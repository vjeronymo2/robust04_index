			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Stepan Yanchuk, Republic of Belarus minister </F> of finances, by Yekaterina Vysotskaya; place and date not given:  "What Is Left `Out of the Picture' of Unification"]    [Text] Details that were not put down on paper, but which  stem from the agreement signed in Moscow on the unification of  the monetary systems were the subject of this interview with  Stepan Yanchuk, Republic of Belarus [Belorussia] minister of  finances.    The minister noted a number of elements which have not yet  been mentioned aloud. He announced that despite the declared  procedure for the exchange of Belorussian money for Russian, the  reassessment of enterprises' fixed capital will not proceed  evenly.    [Yanchuk] Fixed capital, and that means primarily equipment,  was bought five years ago at some enterprises and 50 years ago  at others, Stepan Yanchuk said. So a corrective coefficient  will be applied.    One more detail is that the Republic must seek on its own  sources for eliminating the discrepancy between the cost of the  Russian ruble and the Belorussian ruble when exchanging money in  savings banks. Therefore, the government will have to make a  big effort not to ruin the banks. And not only the savings bank  but also the commercial banks. In addition when money is  exchanged by individuals in sums in excess of 200,000 it is not  simply the general exchange rate which will be used, calculated  on the basis of differences in the cost of consumer goods  baskets, but a rectified exchange rate. This is connected with  the fact that a speculative dollar exchange rate is in operation  in Russia and Belarus today. So when establishing the exchange  rate for Belorussian "hares" against Russian rubles an  adjustment for the speculative element will be made.    Stepan Yanchuk specified the needs for which, according to  the treaty, Russia will give Belarus 200 billion rubles:    Today, we have a negative balance of payments with Russia.  The debts for gas and oil total over 600 billion Russian  rubles. So far, the Russian Federation is supplying us with gas  and in part with oil on credit. And to ensure that the Republic  can settle its debts we have been earmarked this money for the  first half of the year. We will reach a new agreement on credit  for the second half of the year.    [Vysotskaya] Stepan Petrovich, it is known that the keenest  disputes when signing the documents were generated by the fifth  point of the treaty, which states that emission is effected  exclusively by the Central Bank of Russia. Should we be afraid  that the functions of the Republic's National Bank will be  assumed by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation?    [Yanchuk] Even if the fifth point remains in the form which  it has now, but the policy of the Russian Government and the  Central Bank of Russia with regard to Belarus does not change,  then there is no great fear.    We would simply like to protect ourselves against the  unexpected so we are making attempts to somewhat amend the way  it is formulated.    [Vysotskaya] The opponents of unification assert that  Belarus, like Russia, will suffer from a constant shortage of  cash and delays in payments. How real are these fears?    [Yanchuk] I must say that in Russia there are no longer any  cash problems. That wages are not always paid is another  matter, since the enterprises lack funds. Under the treaty the  Russian side undertook to supply Belarus with cash. As for the  question of whether Belorussian enterprises will have the money  to pay wages, just as today not everyone has money so in the  future some people may not have it. The main thing is to give a  push to production, after all it is production that creates  money.    Incidentally, over the first quarter of this year production  decline in Belarus was 36 percent. Because of this the budget  shortfall was 1.5 trillion rubles. Enterprises are standing  idle. The reason is the price factor, because of which our  output is not competitive even on the Russian market, not to  mention the world market. A unification which equalizes prices  will make it possible to boost our production and economy.</p>

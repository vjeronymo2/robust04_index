			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Japan car companies seek to make it abroad  -High yen and trade rows spur overseas production Japanese vehicle manufacturing facilities in North America are regarded in some US quarters as Trojan horses bent on promoting Japan's industrial predominance at the expense of their US counterparts. For their part, Japanese car makers, restrained by their natural caution and concern for their treasured relationships at home, have at times seemed hesitant about moving overseas. But the announcement this week that Toyota will raise North American vehicle output by 50 per cent in the next two years and double its engine production there, which followed Honda's earlier revelation that it would spend Dollars 310m more on its North American operations, provides strong evidence that the Japanese car industry wants further to expand its production abroad. 'There is no doubt that globalisation has to go on in order to keep these guys in business and there is no doubt that plants (in Japan) will have to be closed down,' although not immediately, says Mr Andrew Blair-Smith, industry analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities in Tokyo. The US, for political and economic reasons, is an obvious target for increased Japanese manufacturing. Not only is it a huge market that provided demand for nearly 1.4m Japanese vehicles last year, the growing need to meet specific regional market demands, the yen's strong rise against the dollar, mounting trade friction and protectionist tendencies in the US all provide strong arguments for increasing local manufacturing in North America. The yen's appreciation has forced Japanese car makers to raise the prices of exports to the US, making them more expensive than US-made cars. While Japanese companies have tried to alleviate the impact of the yen's rise through aggressive leasing programmes, their share of the US market has come under pressure while profitability has suffered. In announcing its annual results in the year to the end of June, Toyota revealed that the yen's rise against the dollar had the effect of wiping off Y160bn (Dollars 1.61bn) from operating profits. Meanwhile, as bilateral negotiations aimed at opening Japan's market further to foreign cars and parts remain stalled, protectionist tendencies could gather momentum, particularly when the strength of demand in the US begins to taper off. On the immediate horizon is a law to be introduced in October requiring labelling on the vehicle of the origin of parts. US negotiators have been pressing the Japanese authorities to see to it that the Japanese industry increases a voluntary plan to purchase more foreign car parts, and presents a programme for increasing the number of manufacturer-affiliated dealers willing to sell US cars in Japan. The US has been dangling the threat of trade sanctions if no progress is made either in vehicle or other priority trade issues by the end of this month. 'The Japanese acceleration of US production is an attempt to get the foot firmly in the door before the market tops out,' says Mr Blair-Smith. At the same time, local production in the US will increase as Japanese car makers increasingly concentrate the manufacturing of specific cars in one global manufacturing base. Honda, for example, only manufactures the Accord Wagon in the US, the market for which it was intended, and imports the car back into Japan. Overall, Japanese reverse imports from the US have increased from about 5,400 units in 1988 to 35,000 last year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. The US is by no means the only region slated for greater Japanese local production. Toyota, for example, is setting up production of passenger cars in Turkey while Honda is expanding production in the UK. 'Japanese globalisation is going to accelerate much more rapidly in Europe and Asia than in the US,' Mr Blair-Smith says. 'In the US they are trying to replace exports with local production but in Europe they are trying to increase market share.' The greatest impact of all this expansion will be felt in Japan. Toyota stresses it will not reduce employment in Japan even though exports from Japan will fall 28 per cent as a result of increased North American production. However, vehicle exports from Japan have already fallen by more than a quarter from a peak of 6.7m units in 1985 to just more than 5m units last year. Domestic production, meanwhile, has fallen 17 per cent from a peak of 13.5m in 1990 to 11.2m last year. The challenge for Japanese car makers, says Mr Yutaka Kume, chairman of Nissan, the country's second largest vehicle maker, 'is how to re-position Japan as a production centre in the world'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to journalists' estimates, following the  call by the Czech-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions Association,  approximately 40,000 people gathered in the Old Town Square in  Prague at midday today to tell the government and deputies that  the situation of employees and pensioners is nearing the limits  of tolerance. Chamber Chairman Vladimir Petrus addressed the  rally.    [Begin Petrus recording] What should also be asked is: What  is the reason for this state of affairs? The laws are  imperfect, the linkage between the laws is poor, there is a  perceptible lack of jurisdiction governing administrative and  labor affairs. Other necessary laws that could prevent these  phenomena and developments from taking place are clearly absent,  too.    These are the problems that you, the government and the  parliament, should focus on; this is the area where your efforts  should be targeted. But do not look for enemies and extremists  in the trade unions. [applause]    All of the extremes, foreign and domestic ones  alike--Zhirinovskiy and his supporters, no matter where they may  be--are alien to us. For this very reason, we consider it our  civic duty to speak up and say that we have had enough, that  things cannot go on like this, that people's dissatisfaction is  looming over us, and that it is inadvisable to play around with  this dissatisfaction. [applause] [end recording]</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Strong copper contract leads base metals higher - Market Report London Metal Exchange contracts yesterday reacted positively to a strong copper market and pushed higher throughout the day. COPPER's three months delivery position got to within Dollars 3 of the Dollars 3,000-a-tonne barrier at one stage. Traders said trading conditions were comparatively thin and would probably remain so until the new year. 'It does appear to be very thin on the floor,' said one. 'The markets are looking bullish for next year, so people do not want to be caught short.' The three months price eventually finished the after hours 'kerb' session at Dollars 2,994 a tonne, up Dollars 29 from the pre-Christmas level. The ALUMINIUM market was encouraged by the trend in copper and once resistance above Dollars 1,950 a tonne was cleared prices were able to build on last week's gains. Final business for three months delivery was at Dollars 1,973 a tonne, the session high, up Dollars 35 gain from last Friday. Traders thought a run-up towards Dollars 2,000 was feasible as current thin conditions tended to exaggerate price moves. The NICKEL market also moved sharply higher, again in light conditions, as chart-based speculative buying lifted prices through intermediate resistance levels. At the London bullion market light two-way interest kept the GOLD price within a narrow range of around 50 cents a troy ounce and traders expected the market to continue in the same vein for the rest of the week unless something out of the ordinary emerges. 'I don't think much will happen on the precious metals this week. . . it's just a case of keeping an eye on Comex (the New York Commodity Exchange) because you can never tell whether they will come up with something new,' one dealer said. COFFEE futures at the London Commodity Exchange ended a quiet session just off the day's highs, mainly on buying linked to year-end book-squaring, traders said. 'It's a pretty normal thin volume day. There's a lot of disinterest,' said one trader as the March delivery contract closed Dollars 53 higher at Dollars 2,848 a tonne. Nearby positions in the COCOA market fell back as fears of supply tightness eased following news that a substantial amount of beans had been graded for delivery since Friday. The December contract was Pounds 25 down at Pounds 978 a tonne while March was down Pounds 8 at Pounds 985. Compiled from Reuters</p>

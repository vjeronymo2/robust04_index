Licensee is the holder of License Nos. DPR&hyph;62 and DPR&hyph;71 issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50 on December 27, 1974 and November 12, 1976, respectively. The licenses authorize the operation of the Brunswick Nuclear Plant in accordance with the conditions specified therein. The facility is located on the Licensee's site in Southport, North Carolina. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 24, 1993, Mr. Werts was granted unescorted access to the Brunswick Nuclear Plant, based in part on representations he made on an access authorization application, dated March 11, 1993, which he submitted to Power Plant Maintenance, Inc., (PPM), a contractor of the Licensee. In the application, Mr. Werts falsely represented himself as Michael Allen Hunter and stated that he had not been arrested or convicted of any criminal offense. In addition, Mr. Werts failed to correct that information after he was granted unescorted access and continued to hold that status on the basis of his false identity. The Licensee submitted fingerprint cards completed by Mr. Werts to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and subsequently was informed that Mr. Werts (alias Mr. Hunter) had a record of arrests, convictions, and imprisonments prior to 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above, Mr. Werts engaged in deliberate misconduct in violation of 10 CFR 50.5(a)(2) which prohibits any employee of a licensee or licensee contractor from deliberately submitting to the licensee or licensee's contractor information the employee knows to be incomplete or inaccurate in some respect material to the NRC. Information concerning an individual's true identity and criminal history is material in that it is used by the Licensee to make determinations relative to the grant or denial access authorization. If the Licensee has been given accurate information regarding Mr. Werts' criminal record the Licensee would not have granted unescorted access to Mr. Werts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC must be able to rely on the Licensee, its contractors, and licensee and contractor employees to comply with NRC requirements, including the requirement to provide information that is complete and accurate in all material respects. Mr. Werts' actions have raised serious concerns as to whether he can be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements and to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC or NRC licensees in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that nuclear safety activities can be conducted in compliance with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public would be protected if Mr. Werts were permitted at this time to be involved in the performance of licensed activities or were permitted unescorted access to protected or vital areas of NRC-licensed facilities. Therefore, the public health, safety and interest require that Mr. Werts be prohibited from being involved in the performance of activities licensed by the NRC and be prohibited from obtaining unescorted access for a period of three years from the date of this Order. For a period of five years from the date of this Order, Mr. Werts is required to inform the NRC of his acceptance of employment with any employer whose operations he knows or has reason to believe involve NRC-licensed activities. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the deliberate misconduct described above is such that the public health, safety and interest require that this Order be immediately effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to sections 103, 161b, 161i, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202, 10 CFR 50.5, and 10 CFR 150.20, It is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. For a three-year period from the date of this Order, Mr. Rex Allen Werts is prohibited from engaging in activities licensed by the NRC and is prohibited from obtaining unescorted access to protected and vital areas of facilities licensed by the NRC. For the purposes of this Order, licensed activities include the activities licensed or regulated by: (1) NRC; (2) an Agreement State, limited to the Licensee's conduct of activities within NRC jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 150.20; and (3) an Agreement State where the licensee is involved in the distribution of products that are subject to NRC jurisdiction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

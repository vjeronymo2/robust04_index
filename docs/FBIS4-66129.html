			<p>BFN     [Text] Lisbon, May 23 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec told journalists he tried to "diffuse possible  fears" that (once in the European Union) the Czech Republic  might "deprive the weaker countries of aid from the  restructuring funds" in his meeting today with Portuguese  parliamentary chairman Antonio Moreira Barbosa de Melo.    The Czech Republic intended to enter the EU well prepared  and  use up none of the funds, he said. Indeed, the Czech Republic  wanted to become one of the richest countries in the Union and  itself contribute to the funds, said Zieleniec, who began a  two-day visit to Portugal today.    It emerged from the meeting that Portugal is prepared to  support the Czech Republic in its efforts to join the EU, he  said. Portugal was looking for a way into Europe for the Czech  Republic with the understanding that results from its similar  historical and geopolitical situation: a country of  approximately the same size and number of inhabitants, which has  recently shaken off a totalitarian regime, he said.    Pragmatically speaking, Czech admission to the EU might  assure Portugal of an ally which would defend the joint  interests of smaller nations in the EU, he said.    The agenda of Zieleniec's visit includes discussions  tomorrow  with Portuguese Defense Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barros and  Premier Anibal Cavaco Silva.    An autumn visit to Prague by Portuguese President Maria  Soares and Czech Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy's  planned visit to Lisbon in July should contribute to the closer  relations being fostered between Portugal and the Czech Republic.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature, by correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, E. Terekhov and others]    [Text] Russia pins hopes on negotiations on the nuclear  theme between the United States and North Korea, due to begin in  Geneva, but still wants an international conference on the  issue. "Moscow's proposal to that effect is still on the  agenda", the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has told  Interfax. He was speaking in Moscow on Tuesday after talks with  his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen.    Kozyrev said "Russia and China are unanimous that to ensure  the non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula political  solutions must be found."    "Our Chinese counterparts have taken interest in Russia's  proposal to convene an international conference. They have the  intention to consider the most suitable conditions, when they  take shape, in order to return to that idea once again", Kozyrev  said.    Qian Qichen said that China and Russia's great interest in  resolving the problem stems from their geographic proximity to  the Korean Peninsula. "We wish to see the success of the  forthcoming US-North-Korean talks. As for Russia's proposal to  convene an international conference, China has responded to it  with understanding. We believe, however, that proposal can  materialize only when there are appropriate favorable conditions  for it."    Kozyrev said that Russian-Chinese relations were on the  ascent. "That upward trend will reach a culmination when China's  Premier [as received] Jiang Zemin visits Russia in the autumn.  During that visit at least five or six agreements, including a  major political treaty will be signed", he said.    Kozyrev said he was certain that the Chinese Premier's visit  to Russia would become "a land-mark event in fostering  neighborly and friendly relations and partnership between the  Russia and China."    After the foreign ministers ended the talks their deputies  Aleksandr Panov and Dai Bingguo initialled an agreement on the  Russian-Chinese state border in the West and signed a protocol  of cooperation in the field of information exchanges between the  Russian and Chinese foreign ministries.    Kozyrev's Political Advisor Galina Sidorova told Interfax  that during the talks with Kozyrev Qian Quichen said he was  satisfied with partnership established between Russia and the  Western countries and NATO.    Kozyrev stressed that Russia was developing partnership both  with the West and the East, including China. Such relations  will help to strengthen international security, are not aimed  against the interests of any third countries and reflect the  special situation of Russia as a great European power, Sidorova  said.</p>

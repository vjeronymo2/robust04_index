			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI INFECTION RATE IN CESAREANS DOUBLE LEVEL DEEMED ACCEPTABLE  </P> <P> The infection rate among some laboring mothers at UCI Medical Center is more  than twice an acceptable rate because of patient overcrowding, the hospital's  acting chief of obstetrics said Sunday.  </P> <P> Dr. Thomas J. Garite said 30% to 40% of the obstetrical ward's patients who  have Cesarean sections now end up with an infection. An acceptable infection  rate would be about 15%.  </P> <P> A hospital committee has taken some measures to control the problem, Garite  said. But he and several other obstetricians said the ward was so busy,  treating more than 500 patients a month in a unit designed for 250, that  overworked staff members don't always have time to maintain rigorous hospital  standards for cleanliness.  </P> <P> "We can't always maintain sterile technique," said Dr. Joseph Lucci III, an  obstetrician who is on a fellowship at the medical center.  </P> <P> The complaints came Sunday as a Times reporter and photographer toured the ward  and heard some of its doctors and nurses describe what happens when a  university hospital's obstetrics ward, designed to offer state-of-the-art care,  becomes inundated with more patients than it can handle.  </P> <P> In addition to rising infection rates, frustrated doctors and nurses complained  that fetal monitors, which signal if a baby is in distress, are not always  available and that patients often go through labor in hallways, where no oxygen  units are on hand. Staff members are so overloaded with patients, they said,  that they are not able to closely watch each woman.  </P> <P> Also three rooms that function as labor-delivery rooms do not comply with state  licensing standards for that use, Garite said. "But if they tell us we can't do  this anymore, then we have to deliver in the hall. It becomes ludicrous after a  while," he said.  </P> <P> Conditions have become so bad recently, one young doctor said, that she would  not want to refer private patients there nor would she want to deliver there  herself.  </P> <P> "The way it is, absolutely not," said obstetrician Jean Marie Costello, a  second-year resident at the medical center. "We haven't had a baby die in labor  because somebody couldn't get to them, but I just don't think a woman should  labor in the hall without a (fetal) monitor, period."  </P> <P> Saying overcrowding has made conditions on the ward "unsafe," Garite and Mary  A. Piccione, the hospital's executive director, warned other county hospitals  on Friday that the medical center would begin turning away women in "active  labor" when both its emergency room and obstetrics unit are full. Active labor  occurs when a woman has regular contractions and dilation of the cervix. The  only exception to the new policy would be women who have received prenatal care  at UCI Medical Center, who would receive priority admission, according to the  new policy.  </P> <P> Starting Friday night, when the medical center first notified area hospitals it  had reached "obstetrical diversion" status, medical center security guards were  to hand out maps and a list of area hospitals to women in labor. But Garite  said he believed that only women who had received prenatal care showed up  Friday, so all were admitted.  </P> <P> Ironically, medical center officials have criticized other hospitals and  clinics for giving indigent patients maps to their hospital instead of caring  for these patients themselves.  </P> <P> Poor patients around Orange County regularly come to UCI, in part because the  493-bed hospital in Orange is a former county hospital and has a reputation for  treating the poor.  </P> <P> But part of the problem, medical center officials have said, is that other  local hospitals have recently canceled Medi-Cal contracts, and their patients  now come to the medical center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bankruptcy Threat  </P> <P> UCI Medical Center officials say they are treating 65% of the county's indigent  patients -- many of these on the obstetrics unit. These patients are not only  causing overcrowding at the teaching hospital but may force it into bankruptcy,  hospital officials have said.  </P> <P> However, at least one administrator at another Orange County hospital was not  entirely sympathetic to the medical center's decision to turn away women in  labor.  </P> <P> Michael Stephens, administrator of Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach said he was  unsure whether the medical center had done all it could to ease the  overcrowding situation before taking this "drastic action" of turning away  women in labor. He said he was uncertain whether the action was legal.  </P> <P> Stephens also criticized state officials and Gov. George Deukmejian for failing  to take action on improving Medi-Cal reimbursements to hospitals. He also  blamed county supervisors for a lack of leadership in providing health care for  the poor.  </P> <P> "Something more logical has to be done than just greeting patients at the door  with (a map) telling them to go elsewhere. As health-care providers, we  certainly have an obligation to patients," Stephens said.  </P> <P> But rather than unilaterally turning women in labor away, Stephens said he  believed that the medical center should petition the Hospital Council of  Southern California to bring other hospitals together. "I understand UCIMC's  problems," he said, "but as providers, we certainly have an obligation of care  to the patients instead of telling them to go elsewhere."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Sunday began as an atypically quiet day on UCI Medical Center's  obstetrics ward.  </P> <P> As fetal monitors beeped in the background, Garite donned a yellow medical gown  and showed visitors his unit's three delivery rooms and 14 other beds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Six Women in Labor  </P> <P> At midday, only six women were in labor when lately there have been as many as  25 at once.  </P> <P> But if most of the sparsely decorated rooms were empty now, Garite said he  doubted that they would stay that way. "All you have to do is wait and it picks  up," the 45-year-old obstetrician said with a laugh.  </P> <P> At one point, he flipped through a thick patient registry that showed each  day's census.  </P> <P> In the first four days of June, 79 women delivered babies, Garite said, "so  we're cooking at about a 600 (patient-a-month) pace if we keep this up."  </P> <P> Conditions have become so difficult that Garite, an expert on fetal monitoring  who would like to be named the permanent chairman of obstetrics and gynecology,  has also been "exploring other alternatives" -- although, he added quickly, he  would like to stay on at the medical center.  </P> <P> Garite was sympathetic toward his overworked staff and to patients who were  sometimes "stuffed" together in a room.  </P> <P> Garite's doctors and nurses agreed with him that the situation had become  unusually difficult -- stressful for the staff, sometimes "unsafe" for  patients.  </P> <P> Said Dr. Lucci: "There are days when I put my name on a chart and I feel bad.  I'm not implying any malpractice, but for a patient who had to wait several  hours (to be taken care of), I do occasionally feel almost angry or upset."  </P> <P> Added nurse Carol Patillo: "You give the best care. I think I give quality care  to my patients. I'm the one who's stressed out about it. I have to work harder,  run further" between laboring women.  </P> <P> Like some of the other nurses and doctors, Patillo was also concerned about the  women in active labor who will now be turned away when the medical center's  unit is full.  </P> <P> "It's too bad we had to resort to that," Patillo said. "If she comes here, she  could deliver in the parking lot. Who knows if she is going to find her way to  the next hospital?"  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIT-RUN KILLS ILLEGAL ALIEN NEAR BORDER  </P> <P> An unidentified man was killed Tuesday night in a hit-and-run accident as he  attempted to run across Interstate 5 near the U.S.-Mexican border, marking what  CHP officials say is the eighth illegal alien killed this year trying to cross  a San Diego freeway.  </P> <P> A coroner's spokesman said the man, believed to be in his 20s, suffered  multiple injuries and was found dead about 8 p.m. after being struck in the far  left lane of southbound Interstate 5 about a quarter of a mile south of Dairy  Mart Road. He said there were skid marks leading up to the body.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wearing Black Clothes  </P> <P> California Highway Patrol investigators said Wednesday there were no witnesses.  The man was wearing black jeans, a black leather jacket and white, high-top  tennis shoes.  </P> <P> Since Jan. 1, 1985, 72 undocumented aliens have been killed while trying to  cross Interstate 805, Interstate 5 and nearby roadways. About 39% of those  cases involved a hit-and-run driver, according to CHP statistics.  </P> <P> Virtually all of the fatalities -- 98% were of Mexican nationals, the rest  Central Americans -- have occurred within 5 miles of the border, and 60% of  them occurred in northbound lanes.  </P> <P> About 62% of those illegal aliens killed while crossing San Diego freeways  since 1985 have been 21 to 30 years old, according to CHP statistics. Most of  the rest have been from 31 to 40.  </P> <P> The carnage on the freeways has attracted growing public attention and has  prompted authorities to take action.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Move Begun to Cut Danger  </P> <P> In the first step of what state officials say is a multipronged effort to  reduce the growing traffic hazard to illegal-alien pedestrians, a flashing sign  -- warning "Watch for People Crossing Road" -- was posted earlier this year  along the grid of freeways just north of the border.  </P> <P> State transportation officials have also begun trimming back bushes along the  freeways where illegal aliens hide while waiting for a chance to cross. State  officials are also providing U. S. Customs agents at the border crossing with  handouts that warn northbound motorists to "watch out for pedestrians who may  be illegally crossing the freeways for the next 5 miles."  </P></p>

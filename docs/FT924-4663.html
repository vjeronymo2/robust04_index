			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: GE Capital buys US trailer leasing unit GE CAPITAL, the financial services subsidiary of General Electric Company of the US, is acquiring the over-the-road trailer leasing business of Transamerica, a west coast-based financial services conglomerate. The deal involves the purchase of around 19,000 Transamerica Leasing units, valued at about Dollars 200m, by Transport International Pool, part of GE Capital. GE Capital said yesterday that this would take TIP's fleet size to around 62,000 units. It would also 'increase GE Capital's investment in the highly diversified and profitable asset management segment of its portfolio.' Transamerica said the transaction would allow it to focus on 'established' product lines, and on certain new businesses which it is trying to build up, including over-the-road trailer leasing in Europe. Its Transamerica Leasing subsidiary is based in White Plains, New York State, and leases transportation equipment ranging from containers and chassis to rail trailers. Fluor, the US engineering and construction services group, has approved a plan to divest its lead business, Doe Run Co. It will in future account for the lead segment as a discontinued operation, Reuter reports. This will result in a charge to 1992 net earnings of about Dollars 95m, including Doe's operating loss of about Dollars 17m after tax.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 3 (CNA) -- Taiwan and Japan took a  step closer to understanding each other's trade needs during  informal tariff reduction talks under the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) framework last week, Huang Yen-chao,  director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade, said Monday [2  May].    Huang said that Taiwan expressed its concern about its huge  trade deficit with Japan during the talks, and also discussed  opening its market to Japanese agricultural products, alcohol  and tobacco.    Japan, although supportive of Taiwan's bid to enter GATT,  expressed the hope that Taiwan would move faster in opening its  markets, Huang added.    (Huang said that Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan rose  above  US$15 billion in the past 15 months. He said he asked the  Japanese side to lower import barriers to facilitate foreign  exports.    Japanese negotiators responded that Japan would begin  substantive measures in June to increase imports in line with  economic reforms.    Taiwan also proposed that the two sides hold regular trade  consultations, similar to those held between Taiwan and the  European Union and the United States. Japan replied that it  would consider the proposal.    Huang said that Japan asked Taiwan to end discriminatory  treatment on imports of Japanese agricultural products,  automobiles, alcohol and tobacco.    On agricultural products, Taiwan asked for a six-year grace  period before allowing the import of Japanese fruits, but Japan  rejected the proposal and further negotiations are necessary,  Huang said.    On imports of Japanese automobiles, Taiwan said that it  would  allow the imports of Japanese cars with engine sizes of 3000  cubic centimeters and above by the end of this year, Huang added.    Huang also said that Japan would submit a list of proposed  tariff cuts for Taiwan during a mid-May meeting of the GATT  fifth working party reviewing Taiwan's membership bid.    Taiwan applied for GATT membership in January 1990 and was  given observer status in September 1992. It hopes to become a  full member by the end of the year.</p>

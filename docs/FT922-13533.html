			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie posts biggest gain of the year LONDON'S equity market, shrugging off the debilitating effects of the recent slides by Wall Street and Tokyo, was gripped by election fever as the market spiralled upwards towards the close amid frantic trading and a growing feeling that the Tories might have staged a last gasp advance to pip Labour at the post. The FT-SE 100-share Index went into overdrive, gathering momentum as the day wore on to close 43.2 higher at 2,436.4, its biggest single-session rise this year. Adding to the market's general mood of enthusiasm was another bout of strength in the currency and money markets. Sterling continued to rise against the dollar and the D-Mark, especially the latter, while the three-month interbank rate indicated that the market sees no short term increase in bank base rates. Gilt-edged stocks mirrored the general mood, posting gains of around half a point. Dealers pushed equity prices ahead as soon as the market opened after confirmation in the most recent opinion polls that the Conservative party had begun to peg back the long-held Labour lead. They were also reassured by a late rally on Wall Street on Wednesday evening. Another bad showing by the Tokyo market, down to its lowest level for 5 1/2 years, had been expected, dealers said, but remained a worrying factor. What took the market by surprise was the weight and volume of demand for UK equities at the eleventh hour of the election campaign. The Footsie future galloped ahead, triggering short-covering around the derivatives market and causing a flurry of buying of the underlying Footsie stocks. There was strong evidence that overseas funds had moved back into the London market, with Glaxo, ICI, BAT Industries and all the recently troubled utilities attracting exceptionally heavy support from the Continent, the US and domestic institutions. 'We have had our busiest day for a week or so,' said a trader at one of the leading US investment banks, although he professed scepticism over the market's expectations of an overall Tory majority in the next parliament. Another trader said the market had definitely responded to a late swing of support for the ruling party, and marketmakers, alarmed at the prospect of waking up with short trading positions in the face of a Tory victory, had rushed in to cover all their short positions. 'There is no doubt the City expects a much better showing by the Conservatives, and there has definitely been keen support for the leaders since the encouraging economic data earlier this week,' he added. Seaq turnover in equities was well above expectations at 506.2m shares. Strategists are forecasting a tumultuous trading session this morning, when it is expected that the biggest single-session volume so far this year, just over 700m shares, will be left far behind. Water, electricity and power generation stocks, all of which have been roughly treated in the run-up to the general election, were strongly supported, as was BT, in both fully-paid and partly-paid form. Reuters was hit by another burst of selling pressure.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / CBI calls for boost in school spending The Scottish Office was urged yesterday to consider giving primary and secondary education a bigger share of funding compared with that devoted to university and other tertiary education, James Buxton writes. The recommendation is one of 51 in a CBI report in Scotland, which has the broad aim of reversing the decline of Scotland's manufacturing industry. The report, prepared by the manufacturing group of the CBI in Scotland, points out that the UK spends 144 per cent more per head on tertiary education than the OECD average, but only 88 per cent of the average on secondary education and 78 per cent on primary education. The report welcomes the recent growth of university education, but points out that Scotland has a low place in the OECD ranking of overall skill attainment needed to support a thriving manufacturing sector.</p>

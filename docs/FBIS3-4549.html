The officials said Hosokawa told a high-level meeting of the  government and ruling coalition parties it is too late for Japan  to work out such measures by the end of March.    Hosokawa told the session U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo March 9 while  Washington will decide on March 17 whether to impose sanctions  against Japan over a mobile telephone issue, the officials said.    Hosokawa predicted that U.S. President Bill Clinton will  almost certainly reinstate Super 301, which allows Washington to  impose sanctions against countries with unfair trade practices,  ahead of off-year elections in November, they said.    Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said  Japan will bring the case to the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade if the United States invokes Super 301.</p>

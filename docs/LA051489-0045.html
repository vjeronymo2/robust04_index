			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT RULING ON PROPOSITION 103  </P> <P> The Times' editorial "Half-Won Insurance Victory" (May 7) states that  Proposition 103 does not deal with the insurance problem but only with the  symptoms; I disagree. There is abundant evidence that the insurance industry,  which Proposition 103 will restructure, is the problem.  </P> <P> Once it is fully implemented, with the insurance industry under the control of  an elected insurance commissioner who has rate-setting authority and complete  information on the financial status of each company, Proposition 103 may  provide the affordable liability and casualty insurance that we need.  </P> <P> Without first finding out whether Proposition 103 has fixed the insurance  problem, there is no justification for urging the Legislature to adopt no-fault  insurance which the voters soundly rejected last November.  </P> <P> NORMAN HARRITON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

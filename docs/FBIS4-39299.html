			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Spirin] </F>   [Text] Beijing June 7 TASS -- Russia's main trade partner  in China -- the province of Heilongjiang -- is reconsidering its  foreign economic priorities and planning to switch over from  Russia to the rapidly developing countries of Southeast Asia.    According to Heilongjiang Vice-Governor Wang Zhongzhang,  quoted by the "HONGKONG CHINA NEWS AGENCY", the province is  bound to revise its foreign economic strategy shortly with due  account of "the new situation in the region".    The heavy industry of this northeastern province, which  borders on the Russian Far East and the Russian maritime  territory, was built up with Soviet assistance in the fifties.  It now accounts for an important share of the country's heavy  industry. This is why the province was traditionally linked by  close economic ties with its northern neighbour. However, trade  between Heilongjiang and Russia had dropped drastically in the  first quarter of this year -- by almost 45 per cent. This is  partially due to Moscow's decision to impose visa restrictions  on the entry of Chinese into the Russian Federation and also due  to the growth of customs duties.    Since Russia is short of convertible money, needed to trade  with China, Wang Zhongzhang said, Beijing has already taken  measures to limit the import of Russian raw materials and  semifinished goods, for instance, steel rolled stock.    As to Heilongjiang firms, which are in great straits due to  the state sector's growing debt, they were recommended to seek  "new external sources of financial revenues", primarily in  Southeast Asian countries, where local Chinese businessmen have  much weight.    The volume of Russo-Chinese trade amounted to approximately  6.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1993 and Heilongjiang Province  accounted for its lion's share.    It is not without reason that Moscow had always praised this  Chinese province. Three of its high-ranking officials were  decorated in 1992 with Russian "people's friendship" orders for  their "large contribution to the development of Russo-Chinese  friendship".</p>

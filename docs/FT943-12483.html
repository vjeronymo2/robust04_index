			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Bass It is only a straw in the wind at the moment but the pace of discounting in the UK beer trade seems to be abating. While the big brewers continue to fight fiercely over the large national accounts, they have become less keen to offer wholesale discounts to their smaller customers. Such a development is only logical. It was clear from Bass's interim profits in May that discounting had failed to produce the required reward in terms of volume. Courage needs a more substantial strategy to cope with the looming expiry of supply contracts with Chef &amp; Brewer and Inntrepreneur. Coupled with the warm weather, which should do wonders for beer sales, that may explain the renewed outperformance of Bass's shares over the past month. The equity market is in for a disappointment, though, if it is factoring in much of an increase in brewing margins. It is not just a question of excess capacity in the UK industry continuing to prevent much actual increase in beer prices. The supermarkets have shown that it is possible to import European lager and sell it - even duty-paid - at competitive prices. Against that background the level of domestic capacity use becomes less and less relevant. Brand development thus remains a more convincing strategy than a price-based attempt to gain market share. In Carling and Tennent's, Bass has best-selling lagers. But Whitbread still appears to have the edge in focusing on brand value.</p>

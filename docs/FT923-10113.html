			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Passengers safe after aircraft catches fire ALL 291 people aboard a TWA jet aircraft made a dramatic escape at Kennedy Airport yesterday within minutes of an aborted takeoff and fire that gutted the rear half of the plane, AP reports from San Francisco. At least 55 people were injured. 'It's amazing no one died on that thing,' said Mr Tom Middlemiss, a Kennedy airport official. The Lockheed L-1011, bound for San Francisco, caught fire as it sped down the runway. The pilot halted the takeoff which caused the plane to veer off the runway and crash through a barrier.</p>

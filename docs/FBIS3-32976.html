In the opinion of former ministers,  jurists, and deputies, President Itamar Franco debased the  dignity of his mandate and the institution of the Presidency of  the Republic by allowing himself to be kissed and embraced by  model Lilian Ramos, who was wearing nothing but a short T-shirt.  Deputy Sigmaringa Seixas (PSDB-DF [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party-Federal District]) was the only person to openly admit  that Itamar's attitude may justify an impeachment process based  on Law 1079/50, the same one that removed Fernando Collor from  the presidency.    Outstanding politicians and jurists who worked hard in 1992  to maintain political stability during the impeachment of  Fernando Collor de Mello, who was president at that time, agree  with Sigmaringa. A former minister linked to the judicial field  angrily commented: "A president cannot debase the institution  and country's image." They explained that the impeachment law  is quite clear in stating that the president of the Republic and  state ministers commit crimes against probity in administration  when "they behave in a manner that is incompatible with the  dignity, distinction, and decency of the post" (Clause 7 of  Article 7 of the law).  <H5>  The Balcony of the Numbers Game Kingpin </H5>   Sigmaringa asserted: "The president of the Republic must  behave in accordance with the post he holds and cannot appear  hugging and kissing a woman who is exhibiting her genitals."  "He (Itamar) does not consider the consequences of his actions.  He goes in his capacity as president and not as an ordinary  citizen to the balcony of the numbers game kingpins and makes  passes at all those near him," commented a senator friend of the  president. A retired member of the Federal Supreme Court, who  fears the consequences of a "thoughtless action" by Itamar,  indignantly commented: "Why is it that he, in addition to the  photographs that were taken, used a vehicle of the Presidency of  the Republic to take that girl home?"    Justice Minister Mauricio Correa, may be judged under the  same article of the impeachment law, and may even be tried for  seduction and sexual harassment. In addition to drunkenness and  having told his bodyguards to carry him to his hotel room, a few  whiskeys earlier Correa tried to grab some journalists,  according to the account of one of them, in the balcony at the  Sambodromo. A deputy who participated in the CPI [Congressional  Investigating Committee] in the PC [Paulo Cesar] Farias case,  but who wants to remain anonymous so as not to contribute to the  unleashing of a crisis, commented that "journalists have the  right and duty to bring charges against individuals who do not  respect this symbolically important ministry."    Those who have reacted negatively to Itamar's behavior have  been very cautious. Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA  [Progressive Renewal Party-Para State]) said: "I would rather  make no comment." He said that any comment "now" may be used  ill-intentionally. Celio Borja, the justice minister under  Collor's administration, said: "I hope the people will bear the  country in mind." Deputy Roberto Magalhaes (PFL-PE [Liberal  Front Party-Pernambuco], coordinator of the Budget CPI, tried to  avoid commenting, but could not resist the temptation: "He  (Itamar) chose a very unorthodox way for a president of the  Republic to celebrate Carnival."</p>

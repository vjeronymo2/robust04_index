			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ry"-signed report: "Bonn Has Little Chance of Becoming </F> Headquarters of World Trade Organization"]    [Excerpt] Geneva -- Only four weeks after the ceremonious  signing of the GATT agreement in Marrakesh, all the old points  of contention are gradually resurfacing. The question of who  should succeed GATT Director General Sutherland also remains  open.    Since the signing of the GATT agreement on 15 April, the  outcome of the Marrakesh talks was officially discussed by the  Council of the UN Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD].  Differences of opinions also surfaced at the first meeting of  the Preparatory Committee [Prepcom] of the planned World Trade  Organization [WTO]. However, the UNCTAD Council adhered more or  less to what the ministers had said in Marrakesh. The final  result was once again lauded as "historic." The WTO-Prepcom  dealt mainly with procedural matters such as the appointment of  chairmen of subcommittees. Further chairmen are due to be  appointed over the next six weeks, so that the formation of the  WTO may begin at all levels afterward.    Thorny issues such as Director General Sutherland's plans to  resign; whether WTO headquarters should be in Geneva or Bonn;  the chances of ratifying the Marrakesh results, especially by  the Americans; and the WTO's spheres of activity; were discussed  in a more intimate circle because of their controversy.    Peter Sutherland, the "savior of the Uruguay round of  talks,"  has confirmed during informal consultations that he does not  intend to be chairman of the WTO. But neither has he given the  required six months' notice to quit the GATT chairmanship.  Therefore one assumes he will stay on until GATT changes into  the WTO which, according to the current schedule, should occur  on 1 January 1995. He says that his decision is dictated by  "personal motives." Not everyone believes this.    Needless to say, there is now a debate on the subject of  Sutherland's successor. The developing countries, which will  now form the GATT majority, want to have the GATT chairmanship,  and the Latin American countries, which were in the lead already  after the demise of Sutherland's predecessor, the Swiss Arthur  Dunkel, also seem to have good chances of getting it.    Regardless of this, Sutherland also has the power to hold  negotiations on the new GATT chairmanship. Participants in  these negotiations would include Andras Szepesi, Hungarian  chairman of the GATT member countries committee, and the  chairmen of the WTO-Prepcom subcommittees. Most GATT officials  and employees in the diplomatic missions of the 125 GATT member  countries take a gloomy view of Bonn becoming WTO headquarters.  They would not like to leave their comfortable surroundings on  Lake Geneva.    But the official reason why Bonn should not be WTO  headquarters is that the WTO would be cut off from its related  organizations in Geneva, with whom it must remain in close touch  when discussing certain matters, such as the GATT-WTO  conversion. For example, UNCTAD has been charged with examining  and explaining the economic effects of the Marrakesh agreement.  In Bonn, such a concentration of tasks would not be possible  because there are no other world trade organizations there.    Last week, the Federal Government made a sudden offer to  GATT  and suggested Bonn for WTO headquarters. A decision will  probably be reached in Geneva in the coming weeks. The Swiss  offer that is currently being discussed between the Swiss  authorities and GATT Director General Sutherland also has to be  considered. [passage omitted]</p>

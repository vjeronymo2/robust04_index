			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Asset deal gives Dutch group 33% of Campari BolsWessanen, the Dutch food and beverages group, is to take a stake of at least 33 per cent in Davide Campari-Milano, the maker of Campari, one of the few remaining independent international drinks brands. The Dutch company agreed yesterday to transfer its Italian brands and production facilities to Campari in return for at least one third of the privately-owned company, a stake worth an estimated L500bn-L600bn (Dollars 312m-Dollars 374). BolsWessanen's Italian brands, which include Crodino, a leading non-alcoholic aperitif, as well as sparkling wines, vermouth and mineral waters, generate annual turnover equivalent to Fl 370m (Dollars 210m). Campari, producer of Bitter Campari, Campari Soda and Campari Cordial, had worldwide sales of Fl 450m in 1993. The alliance between BolsWessanen and Campari is aimed first at the Italian market, but should be a springboard for international co-operation in the near future. 'The distribution networks of the both companies are complementary on a worldwide basis,' they said yesterday. Campari's private owners were initially reluctant to give up shares in the group, which have been held by the Campari family or their inheritors since the company's foundation in 1860. The Italian media has painted the deal as a further assault on Italian brands by foreign companies. Campari yesterday pointed out that well-known Italian brands such as Crodino and Cynar, an artichoke-based liqueur, are coming back under Italian control. The deal is dependent on approval from Italy's anti-trust authorities. If the transaction goes ahead as planned in late 1994 or January 1995, the two will control 20 per cent of the bitters sector of the Italian spirits market.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Nippon Mining slides to Y16bn loss NIPPON Mining, the Japanese petroleum refiner and copper company, reported a consolidated pre-tax loss of Y3.34bn (Dollars 26.29m). It indicated that its acquisition of Gould, a US computer and copper company, had been an unexpected burden. The loss for the year to end-March followed a profit of Y14.9bn in the previous period, while the after-tax loss swelled to Y16.3bn, compared with a profit of Y5.3bn. Group sales fell 12.7 per cent to Y1,052.9bn. Sales have been falling in Japan, but the biggest problem for the company has been the Illinois-based Gould, which it said had a Y24.6bn loss because of costs associated with restructuring. Gould, purchased in 1988, was meant to be the centrepiece of Nippon Mining's expansion of its overseas operations and its diversification into electronics. Those plans, however, have been compromised by the prolonged slump in the computer and semiconductor markets. The company admitted that its electronics-related business has been weak and that demand for Gould's copper products has also been less than expected. It is confident, however, that the liquidation of unprofitable businesses will produce profits this year. While Nippon Mining's sales were likely to have continued to fall, forecasts for the current year are distorted by a merger with Kyodo Oil, scheduled for December 1.</p>

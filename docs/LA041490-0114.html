			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS GIVE THE TWINS A HAND, 7-4  </P> <P> Two nights after Mike Witt played a key role in the kind of game pitchers dream  of, he endured an inning that pitchers dread.  </P> <P> Witt, who shared credit with Mark Langston in a combined no-hitter Wednesday,  struggled in relief of Jim Abbott Friday night. The Angels' defense also  struggled, committing three errors in the seventh inning and four overall to  help the Minnesota Twins rally for a 7-4 victory at Anaheim Stadium before a  crowd of 33,217.  </P> <P> The loss ended the Angels' three-game winning streak.  </P> <P> Abbott, the last pitcher in the Angels' rotation to make his season debut,  pitched into the sixth inning before giving way to Witt. Abbott, who was  charged with giving up only one earned run, had some trouble early, but left  with a 4-2 lead, thanks in good part to Lance Parrish's three-run home run in  the fourth.  </P> <P> That lead disintegrated in the seventh, with Witt pitching. Angel shortstop  Kent Anderson bobbled two grounders and left fielder Chili Davis misplayed a  double by Brian Harper, an unusual occurrence for a team that last season had  the second-best fielding percentage in the American League.  </P> <P> Greg Gagne led off the seventh with a single to right and moved to second when  pinch-hitter John Moses walked. Dan Gladden's easy grounder to short didn't  stay in Anderson's glove, an error that loaded the bases. Gagne and Moses  scored on a single to left by pinch-hitter Jim Dwyer.  </P> <P> Kirby Puckett hit another seemingly easy grounder to Anderson, who was charging  in and bobbled it. Dwyer moved to second and Gladden to third. Gary Gaetti then  flied out to right, deep enough for Gladden to score. Dwyer tried to tag and go  to third, but Dante Bichette made a fine throw to third to get him. Harper then  doubled to left. The ball was misplayed by Davis, which enabled Puckett to  score. Witt hit Gene Larkin with the first pitch, which became Witt's last  pitch. He left to a mixed sendoff of cheers and jeers.  </P> <P> Witt (0-1) had given up four hits and five runs in 1 2/3 innings, but only one  run was earned.  </P> <P> Scott Bailes came on and walked Hrbek and Gagne to force in a run, but the  inning ended when Moses -- the ninth Twin to bat -- hit a shot back to Bailes  for a play at first. Four of the Twins' runs were unearned.  </P> <P> The Angels had taken a 4-2 lead during a three-run fourth inning. Davis led off  with a double, moved to third on Brian Downing's grounder to first and scored  on Bichette's single to right to give the Angels a 2-2 tie. Then Parrish, who  had managed only two hits in his previous 11 at-bats this season, hit Allan  Anderson's 2-2 pitch into the left-field seats for his first home run of the  season.  </P> <P> It stayed that way through the sixth inning, which Abbott started but couldn't  finish. Witt got out of that inning unscathed, getting Gaetti and Harper to  ground into force plays before striking out Kent Hrbek.  </P> <P> Allan Anderson (1-1) allowed eight hits and four runs in six innings but got  the victory when Minnesota rallied.  </P> <P> It was a tough start for Abbott, who labored in the first inning, falling  behind most batters. With one out, Shane Mack, formerly of UCLA, was walked  after working the count full, and he advanced to third when Puckett singled to  right. Abbott walked Gaetti on four straight pitches, prompting a visit to the  mound by pitching coach Marcel Lachemann.  </P> <P> Whatever Lachemann said appeared to make a difference. Abbott retired the next  two batters, although Harper hit a fly deep enough to left to score Mack. Then  Abbott got Larkin to ground to first to end the inning.  </P> <P> The Angels came back to tie the score in their half of the inning. Devon White  led off with a sharp single that rolled past left fielder Dan Gladden, White  going to second on the fielding error. Johnny Ray's sacrifice bunt toward first  enabled White to move to third. Wally Joyner walked and Anderson's first pitch  to Davis bounced in the dirt and away from Harper for a wild pitch, which  allowed White to score.  </P> <P> The Twins manufactured another run in the fourth. Harper led off with a liner  to left that took one hop and bounced into the seats, a ground-rule double.  Larkin hit a grounder back to Abbott, who engaged Harper in a rundown before  finaly tagging him out. Larkin had time to go to second.  </P> <P> Carmen Castillo followed with a grounder to short, on which Larkin initially  held up. As Kent Anderson's throw was heading toward Joyner, Larkin dashed  toward third. Joyner's throw to third ended up several rows back in the stands,  and Larkin was waved home.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> A number of Angels took early batting practice Friday afternoon, still trying  to make up for lost time because of the lockout. "We're still kind of in spring  training as far as hitting goes," hitting instructor Deron Johnson said. "The  thing about spring training is that you don't get to see that many breaking  balls. You've got to see them and adjust. That's what's happened all over  baseball. Hitting is timing. You've been off six months, and here come these  guys with forkballs and sliders. Fastball pitchers get hit in spring and then  you come into the season and see a 2-and-0 curveball and go, 'Holy smokes!' "  </P> <P> Johnson's prize pupil is third baseman Jack Howell, who was five for seven  before Friday night's game. That included two hits in three at-bats against  left-handers, who owned Howell last season. He hit only .140 against  left-handers in 1989 and .179 over his career. "He got off to a good start,  which is amazing because he was out a week," said Johnson, referring to the  sprained left ankle that sidelined Howell until Wednesday. "You can't have  everybody all hitting at the same time -- you'd rather stagger it, keep three  or four going at the same time." Howell, however, was hitless in four at-bats  Friday night.  </P> <P> The saves by Mark Eichhorn Tuesday and Thursday and Mike Witt Wednesday gave  the Angels' relievers saves in three consecutive games for the first time since  the relievers recorded six straight from July 6-15, 1988. . . . The MRI test  done on the left elbow of reliever Bob McClure, showed no tissue damage.  McClure was placed on the 21-day disabled list retroactive to April 6.  </P> <P> The Twins acquired infielder Fred Manrique from the Texas Rangers in exchange  for right-handed pitcher Jeff Satzinger.  </P></p>

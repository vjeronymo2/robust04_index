			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Economy still flat, say owner-managers MORE than two thirds of Britain's owner-managed businesses do not believe the economy will improve over the next 12 months, a survey published yesterday reports. A study of 600 owner-managed companies conducted by Mori for Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, shows a marked deterioration in business confidence during the past six months. It suggests that 67 per cent of companies studied believe the recession is likely to continue or deepen further. Nearly a quarter say they have no confidence in the government's ability to help revive the economy. The study shows that half of all respondents expect no change in employment levels over the next year, although 20 per cent expect to shed more labour. Even so, a clear majority believe their output will rise during 1993. The last Mori study, carried out six months earlier after the general election, said two thirds of companies were confident about the economic outlook. Mr Jock Lennox of Ernst &amp; Young said: '(The findings) reflect a realistic view of the economic climate facing owner-managed businesses. 'Some recent signs of increased activity in the high street have not yet had time to lift the overall mood of the UK's owner-managers.' There are mixed signs about prospects for increasing exports in the aftermath of sterling's devaluation. While companies selling overseas expected to maintain or raise export sales in 1993, businesses without export markets did not intend to seek them over the next year.</p>

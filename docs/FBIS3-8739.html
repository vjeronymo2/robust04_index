			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F> Democratic Left, by correspondent Ivan Samel; place and date not  given--live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Samel] Can we already talk about some partial  results?    [Weiss] Of course, because these negotiations did not begin  just last week. There will be another meeting of opposition  representatives this afternoon, and a decision should be reached  then about the most fundamental personnel questions.    [Samel] Some time ago, a demand was made that party chairmen  should not be included in this government. Can you tell us if  they are going to be in the government?    [Weiss] I am of the opinion that this demand should be  respected. After all, we made it recently. [passage omitted]    [Samel] The present opposition parties are presenting the  new  government as a good alternative at this time. However, there  are voices casting doubts on the efficiency of such government  in view of the fact that there would be too many parties  participating with too diverse an orientation. Judging by the  atmosphere at the talks, can you say that this government would  not be problem and conflict ridden?    [Weiss] This government is going to be interested in  agreeing  on basic policy priorities, on things that need to be solved  first of all within a given time. Of course, it will be a  government that is going to be aware of its responsibility to  the Slovak Republic and its citizens. It will certainly not be  an anti-Slovak government that some people are trying to  suggest. It will simply be an alternative to that type of rule  that we have just lived through. This government will invest in  expertise, will resolutely press ahead with the transformation  of the state economy, and will try to act competently. It will  definitely tell people the truth about the state of the economy,  even if it is bitter.    The citizen does not need to be lied to because he can  become  optimistic only if such optimism is warranted and based on a  true picture of the state of the national economy and its  potential. We do not want a government that just keeps things  going, but one that will create genuine conditions for the  continuation of the transformation process after the early  elections, and for businesslike solutions to a multitude of  problems weighing down on people. Apart from economic and  social problems, this government will make it its priority to  deal with growing criminality.    [Samel] What economic measures can be expected from the new  government?    [Weiss] The government wants to set off on a course of  pursuing a realistic policy of macroeconomic transformation. As  I have already said, the platform will be an analysis of the  state of the economy, especially so that the government is able  to send a clear signal to the public about the conditions under  which it is taking over the economy, and what the reasons for  this situation are.    The government will undoubtedly cooperate with the banking  and capital market to find an immediate solution to corporate  insolvencies, including bankruptcies, reviving the flow of  money, and developing the capital market. Work on amending the  law on the state budget will definitely begin so as to put its  revenue and expenditure on a more realistic basis.    The government will strive to maintain external balance [as  heard]. Through its economic policy, it wants to sustain the  internal convertibility of the currency. Its political  decisions will not interfere with currency stability. Above  all, exchange rates will not be artificially sustained at the  cost of increasing foreign indebtedness. Measures aimed at  protecting the domestic market will be implemented in compliance  with international agreements.    Another important aspect of the government's work will be to  depoliticize privatization in accordance with the adopted  amendment to the law on big privatization. Special emphasis  will be placed on the equality of [privatization] methods, on  the equal standing of those who enter into privatization  process, on transparency, and on exercising parliamentary and  public control over privatization.    The government will try to begin preparation of the second  wave of coupon privatization, so that it might begin in the  second half of 1994.    It is natural that the government that takes over  responsibility will be exposed to a huge number of risks, and  the time it will have at its disposal will not be sufficient.  But transformation must be continued, and, at the same time,  the most pressing difficulties hampering people's lives must be  pragmatically resolved.    Wherever possible, the new government will try to compensate  for the impact of certain economic measures on the population by  introducing positive measures in other spheres--for example, in  the social sphere or in reducing criminality.    [Samel] The law on reducing the [parliamentary] term of the  office is due to be adopted in the near future. But for this  you will need the votes of the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak National Party [SNS]. Have there  been any parallel talks with these deputies' groups?    [Weiss] Yes, talks did take place. All of them want to call  early elections. I hope that we will crack this problem on  Wednesday [16 March, when the Slovak Parliament is due to resume  its session]. It would a very good thing if the government had  a clear mandate for its work.    [Samel] Have you had any indications that some deputies from  the HZDS and the SNS will be willing to vote for the elections  to be held at the end of September or the beginning of October?    [Weiss] There are, of course, some indications, but we  should  wait until this important hurdle is overcome.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Getting into a fix FIXED rate mortgages have grown in popularity compared with variable rates over the last few months, writes John Authers. There is good reason for this. In general, a fixed rate should be preferable when base rates are set to rise; variable rates give a better chance of catching a fall. However, fixed mortgages carry some dangers. First is the arrangement fee - typically around Pounds 200 - which is often non-refundable. Over a long period this should still leave you with a saving, but if the mortgage is only fixed for a year, the benefits may be low. Then there are package deals. Some lenders have a lower arrangement fee, but oblige you to buy their own insurance policy. These are almost always at higher premiums than you could find by shopping around. You should also beware of strings tied to the repayment mechanism. Some only offer a fixed rate if you back it with either an endowment or a personal pension - and neither is generally suitable. Particularly attractive offers available at present, according to Money Facts, include 7.95 per cent fixed for five years from Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, which can be taken on an interest-only basis with no extra insurance; 7.9 per cent fixed until March 31 1998 from Britannia (buildings and contents insurance is required); and 7.7 per cent from Credit Agricole, where buildings and contents insurance is required. Availability of funds poses another argument in favour of fixing. As Weekend FT readers will know, savings rates from building societies are low at present, and many savers have withdrawn funds to invest elsewhere. This makes sense for the saver, but it removes the funds which the building societies use to back mortgages. This could force mortgage rates up, making the current fixed rates look better value.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Moorgate Smaller plans to raise Pounds 30m MOORGATE Smaller Companies Investment Trust is raising a maximum of Pounds 30m through a placing of 30m offer units at 100p apiece. The units will be exchanged for shares at the trust's undiluted net asset value at the close of business on April 22. The trust said that 25m units have been conditionally placed, of which 10m are available to existing shareholders. A further 5m units will be made available only if there is substantial demand from the general public. They would be used to cover applications up to Pounds 6,000 per person where these had not been satisfied out of the 10m units. Sir Michael Richardson, chairman, said he expected UK smaller companies to be early beneficiaries of an upturn in the economy. Moorgate Smaller Companies was launched in May 1991, with shares priced at 100p. The shares closed yesterday at 126p.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / PSBR goes into Pounds 3.54bn deficit Britain's public-sector finances swung heavily into deficit last month, but the shortfall of Pounds 3.54bn appeared to reflect one-off factors rather than a serious deterioration. Yesterday's news from the Treasury and Central Statistical Office of a sharp swing from October's Pounds 551m budget surplus to the large public sector borrowing requirement in November surprised the City, which had been anticipating a deficit of about Pounds 2bn. However, analysts remained confident that the government was on track to meet or undershoot the Budget forecast of Pounds 34.4bn for the PSBR in 1994-95. Britain recorded a cumulative deficit of Pounds 22.7bn for the first eight months of the current financial year compared with Pounds 29.3bn between April and November 1993. Excluding privatisation proceeds, which were a negligible Pounds 2m in November, the PSBR so far this year has totalled Pounds 26.5bn compared with Pounds 32.7bn in the first eight months of 1993-94. November's bigger than expected borrowing requirement exceeded the Pounds 2.91bn recorded in November last year. The deterioration reflected a sharp drop in local authority debt repayments to Pounds 407m from Pounds 1.29bn in November last year when local authorities had high capital receipts from asset sales before the introduction of tougher controls on their spending. The swing from surplus to deficit between October and November also reflected unusually favourable conditions in October when the government had privatisation proceeds of Pounds 1.47bn and corporation tax receipts were especially buoyant. Total cash receipts rose 8 per cent to Pounds 144.5bn in the first eight months of 1994-95, outstripping the 2 per cent growth in cash outlays to Pounds 170.4bn in the period. Among specific taxes, corporation tax revenues were 30 per cent higher at Pounds 11.8bn in the eight months while value added tax receipts rose nearly 12 per cent to Pounds 27.8bn. Total Inland Revenue receipts rose 14 per cent to Pounds 53.9bn. Customs and Excise receipts were 8.5 per cent higher at Pounds 47.4bn, while social security contributions rose 11.5 per cent to Pounds 26.3bn.</p>

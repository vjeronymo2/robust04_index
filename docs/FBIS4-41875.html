			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sergey Ostanin and Andrey </F> Surzhanskiy]    [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- Russia and NATO are ready to  implement the partnership for peace program, Russian Defence  Minister General of the Army Pavel Grachev and NATO Supreme  Allied Commander Europe General George Joulwan confirmed here  today.    In July military experts will start to elaborate a  presentation document on aspects of Russian-NATO cooperation,  Grachev told a news conference at the Defence Ministry on  results of his meeting with Joulwan. Some 1994 arrangements  totalling 30 will be specified, and plans for 1995 military  cooperation will be made more detailed. The Russia-signed  framework document of the partnership for peace program and the  Russia-NATO protocol to the program with the same name open up  diverse prospects for military cooperation, said the defence  minister.    The meeting agreed to open NATO posts in Russia and Russian  posts at the NATO Supreme Allied Command and NATO Command  Headquarters, as well as establish telephone communications  between the Russian armed forces' general staff and the NATO  Supreme Allied Command.    In the opinion of Pavel Grachev, bilateral cooperation will  also involve fleets and districts "up to military units".  Cooperation plans provide for participation of the Russian  Defence Ministry's staffers in NATO exercises as observers and  negotiations of the Russian armed forces' general staff and the  NATO Supreme Allied Command. The main condition of these  relations is the account of Russian interests and adoption of  well-coordinated decisions, said the Russian defence minister.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] The U.S. under secretary of State for Middle Eastern  affairs, Robert Pelletreau, talking to reporters in Abu Dhabi  yesterday, has made certain remarks about Iran and has once  again raised the US officials' accusations, expressing concern  over Iran's role in the region.    Mr. Pelletreau, a politician considered familiar with the  affairs of Iran and that of the Middle East, during yesterday's  press conference, by using such terms as Iran's ambitions for  seeking regional domination and the use of terrorist approaches,  tried to announce to other regional countries, through the mass  media, the U.S. leaders' message of friendship and loyalty in  defending the regional countries against the likely threat of  Iran.    Of course, the U.S. under secretary of State for Middle  Eastern affairs, in line with the task entrusted to him, also  did not leave the point unsaid that his country continues to  call for pressure and economic sanctions against Iran by the  U.S.'s allies in Europe and other pro-Western countries. He  stressed that the U.S. believes that this trend should continue  until such time as Iran alters its policies and turns into a  good neighbor in the Persian Gulf.    What the U.S. under secretary of state has said is neither  new nor a new development in the U.S.'s outlook toward Iran,  since, according to political analysts, it is not the first time  that U.S. leaders are explaining their policies with respect to  the Islamic Republic of Iran; they have done so on various  occasions and under certain specific conditions in the past as  well.    Despite this, Mr. Robert Pelletreau's explicit remarks in  Abu  Dhabi, in an overall assessment should be considered as  indicative of the sensitivity U.S. leaders have always shown  over the determining role of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the  Persian Gulf region; a region that is extremely vital for the  U.S. and its regional interests.    It is beyond doubt that seasoned American politicians are  well aware of the reality that the Islamic Republic of Iran has  achieved substantial progress in its political, economic, and  cultural ties with its neighbors, especially in Central Asia and  in the Persian Gulf region. Obviously these ties have not been  shaped on the basis of Iran's fear in the region, rather, as has  been clearly stated by the leaders of those countries, these  ties are selective and are aimed at realizing joint bilateral  interests with deep understanding of the need for the  enhancement of regional ties for preserving peace and stability  in the region.    Therefore, it is not unusual to see that the U.S. leaders,  by  using such terms as domination, threat for the region, or by  warning the neighbors not to have close ties with Iran, try to  justify the sale of more arms to the regional countries. Mr.  Pelletreau also seems to have a short memory as, during his  remarks in Abu Dhabi, he overlooked the point that, in his  earlier report in March 1994, which was submitted to the Foreign  Relations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives  following the failure of U.S. efforts to isolate Iran on the  international scene, he had described the Iranian Government as  a permanent reality, adding that he was prepared to hold talks  with Iranian officials on disputed issues.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LASIX;  </P> <P> PRO;  </P> <P> SUMMER SQUALL IS A POWERFUL SYMBOL OF THE DRUG'S BENEFITS  </P> <P> Two weeks before the Preakness, the results of a scientific study of Lasix had  been made public and touched off controversy throughout the racing industry.  </P> <P> Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania concluded that the drug doesn't  prevent horses from bleeding but that it does make them run faster. So with  Summer Squall's impressive Lasix-aided victory Saturday at Pimlico, it seems  inevitable that he will be a focal point of the raging debate over this  medication.  </P> <P> And both sides may point to Summer Squall as a vindication of their positions.  </P> <P> Summer Squall has a serious bleeding problem. He gushed blood from his nostrils  after a workout in Florida this winter, and ever since that incident he has  been given Lasix before races and hard workouts. On a few occasions, blood has  trickled from his nostrils after routine morning gallops when he wasn't treated  with the diuretic.  </P> <P> When this happened the day before the Preakness, many witnesses were alarmed,  but trainer Neil Howard assured them:  </P> <P> "The Lasix will hold the bleeding."  </P> <P> And it did. Without the medication, Summer Squall would have been at such risk  in the Preakness that Howard wouldn't have let him run. With Lasix, he was able  to finish powerfully and defeat Unbridled (another Lasix user) by 2 1/4  lengths.  </P> <P> In the view of Howard and owner Cot Campbell, as well as the vast majority of  trainers, owners and veterinarians in America, Summer Squall demonstrates why  it would be senseless to ban the use of Lasix. This extraordinarily talented  horse suffers from one specific physical problem, and there exists a medication  that can remedy that problem.  </P> <P> Why deny the horse this help, deny racing the presence of a top attraction,  deny the owners who put so much money into this game the chance to make a  profit?  </P> <P> Moreover, Summer Squall's record casts plenty of doubts on the University of  Pennsylvania study. That study said Lasix has "questionable efficacy" for the  prevention of bleeding. But even if the medication is not foolproof, virtually  all practicing vets say it is generally effective. What better evidence could  there be than Summer Squall? On Friday, without Lasix, he couldn't even gallop  without bleeding; on Saturday, with Lasix, he could win the second-fastest  Preakness in history with no ill effects.  </P> <P> Campbell reaffirmed after the Preakness that Summer Squall would not run in the  Belmont Stakes, because Lasix is not permitted in New York State. The little  colt needs a rest, he said. He would return to competition this fall, the main  objective to be the Breeders' Cup -- at Belmont Park. And that decision seems  to expose the hollowness of the arguments of the pro-Lasix forces.  </P> <P> Campbell and Howard believe that Summer Squall will be able to run effectively  without medication if he is given a sufficient period of rest this summer.  Indeed, rest has been the traditional prescription for horses who bleed in all  the other countries of the world where medication is not permitted and in the  United States before Lasix was legalized in the early 1970s.  </P> <P> If that is the case, why wasn't Summer Squall given a long period of  recuperation after he bled in Florida? Why aren't run-of-the-mill horses given  rest instead of injections when they bleed? The answer, of course, is simple.  Money. Most owners of thoroughbreds lose money anyway, and it is an expensive  proposition to put a horse on the shelf for months when he will generate a pile  of expenses but no income. How many of the anti-Lasix moralists, had they been  members of the 28-man syndicate that owns Summer Squall, would have pleaded  with Campbell, the syndicate manager: "Forget about the Kentucky Derby. Forget  about the Preakness. Give this horse a rest."  </P> <P> The Lasix dilemma is a difficult one for the thoroughbred industry because  there are such strong arguments on each side of it. It is likely to remain a  divisive issue for a long time, because each side seems immovable in its  convictions.  </P></p>

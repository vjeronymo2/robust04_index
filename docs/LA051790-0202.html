			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE HEALTH CARE FOR POOR URGED;  </P> <P> CLINICS: THE GRAND JURY OFFERS A STINGING INDICTMENT ON THE LACK OF MEDICAL  SERVICES. OFFICIALS SAY THE FUNDS AREN'T THERE.  </P> <P> Saying that Orange County's overburdened community clinics meet "an urgent  need" for a growing number of residents who lack health insurance, the county  grand jury Wednesday called on the Board of Supervisors to expand these  services and "take more responsibility for basic health-care for the poor."  </P> <P> While offering few ideas on how the county should pay for such an expansion,  the grand jury recommended that supervisors assume leadership by "educating the  citizenry to accept basic health care for the poor as a social obligation."  </P> <P> Top county officials called the fact-finding body's latest report  well-intentioned but said they had no idea where they could find the money to  expand services at county and community-operated clinics.  </P> <P> "Where's the source of funding?" asked Don R. Roth, chairman of the Board of  Supervisors. "Yes, we ought to expand the availability of services to the poor,  but we're limited by the amount of dollars available."  </P> <P> Grand juror Frank Spittle said he and his colleagues did not deal in detail  with the question of funding in their report because it is the supervisors' job  "to set those priorities."  </P> <P> Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez noted that in March the board recommended giving  community clinics $1.5 million from California's new tobacco tax. But beyond  that, he said, "the money is just not provided by the state" and key state  legislators now appear willing to accept the deep cuts in health care  recommended by Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> Deukmejian proposed 1990-91 budget slashes of $19.1 million from county  health-care programs, and overall, the county projects a deficit of more than  $20 million next year. In this environment, Roth, Vasquez and Supervisor  Harriett M. Weider said, expanded health services were unlikely soon.  </P> <P> But Margie Fites-Seigel, vice president of the Coalition of Community Clinics  which represents the 12 community-run clinics, applauded the grand jury  findings, especially one that asked supervisors to give community clinics "a  stable source of funding."  </P> <P> She added that it was time for Orange County to "come to terms with what is  basic health care . . . and then ensure access to basic health care for all  citizens."  </P> <P> Noting that more than 2,500 pregnant women were turned away from county-run  prenatal clinics last year because those facilities were full, Fites-Seigel  said, "Orange County should be ashamed of itself. From the community clinic  standpoint, we should not have gotten to that point."  </P> <P> The grand jury was the latest group this year to ask county government to  assume a broader role in the health care of the poor. Earlier, the Orange  County Medical Assn. and the United Way Health Care Task Force asked  supervisors to offer a wide range of general medical services at county-run  clinics and also ease crowding at Medi-Cal hospitals by operating their own  birthing center. But supervisors have repeatedly said they have no funds for  such ventures.  </P> <P> According to the grand jury report, more than 120,000 people with Medi-Cal  coverage or no insurance at all use the county's community clinics each year as  their primary source of care. There, the report said, they receive "accessible,  comprehensive, quality, cost-effective treatment," for very low fees, sometimes  only $20 -- or a donation by the patient.  </P> <P> The 12 clinics form a diverse group, most struggling to survive on a mix of  private and public funds. Two of them are operated by UC Irvine. Others include  four family-planning clinics operated by Planned Parenthood and general medical  clinics such as the Share Our Selves Clinic in Costa Mesa, La Amistad de Jose  in Garden Grove and the South County Community Clinic in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> In addition to offering "well-child" visits, these clinics now offer "primary  care" also known as general medical care, the report said, treating such  problems as respiratory infections, abdominal pain and chronic headaches.  </P> <P> Besides the community clinics, the county Health Care Agency operates clinics  for state-mandated services that include prenatal care, immunizations, child  health screenings and treatment for sexually transmitted disease.  </P> <P> But the report said: "The four permanent county public health clinics are busy  beyond capacity, causing some clients to stand in lines in hallways waiting for  services sometimes for hours."  </P> <P> Among the Grand Jury's recommendations were suggestions that supervisors  provide a larger and more stable share" of financial support to community  clinics, expand locations of county clinics, especially in South County and  link public and private resources to help the poor get care. (The county did  that this year, the report noted, when supervisors allocated $1.3 million from  tobacco tax funds to start a birthing center at Western Medical  Center-Anaheim.)  </P> <P> In addition, the grand jury asked county officials to expand county clinic  services to provide a primary care, which is a wide range of outpatient medical  services beyond those mandated by state law.  </P> <P> County Health Care Agency director Tom Uram called many of the recommendations  "interesting ideas" that would be reviewed. But he said he would recommend  against expanding county clinics to offer primary care. "We're a broker of  services. We're not a provider. We contract for primary care," Uram said.  </P></p>

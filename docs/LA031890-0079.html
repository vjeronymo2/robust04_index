			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MODEL OF DISTRESS OVER DESIGNER'S STYLE  </P> <P> Re: "James Tarantino Makes Dressing Simply Elegant" (March 11). Elegant?  "Clean, simple and pure?" Well, they are as simple as a flour sack with a hole  slipped over the head.  </P> <P> And people will pay hundreds of dollars for a back and front that I would whip  together in an hour? Sack-cloth with buttons?  </P> <P> I used to model, and I would not be caught dead in one of these. Methinks the  Emperor had no clothes. I have been all over the world, and many countries have  clothes that are more graceful, more colorful and (made of) more interesting  material than we do. But few more expensive.  </P> <P> CARYL C.

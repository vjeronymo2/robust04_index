			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva report: "Ministers Have To Learn Genre </F> of Explanatory Notes"]    [Text] Last Thursday millions of TV viewers had the  pleasure of seeing some colorful scenes from the life of the  Russian Government. There were brief pieces on the evening news  about the Council of Ministers Presidium session, but how much  interesting information they contained!    Now we know that our ministers and vice premiers, when they  meet on Thursdays, are "not playing with toys but running the  country!" (V. Chernomyrdin). And that attendance is a very  strict matter for them. If people fail to show up, the ruling  is brief -- "take explanatory notes from all of them, including  the deputy premiers." In short, it is stern!    Out of curiosity we attempted to know just which of the vice  premiers would be reprimanded? It turned out that it was none  other than Aleksandr Shokhin who could expect a scolding.  IZVESTIYA was told in the other deputies' reception offices that  their bosses had attended the Presidium session.    People may even have been angry with Shokhin. The fact is  that the government has been unable for the second week running  to conclude the hearings on the fulfillment of its own 9 March  1994 decree "On the Russian Economy's Position and the Prospects  for its Development in 1994," where one of the main reporters  was the Ministry of Economics representative.    This question was on last Thursday's agenda and, we were  told  by the government's press service, "its examination was not  completed." Shokhin was on vacation at the time, and the report  was delivered by his first deputy -- Yakov Urinson. But at the  last, scandalous, Presidium session the matter was removed from  the agenda altogether. Owing to the absence of many government  members, the television explained.    Incidentally, the minister of economics and one of his  deputies may succeed in finding good reasons to explain away  their absence. As of last Thursday he has been taking part in a  session of the Interim Committee of the IMF and the World Bank  in Washington as part of a large government delegation.    Admittedly, this alibi might be undermined by the fact that  the session officially ended on Wednesday the 27th. And it has  to be said that some delegation members were already back in  Moscow Thursday morning. But not all. Viktor Vladimirovich  Gerashchenko also failed to make it to the Presidium session.  But we must assume that the head of the Central Bank and the  vice premier will not simply be taking it easy in the  Americas....    The premier is also said to be unhappy with the State  Committee for the Management of State Property. Chubays,  admittedly, did not blot his attendance copybook. But his  deputies allegedly slipped up and failed to supply certain  papers in time.    ...The most interesting aspect of this story is -- who will  collect the reports? But how could there be any doubt -- it  will, of course, be Vladimir Petrovich Kvasov, leader of the  government apparatus. To be honest, I would give a month's  salary to be a fly on the wall when the ministers present their  explanations.    And so what if they are ministers? God himself has ordered  them to obey Kvasov; after all, the leader of the apparatus has  also been elevated to ministerial rank by the current premier.  And what about the vice premier? What about Viktor  Vladimirovich Gerashchenko?...    Of course, as they say, it will not be easy for Viktor  Chernomyrdin to handle the collective of ministers and vice  premiers entrusted to him....</p>

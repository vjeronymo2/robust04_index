			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Canadian unit buys MMB stake NORTHERN TELECOM, the Canadian telecommunications group, is to take a 7.5 per cent stake in MMB, the French holding company which controls Matra, the telecommunications and transport group, and Hachette, the advertising and publishing company. The move, to come into force at the end of this year, is a consequence of an offer published yesterday to buy out the outstanding MMB shareholders to pave the way for the merger of Matra and Hachette. Northern Telecom is separately to pay FFr1.36bn (Dollars 270m) for a 20 per cent stake in Matra's telecommunications subsidiary. Mr Philippe Camus, chairman of MMB, said Paribas, the French bank and industrial holding group, would also take 4 per cent in MMB, while other French financial institutions would take 25 per cent. Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the businessman who controls Matra and Hachette, would take more than 10 per cent and Floirat, a holding group allied to Mr Lagardere, would take less than 10 per cent. Before the offer, MMB was 38.4 per cent owned by a Lagardere-controlled holding company, Arjil Groupe. Outstanding shareholders are being offered FFr85 per share. This compares with the FFr83.9 at which MMB's shares were suspended on Monday, while the details were awaited. Hachette was on course to report a net profit of FFr100m to FFr200m this year, after a FFr1.93bn loss in 1991, but the outlook for 1993 was uncertain, said Mr Camus. Matra was set this year to report an increase on last year's net profit of FFr252m and the prospects for 1993 were good, he said.</p>

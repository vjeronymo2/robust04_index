			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Kevin Maxwell ordered to pay Pounds 406m damages MR KEVIN MAXWELL has been ordered by the High Court to make interim payments totalling Pounds 406.8m to the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the company from which hundreds of millions of pounds of Maxwell empire pension funds disappeared. It is believed to be the largest damages award ever made against an individual in the English courts. The liquidators, Robson Rhodes, were given final judgment against Mr Maxwell in an action in which they claimed Pounds 450m compensation or damages for alleged breaches of his fiduciary duty as a director of BIM, which managed pension funds for a number of Maxwell companies. The full amount for which Mr Maxwell is liable has yet to be assessed. He has said he is insolvent and wants to formulate proposals to put to his creditors. However, the liquidators intend to force him into bankruptcy. Because of his lack of resources, Mr Maxwell did not defend the case. Mr Justice Mummery said that, on the liquidators' evidence, there was no defence to their claims. On Thursday the liquidators will ask the court for final judgment in an identical action against Mr Maxwell's brother Ian. After yesterday's ruling Mr Maxwell said in a statement that he had not played an active part in the proceedings brought by the liquidators since declaring himself insolvent on July 8. On that day a High Court order, which expires tomorrow, was made preventing his creditors bringing proceedings against him while he formulates proposals to put to them. In spite of the order, the liquidators were given leave by the court on July 10 to seek summary judgment against Mr Maxwell. His statement continued: 'Had I had the resources, I would have strenuously denied all allegations of breach of duty.' He said it remained his desire to assist in the realisation of his assets for the benefit of all his creditors. Mrs Margaret Cole, of Stephenson Harwood, the liquidators' solicitors, said: 'It is our intention to seek Mr Maxwell's bankruptcy. We believe a trustee in bankruptcy is the best person to investigate his assets and recover or secure them for the benefit of all the creditors, of whom we are by far the largest.' At the end of a two-hour private hearing, Mr Justice Mummery gave his decision in open court because of 'the widespread public interest in this litigation'. He said that the liquidators' 44-page claim related almost entirely to alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by Mr Maxwell while a director of BIM. The judge ordered an account to be taken of what was due from Mr Maxwell to BIM and payment by Mr Maxwell of the sum found to be due. Separate orders were made in respect of breaches of duty in 'procuring, effecting and consenting to' specific transactions, coupled with orders for interim payments. The judge continued an order freezing Mr Maxwell's assets up to a maximum of Pounds 450m. Mr Kenneth Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Committee, said: 'Presumably this will bankrupt Mr Maxwell, and whether pensioners will actually get more than it has cost them to obtain this court decision is highly speculative.' He said fees to professional advisers were depleting pension assets by roughly Pounds 1m a month and urged the government to take over the cost of pursuing assets through the courts.</p>

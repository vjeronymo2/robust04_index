			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] The Cuban emigrants' right-wing forces in the United  States and the Western news media have wasted no time or  opportunity in downplaying or minimizing the role that The  Nation and the Emgrigants Conference played in the path to  normal relations between Cubans inside and outside Cuba. The  most hostile elements went as far as to launch a campaign of  terror against a group of U.S.-based emigres who came to Havana  in late April to participate in the meeting, which the attendees  described as very useful.    Cubans, who until now have comprised the so-called silent  majority, prevented by the right from expressing their views in  favor of a dialogue with the island's government, are beginning  to defy extremists like the members of the Cuban American  National Foundation [FNCA], one of the groups that has tried  hardest to minimize the scope of the Havana meeting.    Raymundo del Toro, president of the Cuban-American Committee  for Peace, in a letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES, pointed out that  his only son lives in Cuba and all members of his group have  relatives on the island. That is why, Del Toro noted, we will  no longer be the silent majority who remain quiet in the face of  attacks by opportunistic politicians like Representative Robert  Torricelli, who sponsored the amendment that stiffened the  blockade on Cuba, and egomaniacs like Jorge Mas Canosa, head of  the FNCA.    In his letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES, Del Toro affirmed that  the important thing about the aforementioned conference is the  agreements reached, not whether the participants had a chat with  Cuban President Fidel Castro. Del Toro is among the emigres who  left the meeting satisfied, as its balance was significant in  terms facilites for emigrants.    In the opinion of Andres Gomez, coordinator of the Antonio  Maceo Brigade, the changes in migration policy that eliminate  the five-year waiting period for Cubans who left the country  legally to return to the country will benefit thousands of  Cubans eager to have more fluid relations with their family  members and country of origin. Although this was not the only  agreement reached in Havana, the extreme right among the emigres  and in the Western media insist on saying that participants in  the conference left empty-handed. In this letter, Del Toro  regretted that the meeting in Havana has been downplayed.    During a news conference in Miami, Gomez took a step farther  in asking: Why do the gentlemen of the extreme right and the  media refuse to hold a debate? Are not they always claiming  they are democrats? Let them dare to practice what they claim  to be.</p>

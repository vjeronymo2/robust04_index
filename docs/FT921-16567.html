			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Anarchic bargaining distorts Israel's budget: The haggling, handouts and histrionics that go into fixing government spending IF ANY of the international creditors from whom Israel is planning soon to borrow Dollars 20bn (Pounds 10.9bn) took time off from the season's festivities to study the anarchic, 11th-hour bargaining over the government's 1992 budget, they are unlikely to have been encouraged to loosen their purse strings. Government officials must be especially anxious about what the US embassy in Tel Aviv is reporting back to Washington on the unedifying spectacle of haggling, handouts and histrionics that increasingly characterises the process of fixing government spending in Israel. The issue is pertinent because of the huge five-year borrowing programme the government has drawn up to help finance mass Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union. A vital component of this is a request that the US government, which already gives Israel Dollars 3bn in annual aid, guarantee credits worth Dollars 10bn - half the total external requirement. Aside from linking this assistance - due to come before Congress late this month - to the Middle East peace talks, the Bush administration has made it plain that a key consideration will be evidence that the Israeli government is conducting a stable economic policy that will ensure it can honour its debt obligations. International lenders will undoubtedly take their lead from Washington. So the failure of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, to get his 1992 budget enacted before the year began, and the frantic horse-trading with small coalition parties that held up the process, may have an impact far beyond the immediate domestic economic consequences. The source of the problem, almost everyone agrees, is the highly factionalised political system which allows small parties to use their hold over the balance of power to make outrageous financial demands for their own vested interests. Mr Shamir, it appeared yesterday, preferred to give in rather than let his government fall on the budget issue. So it was this week that: A single member of Mr Shamir's Likud party was able to force through changes in the system of state-subsidised mortgages against the will of the treasury and Bank of Israel at a cost of Shk1.1bn (Pounds 258m) - more than 1 per cent of the original total budgeted spending. Extreme right-wing parties forced Mr Yitzhak Moda'i to commit about an extra Shk170m to Jewish settlements in the occupied territories - also in political defiance of the US - and some Shk300m in increased subsidies to new immigrants. Ultra-orthodox religious parties won commitments to spend tens of millions of shekels on educational and other institutions which they control. Mr Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the Bank of Israel, repeatedly warned of the inflationary dangers of such deals, especially as the economy is showing signs of stalling. 'During the last few days,' he said on Monday, 'there have been all sorts of dramatic changes going on in the budget so that I can't even tell you, just one day before the budget is approved, how large the deficit will be.' Mr Moda'i himself expressed his exasperation: 'Every year it is more and more wild. This year the Knesset will pencil in money that simply isn't there. The finance minister will then have to go door-to-door, to try to raise the money from the US and from diaspora Jewry. Then you will say, and rightly so, that the government is inconsistent in its economic policy.' Not that the original budget as formulated by the government itself was a model of fiscal firmness. Mr Moda'i's proposal to limit the deficit this year to 5.5 per cent of GDP was thrown out by ministers, who boosted it to 6.3 per cent. And to make even that figure possible, they simply knocked 50,000 off the number of immigrants forecast to arrive, without altering any related projections such as the rate of growth, or revenues. By coincidence, an electoral reform bill was due to be voted on in the Knesset yesterday aimed at ending the influence of the small parties. The proposal to have direct elections for the prime minister, thus creating a virtual executive premier with greater authority, might well prove not to be a solution. But Mr Shamir's entrenched opposition to it means that even this attempt to shake up the system is likely to fail. A recent decline in the rate of arrival of immigrants may mean that this year's last-minute round of budget handouts will not badly inflate the deficit. But the job Mr Moda'i faces in persuading the US and other lenders to invest in the Israeli economy will not have been made any easier by the events of the past few days. A vote was finally scheduled to take place today in Israel's parliament on the 1992 budget, incorporating a large deficit to cope with mass Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union. The move followed negotiations late last night between Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government and religious parties in his coalition amid indications that disputes over allocation of funds to their rival institutions had been settled. A final parliamentary vote was repeatedly postponed yesterday as Mr Shamir tried to find a way to avoid threats by some of the religious groups to vote against the budget, which could block its passage and possibly threaten the government itself. The bill should have been passed by midnight on December 31.</p>

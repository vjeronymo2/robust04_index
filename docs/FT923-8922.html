			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Letter: No simple answer to care of the very old Sir, Mr Cassidy (Letters, July 28) suggests that financial needs of those who are dependent on others through the effects of age rather than specific illness could be met from their pension schemes by 'a modest funding rate applied to the whole of the employee population in a way analogous to that of providing for death in service'. This requires the employer to charge against current profits generated by current employees a benefit for individuals who have not been contributing to that profitability for some time. If this cost really is small, then the paternal employer might be happy to do so. But where a business has shrunk to the extent that, say, half the pension scheme membership are pensioners, the loading will not be so small. A longer term solution to pre-fund long-term care benefits alongside pension benefits is not without its problems. The cost of providing full insurance is still high, all the more because it attracts no tax concessions, and younger employees will be reluctant to contribute because they do not see the need. While small benefits may help those who need extra services brought to their home, when it comes to residential care such benefits may only serve to prevent those on low incomes from claiming state support, just as home ownership does now. Further, the only way of avoiding the extra administrative burden of assessing need would be to pay long-term care benefits to all pensioners, but on an age-related basis. This, though, would increase the cost of the benefits themselves. There seems to be no short-term solution, but the possibility of a longer-term solution on a group rather than an individual basis is already exercising the minds of some pension practitioners.

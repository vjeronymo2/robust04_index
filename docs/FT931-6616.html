			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Surge in Mexican trade deficit worries investors MEXICO'S trade deficit climbed to Dollars 20.6bn (Pounds 14.5bn) last year, an 85 per cent increase over 1991. The shortfall was Dollars 15.8bn when revenues from in-bond plants were included. The trade deficit, which has increased five-fold since 1990, represents more than 6 per cent of gross domestic product and has become a growing source of worry for investors in Mexico's money and stock markets. The December deficit climbed to Dollars 2.2bn, the largest monthly shortfall last year. Exports rose to Dollars 2.3bn, a 4.4 increase over December 1991, while imports were Dollars 4.5bn, a 26 per cent increase. The growth in imports appears to have levelled off at 25-26 per cent, although as yet there is no sign of them slowing. The government is easily financing the deficit, but at the cost of an annual real interest rate of about 10 per cent. The Finance Ministry has long argued that the growth in imports reflects restructuring of Mexican industry, with companies importing capital and intermediate goods to improve productivity and to compete better with international competition. Exports have also suffered from the weakness in the US and international economy, and the steady real appreciation of the peso against the dollar. While the Mexican peso devalued by about 3 per cent against the dollar last year, Mexican inflation was some 9 percentage points higher than the US's. For the year as a whole, exports reached 27.5bn, 1.5 per cent more than 1991. Manufacturing exports performed slightly better, rising by 4.2 per cent. The Finance Ministry said export growth was 'satisfactory'. Imports increased to Dollars 48.1bn last year, 26 per cent more than in 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from "NHK News" program] </F>   [Text] Li Daoyu, Chinese ambassador to the United Nations,  in a 15 June interview with NHK, declined to directly comment on  the draft sanctions resolution that the United States has  prepared to submit to the UN Security Council [UNSC], merely  saying: China's position remains unchanged. The PRC has  maintained a cautious stance on imposing sanctions against the  DPRK.    As a result, it is expected that for the time being,  behind-the-scenes maneuverings -- including possible revisions  to the draft resolution -- will continue among UNSC member  nations, with attention focused on how China will react to the  U.S. proposal.</p>

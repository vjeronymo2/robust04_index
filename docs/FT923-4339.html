			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Treuhand tries to haltfall in east's output THE Treuhand, the German government agency charged with privatising former state companies in east Germany, yesterday launched a new drive to stem the steep decline in output in the five new Lander. The programme will include revised guidelines to encourage capital investment. The Treuhand, which is struggling under a cumulative debt which will reach DM137bn by the end of this year, will make its debut in the international bond markets next month to borrow up to DM10bn (Pounds 3.5bn). A 10-year bond is expected to raise between DM8bn and DM10bn, depending on the acceptance by the markets. Mrs Birgit Breuel, the Treuhand president, announced the bond issue against the background of plummeting sales by Treuhand companies and a darkening outlook for the German economy. Mr Hero Brahms, a member of the Treuhand executive board, said Treuhand companies this year might achieve only 70 per cent of 1991 turnover. The chief reason was the almost total collapse of the former Soviet market. Mrs Breuel said the Treuhand's remaining 3,810 companies - 9,000 were privatised to the end of July - need to boost investment for urgently-needed restructuring. Last year's investment level of 10 per cent of sales was the minimum needed but companies, anticipating further steep falls in sales, had signalled they would invest less next year. 'We are telling the companies to scrutinise their investment plans and are issuing them guidelines. 'They have until September 30 to come up with new investment plans,' she said. The Treuhand would continue to provide equity capital and liquidity to companies which presented a workable restructuring concept and would assume their past debts. Mrs Breuel said the Treuhand aimed to find new owners by the end of next year for all its companies found suitable for restructuring. The large companies among those remaining could be placed under limited partnership management, while the smaller ones would be placed in privatisation funds, which could be run by banks or other financial institutions. Mrs Breuel said that in recent months many of the Treuhand companies had assumed that a breakthrough was imminent in Bonn's negotiations with Moscow to revive trade. Although the Russian government pledged payment of DM5bn for goods covered by German export credit guarantees the pledge was not implemented. She said the situation was complex. The Treuhand would support its companies in long-term efforts to detach themselves from markets in the Commonwealth of Independent States, which 'obviously will remain difficult', according to Mrs Breuel. There was no sense in trying to revive trade by means of subsidies, she added. The Treuhand already has a DM10bn German commercial paper programme of which about DM7bn has been issued. This existing short-term debt has been assigned a top credit rating and both rating agencies (Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's) have said that bond issues by the Treuhand would be rated triple A. Traders said yesterday that the Treuhand's bonds were likely to be priced at a narrow discount to the existing 7.78 per cent yield on 10-year Bunds, reflecting the fact that the new issue will be guaranteed by the federal government. The yield is thought likely to be set at around 7.85 per cent. The new issue will be traded on all German stock exchanges, and the bonds will be 'deliverable' into the German government bond futures contract traded on the Deutsche Terminborse, the German futures and options exchange. This means that the new bonds will be used to settle Bund futures contracts when they expire, thus enhancing the appeal of the new paper to international investors. Mrs Breuel's critical remark coincided with a plan put forward yesterday by Mr Otto Wolff von Amerongen, chairman of German industry's Eastern Board of Trade. Mr Wolff proposed that roubles be used in addition to hard currency in order to boost German-CIS trade. He said the German companies would need to be able to invest rouble proceeds in Russian property and factories.</p>

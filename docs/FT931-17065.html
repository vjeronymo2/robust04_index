			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Markets: Into the New Year in an uncertain mood - Wall Street BY THURSDAY tea-time, with several hours of the old year left, Manhattan's Times Square was already resounding to the blare of trumpets and gaudy rattles: 1993, it seemed, could not come fast enough. Wall Street investors know the feeling well. For much of 1992, their sights have been fixed firmly on what the next 12 months may bring. There is, of course, nothing unusual about stockmarkets anticipating the future. But, the presidential election, dominated by its cries of change and transition, and the turning-point reached in the domestic economic cycle, have given investors a fixation with tomorrow's joys, obscuring the drearier realities of today. The final week of the year ran true to form. On the positive side, a raft of year-end economic indicators provided further hints that the economy may be pulling out of recession with some alacrity. The consumer confidence index published by the New York-based Conference Board climbed 12.7 points during December to 78.3, for example. This follows an 11-point gain in November, and represents the highest level scored for one and a half years. (The benchmark 100-point level was set in 1985, and a strong economy tends to register a figure in the upper 80s). Sales of existing homes were also shown to have reached their highest monthly level for six years in November. This was quickly interpreted as a signal that consumers are more optimistic about future prosperity and job security - although, apparently, also worried that interest rates are set to rise. Meanwhile, the main yardstick of future economic activity - the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators - showed a 0.8 per cent rise for November, the biggest monthly advance since last January. Glimpses into the future, however, were not universally positive. This spate of encouraging economic data failed to translate into a traditional year-end rally on Wall Street, largely because investors were also trying to anticipate the tax changes which may take effect in 1993. The Clinton administration, runs the thinking, will almost certainly increase the income tax burden on high-earning individuals. Accordingly, such investors had every incentive to lock into stockmarket profits before 1992 ended. Tax-centred concerns have already led to the early payments of bonuses by some Wall Street investment firms. Last week, these told on share prices, as dealers reported confusing 'cross-currents' in trading activity. Some investment clients, they suggested, were still buying on the economic news, but others were busily selling on tax fears. The two trends seemed to balance out and the Dow Jones Industrial Average yo-yoed to the year's end - down a little at the start of the week, up a little on Wednesday and Thursday, and then down sharply in 1992's final half-hour of trading as computerised programme selling engulfed an otherwise moribund market. Still, even if short-term influences were mixed, the extent to which US investors have been pinning their hopes - and their dollars - on 1993 were evident when figures for mutual fund investment were published mid-week. These showed a massive Dollars 9.9bn flowing into share-based funds in November, way in excess of the previous monthly record of Dollars 7.5bn. As a result, equity- oriented mutual funds have now pulled in a staggering Dollars 68.6bn from investors in the first 11 months of 1992, almost double the figure seen in the same period of 1991. In one respect at least, investors' taste for equities and mounting optimism over the economy, is irrefutably beneficial. Quite simply, it has helped soak up equally unprecedented outflows from the corporate sector. Corporate share and debt-related issues also rose to unprecedented levels last year - over Dollars 800bn-worth of underwritten issues in the domestic market, according to one calculation - as companies restructured their balance sheets and took advantage of low interest rates. But will the reality of 1993 live up to the hopes ? As analysts at S G Warburg have pointed out, some of the more superficial portents are not good. For a start, the year ends in a three - and statistically, over the past 100 years, this ranks eighth out of the 10 choices. Secondly, a new president will be in the White House, and post-election years have a tendency to produce uninspiring stockmarket performance. But down in Times Square, such qualms were speedily being put to rest. 'Happy New Year,' yelled a partying crowd, with a message which was simple and would have cheered Wall Street's heart. Let the good times roll.  ---------------------------- Monday      3333.26     +7.02 Tuesday     3310.84    -22.42 Wednesday   3321.1     +10.26 Thursday    3301.11    -19.99 Friday        Market closed  ----------------------------</p>

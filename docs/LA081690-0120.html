			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BARGAINS: OFFICE SUPPLIES, NOT FOR MEMBERS ONLY  </P> <P> We've had many membership clubs the past few years that offer good deals after  you pay an annual fee. But it's refreshing to come across a no-membership fee  operation that can beat some of the major discounters.  </P> <P> HQ Office Supplies Warehouse is possibly the best deal in office supplies in  Southern California. Starting with one store in Culver City in February, 1989,  the chain now has 12 locations in the greater Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Here's an example of the savings offered there. The Thomas Los Angeles/Orange  County Map Book (with no ZIP codes), a publication that no one in Los Angeles  should be without, usually lists for $22.95. Crown Books' discounted price is  $20, but HQ offers it for $12.48 -- a savings of almost 45% off list. We don't  know of any spot in town that offers this good a deal.  </P> <P> One of the best-selling word-processing programs, Word Perfect, lists for $495.  HQ's price is $249.49, or 49% off.  </P> <P> On a smaller scale, a box of 25 letter-size Pendaflex hanging folders lists for  $13.99. Quill, a discount office supply catalogue, has a price of $8.79, but  HQ's price is $5.06 -- a dazzling 64% off.  </P> <P> Discouraged with the high cost of Dayrunners appointment books? The compact  pocket edition in vinyl retails for $25 and is priced here at $17.86, or 28%  off list. The 8 1/2-by-11-inch leather Entrepreneur edition lists for $175, but  HQ's price is $125.96. The discount is even better on the vinyl Running Mate,  which is $28.90 instead of the $40 list, and the Pocket Planner, which is  $12.92 instead of the $20 list. If you're still into the Classic Dayrunner,  you'll save 37% on the black leather model. Instead of $110, it's $68.96. You  don't score as well on the refills, which are discounted from 12% to 14% for  the Entrepreneur variety and 16% to 26% for the Classic edition.  </P> <P> Whether you need a copier (Sharp or Canon), a typewriter (Smith Corona, Brother  or Canon), an answering machine (AT&amp;T and Phonemate), file cabinets,  banquet tables, microwaves (Emerson), coffee makers (Norelco), desk lamps or,  of course, all kinds of paper, you'll do well with average price cuts of 30% to  60% off list.  </P> <P> There are toll-free 800 numbers for phone or fax ordering from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Monday through Friday. For phone order service, call (800) 765-6060; the fax  number is (800) 765-3030. The delivery charge is $15 or 5% of the purchase  price, whichever is greater. If you place your order before noon, it will  arrive the following day.  </P> <P> Price books are available at the following HQ Office Supplies Warehouse stores:  </P> <P> 21500 Victory Blvd., Woodland Hills; (818) 999-0091.  </P> <P> 10822 Jefferson Blvd., Culver City; (213) 202-6493.  </P> <P> 17265 E. Gale Ave., City of Industry; (818) 912-3511.  </P> <P> 1962 Barranca Parkway, Irvine; (714) 250-3133.  </P> <P> There are also stores in Alhambra, Bellflower, Fullerton, San Bernardino,  Fountain Valley, West Los Angeles, Montebello and Norwalk.  </P></p>

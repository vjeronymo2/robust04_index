			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [David McKittrick article: "Major Given Hint of More </F> Concessions by Sinn Fein"]    [Text] Sinn Fein leaders used yesterday's traditional  Easter platforms to hint that more republican concessions might  be on the way if the British government responded to this week's  three-day IRA ceasefire.    With the limited ceasefire due to come into effect at  midnight tomorrow both Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness called  on London to end the present stalemate by agreeing to direct  talks with Sinn Fein.    Both used the current republican buzzword -- "potential" --  to plant the suggestion that a new situation would result from a  decision by John Major to clarify aspects of the Downing Street  Declaration.    Mr Major's dismissal of the ceasefire as a cynical exercise  has been contradicted by some nationalist leaders. In  particular Dr Cahal Daly, the Catholic Primate of All-Ireland,  has urged the Government to regard the ceasefire as a genuine  effort by the IRA, and to attempt to build on it.    Mr Adams, speaking at a Belfast rally, was at pains to deny  that the republican call for clarification was a ploy to get  into negotiations. He declared: "We have questions to ask of  London and we require direct dialogue, not protracted  deliberations or negotiations."    There is as yet no public sign of movement from the British  side on this demand. The Irish government, which is showing  increasing signs of impatience and disillusion with the ability  of Mr Adams to deliver the republican movement, has bolstered  the British position by refraining from echoing the call from Dr  Daly.    Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said he did not  believe direct talks between the British government and Sinn  Fein were possible. He said: "We are very disappointed at the  IRA's token gesture. We believe that we have made enormous  efforts over the last number of months. I don't see any  prospect of a meeting between the British Government and Sinn  Fein at this stage."    A statement from Downing Street reiterated the Government's  position: "What is needed is not a three-day ceasefire, after  which the killing would begin again, but a permanent end to  violence."    At the same time, no one knows all of what is going on  behind  the scenes at this moment. There will almost certainly be  surreptitious activity from potential go-betweens anxious to  bridge the gap and move the peace process along.    Logistical considerations within the IRA probably preclude  an  extension of this week's ceasefire, which is scheduled to end at  midnight on Friday. Sinn Fein has already made it fairly clear,  however, that It accepts that no early London move towards  clarification is likely. The impression is being given,  however, that a break in the clarification stalemate could  create new opportunities.    Mr Adams gave an interesting insight into republican  analysis  when he declared: "The British may not yet be planning to leave  Ireland. But they will. I am firmly convinced that they can be  persuaded to end the union and to do so in a manner which will  permit all of the people of Ireland to come to agreement on a  new and stable society on this island."    Because of this, he said, republicans need not be in a  defensive mindset, and should seek to maintain the political  offensive. If these issues were addressed properly, he said,  then substantial progress was possible.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Volvo may disclose chairman's salary THE BOARD of Volvo, the Swedish vehicle maker, may tomorrow make public for the first time details of the salary and benefits of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, its chairman, in a bid to stave off pressure from small shareholders angry over reports of excessive executive remuneration at the lossmaking company. Leaders of Aktiespararna, the Swedish shareholders' association, plan to demand details of Mr Gyllenhammar's pay at Volvo's annual meeting in Gothenberg tomorrow which is expected to be attended by about 2,000 stockholders. They also want to know the salary package of Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive appointed last year, and the severance deal granted to his predecessor, Mr Christer Zetterberg, and other executives who left the company last year. The company last year fell to a record loss of SKr4.75bn (Dollars 610m) after financial items, and for the first time cut its dividend, by 50 per cent. Volvo yesterday denied reports that Mr Zetterberg, 42, had received a golden handshake of SKr75m and an annual salary until retirement of more than SKr400,000. The board, which will meet tomorrow morning, is expected to issue a statement in advance of the shareholders' meeting giving at least some of the details demanded by Aktiespararna in the hope of defusing a rumpus. The company said it was possible this would include details of Mr Gyllenhammar's remuneration, which Volvo has never before published. Swedish press reports have speculated that his package amounts to several million dollars per year, including the use of a private jet and other perks. The small shareholders face an obstacle in forcing greater disclosure by the board as they need to win 10 per cent of votes in the company to push through any resolution. They appear unlikely to receive any help from Renault, the French car and truck maker which is the biggest shareholder in Volvo, with almost 10 per cent of the parent company. Renault declined to say how the company would act in the issue, but said: 'We support the management of Volvo.' Like the Swedish pension funds and insurance companies that are the other main large shareholders, Renault's chief concern is to get Volvo back in profit. In that, the management of Mr Gyllenhammar may be an issue, but the question of executive pay is regarded as peripheral, if publicly sensitive.</p>

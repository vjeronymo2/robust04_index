A letter from  Iraq's permanent Arab League delegate to its secretary general  also points out that the action poses a serious threat to Iraq's  sovereignty and national unity.    Last Friday, Saturday, and Sunday [21, 22, 23 January],  these  aircraft mounted 148 sorties, having taken off from Saudi and  Kuwaiti bases.    Iraq's delegate asked that the letter be circulated among  the  League members.</p>

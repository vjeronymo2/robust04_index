A one-ton bomb was  found yesterday in a rented six-wheel truck that had been seized  by police and parked in front of Lumpini police station since it  had been involved in a minor traffic accident near the Israeli  Embassy on March 11.    Its owner, who had turned up to claim the vehicle yesterday,  found a steel water tank on the truck and, together with the  police, discovered that it contained a bomb. Bomb disposal  experts who were called in to defuse the bomb said it was made  with ammonium nitrate, diesel oil and six bars of C-4 plastic  explosives wired to a car battery and a switch in the dashboard  near the driver's seat. The bomb experts said it was big enough  to destroy a large building. The steel water tank also contained  the body of a Thai man identified later as Chom Phila, 43, the  driver of the rented truck.    Later, Police Department chief Prathin Santipraphop told  reporters after chairing an urgent meeting of top policemen and  officials at the National Security Council that he had ordered  security tightened at all foreign embassies in Bangkok. He said  the bomb belonged to a "sophisticated" international terrorist  gang and was intended to be used against foreign nationals.    Lumpini Police said they had seized the truck near Chitlom  intersection about 300 metres from the Israeli Embassy, after it  hit a motorcycle taxi on March 11. Government House sources  quoted the police report as saying that the bomb was believed to  be on its way to the embassy when it hit the motorcycle taxi as  it came out of the Central Department Store parking lot on  Chitlom Road.    The same day, Muslim protesters had rallied outside the  embassy compound to protest against the February 28 massacre of  Palestinians in a mosque in Hebron. Pol Gen [Police General]  Prathin insisted that it was still too early to say if the truck  bomb had been intended for the Israeli Embassy. The embassy  yesterday sent its security officer to observe the defusing of  the bomb.    The Metropolitan Police yesterday sent ten investigative  teams to hunt for the terrorists. Metropolitan Police  Commissioner Chaiyasit Kanchanakit said that although the attack  was to have taken place several days ago, he believes the  terrorists are still in Thailand.    Sketches of an Arab-looking man who had been driving the  truck was drawn from the account of the motorcyclist who was  involved in the accident, and has been distributed to all police  stations and the Immigration Police. All Arab-looking travellers  leaving Don Muang Airport yesterday were reportedly thoroughly  searched.    The National Security Council's Anti-Terrorism Centre chief  Lt- Gen Saiyawit Sirimonthon told reporters the authorities had  been alerted about a possible terrorism attack in Bangkok  recently by the Thai Embassy in Turkey. The embassy, he said,did  not give any details about the attack except to say that it  could happen this month. The country's policy of opening to  tourism has made Thailand vulnerable to international terrorism,  he said.    The danger was not over yet, he added. Just because the  police had discovered one plot did not mean that the terrorists  who were responsible would not try again, he claimed.    Investigators yesterday questioned the truck's owner, Thawin  Pawaratphichit, 41, and the motorcyclist, Boonsoem Saendi, 21,  to try to obtain more details about the Arab man who rented and  drove the truck the day the accident took place. Police quoted  Thawin as saying he lad rented the vehicle on March 8 to the  Arab for 12,000 baht "to pick up goods" in Chiang Mai. He had  assigned Chom Phila, the driver of the rented truck who was  later murdered, to deliver the truck to the client at Makro  store in Bangkapi on March 10.    Chom had telephoned him at about 8 p.m. on the same day to  tell him that the truck had been delivered to the client and  that he had received 5,500 baht in partial payment of the rent.  Chom told him that the man would pay the rest of he rent on his  return from Chiang Mai. Chom had not been heard from until his  body was discovered yesterday in the steel water tank of the  truck.    Pol Col [Police Colonel] Sombun Tantrakun, a doctor at  Police  Hospital, said Chom had apparently been strangled to death,  judging from the severe bruise around his neck, and both his  wrists had been broken.    Boonsoem, the motorcyclist, said the Arab looking driver of  the truck had gotten out of the vehicle after the accident near  Chitlom intersection to try to negotiate and had handed him some  foreign banknotes. They had difficulty understanding each  other, though, and the man finally walked into the department  store and disappeared.    Lumpini policemen who were called to the scene, drove the  truck to the station on Wireless Road and left it there. Its  owner, Thawin, turned up at the station to claim it yesterday.    Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said the discovery  of the bomb was "very fortunate" and pledged to increase  security. "This is a good lesson. Policemen will be more  watchful," he said. He said he is waiting for a detailed police  report for Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, who is on an official  visit to Vietnam.</p>

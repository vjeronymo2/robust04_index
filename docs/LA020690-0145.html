			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BESIEGED FLA. TAX OFFICIAL QUITS  </P> <P> Florida's chief tax collector resigned her $85,292-a-year job today amid  allegations she singled out a political opponent of her husband's for an audit.  </P> <P> In stepping down, Revenue Director Katie Tucker told Gov. Bob Martinez and the  Cabinet, "I emphatically and unequivocally deny that I have ever abused the  powers of my office for any purpose."  </P> <P> Tucker, 46, has headed the Department of Revenue since June, 1988.  </P> <P> Martinez and the Cabinet had suspended her with pay two weeks ago to allow her  time to respond to a Florida Department of Law Enforcement report on a 1988 tax  investigation of businesses owned by Donald G. Resha.  </P> <P> The FDLE found that Tucker committed no crime but that she personally ordered  the probe of Resha, who lost a 1985 election for the state AFL-CIO presidency  to her husband, Daniel Miller.  </P></p>

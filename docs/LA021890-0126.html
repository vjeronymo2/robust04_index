			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> LET'S FACE IT: NEITHER SIDE CARES ABOUT THE FANS  </P> <P> So here we go again.  </P> <P> The Great American Lockout looms on the horizon like some thunder cloud at a  Fourth of July picnic, and once again professional sports is faced with the  specter of a work stoppage. Five years ago, it was major-league baseball. Three  years ago, it was the National Football League. Now it's baseball again.  </P> <P> Once again, sports have become just another labor-management feud, no different  than the police and fire department unions haggling over a new contract. Forget  knowing the infield-fly rule. To really understand baseball now, you now have  to be familiar with the life and times of Samuel Gompers.  </P> <P> And once again, we sports fans are supposed to know whom to root for.  </P> <P> Are the players at fault, these spoiled millionaires who think it's their  birthright to never have to work again once their careers are over? Or is it  the owners, those bastions of business who have created these Monopoly-money  contracts in the first place?  </P> <P> Sometimes it seems like you need some advanced degree in negotiations to  decipher all this. But one thing is as clear as the padlocks on the gates of  spring-training sites.  </P> <P> Neither side cares about the fans.  </P> <P> Think about it. No one is talking about reducing ticket prices. No one is  talking about reducing the cost of a hot dog. No one is saying anything about  reducing the price of parking. Neither side is talking about putting pressure  on cable companies to reduce their prices, or lobbying to put more games on  regular television instead of pay television.  </P> <P> All of these things would help the fan. They would help stem the tide of people  almost needing second jobs to afford season tickets. Of having to buy sports  channels on cable television if you want to watch many of the games. Of the  always-rising cost of what it takes to be a sports fan nowadays.  </P> <P> Instead, we get talk of minimum salaries, revenue sharing, free agency and the  amount of time a player needs to be eligible for free agency. We get talk of  collusion and pay-for-performance, talk that makes your eyes glaze over.  </P> <P> And they want you and me to care who wins this so-called labor struggle?  </P> <P> Please. Be serious.  </P> <P> The modern sports climate is all about greed. How much and how often. Who gets  the biggest piece of a pie that keeps getting bigger and bigger. It's about  owners who keep putting more and more games on pay television, all the while  continuing to see their franchises escalate in value. It's about players who  charge little kids for autographs at card shows, and then give us nonsense  about how it's a great way to meet all their fans.  </P> <P> Why is this allowed to go on?  </P> <P> Simple.  </P> <P> We let it go on. You, and I, and anyone else who are baseball fans. We buy  sports channels on cable television. We buy tickets to the games, regardless of  the prices.  </P> <P> We are perceived as a captive audience, one that will be there regardless of  what side emerges as the winner in this so-called labor struggle. We are the  great unwashed, and we are treated as such.  </P> <P> Maybe that's because we want baseball to be some throwback to innocence, some  childhood time when players are loyal to the teams they play for, to the fans  who cheer them, some gone-forever time when no one knew what most players made,  and few cared. We want the players to care as much as we do.  </P> <P> We don't like it when players imply that their families and their personal  futures come before their allegiance to the team they play for and the fans who  cheer them. All that speaks of real life, one of the things we go to baseball  games to forget about.  </P> <P> That's the problem with the lockout.  </P> <P> It takes away all the pretense, robs us of the innocence. It clearly  demonstrates major-league baseball is a business, no different from any other,  complete with its omnipresent labor problems.  </P> <P> Say it ain't so, Joe.  </P> <P> Not that we won't be back when the lockout is over.  </P> <P> We will come crawling back like some jilted lover who gets a second chance, our  hearts once again on our sleeve.  </P> <P> For we are all junkies and, like junkies everywhere, we will get our fix,  whatever the cost. We are the suckers who will stand in line to pay players for  autographs at card shows. We will pay at least $10 to park, and then pay more  for soggy hotdogs and watered-down beer. We will keep paying for sports  channels on TV, and stay up late at night to watch the World Series because  some TV mogul somewhere figured out that ratings are better.  </P> <P> That is a reality.  </P> <P> But don't insult me.  </P> <P> Spare me any talk about who is right and who is wrong, in this Great American  Lockout. Both sides are portraits in greed. The owners who cry poverty while  their franchises continue to escalate in value. The players who want us to  think they are some poor struggling union in the middle of a battle with big,  bad management.  </P> <P> So spare me any talk that this latest work stoppage is any marvelous quest.  This is about what professional sports have become, and there are no winners.  </P> <P> Just people like you and me that neither side cares about.  </P></p>

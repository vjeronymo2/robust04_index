Breeding methods shall include whether breeding is continuous or seasonal (including descriptions of photoperiod manipulations used to stimulate or control breeding, if any) and whether breeding birds are induced to produce multiple clutches by the removal of eggs for artificial incubation; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Descriptions of incubation and rearing methods, as well as any other methods used to enhance production, including artificial insemination when applicable;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) A statement demonstrating that the facility is operated in a manner that is not detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The number and origin of original breeding stock (founders);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A statement from the Scientific Authority of the country in which the facility is located attesting that the parental stock was established in a manner that was not detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If any parental breeding stock was wild-caught, a statement as to the country of origin, date of acquisition, and certification by the Management Authority in the country in which the facility is located that the parental breeding stock was legally acquired; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Certification from the Management Authority in the country in which the facility is located that adequate controls, including inspections, are in place to prevent the use of the facility for the export of wild-caught stock;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) A statement of any anticipated need for augmentation of breeding stock with specimens from other sources; if augmentation is to be from the wild, an explanation as to why the removal of additional specimens from the wild shall be included. This explanation must address whether other captive-bred stock is available and describe breeding strategies employed at the facility to avoid deleterious inbreeding so that the need for augmentation from the wild is minimized;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) A statement describing the facility and demonstrating that it is operated in a humane and healthful manner, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Diagrams or photographs of the facility;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Descriptions of enclosures, including dimensions, construction materials, substrates, availability of water, lighting, ventilation, the need for supplemental heat or cooling and how these are provided, and shading (for outdoor enclosures);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Densities of birds in enclosures;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Internal features of enclosures, including perches, nest boxes, and plantings; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) A description of any facility features designed to satisfy unique requirements of the particular species;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) A description of the care and maintenance practices of the facility, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Husbandry practices, feeding regimes (number of feedings per day), and diet;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Hygienic practices, including methods and frequency of cleaning and disinfection of equipment and facilities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A statement as to the availability of routine professional veterinary care, including annual flock inspection or examination, and medication/vaccination schedules;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Records of mortality and disease outbreaks for both adults and chicks for at least the past two years. Episodes of high mortality or disease should be explained, and measures taken to prevent similar mortality or disease outbreaks in the future should be described; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Qualifications and experience of the personnel who will be responsible for the care of the exotic birds;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) A statement that all birds exported or to be exported from the facility are bred at the facility and are marked with closed leg bands or an electronic marking system;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) Details on the system of recordkeeping and tracking of birds and their progeny hatched at the facility, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Documentation that the facility maintains records of hatch dates and band numbers of all birds produced at the facility;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

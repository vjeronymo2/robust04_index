			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Travel Focus - Caribbean &amp; South America: Capitalism comes quietly to the Brazilian jungle - Christina Lamb takes to the trees on an eco-tour MY FIRST encounter with jungle wildlife on my first day as an ecotourist in Brazil consisted of 60 rosy-cheeked Dutch guzzling a hearty breakfast of tapioca pudding and scrambled eggs, watched intently by a family of monkeys clinging to the netting surrounding the restaurant. The bizarre role reversal presented a hilarious spectacle, though it was not quite how I had envisaged a stay at the Amazon's only treetop hotel. Having visited the jungle on several occasions as a journalist on the trail of a story, I had been looking forward to returning more leisurely as a tourist. I had imagined being overwhelmed by the splendour of the rainforest, silenced by the majesty of trees thousands of years old. I had pictured waking gently to the splash of fish, chatter of monkeys and whoop of exotic birds, perhaps peering out from my hammock in the night into the eyes of some passing wild cat. I had not expected to be brutally awoken by the sound of a tour party of hefty Dutchmen trampling through the jungle and zooming around on jetskis and ultralites. Reached by a leisurely four-hour boat ride up the River Negro from the jungle capital of Manaus, the Ariau Jungle Tower Hotel looms out of the black water like an alien landing craft. A collection of wooden towers shrouded in green netting and connected by a series of suspended catwalks and interlocking passageways, it resembles one of those Escher sketches that students often hang on their walls. The concept behind Ariau was a good one. Most of the action in the Amazon takes place out of sight, high in the trees, and many visitors leave disappointed at the lack of visible wildlife. At Ariau, which is built entirely from local wood and mounted 12 metres above water level, monkeys are liable to leap on to your neck while walking along the catwalks, toucans incline their beaks politely from branches conveniently situated at eye-level, and pointy-nosed racoon-like animals follow at heel like dogs to snuggle up with guests in the hammocks in reception. Moreover, this is jungle travel made easy. A stay at Ariau involves none of the irritations of adventure tourism that become funny only after the event, such as being feasted upon by mosquitos, packed into splintering boats amid the great unwashed, or bitten by giant ants while in the process of relieving oneself. But assigned luxury status by the Brazilian Tourist Authority, the Ariau management has gone overboard in its desire to offer 'facilities.' Do people really visit an Amazon getaway to ride jetskis, watch videos, make international telephone calls or buy gemstones? And catering for the mass market with 90 rooms (plus 100 under construction) means that life at Ariau is highly regimented. A blackboard in reception sets the day's agenda. 6am: Watch Sunrise. 6.30am: Watch Birds. 7.30am: Breakfast. 9am: Visit Native House. I tried to imagine what the natives had made of 60 hefty Dutch appearing for morning coffee. Maybe they appreciated some tips on clog-making and tulip-growing. Watching the Dutch party arriving back from the natives' house sporting seed necklaces as evidence that capitalism has come to the jungle, I concluded that Ariau was a convincing argument against mass market eco-tourism. That was until I set off with a small party in a canoe. Gliding down inlets on the black water amid half-submerged trees and giant lilies, we watched pink dolphins frolicking round the boat, sullen natives spear-fishing in the reeds and wild geese practising formation flying against a deep azure sky. This was the kind of bliss that makes one doubt the value of progress. The afternoon was again spent drifting lazily and fishing for piranhas with raw meat. Apparently, the best way to attract them is by splashing and the smell of fresh blood, but as none of our party offered to slash themselves with a knife and jump in, our haul was small. Mercifully so, I thought, watching the razor-sharp teeth of our victims snapping viciously as they writhed on the floor of the boat. Successful catches could be taken to the hotel to be dried, mounted and fashioned into an interesting conversation piece. Arriving back at sunset, I climbed the hotel's rickety Blue Sky Tower which, at 40m, claims to be the world's highest wooden tower. From this vantage point I watched the sky flame over the endless trees and water of the Anavilhanas archipelago, the world's largest group of floating islands and the subject of extensive research by Jacques Cousteau. After so much excitement I was quite ready for my buffet dinner of exotic fruit and fish the size of men, served by effeminate waiters in flowery shirts calling each other 'darling'. The cook told me he was always receiving offers of marriage from young Parisians. Adding to the surreality, the maitre d' confessed that he was an out-of-work pornographic model who prefers dressing as a woman. With the monkeys looking on from outside, I began to wonder if I had been slipped some of the Amazon's hallucinogenic drugs. Feeling sated, we took to our canoes again, paddling amid the stars reflected in jet black water. This time we were hunting for alligators, using flashlights to search out their red eyes. They are caught by the guides and brought into the boat, so that brave tourists can hold them. Jungle luxury meant small hard beds in rabbit-hutch rooms instead of hammocks gently swaying under the stars. What sounded like the combined snoring of 60 Dutch was the only decipherable animal noise. Those with a few hundred dollars extra to spare could stay in the far more spacious Tarzan House (at 36m high, the world's highest treehouse, according to the blurb) or the Imperial Suite. I began to feel converted to eco-tourism. Presented with my very own jungle survival certificate at the end of the trip, I suddenly found myself qualified in basic jungle survival techniques, navigation of the River Negro and reconnaissance of the forest lowlands. Mine is on the wall above the mounted piranha. Christina Lamb travelled to Ariau Jungle Towers with Varig Airlines which flies directly to Manaus from the US and via Rio from Europe.</p>

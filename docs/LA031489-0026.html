			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEMICALS  </P> <P> It is a heartening tribute to the resourcefulness of U.S. chemical companies  that they have suitable substitutes for ozone-shredding chlorofluorocarbons  waiting in the wings. (Does anyone doubt that they'll be considerably more  expensive than the current culprits?)  </P> <P> But wait! Could we use this crisis to find out the awful truths about the  possible toxic, carcinogenic, environmental or otherwise hazardous effects of  these new substance now, before another couple of decades roll by? I want full,  impartial disclosure on these chemicals just as I expect it in foodstuffs,  medicines, or household cleaners. In the light of this experience, to assume  harmlessness is naivest folly.  </P> <P> PETER E. SUTHEIM  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

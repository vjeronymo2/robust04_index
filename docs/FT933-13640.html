			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Sport: Faldo leads the charge - Derek Lawrenson watches the best players in the world move up the leader board / Open Golf AFTER TWO first-class days at the Open and two rounds over which the game's shot makers revelled in conditions ideal for their art, the big names dominate the best leader board a major championship has seen for a long time. We are used to Nick Faldo and Bernhard Langer and Fred Couples and Greg Norman and Nick Price making their way up there eventually. But when, if ever, have they done so this early and all together? 'The course is playing tough and that's why the best players are all bunched at the top,' Norman said. Norman is among the mentally scarred artists who have suddenly discovered that they can think more clearly again. Their taut facial muscles have softened, their smiles have returned, and we shall remember the small footnotes that people like Mark Calcavecchia and Severiano Ballesteros have made in this championship. Who among the 28,000 spectators who risked fractured limbs on Thursday walking along rolling hills made treacherous underfoot, will forget the vivid reminder of the Spaniard's wizardry as he remembered how it felt to be young again? But the lord of the links remains Faldo. Yesterday he became the sixth player and the first at Sandwich to score 63 in an Open. His course record gives him a one shot lead from Langer with Norman and Couples a further stroke behind. 'This is as good as it gets,' he said. Ben Hogan once said that four perfect shots was as near as he ever got to a perfect round. The Hoganesque Faldo recalled four yesterday, most notably a 50 yard chip-in for a birdie at the 14th, and a raking two iron that set up the last of his eight threes. And so the number one and two ranked golfers in the world - Faldo and Langer  - will be paired together in the final group out today in the game's most prestigious event. What added to all the delight was the stark contrast to the sense of foreboding that existed on the eve of the Open. Players rarely moan in advance about conditions. There's no sense in placing yourself two down mentally before striking a ball in earnest. But the fairways at Royal St George's do not roll gently in front of a player as they do, say, at Muirfield or Birkdale. They are covered in small pimples of turf and when these are baked motorway hard by months of hot sun then the element of chance rises to unhealthily significant proportions. And then there are the blind shots. Norman, who stands 6ft 2in tall, reckons there are 14. Asking a player to hit a blind approach shot and, oh, pitch it 40 yards short to take account of the wind and the scorched earth and then hope for a kind bounce places fate far too highly up the list of questions that a prospective Open champion should be required to answer. The rain changed all that, and yesterday's stiff westerly breeze gave the game's artists all the further encouragement they needed. Langer and Couples, two players who easily fall within that definition, were the first players to make their presence felt yesterday. This was a tad surprising since on Tuesday, Couples had said he had no chance of winning, and on Wednesday Langer said that he had little chance either. Couples admitted that sloth had got the better of him. He used to be a couch potato in his college days until his wife, Debbie, gave him the proverbial kick up the backside. But Debbie hitched up her mini-skirts last year and moved on and Fred has been buried ever since in divorce paperwork and re-runs of old American television sit-coms. 'With everything that's been going on, I've just been a bit lazy,' he said. The Open was to be merely the start of a return to serious competition, but the American possesses a natural talent that borders on the outrageous and so removing the layers of rust is not the problem it might have been for others. Birdies tended to come in pairs for Couples yesterday: At the second and the third, for example, and at the 12th and the 13th. At the 16th he had an 8ft birdie putt that brought the course record of 64 within his compass. But he missed it and dropped shots at the 17th and the 18th holes. Still, he finished with a 66, and an eminently useful six under par total. Not bad for someone with no chance. Langer arrived at an official function on Tuesday evening, looking like someone had strapped a plank of wood to his back. He said that his neck was still troubling him and his ball striking was not as he would like and so naturally everyone who likes a bet and who possessed this inside knowledge put large amounts of money on him. In every great golfer there is the touch of the hypochondriac. Hence the cliche: beware the injured golfer. A piece on this Open without mentioning John Daly, the man who has given new meaning to the phrase: daily papers? That would be a novelty. It would also be wrong. The American hit a 66. And that included a double bogey six, with three putts from 4ft at the 17th. They even came out of the hospitality units, that for the first time in an Open have encroached along the 18th fairway, to watch him finish. And so to the final 36 holes. The week began with stories about Payne Stewart's enlarged heart. With so many good players in contention a big heart will be a heck of an asset tomorrow.</p>

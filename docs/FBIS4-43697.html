			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Anti-Mafia Commission Taking </F> Shape in Parliament"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 16 -- A new and more powerful  Parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission began taking shape in the  Lower House today with unanimous approval of legislation which  will now be sent on to the Senate for passage into law.    The judiciary authority of the commission, empowered to call  on the work of judiciary police officials "and all others for  cooperation, as deemed necessary," will be enhanced by allowing  the commission to set aside the official secrets act for matters  pertaining to the Mafia, the Camorra, the 'Ndrangheta or any  other criminal organization.    Thanks to an amendment tacked on to the bill by the House  Constitutional Affairs Committee, the official secrets act  cannot be made to prevail against Anti-Mafia Commission  investigations because the issues linked to Mafia-type organized  crime activities are now giving equal standing with "facts of  subversion in the constitutional sphere."    The commission will be made up of 25 Senators and 25 members  of the Lower House picked by the respective speakers on a  proportional basis so that the strength of the parliamentary  groups is reflected in the commission. The chairman will be  installed by both speakers following agreement on a name.    The basic duties of the Parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission  are to review legislation on organized crime, draft proposals  and keep close tabs on the Mafia and similar organizations. The  commission reports on its work to the full Parliament at least  once each year and at any other time as required.    Among the powers of the commission are those of conducting  hearings for taking testimony and depositions, issuing subpoenas  for reports and documents on investigations in course and  establishing which reports or documents must remain in the realm  of judiciary secrecy.    A witness found guilty of perjury in testimony given to the  commission comes under the criminal law provision which carries  a sentence of from six months to three years in prison for this  crime. The same sentence can be passed on those found guilty of  violations of official secrecy applied by the commission to  investigation documents.    Handling coordination of the judicial powers of the  commission and law enforcement services are one or more  magistrates and one or more Interior Ministry officials, named  respectively by the Justice and Interior Ministries, who sit on  the commission.    The commission's staff and premises are made available by  the  speaker of the Lower House and the bill for running the body is  shared equally by the two houses.    Commenting on Lower House approval of the legislation, MP  Tiziana Parenti, a magistrate and in the running for the chair  of the commission, spoke out on the need for a "firm response  from the institutions to the renewal of Mafia attacks on the  state."    Parenti was apparently referring to the spectacular jail  break Tuesday [14 June] of a Mafia boss detained in Padua,  sprung at dawn by four men dressed as Carabinieri policemen, and  the latest in a string of firebombings of Progressive and  Democratic Party of the Left quarters in Sicily which came early  this morning.    A Progressive candidate for the post, Pino Arlacchi, said,  "We are not concerned with arguments about the validity of  state's witnesses and on less-harsh prison regimes. We are  worried by the actions of the Mafia which seem to have been  renewed with vigor in these days."    The head of the Forza Italia caucus, Raffaele Della Valle,  said the amendment on the state secrets act "sends an important  signal to the nation because this shows that the government  looks at the Mafia as the anti-state."    In this connection an MP for Communist Refoundation cited  what he said was the danger of "re-forging relations between the  Mafia and the state" and declared, "Let's remember that before  Falcone and Borsellino were killed by explosives, they had been  slain by isolation," with reference to leading anti-Mafia  magistrates murdered in 1992.</p>

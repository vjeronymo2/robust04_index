			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Losses deepen at Boise Cascade BOISE CASCADE, the US forest products group, remained in the red during the first three months of 1992, reporting an after-tax loss of Dollars 42.9m. This compares with a Dollars 16.8m deficit in the same period a year earlier. Sales fell from Dollars 992.7m to Dollars 953m. Boise, based in Idaho, blamed 'severely depressed prices' for some of its key paper grades for the loss. It said that prices for most grades of pulp and paper were down on a year ago, while prices for its most important products fell 'substantially' from already-depressed fourth quarter levels. This latter category includes coated and uncoated business and printing papers and newsprint. Boise Cascade shares closed down Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 20 7/8 . International Paper, another of the large US paper and packaging companies, reported first-quarter profits after tax of Dollars 102m. Superficially, this appeared to be a considerable improvement on the first-quarter loss of Dollars 87m last year  - but the 1991 figure was struck after a one-off accounting charge. The underlying 1991 figure stood at Dollars 128m. Like Boise, International Paper cited declining printing and writing paper prices as the principal reason for the fall in underlying profits. However, it added a more optimistic note as well, saying that first-quarter profits from distribution and specialty products, and from timber and wood products had improved year-on-year.</p>

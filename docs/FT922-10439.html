			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK interest rises in E German companies BRITISH companies have risen to the top of the pack of foreign investors in east Germany, buying 66 companies since 1990, according to the Treuhand privatisation agency. However, French companies retained their lead by size of investment, promising to commit DM2.3bn (Pounds 780m) to their east German acquisitions. British companies were second, at DM1.5bn (Pounds 510m), and the Swiss third at DM657m (Pounds 223m). At the end of last year the Treuhand reported that British investors had bought only 26 of the east German companies on its books, putting them in third place after France and Switzerland, which had acquired 44 and 42 respectively. Although there has been some direct growth in acquisitions by the UK, most of the change in the league table is accounted for by a change in the Treuhand's criteria. The agency had previously ignored companies with partial British ownership and has now decided to include them. UK companies said they would guarantee nearly 14,000 jobs in their east German takeovers, second to the French who promised to guarantee 14,743 jobs, said the Treuhand. US companies have bought only 19 east German companies but pledged investments of DM1.5bn (Pounds 510m). Japanese companies, however, have been prominent by their absence.</p>

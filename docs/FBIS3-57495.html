As was expected, the meeting was held behind  closed doors.    Boris Fedorov left the president just 15 minutes later. Some  30 minutes after that, Boris Fedorov gave an exclusive interview  to IZVESTIYA and INTERFAX correspondents. But first of all he  suggested that we study the statement he had formulated as soon  as he arrived back from the Kremlin.    "My position (refusal to join the government) has nothing to  do with personal reasons," the document says. "It cannot be  right to include in the cabinet or to retain in their previous  jobs people who have caused colossal economic and political  damage to the state, people who are the main and overt opponents  of the reforms policy. I cannot agree with the policy  turnaround which was recently formulated by the premier and is  being implemented in practice. This includes the refusal to  combat inflation; the intention to increase emission by at least  60 percent in relation to the plan in the first quarter alone;  and the predominance in the cabinet of the lifeless and ignorant  ideology of the State Planning Committee and the red economic  managers. `Ukrainianization' has crossed the Russian border.    "At the same time it is still not too late to halt the  slide.  I appeal to the president: Boris Nikolayevich! An economic  coup is taking place in the country, a backward slide, you are  our only hope. The issue here is not just Fedorov, who is  always ready to return and fight for Russian interests to the  bitter end; the issue is the future of the country which is  being decided right now, as we speak. At the same time nobody,  I hope, has any illusions that the economy is separate from  politics."    [Kononenko] Boris Grigoryevich, how did your meeting with  the president go?    [Fedorov] The president confirmed his offer of the post of  finance minister, saying that he trusts me and has no complaints  about my performance, and stressing that the formation of a  government is a lengthy process and nobody in the government  lasts forever, including Gerashchenko. But since the terms for  joining the government were the same as before, I refused,  saying that I could not work with political enemies.    [Kononenko] Who do you mean?    [Fedorov] Gerashchenko primarily. I am not particularly  concerned about Zaveryukha. He is just the kolkhoz lobby's  spokesman. The main reason for my refusing a portfolio in the  government as it presently stands is that I did not have  sufficient powers to implement my financial policy. The  president disagreed with my arguments, saying: "Do not drift  away." I do not intend to drift away. I will not leave the  country. I will work in the State Duma.    [Kononenko] What is your opinion -- why did the expected  compromise over your appointment not materialize?    [Fedorov] As premier, V. Chernomyrdin is entitled to form  his team. And all the indications are that the president has  not foisted his will on him. I have not spoken with the premier  since last Saturday [22 January].    [Kononenko] So V. Chernomyrdin needs V. Gerashchenko more  than he needs B. Fedorov?    [Fedorov] It would seem so. And this shows that an economic  coup is taking place in the country.    [Kononenko] In your view, where is all this leading?    [Fedorov] All government statements forecast inflation.  This will mean a fall in the population's living standards. At  a time when such enormous rates of inflation are already being  forecast, there is no way production will pick up. Without a  doubt, isolationism will gather strength and attempts to peg the  ruble exchange rate to other foreign currencies will get  nowhere. The present government has far fewer administrative  levers that former Premier Ryzhkov had at his disposal. We will  see the bitter fruits for real in May or June, and social  tension will increase sharply by the fall.    [Kononenko] Is it possible that V. Shcherbakov will fill the  finance minister's post?    [Fedorov] I believe this will be ruled out since he is not a  financier. He does not have his own program. I think they will  opt for the gentler scenario of appointing S. Dubinin, my first  deputy.    If I am elected to any organ in the State Duma, I will work  there, but generally speaking we need a "shadow cabinet of  ministers" which will monitor the government's actions and put  forward its own ideas for resolving state problems. Of course,  the economy cannot be extricated from crisis by financial policy  alone, long-term work in other spheres also needs to be done.  But in order for this to happen, we need a new Cabinet of  Ministers since the present government is amorphous and has been  unable to refrain from ruining the budget, B. Fedorov stressed  in conclusion.</p>

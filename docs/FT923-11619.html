			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Investments boost Bankers Trust BANKERS Trust yesterday reported an 11 per cent improvement in second-quarter profits to Dollars 205m, making it the second-best quarter in the New York banking group's history. Return on equity for the three months was 26 per cent. Mr Charles Sanford, chairman (pictured right), said every leading business line contributed to the strong quarter, but he gave a special mention to the record-breaking performance of the bank's global capital markets operations, which use financial derivatives to provide clients with risk management services. Bankers Trust said strong worldwide demand for the banks' traditional derivatives products - such as interest rate, currency and equity swaps and options - lifted trading revenue, which comprises both client-related and proprietary business, to Dollars 335m, up from Dollars 329m in the same quarter a year ago. Earnings from fiduciary and fund management rose sharply in the quarter, climbing 28 per cent to Dollars 180m following higher revenues from asset management activities, particularly performance-based foreign exchange funds management for institutional clients and private banking services. Fees and commissions rose Dollars 12m to Dollars 137m, with corporate finance fees receiving a lift from demand for securities underwriting. Bankers Trust is one of only two US banks - JP Morgan is the other - allowed by regulators to underwrite and deal in US securities. Net interest revenue rose 29 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 252m, thanks to a big rise in interest-earning assets and an improved interest rate spread. Non-interest expenses increased 9 per cent to Dollars 589m. Provision for credit losses in the April-to-June period was Dollars 75m, compared with Dollars 52m a year ago, and Bankers Trust's net charge-offs totalled Dollars 109m, the bulk of which was related to non-refinancing country loans. On the New York Stock Exchange Bankers Trust's shares rose Dollars  5/8 to close at Dollars 61 1/4 .</p>

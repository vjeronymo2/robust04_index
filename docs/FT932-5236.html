			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: ENI plunges L815bn into the red ENI, the Italian state energy holding group, swung to a consolidated net loss of L815bn (Dollars 558m) in 1992 from a net profit of L1,081bn in 1991, agencies report from Milan. The losses came despite forecasts by Mr Franco Bernabe, ENI's managing director, in January that the group would show a profit. Gross operating profit edged up by 4 per cent, to L9,870bn from L9,510bn, on revenues down 2 per cent to L49,780bn from L50,880bn. Financing and exchange rate costs amounted to L2,500bn, up from L2,000bn in 1991, while there were extraordinary losses of L1,400bn against L54bn of profits in the previous year. ENI said its basic industrial activities produced a profit of L1,250bn while the energy sector generated a profit of L3,500bn. But losses from its non-core businesses, mainly chemicals, had risen to L2,065bn from L1,165bn in 1991. ENI described the situation in the chemicals sector as 'very grave'. Resolving the crisis required selling off businesses in which the group could no longer invest, and the closing or restructuring of activities in loss, it said.</p>

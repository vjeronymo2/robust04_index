The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year  address defined this year as an agriculture-first year and put  forward a task to concentrate efforts on the agricultural  production.    Last year the agricultural working people in Pyongwon County  did farming on a scientific and technical basis as demanded by  the chuche method of farming, thus producing 40,000 more tons of  grain than in the preceding year. They are concentrating on  farming preparations, having set themselves the high goal of  topping last year's harvest by 30,000 tons this year in which  falls the 30th anniversary of the publication of the rural  theses (February 25, 1964).    The county overfulfilled its plan of compost production, a  part of farming preparations for this year, on January 20 and  has carried most of it out to the paddy and non-paddy fields.    All preparations for sowing seed rice on cold-frame beds  including windbreak fence, humus soil and high-yield seeds have  been completed in the main on the cooperative farms in the  county.    The repair and readjustment of tractors and  rice-transplanting, rice seedling-plucking, weeding and other  farm machines is being hastened at the final stage.    The county carried out the cleaning of two hundred odd  kilometre- long waterways and the repair and readjustment of  hundreds of water pumps, electric motors, and transformers 20  days ealier than last year.    Meanwhile, the Pyongwon automobile parts factory, the  Pyongwon garment factory and other factories and enterprises in  the county have manufactured a number of minor farm implements  and sent them to cooperative farms.    In recent few days the county secured 671,000 pieces of  minor  farm implements of 106 kinds and quantities of farming materials  through an all-people campaign.</p>

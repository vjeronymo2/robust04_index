His professional biography began with the position of  reviewer in the Far East Department of the USSR Ministry of  Foreign Affairs in 1968. He then worked for several years as  part of the permanent mission of the USSR at the United Nations  in New York. In the period 1983-1988 he was first secretary and  then counselor at the USSR Embassy in Japan. At the end of the  1980's he worked at the Pacific and Southeast Asia Desk in the  USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in the period 1990-1992,  as chief of the desk. Prior to his appointment as deputy  minister of foreign affairs, he was ambassador of Russia in the  Republic of Korea. His diplomatic rank is ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary. He is a candidate of  historical sciences.    This year will be the year of Asia for the Russian Ministry  of Foreign Affairs, Aleksandr Panov, deputy minister of foreign  affairs of the Russian Federation, declared in an interview with  our SEGODNYA correspondent. Russian diplomacy is setting itself  the assignment here not only of maintaining good-neighbor  relations with all Asian countries but also of becoming an  active part of the economic life of the region and contributing  to ensuring that Asia become a region of stability, security,  and cooperation. An extensive program of exchanges of visits is  planned. The minister of foreign affairs and then the chairman  of the PRC, the president of the Republic of Korea, and the  prime minister of India are expected in Moscow this year, and  visits by the Vietnamese and Mongolian prime ministers are  possible. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Government of the  Russian Federation, will head for Beijing in June, and a Russian  delegation will take part in an ASEAN ministerial session in  Bangkok in July. The deputy minister observed that greater  attention to the rapidly developing region has come to be paid  by Russian private business, Far East business particularly. The  new commercial structures are accounting for up to 50 percent of  commodity turnover in trade with certain Asian countries.  According to Aleksandr Panov, Russia could not export such a  quantity of finished goods to any other region of the world.    The Russo-Japanese consultations at deputy foreign minister  level which were held in Moscow recently, the diplomat said,  showed that "quickly arriving at a peace treaty" and,  consequently, resolving the territorial problem were impossible  under the current conditions. The parties understand this and  intend in the immediate future to concentrate on specific  questions in order to gradually create a "new atmosphere" in  bilateral relations. In the course of the consultations it was  arranged, as we all know, that Tsutomo Hata, minister of foreign  affairs of Japan, would visit Moscow in March. As was to be  understood from the statements of Mr. Panov, no breakthroughs  are to be expected from this visit.    To the correspondent's question as to how the Japanese side  is reacting to Moscow's proposals concerning joint economic  activity in the "Northern territories," the deputy minister  responded that "the Japanese are giving our position a guarded  reception": Joint ventures on the South Kurils must observe  Russian legislation, and this, from Japan's viewpoint, is a  violation of Japan's sovereignty. Mr. Panov disagreed that the  numerous violations of Russia's border by Japanese fishermen  were being perpetrated for political reasons and with the direct  support of Tokyo officialdom. The border incidents, the diplomat  declared, are explained primarily by economic factors. Moscow is  raising the question of fishing in the area of the Kuril chain  in strict terms, nonetheless, it is obvious that an economic  solution needs to be found. A version of such a solution is  already being applied in the area of Signalnyy Island, where the  Japanese have obtained the right to procure sea kale on a  compensation basis.    Things are comparatively better with respect to observance  of  the moratorium on fishing in the central Sea of Okhotsk. This  area is not part of Russia's economic zone but Russia deemed it  possible to announce last year a unilateral moratorium in  connection with the fact that the reduction in the stocks of  pollock had reached crisis point. At the present time neither  Japan and nor South Korea are fishing, and China has reduced it  25 percent and is prepared to examine the question of  compensation, that is, the exchange of this area for another  within Russia's economic zone. This leaves Poland, which is  agreeing to no restrictions.    Aleksandr Panov is not disposed to dramatize the fact of  Russia's nonaccession to the Prevention of Pollution of the Seas  Convention. Moscow and Tokyo are conducting negotiations on  assistance in the utilization [utilizatsiya] of Russia's liquid  radioactive waste, specifically, the financing of the  construction of a repository for such waste. Until there is a  repository, there will be no further disposals, which has been  stated clearly.    But the most serious problem of the region is undoubtedly  the  DPRK's nuclear program. It is being complicated by Pyongyang's  hard-line negotiating position, Mr. Panov said. The North Korean  side is endeavoring to compensate each positive step on its part  with return concessions by Washington. As a result a specific  situation has been created, the deputy minister observed. On the  one hand inspections of nuclear facilities are the prerogative  of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Authority], on the  other, the DPRK is preferring to negotiate on this topic with  the Americans. But there is a "third angle" also: the  North-South negotiations on denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula. Untangling this knot is not easy, Mr. Panov said.  Moscow, he declared, occupies a balanced position. The Sarajevo  example has shown that a positive result cannot be achieved with  ultimatums. Power politics will produce nothing in the East:  History testifies that these countries are capable even in a  difficult situation of sustaining quite strong political  pressure. If, despite all the diplomatic efforts, the question  is put to the UN Security Council for consideration, Russia will  act circumspectly there also.    The Russian-North Korean intergovernmental agreement on the  basis of which from 15,000 to 20,000 lumberjacks of the DPRK  have been working at Khabarovsk Kray and Amur Oblast timber  industry enterprises expired on 1 January. In this connection  the SEGODNYA correspondent asked about the future of this  document and, most importantly, about the legal status of the  Korean timber industry enterprises, which are known for their  mass violations of human rights. The agreement, the deputy  minister observed, has expired and is operating now only "within  a particular framework." But dropping it altogether would not  seem possible: The local authorities maintain that they have no  one with whom to replace the Koreans. A new negotiating  position, with which we will resume negotiations in the very  near future, is being shaped in the government at this time. In  any event, whatever the economic agreements, the state within a  state and the ex-territoriality of the Korean settlements have  been done away with, was Aleksandr Panov's assurance.    The deputy minister commented on the reports of President  Yeltsin's recent message to Indonesian President Suharto. The  message, Mr. Panov reported, had been preceded by an appeal to  Russia on the part of a number of members of the Nonaligned  Movement proposing that it join the movement as an observer.  Moscow deemed the proposal flattering and expedient. It is this  that was the subject of Yeltsin's message sent to Suharto, as  the present chairman of the Nonaligned Movement. According to  the movement's charter, a member of the Security Council may not  be a member, but is entitled to apply for observer status.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters You Xiayin (3266 1115 5419) and Gan Zhebin </F> (3927 0772 2430): "Lu Ping, State Council Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office Director, Indicates That for the British To  Spread the Idea That Hong Kong's Government Structure Will Not  Terminate After 1997 Is To Mislead Public Opinion"]    [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Lu Ping,  director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State  Council, noted here today that the British side is trying to  mislead Hong Kong people by spreading the view that the  three-tier constitutional framework the British Hong Kong  Government is going to set up will not be terminated after 1  July 1997.    In response to a question raised by a reporter in a special  television program today, Lu Ping said: Britain's publication  of a white paper to unilaterally give its account of the  Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong constitutional system  indicates that the British side, on the one hand, is adopting a  non-cooperative attitude toward China in the coming three and a  half years, and on the other hand, is trying to make the  three-tier councils established on the basis of its own  constitutional reform package a fait accompli.    Lu Ping pointed out: The British Hong Kong Government's  three-tier councils are bound to be short-lived. District  boards, the Urban Council, and the Regional Council, as well as  the Legislative Council, all will be terminated on 30 June 1997.  We hope the British side will no longer indulge in any illusion  in this regard. Lu Ping reiterated that China always means what  it says, so by 1 July 1997 China surely will "set up another  stove" in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law.    Talking about the progress the Chinese side has made so far  in "setting up another stove" under the present circumstance, Lu  Ping said: The Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the  Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administration  Region must step up its operation. The members of the PWC all  feel the heavy workload, and they unanimously agree to speed up  the working pace of the PWC. As for the "stove," the design of  it is already there in the Basic Law. Our task now is to set up  the "stove" by 1 July 1997 following the design laid out in the  Basic Law. And what the PWC is going to do is to implement  properly the provisions in the Basic Law, and to strive to  ensure a steady transition and to maintainthe prosperity and  stability of Hong Kong through 1997, given Britain's policy of  non-cooperation.</p>

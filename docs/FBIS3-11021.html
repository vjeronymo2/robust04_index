			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 11 Mar (EFE) -- Luis Caceres Velasquez --  former mayor of Arequipa, the second-largest city in Peru --  today announced his decision to run for the presidency of his  country in the 1995 general elections as a candidate for the  independent movement "Peru in the Year 2000" [Peru al 2000].    Caceres is the first candidate to officially announce his  intention to run for the presidency in next year's presidential  and legislative electoral campaign.    The former mayor said he has several names to include on his  list of congressional candidates and already has the name of two  vice presidents who will run on his presidential ticket. He  declined, however, to reveal their names.    He pointed out that everyone is entitled to become a  candidate to govern the country and that he is not concerned  about the possibility that President Alberto Fujimori, whom the  Constitution allows to be reelected, and former UN Secretary  General Javier Perez de Cuellar might decide to present their  candidacies too.    Fujimori often has reiterated that he still has not thought  about the possibility of running for reelection. Nonetheless,  opposition members believe he surely will. Perez de Cuellar,  however, has recently said it is still too early to decide on a  possible candidacy.    Caceres Velasquez was mayor of Arequipa, 1,025 km south of  Lima, for two consecutive terms. In the January 1993 municipal  elections he was a candidate for mayor of Lima, but another  independent candidate -- Ricardo Belmont -- won.</p>

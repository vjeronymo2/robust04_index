			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE CONCERT COSTS UNDER FIRE  </P> <P> In an effort to save money, a Garden Grove official has urged the city to  replace subsidized performances by the Garden Grove Symphony with free concerts  by military bands.  </P> <P> However, a military spokesman says regulations prohibit Navy bands from  competing with civilian groups.  </P> <P> Council member Robert F. Dinsen was the lone dissenter when the council  recently voted 4 to 1 to allocate $16,000 to support the orchestra's fifth  annual free summer concert on the Village Green, Aug. 19. At that July 24  meeting, Dinsen asked the city staff to explore the possibility of using  military bands to play future concerts in the park at no cost to the city.  Dinsen also opposed an additional $14,000 to support the orchestra for the  fiscal year which began July 1.  </P> <P> Twice in the past two years, military groups have presented free concerts at  the Don Walsh Auditorium, said city spokesman John Bushman. Both the U.S. Navy  Band, based in Washington, and the Commodores, the Navy's jazz ensemble, came  to the city, Bushman said.  </P> <P> "If we can get them for free, and if people enjoy them, why should we waste  $16,000?" Dinsen wondered in an interview. The councilman, who opposes all  municipal support for the arts, including the annual Grove Shakespeare  Festival, complained that the Garden Grove Symphony's overhead has grown too  much.  </P> <P> "They use too many union musicians," he said. "They're overloaded with  professionals."  </P> <P> However, according to Chief Petty Officer Stephen Evans, a spokesman for the  U.S. Navy Band in San Diego, military groups are prohibited from replacing an  organization of professional musicians.  </P> <P> For one thing, Evans said, military bands are "limited to (performing)  patriotic programs as opposed to pure entertainment." More specifically, Evans  said, the Navy's manual of public policy states that "military musicians will  not be placed nor place themselves in competition with civilian musicians."  Replacing the orchestra in Garden Grove concerts, Evans said, appeared to fall  into that category.  </P> <P> Union and orchestra officials said they were not opposed to military concerts  in the city.  </P> <P> "I have no argument with anything that doesn't replace a paid performance,"  said Robert W. Stava, secretary treasurer of Orange County Musicians Assn.,  Local No. 7, which represents members of the Garden Grove Symphony.  </P> <P> Yaakov Dvir-Djerassi, marketing director for the orchestra, said that, while  "there is nothing wrong with a military band coming down here . . . I think the  city should always take pride in their own creativity -- the (Grove)  Shakespeare Festival, the Gem Theatre and the symphony -- the unique things  that the town has to offer."  </P> <P> The total cost of the Village Green concert, Dvir-Djerassi said, is $27,000.  The orchestra will pay the difference.  </P></p>

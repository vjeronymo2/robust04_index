			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium users look forward to end of EC import tariff ALUMINIUM USERS who have been campaigning long and hard for the removal of the European Community's 6 per cent tariff on imports of the metal are hoping that the barrier will at last disappear - along with those imposed by other countries on many non-ferrous metals - if the present Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks comes to a successful conclusion. Any change would receive a mixed reaction in Europe where the local aluminium producers are split in opinion about the tariff, but it would be warmly welcomed by by aluminium users and fabricators. The case for removal was expounded recently by Mr David Humphreys, an economist at the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining group. He pointed out that, although Europe was the world's second-largest aluminium producer, it was now importing about a quarter of its requirements. European integrated aluminium producers were likely to continue to focus more on their downstream activities - particularly on packaging - and to place their new primary production capacity in those parts of the world outside Europe where low-cost energy was available, Mr Humphreys told a meeting of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy in London. Already Austria Metall, Hoogovens, Pechiney and VAW between them had 446,000 tonnes of annual production in Australia and Canada. Mr Humphreys said Europe should retain a core of primary smelting operations, based on its larger, newer plants - particularly those away from population centres using hydro-electric power. It was even possible that some new capacity would be installed in Norway and Iceland, while France would retain substantial capacity, partly because of the need for Pechiney, the world's technical leader in aluminium smelting, to have a test bed for its technology. Nevertheless, he said, the trends were leading to 'an end to a Eurocentric view of primary (aluminium) supply and with it will also go the justification for a protectionist import tariff. 'Europe is now a major net importer of aluminium and the interests of its consumers and of its fabricators are best served by access to low cost raw materials.' Some European producers still argue, however, that they need the tariff because so much aluminium production elsewhere in the world is heavily subsidised, in one way or another, by governments. They also point out they are struggling to cope with an unprecedented and sudden surge of aluminium exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States, which has caused turmoil in the market and sent prices crashing. RTZ's Mr Humphreys warned that CIS imports increasingly looked like a structural change to western supplies, rather than a transitory phenomenon. But he suggested that, if this was the case, present attempts to block them would no longer be a rational response. 'Complaints that the displacement of clean western production by dirty CIS production is environmentally unsound, while true, ignore the underlying economic realities. Although exports from the CIS may fall as a result of production difficulties or as more metal is retained for domestic use, the CIS has an undeniable comparative advantage in energy costs,' he added.</p>

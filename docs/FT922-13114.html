			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: BHP wins final go-ahead to buy NZ Steel NEW Zealand Steel, a company set up with government backing in the 1960s to give the country independence from British and Australian suppliers, was yesterday sold to one of its greatest rivals, Australia's BHP. New Zealand's Overseas Investments Commission became the final statutory authority to agree to the sale. Earlier approvals came from the New Zealand Commerce Commission and the Australian Trade Practices Commission. NZ Steel was established to take advantage of the country's ironsand and coal deposits. It was set up according to the then government's policies of saving overseas exchange, import substitution and creating employment. New Zealand became the world leader in developing high technology to convert ironsand to steel, and, helped by tariff barriers, the company became highly profitable. In 1981 the National Party government under Sir Robert Muldoon made steel production a 'Think Big' job creation project, and invested around NZDollars 2.5bn (USDollars 1.36bn) to enlarge the plant and make it a power in the Pacific region. However in 1984 the reformist Labour government earmarked the plant for early sale, did away with all tax and import protection, and injected NZDollars 1.5bn to make it saleable. After a number of bids, it was finally sold to Equiticorp in 1987. Equiticorp promptly fell into financial difficulties which it blamed on problems at NZ Steel and its merchant banking operations in Britain. In 1989, NZ Steel passed into the effective control of its greatest Pacific rival, BHP, a company which had fought ruthlessly to stop it becoming established. However statutory requirements prohibited BHP from owning more than 31 per cent of the ordinary shares. This requirement was lifted yesterday. The two New Zealand-based shareholders in NZ Steel, Fisher &amp; Paykel and Steel &amp; Tube - which is 49 per cent controlled by BHP - yesterday confirmed they would sell their respective 50 per cent holdings of ordinary shares to BHP. They had earlier sold their preference shareholdings. However, ANZ Banking Group, which has the remaining 19 per cent of NZ Steel, said it may continue as a minority shareholder. Mr Jeff Pitt, spokesman, said the bank was looking closely at the investment. Both Fisher &amp; Paykel, a founder of the company, and Steel &amp; Tube said they did not wish to invest more money at this stage. BHP paid NZDollars 13.8m for the ordinary shares and a further NZDollars 73.7m for the non-voting ordinary shares. BHP intends to invest substantially in the plant, which is meeting all performance standards and achieving record production. However the deep recession in New Zealand is forcing it to export around 70 per cent of its production to Australia and Asia.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: US storm damage The massive damage wrought by what are seen as the worst storms across the east coast of the US this century led to an initial marking down of a UK composite insurance sector buffeted in recent years by a series of natural disasters, capped by last year's Hurricane Andrew. But the markdown and ensuing selling pressure proved shortlived as insurance specialists concentrated instead on the likelihood that the latest disasters would trigger the long-awaited upturn in US insurance premiums. The performance of shares in the biggest US insurance groups when Wall Street opened gave credence to London's view that premiums would almost certainly be raised. General Re was up around Dollars 2 5/8 , Marsh &amp; McLennan 1 1/8 firmer and AIG over a point higher shortly after the US market opened. General Accident, whose US catastrophe reinsurance is triggered if losses rise above Dollars 40m, was seen as possibly the worst affected, and the shares settled 8 off at 589p. Royal, with a reinsurance trigger level of Dollars 25m, rallied sharply to end 9 ahead at 305p after an early fall to 293p. Commercial Union, with a reinsurance mark of Dollars 15m, managed a minor rise to 607p. Sun Alliance, which has negligible exposure to the US, rose 11 to 350p. Industrial group IMI, which reported a decline in profits, moved sharply forward, with the market cheered by the held dividend. The shares gained 11 at 270p in trade of 3.3m. In spite of an upbeat analysts meeting, many remained sceptical about the prospects for the current year and several moved to downgrade full year profit expectations. These Included Mr Sandy Morris at NatWest Securities, who trimmed his 1993 estimate by Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 71.5m. He blamed the cut on the continued weakness in the rest of Europe, where the company derives around 37 per cent of operating profits, and IMI's moderate exposure to the recovering US economy. The signing of a joint venture agreement for cigarette production in the Ukraine led to positive sentiment in BAT and the shares put on 8 at 956p. Transfer Technology continued to be the subject of strong demand, following the recent favourable figures. The shares added 33 at 558p. Vague hints of a sell recommendation for Gestetner left the shares 12 lighter at 118p. English China Clays rose 5 to 458p after reporting a maintained dividend. British Airways firmed 3 to 298p ahead of confirmation that its Dollars 300m investment into USAir has been cleared by the US government. Volume came to 3m shares. Bid talk returned to a generally positive property sector, with Hammerson once again the name touted as a possible target. However, one dealer suggested that a stock shortage in one type of the group's shares had triggered buying in the other as the two had moved apart, inflating the rise. By the close the ordinary shares had jumped 21 to 387p and the 'A's 26 to 361p. The building materials sector, among the market's worst performing areas last week, staged a good rally amid hopes of a cut in German interest rates. Wolseley moved ahead 17 to 583p, RMC 12 to 588p and Redland 10 to 455p. Second line store issues did some catching up after Friday's strong session for the leaders. T &amp; S Stores rose 5 to 164p, Amber Day 6 to 62p and Body Shop 6 to 190p. The decision by Argos to close its loss-making Chesterman furniture stores lifted the stock 9 to 295p. There was renewed bid talk around Geest and the shares jumped a further 12 to 480p. A US food group is rumoured to be on the prowl. Weekend press comment benefited Perkins Foods, up 7 at 113p, and United Biscuits, ahead 5 at 383p. A buy note from Paribas on Queens Moat Houses helped the shares advance 4 to 49p in turnover of 5.6m. The French-owned broker believes recent weakness to be overdone and that the stock is poised for recovery. Two small but loss-making leisure stocks, European Leisure and Whitegate Leisure, both moved back into the black. The former rose 1 1/4 to 5 1/2 p and the latter 5 to 27p. The recent run of big turnovers in Amstrad continued, with 11m traded yesterday as the stock gained 2 1/2 at 38p - its highest level since June last year. This week sees the expected launch of the company's latest new product, a 'personal digital assistant' computer. Delta advanced 9 to 444p following the maintained dividend, while GEC rallied after last week's slide and settled 6 1/2 ahead at 300p; Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management said it no longer had a notifiable interest in GEC shares. Shareholdings in excess of 3 per cent have to be made public, according to the Stock Exchange rules.</p>

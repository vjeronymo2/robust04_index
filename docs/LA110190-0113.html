			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN SAYS ARMED KILLER MADE HER HELP KIDNAP GIRLS  </P> <P> A woman accused of being the accomplice of a convicted murderer told jurors  Wednesday that he threatened to "blow my brains out" if she did not help him  kidnap two Chatsworth girls, one of whom he killed.  </P> <P> The woman, Marcia Lynn Ramos, 36, testified in her defense in San Fernando  Superior Court, where she is being tried on murder, kidnaping and six other  charges.  </P> <P> She said the killer, Roland Comtois, threatened her at gunpoint throughout the  Sept. 18, 1987, kidnaping. She said he became "crazy, angry and agitated" and  ordered her to lure the teen-agers into his motor home by asking them to help  start it.  </P> <P> "There was a crazy man standing behind me," Ramos told jurors. "He had a gun in  his hand. It was cocked. He said he would kill me if I didn't" ask the girls  into the motor home.  </P> <P> Ramos testified that at one point during the kidnaping, she planned to inject  Comtois with a lethal dose of cocaine after he told her to get a syringe out of  a cabinet. But she said she secretly dumped half the injection when he ordered  her to give the shot to one of the girls.  </P> <P> "I thought it was for him," Ramos said. "I wanted to overdose him."  </P> <P> Ramos, her voice at times choking with emotion, described how Comtois  terrorized her and the two girls, one of whom he sexually assaulted. Ramos said  the 90-minute kidnaping culminated in Comtois' putting the girls into an  abandoned station wagon and shooting them in the head. He killed Wendy  Masuhara, 14. The other girl survived because her upraised hand deflected the  bullet.  </P> <P> Ramos' testimony contradicted the prosecution's position that she voluntarily  initiated the kidnaping, and supported statements made by the surviving victim  shortly after the ordeal that Comtois threatened to kill Ramos.  </P> <P> Comtois was sentenced in July to die in the gas chamber.  </P> <P> Ramos said that after the shooting on remote Woolsey Canyon Road Comtois drove  the motor home to a dead-end, turned around and drove past the station wagon a  second time. He noticed that a door appeared to have been opened, Ramos said.  </P> <P> "That means somebody's found them," she said he told her. In fact the wounded  girl had walked down the road and had been taken by a passing motorist to a  hospital.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Concerns about the Agency's business processes generally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the quality of service in the disability claim process in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular, led SSA leadership to the conclusion that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability process reengineering effort was critical to the SSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goal of providing world-class service to its customers. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Performance Review, headed by the Vice President,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directed improvement of the SSA disability process as a key  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service initiative for the Federal government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Leading private sector organizations have used process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reengineering to identify and quickly put in place dramatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvements in their operations. The objective of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reengineering review is to fundamentally rethink and radically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesign a business process from start to finish, so that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> becomes many times more efficient and, as a result, significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improves service to the organization's customers. By focusing on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disability claim process as a single business process, SSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hoped to cut across the organizational lines and multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components that handle the many pieces of the disability process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Redesign Technique  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A project team composed of 18 Federal and State employees,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the direction of an SSA senior executive, assembled at SSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Headquarters in October 1993 to conduct the disability claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process reengineering review. With the guidance of an Executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Steering Committee the Team was challenged to fundamentally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rethink the way SSA processes disability claims. The Team's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial findings and proposal, issued in March 1994, for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesigned disability claim process were widely shared during a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60-day public comment period. Based on the comments received, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Team presented a revised proposal to the Commissioner of Social  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Security on June 30, 1994. After extensive consultation with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals and organizations in the internal and external  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability community, the Commissioner accepted the Team's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations for a redesigned disability process. A summary of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the methodology used to redesign the disability claim process is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in Appendix I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> New Process Goals and Expectations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commissioner established five primary objectives against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which SSA will measure the success of a redesigned disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim process:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The process is user friendly for claimants and those who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assist them;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The right decision is made the first time;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Decisions are made and effectuated quickly;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The process is efficient; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Employees find the work satisfying.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

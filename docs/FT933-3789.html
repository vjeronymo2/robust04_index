			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Signet Investors who have inflated Signet's share price must be gambling that the ugly duckling will eventually turn into a swan. Yet those who remember the company in its previous incarnation as Ratners may have their doubts. On any sensible criteria the shares have little value. There are no dividends or earnings to support a yield or a price earnings ratio, and preference share dividends are piling up unpaid. Given that some kind of capital restructuring lurks on the horizon, those who have been buying the shares look over-optimistic. The first half may not be a good guide to the year since the business is quintessentially seasonal, but the reduction of losses and cash flow is still painfully slow. Much of the cost-cutting which can be managed has already been done, and only a marked improvement in sales will restore profits. With jewellery purchases highly discretionary, that is as much dependent on the recovery in the economy as on management action or marketing flair. In that light the recent award of generous share options ought to raise a few eyebrows. Signet's managers are already well paid for the size of their business, and turning the operation round is largely a matter of common sense and hanging on. Even so, unless the scheme is adjusted to take account of any dilution on restructuring, it is hard to see managers benefiting. Perhaps the hope is that, if the share price rises enough, a rights issue will pay the rolled up preference dividends without diluting ordinary shareholders out of existence.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (8): The process is irreversible - Motor trading sets the pace for instant data swapping WHEN Karl Benz built the first motor car in 1885, a law was already in place in the UK requiring that a person should walk, carrying a red flag, in front of any car. The UK insurance business has historically had its own red flag for technological developments - an in-built suspicion. However, in the last five years this attitude has changed, radically in some cases. Some people within insurance have seen the need for the application of computers beyond just word processing or use of the odd spreadsheet. They have worked hard to promote electronic data interchange (EDI), and several initiatives have made progress in this direction. Electronic trading is the future for insurance, and it is likely that within the next few years the passage of insurance transaction information over computer networks will be as ubiquitous and unremarkable as the use of a motor car to get from A to B. Electronic trading of insurance requires the sending of standardised, structured information securely between the parties involved in the transaction - client, broker and insurer. Current initiatives aim to allow insurance quote, proposal, policy, claims, adjustment, renewal, accounting and other administration information to flow over networks between brokers and insurers. Limnet is one such initiative which involves the London insurance market. Within the UK there are parallel initiatives in the electronic trading of personal lines insurance - motor, household and life - and in commercial lines. As Mr Mike Anstee, director of electronic marketing at London &amp; Edinburgh Insurance, says: 'It is imperative for the market that we get EDI moving to get rid of both paper flows and the duplicate entry of data.' Motor business has forced the pace. A large boost to electronic trading was given by the Automobile Association, a leading motor insurance broker which is part of the BROKERNET EDI community comprising insurers, brokers, and International Network Services (INS) - the operator of the network over which the information flows. BROKERNET initially developed EDI standards for motor insurance, and the momentum required for the widespread adoption of these standards came largely because of the volume of business done by the AA. In September 1992 INS saw a flow across the network of around 400,000 electronic documents of a dozen different types. Around half of this flow involved 'new business' motor insurance transactions. Mr Colin Billinge, director of INS, argues that there are two encouraging signs. Firstly, initial resistance to the setting of standards has been overcome. Secondly, the phrase 'electronic trading' has become accepted within the insurance industry. Standards are vital to EDI but as Mr Billinge points out, 'standards for data interchange does not imply standardised insurance products'. Several electronic trading 'communities' are up and running. Systems companies such as Policy Master, Quotel, Misys, and North Park provide software for brokers' personal computers. The total number of computer terminals running such software has been estimated at around 8,000. Networks such as those operated by INS and IBM link to the insurers' computer systems. These systems allow a client to walk into a broker, see a motor quote, choose a policy, have a proposal and a cover note printed off, and for the information to be sent down the wire to the insurer. Account reconciliation between insurer and broker is also available. The next step is for EDI links to handle 'mid-term adjustments' (for instance, when a client changes car or address), renewals, and claims. EDI would then, for example, allow a broker to follow the progress of a claim by linking in to the relevant insurer's internal computer system. Household insurance is also in line for the EDI treatment, with the initial round of standards' definitions in train. In the life insurance sector electronic systems are still largely centred around videotext technology. However, developments here were boosted by the formation in early 1991 of The Exchange, a company funded by 20 leading UK insurers aimed at promoting electronic trading of many products - life insurance, mortgages and related products, pensions and annuities, investments and savings, health insurance. The Exchange has made much progress in bringing together interested parties. Commercial lines of insurance are less 'off-the-shelf' than personal lines, and this is reflected in the gradual and coherent approach taken to the electronic trading of these classes. More than 20 leading insurers and brokers set up a commercial lines market initiative (CLMI) in 1990. Following much development work a company, CLMI Ltd, was launched in August 1992. Mr Peter Foreman, managing director of Sun Alliance International, announced at the launch that accounting would be the first EDI priority, then electronic mail, claims and eventually the presentation of risk packages, at least in the easily rated classes of business. Mr Alan Waring, electronic marketing manager at Sun Alliance International, says that the two core objectives behind CLMI are increased efficiency and reduced costs. He adds: 'It was decided that managers within the insurance business would dictate progress rather than be led by the computer systems houses.' Early CLMI feasibility studies looking at data and work flows were followed by more detailed work in four areas - business requirements, technical requirements, data standards, organisation and funding. Mr Mike Anstee says CLMI has 'come a long way quite quickly considering what we are trying to do'. In April this year a CLMI report recommended progress in three phases. Firstly, the formation of CLMI and the election of a board. Secondly, the introduction of facilities for premium accounting, claims administration, electronic mail, and the presentation of simple risk packages. These phases are now under way. The third phase, envisaged as being two or three years away, is introduction of EDI facilities for quotations, policy wording and renewals. Mr Waring argues that the element of competitive difference between insurers must remain. The necessary setting of data standards required by EDI must not introduce inflexibility in products. The first phases of CLMI deal with practical solutions to backroom efficiency problems. For the next phase, 'it is necessary to work out how far the industry wants to introduce networking for trading'. Commercial insurers deal with more underwriting criteria than those in personal lines. If products become totally price-driven it will be more difficult to provide value added service. Mr Waring calls on the industry to address the question: how will a UK-wide network affect the shape and size of the commercial lines market? While EDI provides a tremendous amount of benefit in cost and efficiency terms, its use as a trading tool has to be assessed keeping in mind the potential to change the structure of the way business is done.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOSED MEETINGS BY COUNCIL-ELECT RULED LEGAL  </P> <P> The City Council-elect did not violate the state's open meetings laws by  excluding the public and press from some of its discussions, a Los Angeles  Superior Court judge ruled this week.  </P> <P> A local newspaper had filed suit against the city and the five council  members-elect -- who were elected March 7 and will be sworn in next Tuesday --  complaining that they had violated the Ralph M. Brown Act, which requires  elected officials to conduct virtually all business in public.  </P> <P> The San Gabriel Valley Daily Tribune was granted a temporary restraining order  on March 24, which compelled the council-elect to permit the public and press  to attend its meetings and provide 72 hours notice of the matters to be  discussed.  </P> <P> But on Monday, Judge Dzintra I. Janavs reversed this ruling, rejecting the  newspaper's request for a preliminary injunction on the grounds that the Brown  Act does not apply to elected officials who have not taken their oaths of  office.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Newspaper Disappointed  </P> <P> "Obviously, we're disappointed that she chose not to apply the Brown Act," said  Stephen Contopulos, the newspaper's attorney. "But we hope the council members  . . . will voluntarily subject themselves to the Brown Act."  </P> <P> Council members-elect this week hailed the ruling, but said they did not expect  it to have any effect on the proceedings during the final few days before  incorporation.  </P> <P> "I don't foresee any more meetings that wouldn't be open anyway," said Mayor  Pro Tem-elect Paul Horcher. An attorney, Horcher said he believed the judge's  ruling was consistent with the law. "The judge decided she would adjudicate and  not legislate."  </P> <P> As part of their defense, the council members-elect said they had been told by  Ruth Bennel, executive officer of the county Local Agency Formation Commission,  that they were not bound by the Brown Act until they are sworn in. The county  counsel has given the same advice to newly incorporating cities for more than  20 years, Bennel said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spirit of the Law  </P> <P> In its suit, the newspaper acknowledged that the law did not specifically cover  incorporating cities, but argued that the council had violated the "spirit" of  the Brown Act by discussing matters, such as the selection of a new mayor and  interim city manager, behind closed doors.  </P> <P> Janavs would not comment on her ruling.  </P> <P> The newspaper has not decided whether to pursue the matter further, Contopulos  said, but he called on legislators to change the law. "I think it's a real  problem the Legislature should address, because I think it clearly violates the  purpose of the act."  </P> <P> Mayor-elect Phyllis Papen said she hoped Monday's ruling would clarify the law  for the next city that incorporates. Papen stressed that the council never  sought to conceal its decision-making from the public.  </P></p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Perez firm on economy after attempted coup: Venezuelan president predicts growing support for government reforms THE Venezuelan president, Mr Carlos Andres Perez, sees no reason to backtrack on economic reform because of an attempted military coup two weeks ago and predicts support for his government will grow this year as the benefits of reform become apparent. Mr Perez said: 'We are at the point where the benefits are beginning to percolate all sectors of the society.' In an interview in his office in the battle-scarred Miraflores Palace, he said: 'There is no reason to delay any privatisation.' The government managed to complete a small hotel privatisation on February 5, the day after the attempted putsch. He said the coup was being planned before his administration came to power. However, public opposition to the economic programme might have led the coup leaders to believe that the climate was right to take over the government, he said. He admitted a lapse in the military intelligence system that failed to detect the planning of the coup. His government might not have taken sufficient notice of political opposition which had given the impression of 'immense discontent' in the country. He had ordered a significant restructuring of the armed forces, affecting not only personnel but also their general conditions. Officials close to the armed forces have said the military has been granted a 30 per cent pay rise, higher than the increase earlier planned. Although only a minority of the army backed the attempted coup, with the air force, navy and national guard remaining loyal, a deep investigation into its causes was none the less necessary. However, Mr Perez saw no need for a civilian defence minister in place of the traditional military one, despite there being no constitutional obstacle to such a change. Mr Perez renewed a call for a mechanism that would allow international armed intervention to restore democracy where a military coup had taken place. This would be important in Latin America where 'military coups have been frequent in history'. On the economy, he predicted that as his economic programme's benefits became more extensive, opposition to it from political parties would weaken. 'It will be difficult for the parties to deny this reality,' he said. His economic policy has been opposed in the Venezuelan Congress, in particular by his own Democratic Action party, throughout the three years of his administration. The president said that popular discontent over the programme was strongest, not among the poor as has been widely depicted, but among the middle classes. He admitted that this sector of society had suffered as a result of his economic programme, but defended it as necessary. Venezuela had been 'the most subsidised economy in the region', and an economy which was 'almost completely artificial'. He was pursuing a policy of 'rapprochement and dialogue' with the parties, and had invited them to take part in the preparation of new social programmes announced at the end of last year. The government was on the verge of completing negotiations over loan agreements with the World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank on a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn), five-year social programme to improve health and water supplies, education, child care and nutrition in poor areas. He said corruption in government - a cause of widespread discontent - had not been ended in Venezuela. But many measures taken by his administration had 'eliminated the discretion of the government to define relations in the commercial, industrial and economic life of the country'. These included the abolition of preferential exchange rates, import licensing and the introduction of a bidding process for public works. He defended the decision, criticised widely inside and outside the country, to censor the press in the days immediately after the coup attempt. This was not meant to curb freedom of expression, but was taken for military reasons, to prevent the spread of false information that could affect the morale of the armed forces. Since then, leading journals have agreed to exercise self-restraint and the curbs have been lifted. The president said he was armed with a machine-gun as he made his escape from Miraflores on February 4 to a television station. The coup attempt began to collapse after his broadcast to the country.</p>

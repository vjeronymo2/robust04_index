			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: RADJA SAYS CLUB IS READY TO LET HIM BE A CELTIC  </P> <P> Yugoslavian basketball star Dino Radja said Sunday he was determined to play  for the Boston Celtics next season, and that his home club had agreed in  principle to let him go.  </P> <P> Radja signed with the Celtics last year for $425,000, but the contract was  blocked by a U.S. federal judge, who said Radja had a valid professional  commitment with his Yugoslav team Jugoplastika.  </P> <P> "If the Celtics still want me, I'm ready to play for them next season," Radja  said.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-10 center said that even though his Yugoslav contract runs for two  more years, "Jugoplastika has in principle agreed to let me go this year."  </P> <P> Radja denied recent reports in the Yugoslav and Western press that he has  offered to continue playing for one more year for Jugoplastika, the European  champion, for $400,000.  </P> <P> "Such reports are simply not true," he said. "In Europe I can get five times  the amount given to me by the Celtics, but still I'm determined to join the NBA  team. Playing in the NBA represents a challenge for me."  </P></p>

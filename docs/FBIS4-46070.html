			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 21 May commentary: "No One Can Challenge Our </F> Work To Replace the Fuel Rods"]    [Text] Recently, the United States and its following forces  are once again strengthening the antirepublic oppressive  commotion by finding fault with the issue of replacing the fuel  rods at our five-megawatt experimental nuclear power plant  [sihom wonjaryok paljonso].    They are trying to drive the situation to an extreme  circumstance [kuktanui sanghwang] by saying that the nuclear  issue has entered a grave stage, that the replacement of our  fuel rods is a grave violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty [NPT] and the safeguards accord, that our issue must be  brought to the UN Security Council and sanctions implemented,  and so on because we started to replace the fuel rods. This is  a violent distortion of the facts, and tells us that the United  States and its following forces are persistently maneuvering to  crush [apsal] our Republic.    The issue of replacing the fuel rods at our five-megawatt  experimental nuclear power plant, is a natural consequence  resulting from the rupture of the DPRK-U.S. talks by the United  States.    In reality, up until now the United States had used the  DPRK-U.S. talks as a lever to realize its selfish goal by  strengthening its pressure on us. The United States created a  nuclear crisis and increased pressure on us inside and outside  the talks. Also, under the cloak of modernizing the U.S. forces  stationed in South Korea, it shoved in numerous military  equipment into South Korea, including the Patriot missiles and  Apache helicopters, for offensive use and obtained enormous  economic interests, and strengthened its military presence in  South Korea, which is a strategic point of Asia. On the other  hand, we are receiving a grave military threat from the United  States.    The third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks was disrupted. The  DPRK-U.S. agreement on changing the graphite-moderated reactor  system to light-water moderated reactor system have a long way  to go due to the betrayal act of the United States. Under this  circumstance, we could no longer indefinitely freeze the  operation of the graphite-moderated reactor system even by  suffering an enormous economic loss. Therefore, it was  inevitable for us to move toward the road of normalizing our  peaceful nuclear activities.    No one can pick a quarrel with the issue of replacing the  fuel rods at our five-megawatt experimental nuclear power plant,  even from the technology safety point of view.    The fuel rods in the five-megawatt experimental nuclear  power  plant were (?placed) in 1986. Since, we have delayed the  replacement of the fuel rods until now to provide a favorable  environment for the DPRK-U.S. talks. Today, a considerable  number of fuel rods have been damaged. In particular, due to  the damage of the ventilator, a situation was created in which  we had to stop the operation of the experimental atomic reactor  [sihom wonjaro].    As a result, a serious safety issue was put forth in the  operation of the experimental atomic reactor, and thus it became  inevitable to take out the fuel rods immediately.    Out of such urgency, we sent as many as five telex messages  to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] regarding the  replacement of fuel rods. In the telex messages, we called on  the IAEA to take necessary measures regarding this--such as  being present at the scene to seal and dismantle [haechae]  them--while informing in advance our plan on replacing the fuel  rods.    In addition, we explicitly clarified that in the event the  IAEA Secretariat did not take appropriate measures at the right  time, we would be compelled to recognize this as an action that  the IAEA has empowered us with the authority to break the seals  at appropriate (?spots) [kuromyonso kigusogigugi haedanghan  taechaegul chaettae chwihaji annungyongu haedang (?kaesoaeso)  ponginul ttel kwonhanul uriege puyohangosuro injonghalsubakke  optanungosul myongbaekhihayotta]. What is more, we agreed to  all the IAEA's demands on the witnessing activities, except  selective measurement of fuel rods because it is against our  unique stance, and immediately issued visas upon request.  However, the IAEA Secretariat unreasonably came out with  demands tantamount to irregular inspections [pijonggi sacharae  manmongnun yogurul murihagae tulgonawatsumyo] by babbling about  selective preservation of fuel rods and, thus, rejected the  witnessing, openly ignoring our unique status following the  temporary suspension of the effectuation of the withdrawal from  the NPT.    Under such circumstance, we, as means of last concession,  sent an emergency letter to the U.S. side writing that if our  unique stance was settled [haesodoemyon] now by bringing the  package deal between the DPRK and the United States to a  success, we could allow all regular and irregular  [chonggimitpijonggi] inspections -- including selective  preservation of some fuel -- even during the course of replacing  the fuel rods. Nonetheless, the United States also rejected  this proposal and did not respond to the talks with the DPRK.    Under such conditions, we could no longer delay the changing  of fuel rods due to technical safety reasons [kisul anjongsang  iyuro]. In view of this, the beginning of our work on replacing  fuel rods without the presence of the IAEA Secretariat's  inspectors was an unavoidable step entirely stemmed from the  IAEA's unreasonable acts. Such being the case, there is no  grounds for the United States and the IAEA Secretariat to say so  and so about our replacement of fuel rods.    Before picking on us, the IAEA Secretariat should reflect on  its acts in avoiding its obligation to guarantee the normal  nuclear activities of a member nation. It is an unbreakable  mission of the IAEA to go to the spot for confirmation and to  take necessary measures when an abnormal situation crops up in a  member nation.    Although we requested the agency to immediately take  appropriate measures, including a quick removal of the seals  under unavoidable circumstances, the IAEA Secretariat avoided to  be present in the replacement of the fuel rods for the reason  that we refused to meet their unilateral demand of being allowed  to choose and keep some of the replaced fuel rods. And it is  now raising quite a row, informing the member nations of the  agency's Board of Governors and the UN Security Council that we  unsealed the facilities and violated the NPT. This is obviously  a mean, conscienceless act unbecoming to an international  organization.    The U.S. action is also the same. If the United States had  responded to the DPRK-U.S. talks and brought a package deal to a  success as demanded by us, such complicated problems existing  now would have not even been raised from the beginning.    Nevertheless, the United States avoided the third round of  the DPRK-U.S. talks, ignoring problems put forth by us and  continuously persisting in unreasonable preconditions.  Therefore, for the United States to make an issue of the  replacement of our fuel rods now is the same as a thief turning  on the master with a club.    In particular, some officials in the United States are  currently stirring up the public opinion as if we were replacing  the fuel rods to extract plutonium to produce four to five  nuclear bombs. This is truly preposterous.    Unavoidably, we started the replacement of the fuel rods  without the presence of the IAEA, but we are working our best to  verify that the nuclear materials are not being diverted for  other non-peaceful purposes in the process of replacing the fuel  rods because of the consistent will to prove the innocence of  the peaceful nuclear activities.    The IAEA can never be allowed to choose and keep the fuel  rods before our special status is brought to an end. However,  this does not mean that the continuity of the safeguards would  be broken. The work of replacing our fuel rods is now going on  under the strict observation of the inspection cameras installed  by the IAEA and as soon as the fuel rods are taken out, they are  kept under the restriction and surveillance of the IAEA.    We are carrying out the work on replacing fuel rods in such  a  manner as to fully preserve the possibilities of measuring all  the replaced fuel rods when the nuclear issue is resolved in a  package deal and the partiality of the agency removed [urinun  appro haengmunjeui ilgwaltagyoli silhyondoego kiguui  pulgongjongsongi haesodoenun sichomegaso kyochedoen  modunyollyobongduladaehan chukchong kanungsongul chungbunuhui  pojonhanun panghyangeso nosimyollyojagobul chinhaenghagoitta].  This matter can be solved through negotiations between the DPRK  and the IAEA.    Nonetheless, some forces inside the United States are trying  to forcibly [okchiro] link our fuel rod replacement work with  nuclear development. This can only be seen as a childish plot  [yuchihan sulchaek] designed to find a justification to impose  sanctions on us by deliberately aggravating the situation. At  present, the attempt to justify its unreasonable argument with  any wild guess or assumption can never get through. The nuclear  issue should also seek a fair solution on the basis of the  reality, squarely seeing the reality.    The United States and the IAEA Secretariat must no longer  make mistakes in the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula but take a proper position for honestly solving the  issue.</p>

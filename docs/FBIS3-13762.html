JANA's international affairs editor has commented on those  reports saying: Such statements have revealed that the American  President was under pressures from the Jewish lobby in America.  It was the Jews who initiated the Whitewater scandal and they  implicated Clinton in it, and because of its repercussions,  which have increased his fears for his political future as  president, the American President is now trying to side fully  with them. However, the victims of such a support will be,  without any doubts, the Arabs, as usual.    The American President's announcement that he supported the  idea of Jerusalem as the united and eternal capital of the  Zionist entity was like a new Belfort [name as received]  Declaration, through which he who did not own gave to whom who  did not deserve. If the American President wanted to give  something to the Jews why doesn't he give them his wife,  Washington, or New York for example; Jerusalem is an Arab city  and he has nothing to with it.    JANA's international affairs editor wondered, however: Where  the Arabs were, at time they can see that their capitals were  being sold to or just given away in order to win the Jews'  amity? Where are those who have been singing pan-Arabism, Islam  praises, and lifting the banner of martyrdom at a time when they  can see Christians showing contempt to their holy places and  legitimizing their usurpation by the Jews?.    The editor added: The time to sort out who is who has  arrived  because matters have become clear; any Arab, who stands with  America, is an infidel. Arabs ought to carry out Jihad; they  have every right to martyrdom for the sake of their land and  their rights.</p>

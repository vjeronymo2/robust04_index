			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The president of Burkina Faso whom our reporter met  this morning sounded reassuring. Blaise Compaore, who traced  the background of the Dakar meeting which led to the devaluation  of the CFA franc, commented on the consequences of this measure  on Burkina Faso. Here is President Compaore, speaking to Rock  Patrice Ouedraogo.    [Begin recording] It is true that generally speaking the  devaluation will affect our debt. We will certainly have a  bigger debt to pay. It will affect household spending,  particularly certain goods which are consumed domestically but  which used to be imported and, surely, there will be the problem  of revamping the economy. But, generally speaking, with a  number of backup measures geared toward reducing debt,  preserving the industrial atmosphere, protecting the consumption  of essential commodities, and also with the support of the  international community in financing our investments and  programs and in some employment generating sectors, we believe  all this will restore a measure of credibility to our country.  This will particularly guarantee a higher national production  and put us in better position to export our products by,  naturally, boosting agricultural output. And, of course, there  will definitely be increased external investments. Domestic  savings was also one area identified as one that should offer  more support to our economies. In short, therefore, with all  these measures, coupled with a system of safeguarding what I  earlier referred to as the industrial atmosphere, we hope that  our economies will be put in a better position to face  international competition and sustain the welfare of our people.

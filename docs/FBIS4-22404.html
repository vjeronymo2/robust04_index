			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by unidentified correspondent: "Emigration Service </F> Created"]    [Text] "Emigration from Armenia is of an illegal nature.  This makes an exact calculation difficult," declared Minister of  State Rafayel Bagoyan at a meeting of the Supreme Soviet on the  same day. According to his words, during 1991-1993 approximately  300,000 persons emigrated from Armenia, NOYAN TAPAN reports.    The minister of state reported that the Ministry of Labor  and  Social Security has created an emigration service. It is  envisioned establishing a similar structure in the  Administration for Refugee Affairs also.</p>

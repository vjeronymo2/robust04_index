			<p>BFN     [Text] Thai Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong  Sunsiri, in his position as chairman of the ASEAN Standing  Committee, held a meeting with ASEAN foreign ministers on 1 June  while in Cairo to attend the 11th meeting of the Nonaligned  Movement foreign ministers. They discussed preparations for the  first ARF [Asian Regional Forum], to be held in Thailand in  July. The meeting acknowledged the convening of the ASEAN  foreign ministers meeting and the meeting with dialogue partners  in Bangkok in the same month. They also discussed the meeting  between ASEAN and the European Union in Germany in September and  the ASEAN summit in Bangkok in 1995.    Also on 1 June, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam  met with the Thai foreign minister to discuss preparations for  the ARF. Vietnam is pleased to have the opportunity to attend  the ARF and is ready to contribute to a successful meeting. The  SRV foreign minister felt that the agenda of the first meeting  of the ARF should be wide ranging and emphasize confidence  building. The meeting should also discuss Vietnam's ASEAN  membership. On this issue, the Thai foreign minister felt that  Vietnam will eventually become an ASEAN member, saying how soon  this happens depends on Vietnam's readiness.    The Thai foreign minister said Thai-Vietnamese relations  have  improved considerably, as evidenced by cooperation in many  areas, especially in the economic sphere. Both sides will  persuade Thai businessmen to invest more in Vietnam. The  Vietnamese foreign minister expressed a wish to receive more  visits by Thai royal family members. Princess Maha Chakri  Sirinthon and Princess Kanlani Watthana already paid visits to  Vietnam.    The Thai foreign minister informed his Vietnamese  counterpart  of the recent release of 14 Vietnamese fishermen from Thailand.  He expressed hope that Vietnam will release Thai fishermen now  detained in Vietnam at an appropriate time.    Regarding the meeting between the Thai foreign minister and  his Lao and Cambodian counterparts, Lao Deputy Foreign Minister  Souban Salitthilat called on the Thai foreign minister while in  Cairo to attend the NAM foreign ministers meeting. They agreed  that there are currently no problems in relations between their  countries. On the 13,000 Lao refugees remaining at Ban Na Pho  camp and 7,000 others at Phanat Nikhom camp, the Lao deputy  foreign minister, who is in charge of the Lao refugee issue,  said a meeting will be held between officials of Thailand, Laos,  and UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Chiang Saen District,  Chiang Rai Province, on 19 June. The Lao official also said the  Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge has helped boost relations and  contacts between the two countries and speeded up travel between  the two countries. There has been no problem arising from the  bridge.    Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut also  called  on the Thai foreign minister. He informed his Thai counterpart  about the Cambodian roundtable in Pyongyang, saying another  round is scheduled on 15 June in Phnom Penh. The Thai foreign  minister said that it might too optimistic to expect success in  only one meeting. Success may eventually materialize in future  meetings. He reiterated the Thai Government policy which  recognizes the legitimate Cambodian Government and intends to be  a good neighbor of Cambodia. He said the Thai Government and  armed forces will not provide any support to the Khmer Rouge.  He expressed the view that Cambodia will not be able to solve  its problem without earnest cooperation by all Cambodian  factions.    The Cambodian foreign minister informed his Thai counterpart  that King Norodom Sihanouk had approved credentials for the  Cambodian ambassador to Thailand, (Chang Roland). The new  ambassador now is waiting to receive credentials from the king.  The Thai and Cambodian foreign ministers agreed that they  should meet regularly -- both formally or privately -- in  Bangkok or in Phnom Penh.</p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / International Company News: German banks prosper in bleak climate - David Waller examines why fears for the industry's health have been confounded by strong results COMMERZBANK, Germany's third-biggest bank, has seen no let-up in profits growth during the past two months. Coming shortly after it reported 16.5 per cent growth in profits for the first six months of the year, Commerzbank's continuing strength serves to underscore the fact that Germany's banking sector remains a bastion of prosperity amid the country's worst recession since the second world war. Analysts had feared the half-year results for Germany's big banks, published in the past few weeks, would reveal weaknesses in the sector. This fear was based on the banks' decision to report provisions against bad and doubtful debts for the first time, ahead of a European Community directive which will make such disclosure mandatory for the full-year results. In the event, provisions notwithstanding, the results were better than expected and the German banking sector is looking solid. Taking the new measure for assessing banks' profitability - total operating profits after provisions - the big five banks managed growth rates of between 12.6 per cent (Deutsche Bank) and 24.8 per cent (Hypobank). And although provisions grew by as much as 45 per cent at Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, and 25 per cent at Dresdner, the second biggest, analysts were pleasantly surprised at what the new figures implied about the bad debt situation in Germany. 'The information is still incomplete,' said Susan Sternglass at Goldman Sachs in London, 'but all the evidence suggests that the German banks have for several years been making sizeable provisions against bad and doubtful debts in anticipation of the downturn. 'This means that now the downturn has actually materialised, bad debt charges do not have to rise dramatically.' The implication is that German banks will this year match, if not beat, the record level of profits made last year. Along with construction companies - main beneficiaries of a building boom in eastern Germany - the banking industry is one of only two German stock-market sectors likely to increase earnings this year. This raises at least two questions: how have the banks been able to defy a recession likely to mean a decline of at least 2 per cent in German GDP this year, and can this immunity to the downturn last? The central factor behind the rise in total profits in the first six months of the year was a surge in profits from own-account trading. At four out of the five biggest banks, these profits more than doubled against the comparable period for last year. At Dresdner Bank they more than trebled. The smallest rate of increase was 42 per cent at the Deutsche Bank - impressive considering that these DM808m (Dollars 480.9m) profits were bigger than trading profits combined at its two nearest rivals. These strong trading results reflect highly favourable market conditions in currency and securities markets. The bund market rally in the early part of the year was followed by a strong performance in the German equity market, with the DAX index of 30 leading shares up by more than 18 per cent in the first six months. The banks have also benefited from high volatility and trading volumes in currency markets. Market activity also stimulated commission income generated through securities transactions conducted on customers' behalf. This category of profit rose at between 13 per cent (Deutsche) and 21 per cent (Hypobank). Commission income combined with trading profits thus offset a slowdown in earnings on interest income, the mainstay of a bank's business. Here growth slowed from the levels of last year when, according to a Bundesbank analysis published in its monthly report for August, net interest income climbed at 10 per cent. However growth in interest earnings has by no means died away altogether: in the first half, it still rose 7.4 per cent at Deutsche, 4.6 per cent at Dresdner, and more than 10 per cent at Hypobank. This reflects the relaxation of minimum reserve requirements which, earlier this year, freed DM25bn of capital on which the banks had hitherto earned no interest. Continuing strong demand for mortgage borrowing, driven by sharp cuts in long-term interest rates over the past year, has also helped. Will fortune continue to smile on German banks? Mr Ian McEwen, banking analyst at Merrill Lynch, is not sanguine. He believes that banks' margins will be squeezed in a lower interest-rate environment, and that the impact of the downturn will be felt more sharply in 1994, when provisioning will have to be raised still further. 'It will be hard for the banks to generate profit growth in 1994,' he concluded. On this basis, he argues that all German banks, but for Deutsche Bank, are overvalued in stock-market terms. However, for the time being German banks' biggest problem is an enviable one: that of being embarrassingly profitable when virtually everywhere else in the German economy earnings are collapsing.</p>

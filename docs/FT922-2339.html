			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont takes tough line on interest rate cut MR NORMAN LAMONT last night flatly rejected calls from some Conservative MPs for an immediate cut in interest rates to speed up the pace of economic recovery. In a tough speech to members of the Conservative backbench finance committee, the chancellor also insisted that there could be no question of any devaluation of sterling within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Responding to disquiet among many Tory MPs that the April election victory has not brought the promised recovery, Mr Lamont appeared to acknowledge that the Treasury had downgraded its growth forecasts for this year. MPs at the meeting said that he had left the impression that the economy was likely to be flat this year rather than growing by the 1 per cent predicted in his March budget. But Mr Lamont sought to quash speculation that he is under pressure from the prime minister and cabinet colleagues to 'kick start' the economy with an early cut in interest rates. He told the MPs that the government had refused to 'play politics' with the economy in spite of the pressures it faced in the run-up to the general election. To take a short-term view now would be entirely illogical and would risk the medium-term rewards promised by the present tough stance against inflation. He warned also that such determination to judge the economy's performance over a period of years rather than months would mean tough constraints on key public-spending programmes during the present round of Whitehall negotiations. In spite of his reputation as the cabinet's most important Euro-sceptic, Mr Lamont was careful not to support calls from some MPs for the government to abandon the goal of a single currency enshrined in the threatened Maastricht treaty. He told the meeting that the Danish vote against the treaty called for a period of 'cool reflection' but highlighted the benefits of the ERM and the potential gains from a single currency.</p>

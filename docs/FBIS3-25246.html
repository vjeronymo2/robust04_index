Mr.  Meyer said he had asked the Freedom Alliance to make specific  proposals regarding changes to the interim constitution earlier  this week, but thus far no response has been received. He says  that the Freedom Alliance has failed collectively to arrive at a  common consensus, that is why the possibility of progress with  indinvidual parties within the alliance was currently being  investigated.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / BOC adopts Visa cards to speed small bill payment BOC, ONE of Britain's biggest industrial groups, is issuing Visa charge cards to managers to simplify and speed up payment of all small bills incurred by its UK gases business. In an initiative which is provoking widespread interest among other large UK businesses, BOC's gases division has issued cards to purchasing managers at 30 local centres, enabling them to settle any invoices of up to Pounds 250 each. The ceiling for a transaction, covering everything from vehicle parts to office equipment, may soon rise to Pounds 1,000. The business has about 8,000 suppliers. The scheme, now being brought in nationally after a 12-month trial period, has led to immediate cost savings for BOC of Pounds 200,000 a year. Further reductions in overheads are expected. Most suppliers have welcomed the move, which means their bills are being settled within 10 days, on average - many within half that. Bills totalling Pounds 1m a year are already being settled by BOC under the new system, which is proving so successful that it may be adopted by other parts of BOC's business. The group's industrial gas business in Europe has annual sales of nearly Pounds 500m a year, mostly in the UK. Managers have been given individual credit limits, rising as high as Pounds 25,000. Visa charges a fee for each card, but there are no interest charges for BOC as card debts are paid on demand. The initiative, which might make a significant contribution towards combating late payment of bills, follows an analysis by BOC showing that 60 per cent of its purchase and invoice matching activities involve transactions of less than Pounds 250 each. Collectively, however, they account for only 3 per cent of purchasing expenses. Mr Trevor Rock, BOC gases divisional controller responsible for the scheme, said the intention was to 'end the purchasing manager's nightmare' of handling huge volumes of paperwork for low-value transactions. He added: 'It can also work wonders for suppliers' cash flow. The question of chasing for payment becomes a thing of the past.' BOC expects that charge cards to pay day-to-day corporate bills will become normal within the next five years. The company has already made presentations on its new system to businesses including IBM, National Power, Esso and the Post Office.</p>

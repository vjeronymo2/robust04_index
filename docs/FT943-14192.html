			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Fresh Creditanstalt bid likely The German insurance group Allianz is considering a bid for a majority stake in Creditanstalt, the Austrian bank, according to an Austrian newspaper report. Citing unnamed sources, the Vienna newspaper Standard said a delegation of Allianz officials would meet Austrian finance ministry officials today in Vienna for exploratory talks. A spokesman for Allianz in Munich declined to comment on the report, citing German insider trading laws. An offer by Allianz would add a new twist to the battle over Austria's second largest bank, which is already being sought by CS Holding, the Swiss banking group, and a consortium that includes Commerzbank of Germany, Italian insurer Generali and various Austrian companies. The government, which owns 49 per cent of Creditanstalt equity and 70 per cent of its voting stock, wants to sell part of its holding before the end of the year. At current stock market prices, the government's stake in Creditanstalt is worth about Sch14bn (Dollars 1.3bn). Austria's finance minister Mr Ferdinand Lacina, a social democrat, is known to favour the CS Holding bid because it would make Creditanstalt part of a strong international banking group. CS Holding, the Swiss financial group built around the Credit Suisse bank, has promised to retain Creditanstalt's independence if its offer is accepted. However, the prospect of a large Austrian bank becoming a subsidiary of a Swiss bank has aroused strong national opposition to the offer. The Conservative People's party, the junior coalition partner, favours the Austrian/Italian/German consortium. In these circumstances, a bid by Allianz could be seen as the best solution for both sides and therefore an acceptable compromise. It would be Allianz's first move into banking. Mr Lacina has postponed his decision until after the parliamentary elections in October, and has asked outside experts to evaluate the various offers in the meantime.</p>

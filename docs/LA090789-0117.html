			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY FINDS MAN GUILTY IN KIDNAPING OF 2;  </P> <P> DEFENDANT FACES LIFE TERMS IN ABDUCTION OF MARKET OWNER'S FAMILY  </P> <P> A jury has convicted a 28-year-old Los Angeles man of kidnaping the wife and  daughter of a Long Beach market owner last March.  </P> <P> Juan Carlos Pena was found guilty last Friday in Norwalk Superior Court of two  counts of kidnaping for ransom and one count of robbery for the abduction of  Maria del Refugio Sanchez, 33, and her daughter, Yesenia, 5.  </P> <P> Two other defendants, Eliazar Romero Cuaei, 26, and Martin Galvan Ceja, 26,  each pleaded guilty to two counts of kidnaping for ransom and one count of  robbery during jury selection for the trial, which started on Aug. 21, Deputy  Dist. Atty. Charles A. Lawhorn said. They were to have been tried with Pena.  </P> <P> The three men each face two life prison terms for the kidnapings and a  five-year term for robbery when they are sentenced later this month, Lawhorn  said. The men were convicted of robbery for taking $50 from Sanchez' purse,  Lawhorn said.  </P> <P> Pena testified that he was not involved in the kidnaping but was merely present  when Sheriff's deputies raided the small Los Angeles home where the victims  were rescued after four days. Pena said he was homeless and looking for work in  downtown Los Angeles when he ran across Cuaei, who told him to go to the house  and search for work.  </P> <P> But Maria Sanchez testified that Pena was in the van that was used in the  kidnaping. The jury deliberated for two hours before returning the guilty  verdict. Yesenia Sanchez, the daughter, did not testify.  </P> <P> "It was an issue of credibility as to whether they believed his alibi that he  was a homeless person looking for work," Lawhorn said.  </P> <P> Froilan Sanchez, 39, was at his La Michoacana Market on Paramount Boulevard in  Long Beach on March 6 when he received a call telling him that his wife and  daughter had been abducted that morning from their La Mirada home, sheriff's  officials said after the arrests. The caller demanded A$100,000 for their safe  return.  </P> <P> Maria Sanchez testified during the trial that she was warming up her car to  take her daughter to preschool when Ceja approached and said her husband had  been seriously injured in an accident at work. She and her daughter voluntarily  climbed into a van with Ceja, she testified. She was later blindfolded.  </P> <P> Froilan Sanchez, who had called the Sheriff's Department, received six more  calls from the abductors during the next four days. The ransom was eventually  raised to $150,000.  </P> <P> Sanchez raised the ransom money from his business, his bank, relatives and  friends, and agreed to drop the money at a phone booth in a Los Angeles parking  lot, authorities said. Detectives had him under surveillance.  </P> <P> Cuaei picked up the money and drove off. He was arrested a short time later and  led lawmen to the 121st Street home, where they arrested Pena, Ceja, Juan  Manuel Cordova, 21, and Jose Luis Estrada, 43.  </P> <P> Maria Sanchez and her daughter were found unharmed in a rear bedroom of the  house.  </P> <P> The cases against Cordova and Estrada were dismissed last May because of  insufficient evidence, Lawhorn said  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- Seoul hasn't given up  hope on talking out the nuclear problem with Pyongyang, Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu said Tuesday in the wake of international  calls for North Korea to permit full nuclear inspections.    The odds of solving the problem through dialogue will  actually get better in the future, Han told reporters.    But he made clear that Seoul is ready to act by  participating  in U.N. sanctions against North Korea.    "Patriot missiles will soon be deployed," Han said, and  Seoul  is prepared for the possibility of Pyongyang bolting from the  nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).    While expecting the U.N. Security Council to adopt a  resolution on North Korea, the foreign minister said trade  sanctions will gradually become tighter.    "But we hope to talk with North Korea even if a resolution  is  on the Security Council table. The door is open," said Han.    "The whole purpose is to press North Korea to accept nuclear  inspections and to convince it that dialogue is more to its  advantage than sanctions," he said.    The IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency], the U.N.  nuclear watchdog, passed a resolution of its own on Tuesday [day  as received] stating it was unable to verify that North Korea  had not diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful uses. The  Agency reported its findings to the U.N. Security Council.    China, which voted against a similar IAEA resolution in  April  last year, abstained this time.    "This was a strong message to North Korea from China," he  said.    Despite pessimism that Beijing, Pyongyang's longstanding  ally  whose diplomatic relations with Seoul go back less than two  years, will not go along with international sanctions against  North Korea, Han said things are changing.    "China no longer insists that its influence over North Korea  is limited. It used to, but not anymore," he said. "It's also  true that North Korea and China have grown closer than before,  and Beijing's role has become enlarged."    U.N. sanctions will be mild at the start, making it easier  for Beijing to tacitly agree. "What will determine China's  decision is what happens from now, how much effort we put in to  show that diplomatic efforts have really been exhausted," said  Han.    Seoul's role, in contrast, will diminish as the influence of  China increases, he predicted. "We have to be prepared for that  eventuality."    The immediate concern is that North Korea might overreact,  possibly making good on its threat to pull out of the NPT. "We  need to be prepared for that, too," Han stressed.    Asked when Patriot missiles will be deployed in South Korea,  Han said "very soon," hinting they are due to arrive sometime  next month.    Seoul and Washington have already consulted on when to  deploy  the defensive missiles, he said.</p>

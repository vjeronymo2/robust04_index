			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble part 51 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=3 --> PART 51_REQUIREMENTS FOR PREPARATION, ADOPTION, AND SUBMITTAL OF IMPLEMENTATION PLANS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1. The authority citation for part 51 continues to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> U.S.C. 7401(a)(2), 7475(e), 7502 (a) and (b), 7503, 7601(a)(1) and 7620. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 51.372 is proposed to be amended by adding paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;51.372 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> State implementation plan submissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Redesignation requests <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Any nonattainment area that EPA determines would otherwise qualify for redesignation from nonattainment to attainment may receive full approval of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal under sections 182(a)(2)(B) or 182(b)(4) if the submittal contains the following elements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Legal authority to implement a basic I/M program (or enhanced if the state chooses to opt up) as required by this subpart. The legislative authority for an I/M program shall allow the adoption of implementing regulations without requiring further legislation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A request to place the I/M plan (if no I/M program is currently in place or if an I/M program has been terminated) or the I/M upgrade (if the existing I/M program is to continue without being upgraded) into the contingency measures portion of the maintenance plan upon redesignation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A contingency measure consisting of a commitment by the Governor or the governor's designee to adopt regulations to implement the required I/M program in response to a specified triggering event. Such contingency measures must be implemented on the trigger date, which is a date determined by the State to be no later than the date EPA notifies the state that it is in violation of the ozone or carbon monoxide standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A commitment that includes an enforceable schedule for adoption and implementation of the I/M program, and appropriate milestones, including the items in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) through (a)(1)(vii) of this section. In addition, the schedule shall include the date for submission of a SIP meeting all of the requirements of this subpart, excluding schedule requirements. Schedule milestones shall be listed in months from the trigger date, and shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. SIP submission shall occur no more than 12 months after the trigger date as specified by the State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Basic areas continuing operation of I/M programs as part of their maintenance plan without implemented upgrades shall be assumed to be 80% as effective as an implemented, upgraded version of the same I/M program design, unless a state can demonstrate using operating information that the I/M program is more effective than the 80% level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> SIP Submittals to Correct Violations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP submissions required pursuant to a violation of the ambient ozone or CO standard (as discussed in paragraph (c) of this section) shall address all of the requirements of this subpart. The SIP shall demonstrate that performance standards in either &sect;51.351 or &sect;51.352 shall be met using an evaluation date (rounded to the nearest January for carbon monoxide and July for hydrocarbons) seven years after the trigger date. Emission standards for vehicles subject to an IM240 test may be phased in during the program but full standards must be in effect for at least one complete test cycle before the end of the 5-year period. All other requirements shall take effect within 24 months of the trigger date. The phase-in allowances of &sect;51.373(c) shall not apply. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15307 Filed 6&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: Belgravia: simply the best in town - Mayfair is on the way back but its neighbour remains the capital's top residential area WHEN Lord Owen, Britain's former foreign secretary, moved to Narrow Street in Wapping more than 20 years ago, living east of the Tower of London suddenly looked trendy. Since then, and especially over the past decade, vast sums have been poured into developing Docklands and the media has been full of seductive advertisements and brochures from developers. But the reality is that Docklands remains a place for the future - a far better bet than it was but needing another 10 years at least. If Docklands is not yet 'in,' where is? The simple answer is that money talks, even though its owners usually prefer to remain silent. They spend their cash on property in the best residential areas of London (often, in the most discreet streets) where there are gracious houses, or seemingly modest ones, with garages if possible and, almost certainly, gardens. If they prefer to live in flats they want a good location, quality, service and, above all, security. Some people think the Monopoly board shows the best addresses in London; and it is true that Mayfair is on its way back to the top spot now that planners require so many fine buildings, used as 'temporary' offices for the past 50 years, to revert to residential use. But the leading residential area in London continues to be Mayfair's neighbour, Belgravia. Its 200 acres are owned by the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor estate (which also controls the best 100 acres of Mayfair). The properties are leasehold, a system being changed by the government through its Housing and Urban Development Bill, which allows tenants to acquire the freeholds. Indeed, most of the best residential areas in London remain - for the moment  -leasehold. Apart from Mayfair and Belgravia, these include the Cadogan and Sloane-Stanley estates in Chelsea; Smith's Charity in South Kensington; the Ilchester estate in Holland Park; the Eyre estate in St John's Wood; the Howard de Walden estate around Harley Street and Portland Place; the Portman estate around Portman Square; the Church Commissioners' estates north of Hyde Park; and Eton College's estate in Swiss Cottage. The Crown estate's leasehold properties in Regent's Park, Kensington, St James's, Millbank and Hackney are excluded from the bill. For those wanting to live in Mayfair, the entry price is surprisingly low. Egerton (tel: 071-493-0676) has two-bedroom flats for sale at less than Pounds 200,000, but service charges can be Pounds 3,500 a year. Larger flats needing modernisation cost up to Pounds 475,000. Wetherell (071-493-6935) is offering newly-refurbished flats in Upper Grosvenor Street, opposite the US Embassy, at between Pounds 795,000 and Pounds 1.1m. On the BP pension fund's 20-acre Mayfair estate, reconstructed flats in Hill Street are being sold by Debenham Tewson Residential (071-408-1161) from Pounds 320,000, and new houses in Hays Mews from Pounds 390,000. Anyone who doubts that Belgravia is London's top address should note that this is where a two-bedroom penthouse in Belgrave Square can be rented through Humberts Majendie (071-223-0433) for Pounds 1,200 a week  - more than Pounds 60,000 a year, which does not include council tax. Belgravia is where property developer Elliott Bernerd bought the Eaton Square flat where the Duke of Westminster lived, combined it with the Duke of Roxburghe's flat next door to create one of London's largest apartments (more than 8,000 sq ft), and sold it last year to Middle East businessman Wafic Said for about Pounds 9m despite the Grosvenor estate lease having only 20 years left, an annual ground rent of Pounds 5,000, and service charges of more than Pounds 30,000 a year. All but six of the grand houses in Eaton Square have been converted into expensive flats. One of the houses, on the south side, was bought two years ago by composer Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber for Pounds 10.5m. Elsewhere in Belgravia, houses in Chester Square or Wilton Crescent can command up to Pounds 4.5m - the price paid last year for one in Wilton Crescent that was reconstructed and given air-conditioning and a lift. A house three doors away is for sale at Pounds 3.25m through WA Ellis (071-581-7654) and Cordle (071-351-0223). An unmodernised house offered for Pounds 2m through Aylesford (071-351-2383) has the extra advantage of having a mews cottage with a double garage at the back in Kinnerton Street. In Cadogan Lane, where the Grosvenor estate meets the Cadogan estate, Wilson Mordant (071-235-0906) is seeking Pounds 4.5m for a new, six-bedroom property designed by Michael Brown Associates on the site of the house in which actress Judy Garland died. This re-interprets the classical style of Belgravia in a modern way and has an indoor swimming pool, a lift and an elaborate security system - but no garage. It is also freehold, rare in this area up to now. Elsewhere on the Cadogan estate, Pounds 4.85m is being sought by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-824-8171) for one of the large houses in Cadogan Place; it has air-conditioning, a lift, a double garage, and a lease with 54 years left. After Mayfair and Belgravia and Chelsea, the next prime address is Holland Park - the street, not the area - where the houses are freehold. Richard Branson owns two adjoining houses there and the Kensington office of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-938-4311) has two nearby houses for sale: one at Pounds 6.75m, the other Pounds 3.85m. On the Phillimore estate in Campden Hill, WA Ellis has a leasehold house at Pounds 2.5m, John D. Wood &amp; Co (071-727-0705) another one at Pounds 2.45m, and Lassmans (071-499-3434) a third for Pounds 1.45m. The redevelopment by Taylor Woodrow and Mitsui Kensetsu of the nine-acre site of St Mary Abbots hospital in Marloes Road, Kensington, is becoming recognised as one of the best addresses in London because of the quality of the new buildings, the ample parking and the high security. Now called Kensington Green, there are flats with 999-year leases from Pounds 180,000 up to penthouses at Pounds 990,000, and freehold houses from Pounds 550,000 to Pounds 1.6m. Of the first phase of 114 properties, 60 have been sold and 23 let. There is a sales office on the site (071-938-3350). Two years ago, Regalian Properties developed 20 luxury flats on Crown estate land at 3a Palace Green, opposite Kensington palace; but with prices from Pounds 2m to Pounds 13.5m, buyers were conspicuous by their absence. Since prices were halved recently, nine flats have been sold and the rest are for sale through Savills (071-499-8644) and Hamptons (071-493-8222) at figures from Pounds 1.05m to Pounds 5.575m. Regalian's chairman, David Goldstone, insists that 3a Palace Green is not just the finest address in London - but in the world.</p>

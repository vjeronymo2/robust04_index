"Individual governments have to increase their input and  intensify community involvement in the vaccination programmes,"  said Kebba Jobe, a Gambian participant, said. Speaking before  the start of the seminar Jobe, who manages his country's  expanded programme on immunization, said the Gambia had attained  69 percent immunisation for children aged below one year. He  said donors must continue supporting Gambia to reduce the cost  of vaccines and thereby increase the percentage of immunisation.    A Mauritanian delegate, Dr. Pradbodh Munbodh, said managers  of immunisation programmes in Africa should adopt private sector  working methods to reduce bureaucracy. He told delegates from  South Africa that by 1992, Mauritania had attained vaccination  of between 75 and 80 percent of all pregnant women, 85 percent  of children against measles and 90 percent against diphteria,  whooping cough and tetanus. "Since you face an enourmous  vaccination task in your country, the best thing is to motivate  the paramedical personnel directly involved in the field," he  told Ray Mabope, the African National Congress' (ANC) national  chair on vaccination and immunisation and Bonginkosi Mhlanga of  the Pan-Africanist Congress' (PAC) health directorate. Mabope  said that with its three vaccine manufacturing institutions,  South Africa should be able to vaccinate all its children within  the next few years and become a vaccine supplier to countries in  the southern African development community.    This, he said, would entail rationalising the activities of  the South African Institute for Medical Research, the State  Vaccine Institute and the National Institute of Virology "to cut  down wastage."    Mhlanga said that although the South African Government  claimed it had achieved 80 percent immunisation of its children,  "we have to unify the country first before analysing the  situation in South Africa, especially in the homelands, where  the situation is not clear." South Africa is due to form its  first democratic government after the country's first non-racial  elections on 26-28 April.    The four-day seminar, which has attracted vaccination  experts  from Africa, Europe and the United States, is to be opened later  today by Cote d'Ivoire's health minister, Maurice Guikahue. The  theme is: "To build a durable partnership for immunisations for  Africa." It is the fourth of its kind, after those of Bamako in  1974, Dakar in 1981 and Niamey in 1987.    South Africa, which is taking part for the first time, is  represented by an eight-person multiracial delegation, including  representatives of government and the former liberation  movements -- ANC and PAC.</p>

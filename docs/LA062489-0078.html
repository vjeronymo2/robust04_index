			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OPINIONS ON OPINION POLL  </P> <P> As the founding member of the Burbank Flatlanders Home Protection League, I am  writing to complain that you published such a sleazy article on the "poll"  taken regarding public approval of the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport,  written bW. McGarry (May 28).  </P> <P> To the best of my knowledge, not one of us homeowners living directly under the  departure flight path of the airport was interviewed by the pollsters.  McGarry's attempt to denigrate us "anti-noise crusaders," as he calls us, and  our efforts to protect our property and our life styles through the political  process, is shameful.  </P> <P> This is a deadly serious business for those of us directly affected by Burbank  Airport and the airport authority. We are not just a bunch of whiners and  malcontents with far too much political power, as we are painted in the  article. We are a group of honest homeowners who are having this airport and  its ever-increasing expansion forced down our throats by an unfeeling and  relentless airport authority.  </P> <P> It is led by Robert W. Garcin, who is supported by members from Pasadena and  Glendale, who control a two-thirds majority voting power over the city of  Burbank's members, in spite of the fact that the airport is located in Burbank  and Burbank's citizens are the most heavily impacted.  </P> <P> Noise is not our only complaint, either. Other issues, such as jet-fuel air  pollution in an area already designated as having the highest air pollution in  Southern California and our civil rights as homeowners come to bear.  </P> <P> In the opinion of many of us Flatlanders, this poll was untruthful, inaccurate  and misleading. Next time your newspaper conducts a poll such as this, make  sure that those most affected are consulted as well as those who live in  communities miles from the airport.  </P> <P> WALLY BERNS  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

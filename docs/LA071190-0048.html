			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COASTAL AGENCY DEALS BLOW TO SEWER PLANS  </P> <P> The California Coastal Commission on Tuesday dealt a severe blow to a bid by  Los Angeles County to speed construction of a controversial sewer system in  Malibu.  </P> <P> By a unanimous vote, the state panel rejected the county's request to go  forward with its proposed $43-million sewer system, bypassing several  administrative steps that ordinarily could be expected to take several more  months.  </P> <P> Left unchallenged, the outcome would greatly increase the likelihood that the  county will be unable to start work on the sewer before Malibu becomes a city.  County officials have indicated that they may file suit against the commission  in an attempt to reverse the decision.  </P> <P> A three-judge panel in Los Angeles has set a July 18 hearing to decide whether  incorporation, which voters approved last month, is allowed to go forward or  whether the county can delay it until next March.  </P></p>

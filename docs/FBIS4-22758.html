			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Aleksandr Shokhin by Nikita </F> Kirichenko, Aleksandr Privalov, and Andrey Shmarov at the  KOMMERSANT publishing house; date not given; published under the  rubric "Very Important": "Wait for Your Debt Far Away and for a  Long Time"]    [Text] Last Wednesday, 23 March, Aleksandr Shokhin came to  the KOMMERSANT publishing house. Thus a good tradition of  informal communication between high-ranking statesmen and  KOMMERSANT experts was continued. Boris Fedorov started this  tradition last year. However, two months after visiting  KOMMERSANT Boris Fedorov left the government, whereas Aleksandr  Shokhin originated a new tradition--one day after his visit to  KOMMERSANT he was given the post of deputy prime minister with a  portfolio in the government.    However, we have always proceeded from the fact that status  is not the only thing to grace a person, as long as he says  interesting things.  <H5>  Shokhin on Camdessus, the Duma, and the People </H5>   Naturally, the foremost desire of KOMMERSANT experts meeting  with a man with whose participation credit exceeding $2 billion  had just been shaken loose was to find out how this is done and  how the outcome of negotiations with the IMF can determine the  domestic array and correlation of forces with regard to economic  reform.    Regarding the intrigue itself involving negotiations about  the second tranche of IMF systemic credit, Aleksandr Shokhin  informed us that the Russian position on, or rather opposition  to, G-7 was set forth in early December. A meeting was scheduled  for 17 December at which it was planned to begin the development  of a new plan for supporting Russian reform so as to begin a new  cycle of financial stabilization scheduled literally day by day  as early as 1 February.    However, according to Aleksandr Shokhin, the Duma elections  and subsequent events caused the negotiating schedule to fall  through. In the opinion of the minister, the first blow to the  progress of negotiations was struck by the former advisers to  the government, Mr. Sachs and Mr. Oslund, who "tried to create  an atmosphere such as not to provide financial support for this  government--it is patently conservative and antireformist. If  Gaydar and Fedorov are not in it, it would be better to delay  assistance until they return to the government again."    In the process, as our guest noted, "Yegor Timurovich and  Boris Grigoryevich themselves support a line of this kind. Yegor  Timurovich made a statement of this kind in Bonn; although he  later denied this fact, the stenographic record says what it  says."    Touching on the contents of the negotiations with the IMF,  Aleksandr Shokhin observed with some pride that for the first  time they proceeded according to the scenario of (what we seemed  to hear was virtually "to the dictation of") the Russian side.    During a meeting with the prime minister, Michel Camdessus  named certain parameters which the IMF considered acceptable as  conditions for the extension of credit, in particular, a 7-8  percent rate of inflation by the end of the year. The minister  noted: "In the process they of course did not fail to say that  Mr. Yeltsin was setting correct tasks (3-5 percent by the end of  the year) and, they said, the government should not be avoiding  implementation of the president's message. Nonetheless, IMF  experts grasped our arguments; this already amounted to  readiness to shift their old dogmatic positions in a more  realistic direction."    Before finally making a determination as to how realistic  the  budget projections of the government for 1994 were, Michel  Camdessus met at the Duma with Nikolay Rybkin and Sergey  Glazyev, who fervently supported the government. Aleksandr  Shokhin said: "This made a strong impression on Camdessus; it  turned out that the Duma was monetarist, perhaps even more so  than the government. Of course, it is hardly so, but he found no  opposition to the government there nonetheless."    Aleksandr Mikolayevich also told us that Mr. Camdessus  "visited a working man in the village--he wanted to see how the  people were doing. He happened upon a working man whose entire  hut was overflowing with books, and he spun tales for Camdessus  for three hours. I do not rule out that this was also a factor  in moderating the position of the IMF. It was good that he did  not drop into a neighboring hut." It turns out that this is how  a creditor needs to be boxed in tightly, from three directions  (the government, the Duma, and the people), so that he will loan  more.    Further on, we decided to cover in our conversation another  aspect of the issue--debt repayment or, in other words, the  manner in which the fact of signing the agreement with the IMF  will influence negotiations concerning the foreign debt. The  minister answered: At present the entire problem is that the  agreement with the Paris Club, dated 2 April 1993, specifies  that interest for the restructuring of the foreign debt in 1994  shall be set at 100 percent, whereas in 1994 we paid 40 percent,  or $2 billion less.    At the same time, a new round of negotiations just could not  begin while Russia had no agreement with the IMF. As  subsequently came out in our conversation, the club had, to put  it mildly, certain grounds for this. Aleksandr Nikolayevich  recalled how last year "we said: We have $2.5 billion in the  budget for all of your business; we do not even know what the  restructuring pattern will be; we do not know about your  intricacies. Here is money for you, think yourselves about how  to do it. They said: This is without precedent; it is not done  this way, with payments being reduced to zero for entire items,  including interest payments. This had never happened indeed.  Nonetheless, at the time we pressed the point home with them."    At this point we somehow legitimately recalled apprehensions  which are now being voiced concerning the fate of repayment of  the domestic foreign exchange loan of the VEB [Bank for Foreign  Economic Relations] (see KOMMERSANT, No. 9, pp. 6-10). On one  hand, if we succeed in economizing on payments to the Paris  Club, and if money from the monetary fund arrives quite promptly  (according to Shokhin it may arrive as early as late April),  chances for the regular (on-time) servicing of the domestic  foreign exchange debt will improve. On the other hand--you will  know yourselves (see above)....    As the saying goes, "debts follow debt," and thereafter the  conversation smoothly moved on to the issue of ruble-denominated  debt.  <H5>  Shokhin on Nonpayments and the Domestic Debt </H5>   The issue of nonpayments surfaced in the  conversation every now and then. Thus, when Mr. Shokhin was  discussing the proposal of the Ministry of the Economy to  eliminate quotas and licensing for oil exports, he directly  indicated what caused this proposal to be made: In the immediate  future, the combination of quota-setting and the nonpayments  crisis may bring about a stoppage in the oil industry because  the latter has no opportunity to compensate for the insolvency  of Russian customers by increasing exports.    It subsequently came out that, in the words of the minister,  the current "semi-market" mechanism for carrying out  intergovernmental agreements with CIS countries is breaking down  because of the nonpayments crisis and the insolvency of Russian  enterprises. For example, Roskontrakt purchases oil in Russia,  pushes it through to Uzbekistan, sells it, buys cotton, and  brings the latter here--and it turns out that nobody is in a  position to buy cotton at these prices. "It is easier for  precisely the Uzbeks and Kazakhs to meet such obligations.  Everything is centralized there. This is why we should either  change the arrangement, too, and use the arrangement for the  administrative regulation of deliveries under such agreements,  or altogether abandon them."    The same topic resurfaced in the discussion on the need to  augment budget revenues. Aleksandr Shokhin said that it is not  simple to raise taxes and not only because "in some instances  the physical limit for these taxes is being reached. There are  other motives, too. For example, the excise tax on gas may be  increased, but will this generate real revenues for the budget?  Nobody knows whether the excise tax will become merely a  calculated value because of nonpayments."    At the same time, Mr. Shokhin clearly led us to understand  that the government does not at all intend to undo the  nonpayments crisis by the "traditional method." What is the  situation with "nontraditional methods?" The deputy prime  minister noted with satisfaction that "the mentality" of the  captains of industry "has finally begun to change--they have  already stopped seeking credit from the government and have  rushed to commercial structures, and are indeed prepared to  accept any terms in order to ensure the infusion of money into  production." He himself added: "However, this is just beginning;  we are not managing to make it through...." Since we are not  making it, plants will be idled.    This position of the minister of the economy makes a  particularly strong impression against the background of data  from his own ministry (see KOMMERSANT, No. 10, p. 11): The  Ministry of the Economy calculates that each ruble of public  debt generates 2-3 rubles [R] in the debt of enterprises.    However, we hate like hell to pay back the debt. If, as we  remember, Mr. Shokhin has managed to restructure the foreign  debt brilliantly, if he has convinced hard-boiled Western  creditors that a country with a trade budget surplus of  approximately $20 billion is just not in a position to pay more  than $2.5 billion on its obligations--will he really be  intimidated by restructuring the domestic debt? Do Russian  agrarians or defense sector people surpass the Paris and London  Clubs in terms of negotiating steadfastness? Even if they do, it  means that they are inferior to the Paris and London Clubs on  some other score....  <H5>  Shokhin On Attracting Nonstate Investment </H5>   Aleksandr Shokhin answered our question about how the  minister views restructuring and a pick-up in investment  activities as straightforwardly as a Roman--there is no money in  the budget, and for this reason, he views centralized investment  as merely a continuous patching up of economic holes. The  minister explained: Social projects (for example, housing) and  conversion will account for the lion's share of investment  outlays. As far as capital investment in effective production  projects is concerned, according to the budget about R4 trillion  will be allocated for it, which is mere scraps.    Besides, the minister confirmed in principle the supposition  of KOMMERSANT experts that the government also lacks a reliable  mechanism for the placement of state investment; moreover, the  investment arrangement proposed once again by the Ministry of  the Economy is patently unworkable.    Aleksandr Shokhin reasons absolutely soberly that a draft of  the compilation of the state investment program which, in  particular, calls for investment through state agents (the  Gosinkor [expansion not identified] and the Russian Finance  Corporation) does not ensure the main point--guarantees of the  recovery of investment. "So, we will give money to Nechayev  (president of the Russian Finance Corporation--note by  KOMMERSANT), but he will not pay it back. Well, it did not work  out. And what is the Russian Finance Corporation going to be  liable with? Its building on Georgiyevskiy Lane?"    It makes sense, and yet the minister has something up his  sleeve. Aleksandr Shokhin stated that a draft decree on a  contract between a government commission and a certain  consortium of commercial banks is already on the prime  minister's desk. As we understood from a not too extensive  commentary by the minister, the idea of this contract is as  follows.    Shokhin believes that demand constraints have finally  started  working at this particular time--there are no sales, enterprises  are screeching to a halt, but directors, on the contrary, have  begun to hustle. If so, state investment for them, the  directors, is no longer pennies from heaven but rather a rare  genuine opportunity to survive. Therefore, it is logical to  surmise that this investment should be fought for.    And just how? By "matching" one's own or private funds with  those of the state. The minister gave an example: The Tekhnokhim  Association from St. Petersburg insisted on having its project  financed from the budget; representatives of the enterprise  showed up at the ministry on this business regularly. Ultimately  a condition was set for them: Bring in a reputable foreign  investor, and you will get money. An investor came along fast:  In turn, he was promised that state funds would be invested in  the project, and some foreign investors in certain places still  believe on occasion that if the state is forking it over,  recovery will be no problem.    It is for this arrangement that the project with the  participation of the bank consortium has apparently been  developed; Shokhin thinks that each R1 in state funds must  attract R4 in private capital.    Of course, it is a good idea, if for no other reason than  because it envisions some kind of partnership between the state  and business. However, we are afraid that we will not go very  far even with this idea.    The reason is very simple. If total capital investment in  the  national economy is calculated with the fourfold investment  multiplier--in keeping with Shokhin's arrangement--taken into  account, it turns out that investment will "give off" 10 percent  this year (an estimate of the Ministry of the Economy itself).  It is clear that no investment policy can be made with such  scant capital, and that the 12 percent projected drop ("active  stabilization" scenario) which was "approved" by the government  last Thursday (after the minister's visit to KOMMERSANT) will  have to be discarded. Moreover, in this case there is perhaps no  dodging a 20 percent drop, as presented in a different scenario  of the projection.    However, the saddest point which our conversation with the  minister suggests: Shokhin is terribly averse to "working" the  investment multiplier a little. Meanwhile, there are  possibilities there: It is lucrative indeed to emit a ruble,  place it with the mysterious consortium for an effective  project, and tie up R4 in private capital. Of course, it is  clear that the multiplier will decrease as emission proceeds:  Private money is short, whereas emission will bring about the  growth of the budget deficit. However, money will not be spent  in vain, either.    But the minister just will not budge. He talked with regret  about the need to pay back the domestic debt, and with virtual  horror about the growth of the budget deficit. Nonetheless,  KOMMERSANT experts got the impression that ("I know that you  know that I know") everything has not yet been lost, and that an  affair between the minister and the economy is still possible.    Of course, special piety has to be shown for the budget  while  Camdessus is around. After a period of time it will be possible  to recall that "the tiger is made of paper": After all, the  level of intake of taxes by the state budget dropped by a factor  of two in the initial months of the year--from 18 percent of the  gross domestic product last year to 9 percent this year. If the  budget still cannot be implemented--with this kind of  nonpayment--it may be treated more liberally. After all, a  softer budget cannot be smuggled past the Duma and the IMF  anyway, but life needs to go on....</p>

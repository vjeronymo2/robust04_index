			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / US isolation grows over Vietnam THE 'road map' set out by former President George Bush for normalising relations between Vietnam and the US has already led the two countries into a few dead ends and several potholes. The discovery in Moscow of a document apparently showing that Vietnam may have held twice as many US prisoners of war as it ever admitted seems sure to throw another obstacle in the way of their awkward march towards full links. While US policy towards Vietnam is officially under review, it has been widely assumed in Washington - although without any explicit statement from President Bill Clinton himself - that the new administration would not depart dramatically from the Bush road map. This set out a phased progression to lifting the US trade embargo and establishing full dramatic relations in exchange for Vietnam's co-operation on accounting for US servicemen listed as missing in action during the Vietnam war and on the UN sponsored peace process in neighbouring Cambodia. The next phase foreseen in the road map would involve the US lifting its trade embargo against Vietnam, ending its opposition to reinstating the country in the International Monetary Fund and supporting loans by the IMF and the World Bank for basic human needs. The US is growing more and more isolated in its insistence on maintaining an embargo against Vietnam. Other western nations, which have until now held back out of deference to the US from helping Vietnam back into the IMF, now seem increasingly inclined to press ahead willy nilly. A support group led by France stands ready to provide a bridging loan to pay off Vietnam's arrears to the IMF of around Dollars 140m (Pounds 92m). Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, has made it clear he feels Hanoi's economic policies would already qualify it for normal IMF financing, allowing it to repay this bridging loan. This, in turn, would pave the way for World Bank infrastructure lending which Vietnam sorely needs. The support group had been expected to meet during the IMF's spring meetings later this month. Until the prisoners of war document surfaced in Moscow this week, Fund officials had expected the Clinton administration to signal its acceptance of Vietnam's reinstatement by lifting the embargo. Such a move now appears, in the short term at least, to be politically impossible for Mr Clinton: whether or not the Moscow document is authentic - and the Vietnamese are not alone in crying 'forgery' - it has the ring of truth to a substantial body of US opinion, which is unlikely ever to be reconciled to the probability that no MIAs are still held in Vietnam. Opinion in the Senate, however, is increasingly shifting towards the view that the best way of ensuring progress on MIA issues, as well as on other US concerns such as human rights violations in Vietnam, is to establish closer relations. Senator Claiborne Pell, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, and Senator Richard Lugar, his Republican opposite number, wrote together last month to urge Mr Clinton to lift the embargo. 'We believe that an aggressive and enlightened bilateral and multilateral dialogue with Vietnam will eventually result in democratic change in Vietnam and achieve a more complete resolution of the POW/MIA issue,' they wrote.</p>

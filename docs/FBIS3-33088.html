			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Energy and Mines Minister Edwin Jose Arrieta today  dismissed the possibility of any increase whatsoever in gasoline  prices. Nevertheless, he said that ultimately any decision will  be the Venezuelan state's sovereign decision to make.    Arrieta said that to discuss gasoline prices in terms of a  necessary increase is a simplistic way of approaching the  problem. Instead, he favors reducing basic production costs  rather than increasing consumer prices.    [Begin Arrieta recording] We have no plans to discuss an  increase in gasoline prices. At any rate, the petroleum product  sector can conduct a study at any time to establish operational  cost structures and so on, and at that time we would discuss the  factors -- which, of course, are quite numerous -- and study the  situation before adopting such a critical measure.    I believe the approach adopted thus far, the thought of  increasing and, in fact, having increased gasoline prices  already, has been very simplistic. Many factors must be  considered, such as economic, operational, and social factors.  Also, Venezuela is an oil-producing country and the Venezuelan  people should have a relative advantage. [end recording]    Regarding the negotiations under way with the U.S.  Government  concerning restrictions on Venezuelan reformulated oil imports,  Arrieta emphatically denied that they have failed. On the  contrary, he said that progress has been made, adding that  during the next round of negotiations scheduled to take place in  Caracas, the U.S. representatives will answer 28 technical  questions Venezuela will ask concerning its gasoline because,  Arrieta reiterated, our gasoline meets the standards demanded by  U.S. legislation.    Arrieta also said that the country's oil income has been  recalculated and in 1994 is expected to be approximately 110  billion bolivares. He added that Venezuela will propose to OPEC  a policy of concerted effort and integration -- in other words,  a return to the OPEC's original doctrine.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / US court dismisses Maxwell actions The administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation have lost a Dollars 140m legal action in the US against three European banks. Price Waterhouse, the administrators, had sought to recover the money from Barclays, National Westminster and Societe Generale. PW had claimed that payments made by MCC to the banks before its insolvency could be recovered under US preference law. The Bankruptcy Court in the southern district of New York last Friday dismissed the actions brought by PW. Under both US and English law, some payments made by a company in a relevant period before it enters formal insolvency proceedings may be set aside as 'preferences' if the effect of such payments is to prefer one creditor at the expense of another. However, the Bankruptcy Court upheld the argument of the banks that US law should not be applied to the payments in question. Under English law, a preference has to be proved by establishing a desire to prefer the creditor concerned. This is not necessary under US law. In 1992, the English Court of Appeal ruled that the issue of whether US preference law should apply was a matter for the US court. The administrators are still deciding whether to appeal in the US. MCC was placed in Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US and in administration in the UK in December 1991.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, Jan 31 (AFP) -- The UN Human Rights  Commission opened its annual session here Monday [31 January]  with a warning from its outgoing chairman that the Bosnian war  will undermine the UN's credibility unless the world community  intervenes there soon.    Mohamed Ennaceur of Tunisia denounced the "passiveness (and)  impotence" afflicting Bosnia.    "If the states which have the capacity and duty to intervene  do not do so rapidly and effectively, and if the international  community continues to content itself with dead-letter  resolutions...the continuing drama of the Bosnian people will  dangerously weaken the credibility of the UN," he said.    Ex-Yugoslavia will be high on the agenda during the  Commission's six-week annual session, which opened Monday by  electing Dutch diplomat and lawyer Pieter Van Wulfften Palthe as  Ennaceur's successor.    Atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina will come under the  spotlight on the basis of a new report by former Polish prime  minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.    The Commission will also discuss the issue of war criminals'  impunity.    Ibrahima Fall, UN undersecretary general for human rights  said last week he hoped that in the wake of the establishment of  an international court on ex-Yugoslavia in The Hague, a  permanent court would be set up to prosecute those who seriously  violate human rights throughout the world.    Heading the list of leaders addressing the session is  Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who is due to appear  Tuesday to denounce India for what officials have called its  "occupation" of Kashmir and repression of the Moslem-majority  population there.    PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat is also expected to address  delegates Tuesday, while Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres  is due February 10.    UN sources here said that a U.S. call for the Commission to  no longer treat the Israeli occupied territories as a case apart  was likely to be rejected due to opposition from Arab states.    It was unlikely that resolutions aimed at Israel --  particularly for its occupation of the Arab territories -- would  be done away with or presented differently, the sources said.    Former Swiss foreign minister Rene Felber is to present a  report on the occupied territories after meeting 'Arafat in  Tunis and a visit to Israel this month.    Meanwhile Georgia succeeded Monday in adding a clause on  "ethnic cleansing" in civil wars onto the agenda in the light of  its own conflict with Abkhaz separatists.    The outgoing chairman welcomed multirace elections in South  Africa scheduled for April, and the successful conclusion in  December of a world trade liberalisation accord under the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Ennaceur also highlighted the appointment of the first UN  High Commissioner for Human Rights. Ecuador's UN ambassador  Jose Ayala Lasso is due to be officially confirmed in the post  in the next few days.    Fall meanwhile called on all member states to ratify UN  conventions on human rights.    Among countries again expected to undergo criticism over  their human rights records will be Sudan, Zaire, Iran, Iraq,  Burma, Haiti, Cuba, Togo, Indonesia -- over East Timor -- and  China.</p>

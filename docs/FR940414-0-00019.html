This amendment is prompted by a report that the cavity vent tube, if not properly grounded, could act as an electrical path in the event of a lightning strike. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent arcing in the tank cavity and possible resulting fire. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective May 16, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of May 16, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, P.O.

That action proposed to require modification of the cavity vent drain tube assembly located in the center wing lower auxiliary fuel tank.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its member operators, requests that the proposal be withdrawn. The commenter maintains that the proposed modification will allow some fuel leakage within specified limits into the lower auxiliary tank cavity. This commenter asserts that, if this modification is not mandated by the FAA, then fuel will not be permitted to leak into the cavity and, unless fuel/vapor is present, there is no risk of fire in this cavity in the event of a lightning strike. The commenter also points out that a daily check to detect fuel leakage in the cavity drain valve is currently specified in the On Aircraft Maintenance Planning (OAMP) document for Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes. The commenter concludes that, since these inspections are performed on a daily basis, and since fuel will not be permitted to leak into the cavity if the modification is not mandated, then a lightning strike will not pose a threat to an area containing fuel or fuel vapor.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur that withdrawal of the proposal is appropriate. First, the FAA points out that the OAMP document is not a mandated, FAA-approved document; therefore, regardless of the number or types of inspections that are contained in it, there is no assurance that operators will strictly comply with those inspections or the indicated inspection intervals. Additionally, there is always the potential that a fuel leak could develop during flight between inspection intervals. Second, the FAA has determined that, since the required modification of the cavity vent drain tube assembly will prevent the possibility of a lightning strike traveling up the cavity vent tube, the possibility of arcing in the fuel tank cavity is thereby eliminated (regardless of whether or not fuel/vapor is present). Further, the FAA has determined that long term continued operational safety will be better assured by actual modification of the cavity vent drain tube assembly to remove the source of the problem, rather than by continuous inspections. Long term inspections may not be providing the degree of safety assurance necessary for the transport airplane fleet. This, coupled with a better understanding of the human factors associated with numerous continual inspections, has led the FAA to consider placing less emphasis on inspections and more emphasis on design improvements. The modification required by this AD is in consonance with these considerations.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA also requests that the proposed compliance time of 12 months for the modification be extended to 18 months. Such an extension would permit accomplishment of the proposed modification during regularly scheduled maintenance visits for most affected operators and would preclude special scheduling at considerable expense. The FAA concurs. Upon consideration of the information provided by the commenter, and the fact that there have been no in-service incidents of arcing or fire in the tank cavity (related to grounding problems in the cavity vent drain tube assembly), the FAA has determined that extending the compliance time by 6 additional months will not adversely affect safety. Paragraph (a) of the final rule has been revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 73 McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 29 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $120 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,265, or $285 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

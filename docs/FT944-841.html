			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Government not disingenuous on a minimum wage claim Sir, Your article, 'Figures show benefit of a minimum wage' (December 19), suggests that the government has been disingenuous in claiming that a national minimum wage would lead to a fall in the number of jobs. Denis MacShane's argument, that a number of other countries with minimum wage mechanisms have seen a higher growth in employment than the UK, is deeply flawed. The facts are that those countries quoted and which have seen a significant growth in employment have, in the main, very different types of wage-fixing mechanisms from the sort of national minimum wage which Labour is proposing. In the US, the minimum wage is currently set at the extremely low level of Dollars 4.25 per hour. Moreover, despite coming to power committed to raising the minimum wage, President Clinton has not done so, clearly because of fears about the effect on jobs. In Australia, wages are set at state level; in Japan, there are different industry rates; in both countries, the level is very low. France and Spain, which are the only EU countries with a national minimum wage of the sort Labour proposes, have significantly higher unemployment rates than the UK. It is not surprising Mr MacShane finds UK employment performance poor compared with other European countries, as he uses the wrong figure. Mr MacShane claims that employment growth for the UK was 1.5 per cent between 1980 and 1990; the actual OECD figure was 6.4 per cent (recently revised up to 6.8 per cent). When comparisons are based over the economic cycle (1979-90) - the correct way of assessing employment growth - the UK rate of job creation was faster than in France and Spain. The government believes the only sustainable way to improve real pay is through a combination of enhanced education and training. This will provide people with the skills to obtain better paid jobs together with the framework for monetary stability, low inflation, and a climate for successful investment and enterprise to allow individuals to provide better paid jobs. That we have been successful in this endeavour is indicated by the fact that whereas pay and productivity levels stagnated during the last Labour government, both have risen substantially since 1979.

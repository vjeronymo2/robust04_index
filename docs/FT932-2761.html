			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Observer: Mystery woman Until recently, trying to assemble a picture of the secretive Fred Olsen - owner of Timex, numerous tankers and much else - was rather like trying to sketch the invisible man. Worries about terrorist attacks were said to be the reason why one of Norway's most mysterious shipping tycoons kept such a low profile. Suddenly, however, Olsen has begun to pop up on TV screens, where he comes across as a rather nice elderly gent who doesn't know what terrible things his subordinates have been doing at the doomed Timex plant in Dundee. The old man has certainly impressed Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish Nationalist Party. He had Olsen on the phone for an hour and a half on Tuesday, and Olsen was paying for the call. 'I couldn't get him off the phone,' says Salmond. Ninety minutes on the blower might not sound long for a politician, but it is a veritable age for an international businessman used to making snappy decisions. 'He kept asking me what I would do,' says Salmond, who has already faxed his answers to Norway. 'I wish I had phoned him earlier,' laments the man who does not hold out much hope of a last-minute reprieve. Come to think of it, the SNP leader might have had more luck if he had rung Fred's daughter, Anette, who many think really runs the group these days.</p>

Suiting the needs of establishing a socialist market  economic structure and quickening the pace of national defense  and military legislation. According to the Central  Military Commission's legislation plan during the Eighth  Five-Year Plan period, which is signed by Chairman Jiang Zemin,  and accepted by Vice Chairmen Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen after  the conclusion of the First Session of the Eighth National  People's Congress [NPC], Qin Jiwei, vice chairman of the NPC  Standing Committee, and Chi Haotian, minister of national  defense, convened and presided over a symposium on national  defense legislation, which was participated in by the newly  elected members of the NPC Standing Committee and its special  committees from the armed forces, as well as leading cadres from  relevant units of the three general departments of the Central  Military Commission. The symposium analyzed and studied the  situation in military legislation and proposed to accelerate the  work of national defense and military legislation. Having been  approved by the State Council and the Central Military  Commission, a national defense law drafting committee was set  up, and the curtain was finally raised on drafting the "Law on  National Defense"--a basic law which will play a leading role in  the building of national defense and the armed forces. As  required by the abovesaid plan, nine military and military  administrative laws and regulations including "Regulations on  Soldiers in Active Service," "Regulations on Management of  Wireless Facilities," "Regulations on Garrisons on Duty,"  "Regulations on Management of Logistic Grass-roots Units," and  "Stipulations on Filing of Military and Military Administrative  Rules and Regulations" have been formulated, revised, or  promulgated in recent years. The general departments, armed  services and branches, major military regions, and the  Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National  Defense have also promulgated more than 600 military and  military administrative rules and regulations, which have  provided the legal basis for the Army's drive for modernization,  and have exercised a positive role in defending the state's  military interests, safeguarding the legitimate rights and  interests of the Army and military personnel, maintaining a high  degree of stability, centralization, and unity in the Army, and  enhancing the fighting capacity of the troops.    Vigorously intensifying the enforcement, supervision,  and examination of the military law and facilitating the  implementation of the principle of administering the Army  according to laws. Leading cadres and organs at all levels  have repeatedly enhanced the consciousness of administering the  Army in accordance with laws, standardized army building in a  comprehensive way strictly according to relevant regulations,  repeatedly elevated the level of making policy decisions,  exercising management, conducting training, and leading the  troops in accordance with laws, and established a good training,  working, and living order and a sound order of combat readiness.  Following the examination of enforcing the "Law on Protecting  Military Facilities" and the "Regulations on the Management of  Army's Real Estate," an overhaul of enforcing the "Regulations  on Military Training" has been organized within the entire Army,  by which the conditions of enforcing training regulations have  been examined in the military regions of Shenyang, Beijing,  Lanzhou, Nanjing, and Chengdu, and the districts subordinate to  them. As a result, the Army's awareness in studying, applying,  and strictly enforcing laws has been noticeably heightened,  training according to laws and plans has become a conscious  action of organizations at all levels which are responsible for  the Army's military training, the central position of military  training has been solidified and enhanced, training order has  been incrementally regularized, training time and content have  been ensured, and training quality has been elevated year after  year, thus profoundly changing the moral features of the Army.    Closely combining theory with the practice in the  military legal system to boost the development of the science of  military law. The Research Institute of Military Law under  the China Law Society took on the key research subject during  the Eighth Five-Year Plan--research on the building of military  legal system. It has completed the overall design and entered  the substantive stage of tackling the problem. With the  approval of the State Press and Publication Administration,  "China Military Law"--the country's only comprehensive  periodical on the military legal system at the central  level--has started publication and been openly put on sale  throughout the country. Afterward, scores of special works on  the military law and voluminous reference books including  Chinese Science of Military Law, Chinese  Military Encyclopedia, Separate Book on Military Law, and  World Famous Statute Book, Volume on Military Law  came off press one after another, and several hundred theses on  military law with guiding theoretical and practical value were  also published, which have filled the gap of China's theoretical  research on military law. Centering around the pressing issue  of national defense and military legislation, the Research  Institute of Military Law enlisted a large number of  specialists, academics, and practical workers to take part in  the academic research activities.    Penetratingly carrying out the principle of  administering the Army according to laws as guided by Deng  Xiaoping's thinking on military legal system. The building  of the military legal system is a major element of the troops  becoming revolutionized, modernized, and regularized, and is  also a legal guarantee for achieving the general objective of  army building. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on military  legal system boasts extremely rich content which covers the  structure of army formation, military training, higher military  education, cadres' work, logistic building, defense science and  technology, and so on. Conscientiously studying Deng Xiaoping's  thinking on the military legal system is of tremendous practical  and guiding significance to implementing the Central Military  Commission's principle of administering the Army according to  law and doing a good job of the building of military legal  system.    Expediting the process of national defense and military  legislation. In the new year, the defense and military  legislation, with the "Law on National Defense" as a dragon  head, will make a giant stride. Important laws are urgently  needed in adapting military to socialist market economic  development through stepping up the formulation of the law on  defense mobilization, the law on defense education, the law on  defense science, technology, and production, the regulations on  officers of reserve service, the law of treatment of military  personnel, and so on; and in suiting the requirements of the  army building to become revolutionized, modernized, and  regularized through stepping up the formulation and revision of  a number of important military laws and regulations, including  those on headquarters, political work, logistic work, formation  and management, managing soldiers, production and operation  management, and so on, with a view to deliberately instituting  and perfecting the military legal system and safeguarding the  country's military interests as well as the legitimate rights  and interests of the Army and servicemen.    Intensifying the implementation of the military law and  the supervision of law enforcement. It is necessary to  intensify the administrative awareness of leading cadres and  organs at all levels, enhance their level of law enforcement,  promote the implementation of military laws and regulations, and  really form a situation in which the entire Army, from top to  bottom, act according to laws, enforce laws strictly, and  investigate into cases in violation of laws resolutely. It is  also necessary to carry out supervision and examination of  enforcing military laws and regulations in a planned way on the  key points in light of the tasks, fully exploit the role of  functional departments, and incrementally establish a benign  cycle of law enforcement and supervisory mechanisms.</p>

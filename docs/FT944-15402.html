			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Rover to boost UK workforce as demand surges: Carmaker will create 1,450 jobs at plants over next six months Rover, the leading UK carmaker, is creating 1,450 jobs at its British plants in response to strongly rising sales, particularly in export markets. About 1,000 of the jobs will be at the main Rover plant at Longbridge, Birmingham, in vehicle assembly and engine production. A further 300 workers will be recruited at the Land Rover plant at Solihull, near Birmingham, to support rising production of the new Range Rover luxury four-wheel-drive vehicle, while 150 jobs will be added at the body and pressings plant at Swindon. The recruitment halts the long decline in the size of the workforce of Rover (formerly British Leyland), which has fallen from 41,700 in 1990 to 33,000 last year. The workforce has been cut from 96,000 in 1984. Rover, taken over by BMW in January, said recruitment of the workers would take place during the next six months. The workforce worldwide was being increased to about 35,500 to meet increases in production and future model programmes, which formed part of the group's Pounds 1.5bn, five-year investment plans. Next year Rover will replace its current 200/400 range and launch a new range of MG sports cars. Rover has added 1,300 jobs at its Land Rover Solihull plant in the past 18 months to support rising production of its Discovery four-wheel-drive vehicle. The group's retail sales in the first nine months worldwide rose by 9 per cent to 371,805 from 341,075 in the corresponding nine months last year with sales in continental Europe increasing up by 20 per cent. Its sales increased by only 3.2 per cent in the UK market, but Mr John Towers, Rover group chief executive, said the group was willing to accept a fall in its UK market share, as long as this was more than offset by rising exports in order to reduce its current heavy domestic reliance. 'I would be happy with a lower market share in the UK, so that sales and marketing can be in line with the positioning of the Rover brand rather than responding to business pressures,' he said.

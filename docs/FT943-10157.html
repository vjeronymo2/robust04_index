			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / A week in the Louvre: Nicholas Woodsworth doesn't know much about art so he went to THE museum to learn more It comes to us all, the sticky moment when we are expected to deliver some sort of judgment on a piece of art. It is especially sticky when we have not got the faintest idea what we are looking at. I have accompanied friends to modernist exhibitions and failed entirely to understand their appreciation. At moments like these I am one of those people who finds refuge in that lame line: 'I don't know much about art, but I know what I like.' I like Impressionism. Why this is so I am not sure. I tell myself it is because of a certain use of light, a particular liveliness of brushstroke, a fidelity to visual experiences, and so on. I have a sneaking suspicion, though, that I like late 19th century French painting simply because I have been more exposed to it than other kinds of painting. We all have. This is accessible art, purveyed to millions around the world. It is the art of the advertising world and of the postcard from Paris. Put a Monet, a Renoir or a Degas in front of me and I can look at it with familiarity. It was with some trepidation, then, that early one morning not long ago I found myself in Paris and heading for a museum. Not to the Musee d'Orsay on the left bank of the Seine, home of a superb collection of Impressionism, but to the opposite bank, to the museum - the Louvre, which, while failing to house a single Impressionist painting or any other work created after 1870, is known by name to more people than any other museum in the world. To me the Louvre was a total mystery - more than 25,000 works of art from every corner of the world and from every age of man. I had no hopes that the Louvre would provide any blinding revelations on art. But I did want to try to understand how people look at art there, and why the Louvre attracts more than 5m people a year. I had given myself a week to do so. In the past the Louvre has been a monument to the ornate 19th century classicism favoured by Napoleon III, the last traditional renovator of this 800-year-old royal complex. Today it shares that classicism with the elegantly austere modernist architecture of IM Pei, chief designer of President Francois Mitterrand's 13-year-long, Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) Louvre renovation programme. In spite of the dramatic contrast, the marriage is a happy one. Pei's spectacular glass pyramid, which now forms the main entrance to the museum in the Cour Napoleon, is but the tip of the iceberg. Formerly badly-organised, poorly-lit and ill-equipped to receive masses of people carried on the wave of today's cultural tourism, the Louvre in its new guise is generally acclaimed a great success. But if I had left behind busy Parisian streets and the familiar confusion of life, I had entered into a much less familiar confusion of art. At the reception desk below the pyramid, I picked up a museum handbook. The Louvre has seven major departments: Oriental antiquities; Egyptian antiquities; Greek, Etruscan and Roman antiquities; objets d'art; sculpture; prints and drawings; and paintings. Where to begin? Doubts assailed me. When it came to visiting museums, Bernard Berenson, pre-eminent art historian of the Renaissance, had some advice for his friends: never spend more than an hour in one. Any longer, he said, and the eyelids grow heavy, the legs protest and the spirit begins to numb. Of all the schools of art the highly-praised principles and techniques of which I have failed to understand, this is the one I understood least, so before my resolve weakened, I made straight for the Grand Galerie and the great works of the Italian Renaissance masters. Summer-time visitors thronged the great long hall. In front of groups that were constantly settling, moving on and reforming, scores of chef-d'oeuvres stretched away into the distance before me. I joined the crowds. I peered at Leonardo's The Virgin, the Child and Saint Anne. I gazed at Raphael's The Virgin and Child with Saint John the Baptist. I studied Caravaggio's The Death of the Virgin. There are endless virgins in 15th and 16th century Italian painting, though none of them swept me away. Nor did most of my fellow visitors seem impressed with the bulk of religious, classical and mythologically-inspired paintings that dominate this part of the Louvre. Apart from those few works which are famous for being famous, few held most people's attention for long. Was it the paintings' fault, or ours? I began to feel depressed. I was rescued by a man whose attention has been held in the grand galerie for a very long time indeed. I met Amal Dagher in front of Reni's Abduction of Helen, a painting which he has been looking at for hours every day for more than two months. With brush and palette and easel in tow, Dagher has been a copiste at the Louvre for 23 years. 'It was like a bolt of lightening,' he told me. 'When I first came to the Louvre and saw the Italian masters I could not believe what they had done. Nothing in the world of modern painting compares to their technique.' He pointed upwards to a foreshortened, sandled foot. 'Look at those toes. Not even a photo can get over the concept of toes as well. Aren't they marvellous]' Such accomplishments became a challenge, Dagher said. 'I had to try what they had succeeded in doing. Each time I copied a painting I learned something, and each time I was sure that the next copy would reveal the master's secrets. I am still copying and learning today.' When I told Dagher that I enjoyed Impressionism but had problems looking at the paintings that so absorbed him, he laughed. 'That is no surprise - so does everyone. Renaissance works are more difficult than Impressionist works. Technically - but also philosophically - it takes a long time to get to know them. I have spent half my life here and still don't. Impressionism captures the passing moment. The classical master's work is more considered, the result of long reflection on themes without time. We have lost the habit of thinking and looking this way. We have to learn again. That is why the Louvre is a valuable place.' How, I asked him, should one go about looking at such a vast collection as the Louvre's? 'Follow your instincts,' he said. 'First comes enthusiasm. The rest - the study, the knowledge - can come later. But try to see things by period. It is the only way we can situate them.' My instincts were to get away from the huge numbers of people billowing into the grand galerie. Just a short stroll down the hall from the mostly neglected Helen hangs the most famous resident of the Louvre. I took a quick peek over the heads of the crowd gathered in front of Leonardo's celebrated work, but made no real effort at contemplation of the Mona Lisa. It was hopeless. Like artillery barrages on a busy front the cameras flashed, the video cameras rolled and the poor woman sat bunkered down behind a screen of tinted, hardened, madman-proof glass. But I did enjoy talking to Rosa Andrades, one of the Louvre's 650 grey-uniformed museum attendants. They like change as much as we do. Rosa's favourite post is beside the Mona Lisa, not because she likes looking at the painting but because she likes looking at the people. Why, I asked her, do people come to the Louvre? They come for all sorts of reasons, and behave in all sorts of ways, she replied. Only a third are French. Many foreigners come simply because the Louvre is as famous a French tourist fixture as the Eiffel Tower or the Champs Elysees. There is sometimes, it seems, a confusion between museum and attraction park. Sundays are Rosa's least favourite day: many parents bring families through a sense of cultural duty and end up in aimless wandering. And what of public behaviour, I asked, in a place intended for private contemplation? The Japanese, she said, are obsessed with visually recording the whole experience. The Italians are ill-disciplined and good-humoured. The Americans like to talk. The French can get shirty with everyone. There was no reason for everybody to approach the Louvre with hushed reverence, but surely, I suggested, everyone treated it with respect. Not always, Rosa laughed. 'Teenagers stick bubble gum on noses in portraits. Couples climb on to the Great Sphinx to be photographed. Statues are a great temptation - we find cigarettes between their fingers, sun-glasses on their heads, red lipstick kisses on their cheeks and other places.' What other places, I asked. Rosa was not saying. But she did tell me what she thought was the strangest behaviour she had seen in her six years at the museum: a tourist marching crabwise down the corridors at high speed with a video camera to his eye, determined to take home an image of every single item displayed in the museum. As befits a place presenting the vast spectrum of human creation, the Louvre is what you make of it. Leave behind the handful of objects that draw the great crowds - there are only a dozen or so - and you will find people gliding peacefully about near-empty corridors, absorbed in their own private worlds. Nor are all tourists vulgarians. Many take on the Louvre as Amal Dagher would have them do it: slowly and thoughtfully, following their own curiosity and preferences. Entering the secret world of art is never easy, Pierre Rosenburg, the Louvre's curator of paintings, told me when I visited his office: there are many different ways of getting inside it. As the days followed and I made my own way about as a tourist, I realised that we all have different motives and approaches. In a room full of marble statuary I met an art student from Mexico who was there to study Greek proportion - she could not find it taught in any school. In the objets d'art department I chatted to a young French intellectual couple, members of the Societe des Amis du Louvre, who each week pursue a different theme. This week it was the life and times of Henry IV. In the King Francois I room, I watched an antique specialist, on his knees, explaining the arcana of 16th-century cabinet making to a group of connoisseurs. In the caryatid room I watched a class of round-eyed children ponder the marble-carved breasts and penis of the Sleeping Hermaphrodite. And I made my own discoveries. I now covet the ceramics and silk carpets in the Louvre's Islamic art rooms. In the French painting rooms I found I was enjoying not only precursors of Impressionism, such as Corot, but much earlier French painters as well - Le Sueur, de la Tour, Chardin. I was seduced by the clean, sensual lines of Ingres, and came to dislike the pompous neo-classicism of David. On and on it went. Dutch still-life, Burgundian medieval sculpture, Persian palace art, early Italian tryptics, Egyptian sarcophagi. Finally, late one afternoon, on the fifth day, I sat back in a reclining chair designed for looking at the ceiling frescoes in the Beauvais room. In a few moments the angels, doves, trumpeting musicians and naked women flying about high above began to blur, and then faded altogether. My eyes had closed. My legs were dead. My spirit was thoroughly numb. I was terminally struck with Berenson's disease. I was not, I decided, going to take another step. I had seen a small portion of the Louvre. I had learned that there was art before Impressionism. But it is quite true - the secret world of art is hard to enter in an hour, a week, a month. My next visit would have to wait. The Louvre takes time.</p>

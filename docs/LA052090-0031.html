			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Q &amp; A  </P> <P> Q: What do you think about Pan Am? I hear stories about it taking over another  airline or another airline taking it over. Is it a good investment? -- Oak  Lawn, Ill.  </P> <P> A: Pan Am has problems. Even its chairman, G. Thomas Plaskett, has been saying  publicly for a long time that the best action for Pan Am would be to become  part of a "larger route network." That means Pan Am needs to combine with one  or more airlines.  </P> <P> The hottest of the talks, according to a well-informed source, came a few  months ago when Pan Am was discussing a deal with NWA Corp., the parent of  Northwest Airlines. Those discussions have virtually ended.  </P> <P> Before that, there were talks with TWA. Carl Icahn, head of TWA, wanted Pan Am  to purchase his airline, according to a source. With more than $1 billion in  tax losses to carry forward, Pan Am can offer lower taxes to another airline if  a merger is structured in which Pan Am is technically the one doing the  acquiring.  </P> <P> Because fuel costs have declined, airlines are generally making better profits  these days. So Pan Am could be safe for a while. But next September, the  airline has a $73-million pension payment due that could stretch its liquidity  to the limit. Pan Am has requested a waiver on that payment. If it doesn't get  it, it will probably have to sell an asset. Which one? Its Boston-New  York-Washington shuttle is a likely candidate.  </P> <P> But even then, Pan Am's problems won't be over. In October, says Thomas Longman  of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Pan Am will have to pay big bills that were  deferred on leased aircraft. Longman thinks that Pan Am will lose $1.40 a share  this year, better than the $2.31 a share it lost in 1989. According to the  Institutional Brokers Estimate System computer, the average estimate is a loss  of $1.76 a share this year.  </P> <P> Q: I read recently that T. Boone Pickens, the corporate raider, said he  attacked companies first and foremost because he was trying to serve the  interest of the shareholders of his company, Mesa Petroleum.  </P> <P> I bought Mesa Limited Partnership units at $16 in 1987. They closed recently at  less than $5. I wonder who Pickens is serving? -- Palm Desert, Calif.  </P> <P> A: T. Boone Pickens did, indeed, say all he was trying to do with his forays  was serve the interests of Mesa shareholders. But sometimes people just don't  succeed in following through on their intentions.  </P> <P> David Bradshaw, the energy analyst at Paine Webber Inc., says a lot of Mesa's  problems weren't caused by Pickens. "The '80s were bad for the energy  business," Bradshaw says. The price of natural gas, Mesa's main business,  peaked in 1981 at more than $6 per 1,000 cubic feet. Recently, he says, the  price was around $1.65. Since Mesa didn't have any refining and marketing  capabilities, it couldn't insulate itself against such a steep drop in natural  gas prices.  </P> <P> Bradshaw is neutral on Mesa Limited units. They'll perform no better -- or  worse -- than the market for the next 12 months, he says. Mesa recently  announced an $18.2-million first-quarter loss and suspended cash distributions  to holders of its preferred units.  </P> <P> The company lost 24 cents a unit in 1989, contrasted with a profit of 52 cents  the year before. According to Institutional Brokers Estimate System at Lynch  Jones &amp; Ryan, an average profit of 12 cents a share is expected for Mesa  this year.  </P> <P> Q: In 1984 I bought 4,000 shares of Gemini Resources Inc. at about 40 cents  each. Lately, I've been unable to find out anything about the stock. Do you  have an address to write to? -- Hummelstown, Pa.  </P> <P> A: I think you can kiss that $1,600 good-bye. The company's last address was  878 E. Ninth St., Salt Lake City, Utah 84105. But there is no listing in the  Salt Lake City telephone directory for a firm with that name.  </P> <P> And the last time Gemini Resources stock traded over the counter was more than  two years ago -- on March 22, 1988. It was then quoted at a bid price of just  10 cents. JOHN CRUDELE  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh </F> Na'im Qasim by unidentified CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent;  place, date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Correspondent: Some  people say that lifting the international cover of the Lebanese  Forces will also lead to lifting Hizballah's cover, particularly  the Syrian and Iranian protection, because of the party's links  to the foreign hostages issue. What is your reaction to that?    Qasim: The circumstances that made eyes focus on  the Lebanese Forces are unique to the Lebanese Forces, the only  local Lebanese organization that rendered services to the  Israeli enemy by engaging in domestic sedition. This does not  apply to Hizballah, which seeks to liberate the land, drive the  Israeli enemy out of the south and the western al-Biqa', spread  peace among the people, and serve the community. Hizballah did  not gain power in the Lebanese arena through dreadful acts; it  got its status through its sincerity, major sacrifices, and the  blood of innocent martyrs who served not only the Islamic cause,  but also the Lebanese cause in the region and helped the free  people in the Arab and Muslim worlds. [passage omitted]    As for the foreign hostages, we repeated several times in  the  past that we have absolutely no connection with that file.  There is no sense in reopening that file, because we settled  the ramifications of that issue at the time. [passage omitted]    As for Hizballah, we do not rely on any international cover  for our local existence. You say that some people ask whether  the cover will be lifted from Hizballah now that it has been  lifted from the Lebanese Forces. The way the West deals with  Samir Ja'ja' and what he stands for is generally different from  the way they deal with Hizballah. We are fighters at the  international level, because we do not tolerate the continued  occupation of our lands. [passage omitted]    Correspondent: Some believe that things will get  worse if the domestic situation keeps on its current course.  How does Hizballah view the need to close all domestic files?    Qasim: We understand the meaning of balances of  rights and duties and the need for mutual coexistance. But we  do not understand this balance to mean taking the innocent with  the guilty to achieve sectarian equality. Had the Sayyidat  al-Najat Church crime been committed by Muslims, the same  measures that were taken against the Lebanese Forces should have  been taken against Muslims, if they were directly accused. That  horrible act was committed by a team of Christians, so they have  to pay the price for harming people, violating a place of  worship, and terrorizing a sector of the Lebanese people. But  opening files in every direction is not an objective measure; it  ruins Lebanon. Whoever makes mistakes and undermines public  peace must be punished. [passage omitted]    The Christians' frustration has objective causes that have  to  do with the performance of Christian political leaders. The  bloody conflicts that raged in the eastern area [of Beirut] as  part of a power struggle and the way some Christian parties  dealt with the grassroots level and with Christian citizens led  to that development and created an atmosphere of frustration  among Christians in general and the Maronites in particular.  Those bloody confrontations could have been averted. We in  Hizballah believe that rectifying that internal situation  requires that all Lebanese citizens be dealt with on the basis  of actual developments. These developments require an  Islamic-Christian openness, free of tribal fanaticism.</p>

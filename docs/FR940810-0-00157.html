			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, asbestos removal efforts reflect concern over liability claims from building occupants, and perhaps custodians and maintenance personnel. It does not include the value of prevented claims from workers who must remove the asbestos. The revised asbestos standard  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> eliminates significant risk to the extent feasible, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as defined by law, and thereby minimizes secondary liability created by attempts to minimize primary liability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Technological Feasibility and Compliance Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section examines the technological feasibility and estimated costs of compliance for the final revised asbestos standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Technological Feasibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General industry. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  OSHA's 1986 Regulatory Impact Analysis [OSHA, 1986] described in detail the controls that would be necessary in order to achieve a PEL of 0.2 f/cc in each of the affected sectors in general industry. OSHA determined that compliance with the 0.2 f/cc PEL was feasible through the use of wet methods, engineering controls, and housekeeping practices. In addition, for the following operations compliance with the PEL of 0.2 f/cc was generally not achievable without the use of respirators: the dry mechanical process in A/C pipe manufacturing and the dry mechanical, wet mechanical, and nuclear ripout processes in ship repair. Compliance with the 1.0 f/cc excursion limit promulgated in the 1988 rulemaking was also expected to lead to occasional respirator use in high-exposure activities throughout primary and secondary manufacturing [OSHA, 1988].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the revised PEL of 0.1 f/cc, some manufacturing operations will need to supplement engineering controls and work practices with respiratory protection. In all, 2,345 workers (or less than 1 percent of the 682,685 workers exposed in all affected industry sectors) in general industry are expected to need respirators at least part of the workday in order to maintain exposures below the revised PEL. Since all affected employers in general industry will be able to comply with the proposed PEL through the use of engineering controls or, where necessary, respirators, OSHA concludes that the proposed PEL is technologically feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to respirators, ancillary controls will also be needed in affected industry/process groups as a result of the lowering of the PEL. These controls include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Regulated areas;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Disposable protective clothing and gloves;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Changerooms and lockers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Shower rooms;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Lunch areas; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Annual update of the written compliance program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All ancillary controls required by the revised general industry standard are currently in extensive use throughout industry and are therefore technologically feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

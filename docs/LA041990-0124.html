			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASHTON-TATE LINKS LOSS TO FAILED PROGRAM  </P> <P> Blaming its continuing failure to ship a corrected new version for its popular  dBase software program, Ashton-Tate said Wednesday that it lost $1 million in  the first quarter on sales that declined 25% from the prior year.  </P> <P> Sales were $57 million, compared to $89.8 million last year, when profits were  $11.5 million.  </P> <P> It was the fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the Torrance company that has  been plagued with problems since releasing an error-riddled update of its  franchise-making dBase program in October, 1988. That prompted analysts to  revive speculation about the ability of the company to remain independent.  </P> <P> Ashton-Tate Chairman Edward Esber on Wednesday did not rule out the possibility  of a merger.  </P> <P> Noting the pending merger of Lotus Development and Novell into what would be  the industry's largest operation, Esber said Ashton-Tate could be attractive to  the right partner.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't rule out anything," Esber said, adding that the company has 5  million users of its dBase programs and that at its current market valuation,  the company's stock is selling for about $70 per user. "That's less than the  cost of a sales call." CARLA LAZZARESCHI  </P></p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Letter: Care of elderly creating enormous challenge Sir, The Family Policy Studies Centre research findings ('Cost of residential care 'forcing old to sell homes'', October 5) show that young people may find their legacies depleted by the cost of caring for elderly parents and may place older people in a dilemma over depriving children of their inheritance. The fact is that Britain is now facing an enormous challenge in care provision for frail elderly people. Older home-owners needing care are presently having to sell houses at lower prices in the present property slump so the capital realised buys even less residential care. As older people can now expect to live into their 90s their 'children' are probably in their 60s and pensioners themselves] Within 10 years, it is estimated another 100,000 residential places will be needed. Despite assurances by health secretary Mrs Virginia Bottomley that community care finance will be partially ring-fenced in the early years, this charity's concern is that these funds will be woefully insufficient. The government really must take a lead to sort out the matter of long-term care for ever increasing numbers of frail, elderly people. Unless it does, the nation will be faced with a serious situation where elderly frail people simply have nowhere to go and no funds. Sufferers will not be young people with no legacies, but frail elderly people, their carers and the family as a whole.

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: New York A raft of economic data due this week should provide the bond market with more meat to chew on. After last week's mixed menu, when prices dived and then soared in nervous reaction to conflicting data, the market will be hoping for some consistency in the numbers, especially in a week when the Treasury will be selling new government securities. The big event is Thursday's release of the first-quarter gross domestic product report. After 7 per cent growth in the final three months of last year, analysts expect the economy to have slowed considerably in this year's opening quarter and are predicting GDP growth close to 3.5 per cent. Anything much larger than that could spark heavy selling. In the GDP data, traders will be keeping a eye out for the implicit price-deflator - a key inflation measure - which is predicted to come in around 1.5 per cent. Among the other important figures out this week is the latest consumer confidence index (tomorrow), which is expected to be broadly flat and will be followed later in the week by data on consumer spending and personal income. The March durable goods orders are also due out. Finally, new home sales on Friday should show a sharp snapback in March sales following the weather-related declines of January and February.</p>

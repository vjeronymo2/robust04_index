			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Travel: A Moslem outpost of the Chinese empire - Peter Harris drinks tea with old men in Dali, in China's south-west province of Yunnan, and listens to a tea planter's stories of his life and times THERE IS an old Chinese saying that heaven is high and the emperor far away. In China you cannot get much further from the emperor (or rather, Deng Xiaoping), than the town of Dali in the south-west province of Yunnan, across the border from Burma. The old town gates of Dali can be seen for miles around, rising from the plains. The town is flanked on one side by a long narrow lake, and on the other by a ridge of hills running north from a mountain called Buddha Peak. It is located on a major road junction, one branch going north to Tibet, the other south to the Burmese border. The road south is the original Burma road, which Allied lorries plied 50 years ago to supply the Chinese nationalists, holed up by the Japanese in Chungking. Nowadays the main travellers to Dali are traders from south China, Tibet and Burma, and backpackers from Australia, Germany and elsewhere. The backpackers give the town an oddly familiar air. Signs in English hang from wooden house frames, advertising bicycles for hire and eggs for breakfast. Weary, suntanned travellers sit in open-air cafes nursing bottles of local beer. Women of the local Bai minority clad in vivid blue costumes and head-dresses catch you by the arm, smile disarmingly, and ask in English: 'Change money?' 'When I first came to Dali, I loved it,' the Cantonese who served me coffee and rolls in the cafe near the hotel, told me on my first morning. One of a growing number of people from south China who roam around looking for casual jobs, he had been in and out of Dali for years. 'But now everyone here just thinks about money, and there's a lot of backbiting and rivalry. As for these foreign travellers,' he went on, 'they come mainly for the dope.' In fact, drugs are not much in evidence in Dali, in spite of a growing cross-border heroin trade that worries the authorities. Nor is there much sign of the money-making fever that is gripping other parts of China. But this remote outpost of empire has not been immune to the winds of change. In the spartan old days, I was told, my hotel was just the Dali Number Two Government Guest House. Now it has a new name, and a new look. It is the Red Mountain Camellia Hotel, and sports a roof with gold tiles and fresh paint on the eaves. A huge, rambling affair, it is the best in town and good value for money. A comfortable room with bathroom and closed-circuit colour TV - no satellite dish here - costs about Pounds 8 at the official exchange rate, and on my first night a dinner of mushrooms, Yunnan ham, greens and dumplings cost less than 50p. Dinner was served with a flourish by an ebullient chef, anxious to please his foreign guests. He turned out to be an exception, though. On the whole, service in the hotel still came socialist-style. The woman on the front desk was amazed by my request to have my laundry ironed (no irons). And the maid was equally bemused when I asked for my room key (no keys, other than the ones on her key-ring). The view from my hotel window included one of Dali's four Tang dynasty pagodas, heavily restored but still elegant, and the courtyard of the public library. Each morning the courtyard filled with old people going through the slow, graceful movements of the Chinese callisthenic exercise taijiquan. Less graceful was the clatter of machine-gun fire that broke the calm on my first evening. This turned out to be a contingent of the People's Liberation Army on the firing range of the local barracks. The army has a high profile in Dali, in keeping with the town's frontier location. It runs a hospital - on the basis of 'revolutionary humanitarianism,' as the notice on the gate declares - and men in green uniforms and plimsolls are to be seen on the outskirts of town planting trees and digging ditches. The guidebooks say Dali dates back 3,000 years. It was a flourishing kingdom during the Tang and Song dynasties, after which it was overrun by Kublai Khan and the Mongols. One legacy of Dali's history is that most of its inhabitants are Moslem. There are two delapidated mosques tucked away on the west side of town, both of them in the Chinese style, with a large prayer hall and an imam but no minarets. One of them was full of old men drinking tea and gossiping when I dropped in. A sheet of red paper was pinned on the front door. Usually, in China, red paper is used for messages and slogans from the communist party. But this displayed a list of the names of local Moslems who had given money for the mosque's upkeep. The centre of Dali's old town is a delightful place in which to stroll. Unlike most Chinese cities it is virtually free of traffic, and consists of narrow cobbled streets, secluded courtyard homes and noisy street markets. The markets sell hats and sweatshirts made from the local blue-dyed cloth, and cups and bowls cut from the local marble (known throughout China as Dali stone). An enterprising Tibetan has a permanent art show ('The Neeman Gallery') at the Dali museum, with oils by masters of the Yunnan School on display. Their work, better known in New York than Dali, is a cross between Miro, Gauguin and the murals on the London Underground. Beyond the old city gates, on the outskirts of town, are the homes of the Bai people. The Bai's two-storey houses are in striking contrast to the drab brick dwellings of the local Han Chinese. Bai houses are trim and whitewashed, with carved wooden balconies overlooking well-kept vegetable and flower gardens. It is some time since I have seen an English country garden, and I must confess the sight of these gardens warmed my heart. Above the Tang pagodas to the west of Dali are fine walks in the hills. On my second day I found my way up through an Islamic graveyard scattered with Arabic epitaphs to a secluded stone pathway winding into the forest. It was like a poem by the great Tang poet Wang Wei - rather, it would have been if there had been a temple at the top. Instead, all I found was a stone wall and a space full of bracken. I assumed this was the work of Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. Certainly Dali suffered a great deal of damage then, or so I was told by a local tea planter, who stopped me on my way up. He told me stories of his life and times, and ended up asking whether I was a Christian or a communist. (For some reason it seems I had to be one or the other). More adventurous holidaymakers can take boats across the lake, hire horse-drawn carriages, or hike to the many historic sites scattered around the Dali region. The only real problem with Dali is getting there. The best bet is probably the 12-hour trip on the Polish-made night bus that plies the Burma road from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province. There are also taxis and minibus tours, but the latter have to be fixed in advance. A railway line, an airport and a luxury hotel by the lake are all in the planning stage. If and when they are built - the rail line will have to be cut through mountainous terrain - Dali's tourism industry will boom. The town will also lose much of its present sleepy appeal. Doubtless, though, the Bai women will learn to smile even more disarmingly than they do at present. Air China and Dragon Air fly from Hong Kong to Kunming. The best hotel in Kunming, where travel to Dali can be arranged, is the King World, Kunming, fax: (0871)-31910, tel: (0871)-38888. Telephone for the Red Mountain Camellia (Hong Shan Cha) Hotel in Dali: (0872)-70427, but lines are poor and reservations best made through an agent in Kunming or Hong Kong. Malaria has been reported from Yunnan, and some doctors advise travellers in the area to take prophylactics.</p>

The protesters did not resort to  violence, did not even get close to the sidewalk [in Victory  Square], but the authorities continue to incite, unquote. The  communique requests support from all state institutions to adopt  a positive stance as soon as possible to avoid possible  regrettable violence.    Another communique released by the National Trade Union  Bloc,  in its capacity as a participant in the rally organized by Alfa  Cartel, informs public opinion about, quote, the constant and  arrogant refusal of the executive to solve the problems of the  trade unions and, at the same time, the obviously hypocritical  way in which dialogue is being mimed, unquote.</p>

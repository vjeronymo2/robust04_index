			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Yeltsin steps up pressure for coalition PRESSURE is building on President Mikhail Gorbachev to agree to a coalition government after renewed appeals by two key republican leaders for such a compromise and the unveiling of central government anti-crisis measures which cannot be implemented without republican support. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian federation leader, urged President Gorbachev at the weekend to hold 'round table' talks with all political forces to stop the country disintegrating, as a crippling strike by coal miners demanding the Soviet leader's resignation threatened to spread to other sectors of the economy. 'Sitting at this round table should be Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and other representatives of the republics, of the Communist and other parties and movements, and of strikers, including the miners. Does this question need to be resolved somehow? Yes it does, otherwise that will be it. The country will disintegrate,' Mr Yeltsin said before leaving for a visit to France. Meanwhile party officials quoted by the official news agency Tass yesterday sought to quash rumours that the Communist party was seeking to oust Mr Gorbachev. President Nursultan Nazarbayev, of Kazakhstan, who has tried to bring Mr Yeltsin and Mr Gorbachev together, said he feared it was already too late for them to reach agreement. But he echoed Mr Yeltsin's call for a coalition government, saying that the country was in danger of succumbing 'to a more brutal dictatorship than the old totalitarian system'. Mr Nazarbayev was speaking in an interview published the day after Mr Valentin Pavlov, Soviet Prime Minister, submitted to deputies an anti-crisis programme which relies on co-operation with the republics. 'We need a government of national confidence which will have a clear programme and its own think-tank, and which will offer urgent measures for resolving the crisis,' the Kazakh leader told Komsomolskaya Pravda. Official statistics published at the weekend said coal output fell 82 per cent in March following the start of the miners' strike. Non-ferrous metals production was down 7 per cent in the first quarter, while other sectors showed a fall in production ranging from 6 per cent in machine tools to 15 per cent in timber. Meanwhile, the republic of Georgia sought to boost its campaign for independence when its parliament yesterday elected Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the parliamentary chairman, as its state president, in a preliminary step to calling direct presidential elections next month. Transport in and through the republic has been paralysed because of a three-day strike by rail workers demanding Soviet troops withdraw from South Ossetia.</p>

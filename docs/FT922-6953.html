			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Price war cuts RHM to Pounds 49m RANKS HOVIS McDougall, the UK's largest baker, yesterday revealed the effects of the deepening bread price war with a sharper-than-expected 36 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 48.5m. The group also indicated that trading in the second half remained difficult and said annual profits would be significantly lower than last year. Analysts, surprised at the depth of price-cutting and at difficulties in RHM's US market, cut full-year forecasts from Pounds 110m to between Pounds 95m and Pounds 98m. Although the company had warned in January of lower profits, analysts said the indications were that price-cutting was deepening. Mr Paul Coker, managing director, said the company intended to pursue volume, even at the expense of margin. 'If you haven't got volume you haven't got a business,' he said. RHM, which entered the bread price war in the new year, had begun to rebuild the volume lost when it refused to cut prices last autumn, Mr Coker said. Turnover for the six months to February 29 rose by Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 773.7m. RHM did not intend to close any more of its 18 bakeries, he added. 'If there has to be capacity taken out, others can do it.' The milling and bread baking division, the group's largest business which includes brands such as Hovis, saw pre-tax profits drop by 62 per cent to Pounds 12.6m. The cakes business, home of Mr Kipling, also suffered from price-cutting and profits fell from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 5.1m. In the US, RHM suffered the effects of higher peanut prices and a surplus of tomatoes, which resulted in a squeeze on ketchup margins. Pre-tax profits in North America fell by 84 per cent to Pounds 900,000. Both grocery products that and food services increased profits through cost-cutting and rationalisation, Mr Coker said. Earnings dropped by 35 per cent to 9.6p but the interim dividend is maintained at 3.82p. COMMENT RHM's shares proved remarkably resilient despite the results yesterday, closing up 5p at 234p. This has less to do with bullish sentiment than the fact that RHM maintained the interim dividend, making the yield a healthy 8 per cent. Yet, on full year estimates dividend cover falls to about 1.5 times - compared with a sector average of more than two times - and only marginally higher for 1993. There is also the threat that RHM is not generating enough profit to make the pay-out and it will have to use cash balances to do so. On full-year forecasts of Pounds 95m, the prospective p/e of 12.1 times leaves little reason to buy. Given next year's outlook there appears to be even less reason to hold.</p>

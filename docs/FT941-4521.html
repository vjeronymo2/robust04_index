			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control Sytems (11): Window on the world - Integrated accounting in manufacturing / For Henkel, the manufacturing group, linking existing 'islands of automation' to create an integrated view brought the benefits of the new, without losing the familiarity of old tools One problem facing Henkel, the chemicals, cosmetics and household products group, was a good one to have: that of integrating its operations as the group expanded. Brand names such as Aapri, Silkience and Pritt sticks are probably more familiar names than that of their manufacturer, Henkel. But the German-based group is large - Dollars 8bn turnover and 140 production units - with interests in domestic and industrial chemical products, DIY products, including wallpaper. In the UK, finance director Norbert Frank explains the problem: 'Different people need to look at different things: margins achieved within a period, manufacturing performance, yield, wastage, and so on. We had many applications on our System 38 - all good 'island' solutions, but not integrated.' He wanted closer financial control, with financial systems that would link with sales and distribution, manufacturing, production planning, and human resources. (See 'enterprise' in buzzwords, page 4). A complete upgrade left the coast clear for new hardware - AS400 or a Unix computer - and a fresh start, with GUI (graphical user interface) and Windows. Mr Frank was convinced that he had found a state-of-the art offering in the new R3 package from SAP, whose mainframe accounting solution R/2 had long been in use in the German parent company. 'It combines the Windows world with the applications software,' says Mr Frank, 'and I have not seen any other package that does that.' The main attraction of R3 was the ease of use, and its executive information system or EIS-like facilities. 'The benefits are the transparency and accessibility of financial data. We can now 'drill down,' looking at an individual account balance and then right down to a single transaction or document, but at the same time, access is easy at the highest level, using 'drop down' windows,' he says. Another benefit was that users did not have to abandon their Excel spreadsheets. Users can simply choose Excel from within R/3. Henkel has been treated very much as a pilot site for R3 in the UK. The implementation uses a Hewlett-Packard 9890 database server and 9730 computers in a client/server configuration with PCs, and will eventually support 250 users in the UK alone. Mr Frank's 'anchor group' has forged a configuration that is likely to be adopted elsewhere in the Henkel group, in the Asia Pacific operations. The first part of the project went live in April 1993, after a six-month period in which SAP provided a full consultancy service. This accounted for around Pounds 500,000 worth of the Pounds 2.5 project total, with a Pounds 1m expenditure on software, and Pounds 1m on hardware. According to Mr Frank it has been a revelation, exciting even, to emerge from a more limited world into an 'Open' system that can expand with the company. 'It is not just a matter of turning on the the screen and making a better decision. We are growing by acquisition at the rate of one a year, and now we can easily integrate any acquired business on a Unix platform. 'Now, people are all using the same data at different levels of the hierarchy. Decisions will be made on this data as we build up an executive information system, which will work at different levels for users in different areas.'

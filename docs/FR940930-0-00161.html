Imposing such liability on the certifier is an outgrowth and systhesis of the two options presented in the proposal. Following is a discussion of the significant advantages and disadvantages inherent in each of the proposed options, a response to pertinent pubic comments, and the final approach being promulgated today.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 247(c) states that ``any person who converts conventional vehicles to clean-fuel vehicles *&blank;*&blank;* shall be considered a manufacturer for purposes of sections 206 and 207 and related enforcement provisions.'' To implement this requirement EPA considered two options in the NPRM regarding the definition of the ``person who converts.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the first proposed option, the person(s) who installs a conversion configuration on a vehicle in order to convert the vehicle into a CFV would be liable as a manufacturer under section 247(c). Thus, a person installing a conversion kit would be required to obtain a federal certificate of conformity for that conversion configuration. Under the second proposed option, both the conversion kit manufacturer and the installer of the kit would be liable as manufacturers under 247(c). In the second option, the kit manufacturer and the installer would both have responsibilities in demonstrating that a vehicle converted to a CFV complies with the CFV standards and with EPA's regulations promulgated under section 247(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A significant advantage inherent in the first option is that liability is easily assigned and enforcement is less complicated if a single entity is held accountable for warranting each vehicle's emissions performance and is subject to production line testing requirements. The existence of such a sole liable party may also make it easier for purchasers of converted vehicles to seek redress for emissions performance failures under warranty provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, EPA believes that the installer may not be the appropriate party on which to focus all liability. Commenters indicated that the kit manufacturer is in the best position to perform the required certification testing. In addition, EPA believes that the first proposed option would result in a larger number of certifiers, and multiple certificates for the same conversion configuration. This would complicate enforcement and warranty actions by increasing the number or parties against whom such actions would need to be taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters also noted the need for strong warranty and recall provisions in order to increase public confidence in the performance of converted vehicles. EPA believes that the existence of a large number of certifier-installers, many of whom may be relatively small businesses with limited financial resources <FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>  will adversely affect the confidence of purchasers of converted vehicles in their ability to pursue warranty claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Mobile Sources, ``A Preliminary Assessment of the Gaseous Fuels Aftermarket Conversions Industry, EPA Contract 68&hyph;C1&hyph;0059, September 28, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second option offers the advantage of allowing EPA to hold kit manufacturers legally responsible for some or all of the certification, production line testing, in-use testing, warranty, and recall requirements. EPA believes it will be more practical to focus enforcement efforts on kit manufacturers than on installers, given the large number of installers in relation to the number of kit manufacturers. This option would also allow EPA to distribute the responsibility for certification, and warranty and recall between a kit manufacturer and installers in a manner consistent with their abilities and level of involvement in the conversion process. Public comment was generally in support of adopting this option and favored holding conversion kit manufacturers responsible for in-use emission performance of kit hardware except where performance failures result from poor installation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A significant disadvantage in this approach is that, though EPA could bring an action against either the kit manufacturer or the installer for any violation of the Act, as both would be jointly and severally liable, factual disputes between the parties regarding the actual cause of the emission failure could become a complicating factor during an enforcement action. This could lead to lengthy proceedings between the involved parties which in turn may delay resolution of emission problems and/or the compensation to vehicle owners for in-use performance problems covered under vehicle warranty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

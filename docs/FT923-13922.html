			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses respond to recovery in the dollar YESTERDAY's recovery in the dollar gave bourses a better day, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw the dollar improve 3 1/2 pfg to DM1.51, reversed direction and restored some serious share price falls of a day before. This, and a modicum of good company news, left the DAX 6.46 better at 1,757.64 after a token 0.05 gain for the FAZ in midsession. Volume fell from DM5.2bn to DM4.7bn. Among the DAX stocks, the big three chemicals put in bigger than average gains; Degussa and Metallgesellschaft recovered DM8.60 to DM331.80 and DM6.30 to DM401.50, the former helped by supportive comment and the latter by speculation about higher metals prices, and news of a cooperation agreement with Deutsche Babcock on power plant production. In construction, Hochtief rose DM15 to DM1,217 on a 19 per cent rise in first half output. In retailing, Kaufhof rose DM8.50 to DM520.50 on the prospect of a 20 per cent increase in earnings this year; Asko continued its recovery with a DM19 rise to DM710. Elsewhere, AMB put on DM27 to DM895 after its accord with the French insurer, AGF, over voting rights attached to AGF's stake in AMB; the agreement also paved the way for Credit Lyonnais to become a majority shareholder in BfG Bank, a substantial drain on AMB since 1987. PARIS rose in a technical reaction to its recent losses but trading was thin ahead of the Bastille holidays on Monday and Tuesday. The CAC 40 index rose 14.09 to 1,861.84 in turnover of FFr1.6bn. LVMH was a prominent winner, adding FFr118 or 3.2 per cent to FFr3,780 on news that turnover rose around 5 per cent in the first half. Among stocks participating in the rebound, Suez rose FFr6.90 to FFr273.80, Total FFr2.50 to FFr235, Michelin FFr5.20 to FFr204.2 and Euro Disney FFr1.90 to FFr106.90. Valeo fell FFr24 to FFr745 on news that CGIP had sold a 1.4 per cent stake in the car parts maker during the third week of June and that it intended to sell its remaining 3.7 per cent. MILAN closed firmer in a technical rebound after its recent weakness. But trading was thin ahead of details of the government's interim budget, due to be released today. The Comit index rose 4.09 to 433.21 in turnover estimated at less than Wednesday's L89.5bn. The insurer, Fondiaria eased L550 to L24,500 on fears that the accord between France's AGF and Germany's AMB could hurt the Italian company's own projects with AMB. Benetton fell to L10.905 on reports that a domestic broker had cut its earnings estimates for the textile company, but recovered to L11,600, down L250, on a 15 per cent increase in first-half net profit. Telecoms steadied after their recent drop, with Stet closing L19 higher at L1,569 and Sip recovering L35 to L1,203. ZURICH saw thin trading and the employment agency, Adia, which does substantial US business, topped the active list as it rose SFr9 to SFr304. The SMI index rose 9.1 to 1,846.7. Ciba-Geigy registered rose SFr6 to SFr682 following news that EMS Chemie had sold 70,000 at an unknown price. There had been talk of a major seller in Ciba. Bearers in the watchmaker, SMH, rose SFr65 to SFr1,260 in active trading on the acquisition of two small Swiss companies, the watchmaker, Blancpain, and the watch movements manufacturer, Frederic Piguet. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index added 1.3 to 122.10. Unilever was the main beneficiary of the dollar's recovery, adding Fl 2.30 to Fl 187.30. The truckmaker Daf added 40 cents to Fl 21.70 on reports that it might receive a Fl 100m loan from the government. STOCKHOLM rebounded in low volume, the Affarsvarlden General index closing 7.6 higher at 885.1 as turnover dropped from SKr552m to SKr284m. The pharmaceuticals group, Astra, led active stocks, the B gaining SKr4 to SKr518 on their defensive qualities. Volvo went against the trend, the B shares retreating SKr4 to SKr370. Dealers attributed this partly to a French government report on Tuesday, which was gloomy about Volvo's prospects, and to the dollar's effect on Volvo revenues. VIENNA was volatile, the ATX index hitting a low of 887.84, recovering to close 7.37 lower on the day at 900.25, and indicated lower again after hours following the surprise resignation of the OMV chairman, Mr Siegfried Meysel. OMV fell Sch20 during the session to Sch784 but after news of Mr Meysel's resignation it fell to Sch747 in London.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUL 9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Hourly changes   Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1122.29  1122.48  1123.51  1124.84  1123.69  1126.77  1127.49  1128.17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         Day's High  1128.43            Day's Low  1118.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------     Jul 8        Jul 7        Jul 6        Jul 3        Jul 2    1121.53      1129.83      1134.09      1142.19      1134.63  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

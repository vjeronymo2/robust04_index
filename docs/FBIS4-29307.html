			<p>BFN     [Text] Another P [Philippine peso] 8.7 billion will be  pumped into the agriculture and irrigation sectors in the coming  months as the Ramos government primes up its countryside  development program.    In a statement released yesterday, National Economic and  Development Authority (NEDA) Director General Cielito Habito  reported that President Ramos who also heads the NEDA Board has  given the go signal for the implementation of six infrastructure  development projects located in the countryside.    The largest budgetary outlay of P6.1 billion was earmarked  for the Arterial Road Links Development Project.    Under the project, a total of 327.8 kilometers of arterial  or  secondary roads in different parts of the country will be  cemented.    Once completed, 96 percent of the country's arterial road  network will have been paved, Mr. Habito said.    Other projects in the approved package are:    -- The P399.8 million Angat Afterbay Regulator Dam which  involves the rehabilitation of the main diversion structure of  the Angat-Maasim River Irrigation System that serves about  28,316 hectares of agricultural lands;    -- The P578.1 million Optimum Water Utilization and Rural  Development Project, which includes the construction of the  Aganan River Irrigation System to improve farm productivity and  promote efficient water and land resource utilization through  the improvement of irrigation facilities, construction of  post-harvest facilities, and procurement of necessary equipment;    -- The P451.1 million Catubig Valley Rural Development  Project, which will construct and provide agriculture and rural  infrastructure as well as agricultural support services, flood  protection and schistosomiasis control;    -- The P688.6 million 18th RP [Republic of the Philippines]-  Japan Increased Food Production Program, under which the  Japanese Government will provide commodity assistance in the  form of fertilizers, pesticides, machinery and equipment; and    -- The P450 million U.S. Public Law 480 Title I for 1994 for  the importation of soybean meal for sale to poultry and hog  raisers and feedmillers in the country.    The approval of the projects dovetails with the economic  thrust of the Ramos administration for agri-based industrial  development in the different regions and growth areas.    At present, more than half of the industrial output of the  country comes from Metro Manila and its neighboring provinces.    It is the medium-term design of government to disperse the  industrial activities to the countryside.    Among the major growth areas being eyed by the Ramos  Administration are the former U.S. military bases in Subic and  San Fernando, the Northwestern Luzon growth quadrangle, the  Cagayan de Oro-Iligan Corridor and the South  Cotabato-Sarangani-General Santos area.</p>

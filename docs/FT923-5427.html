			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Seatbelts fastened for a bumpy ride: Lufthansa is facing the worst crisis of its 66-year history Lufthansa is facing the worst crisis of its 66-year history, buffetted by excessive costs, tough competition at a time of world economic weakness, and the consequences of its own over-expansion. The German airline will today announce a comprehensive package of job cuts, fleet reductions, streamlining of routes, and other measures which it hopes will save up to DM1bn (Pounds 300m) a year from 1995. It has managed to obtain reluctant acceptance for its plans from the unions, uneasily aware that Lufthansa's existence is at stake. Mr Jurgen Weber, the chief executive, will have been in office for a year when the Frankfurt-based airline's stringent Programme 93, worked out in the face of mounting losses, is presented today. 'It's not been as I imagined it would be', he said of the rough period Lufthansa has gone through since he took over the top job. Lufthansa's problems are partly due to the harsh economic and airline industry environment in which it is now operating and partly to the ambitious expansion by his predecessor, the prickly, overbearing Mr Heinz Ruhnau. In the three years to 1991, the group has increased employee numbers by 13,000 people to 62,000 (of which 50,000 are at the airline itself) and its fleet by 120 aircraft to 275. It has added to its domestic route network, on which it lost DM350m last year, as a result of unification - new destinations in the past three years include Berlin, Dresden, and Leipzig - and spent heavily on new aircraft for all its operations, including the Condor charter line. Group capital spending exceeded DM8bn in the three-year period. Mr Weber, 51, is discreet about the policies pursued under his predecessor, saying only: 'From today's viewpoint, we can only establish that we have too many aircraft'. Moreover, in the present dire state of the industry, it is hard to sell second-hand aircraft. Those which it cannot sell are mostly parked in the Arizona desert. This year, it is taking 26 aircraft out of service. Eleven options on aircraft for delivery next year will not be taken up and another eight deliveries have been postponed from 1993 to the following year. It has trimmed its European capacity this year by around 11 per cent on the original plan and hopes to operate more cost effectively with its new Lufthansa Express operation on domestic routes. All this has meant tough negotiations with unions. DAG, the white-collar union whose members include pilots, engineers, and technicians, made a big initial concession when it offered to accept pay cuts and longer working hours to help Lufthansa in its crisis. The bigger oTV public sector union, representing lower paid staff, has also come round in the end to the need for sacrifices. It is little comfort to Mr Weber that other airlines are negotiating equally bumpy squalls. In most cases, their costs are not as high as Lufthansa's. British Airways is constantly cited as an example of how an airline can move from being fat, lazy, and unpopular to lean, efficient, and profitable. Its agreed purchase of a Dollars 750m minority stake in USAir, with which the German company also held talks, shows that Lufthansa is now in no position to take the initiative when it comes to expansion. Lufthansa admits it could not afford the USAir price tag, though officials say they are not convinced that the airline would have been the best partner. Mr Weber also points out that British Airways had strong government support when implementing its own recovery programme. Even so, he is on the defensive in an increasingly unforgiving market. Because of the differing terms of international airline agreements, Lufthansa says it has a raw deal on the Atlantic. Unlike British Airways, which has wide access to US destinations, Lufthansa is more restricted. Mr Weber has fulminated against the unfairness of the US-German aviation accord, urging a tougher government line. He believes that the Bonn government is now ready, like the French, to end the bilateral deal if Washington does not offer improved conditions. If Lufthansa had similar access to the US, it would also make profits across the North Atlantic instead of losing heavily, Mr Weber says. As it is, Lufthansa has been reducing the proportion of its total business accounted for by North Atlantic business from 30 per cent to around 20 per cent this year, cutting flights to Charlotte and Philadelphia from Frankfurt, to Miami from Hamburg and Dusseldorf, and to New York from Hamburg. It is still looking for a partner to help it develop the US market by carrying Lufthansa passengers on to other destinations. According to Mr Weber 'we are seeking a bride'. Lufthansa is also interested in link-ups elsewhere. For example, it hopes to take a stake in Malev, the Hungarian carrier. Mr Weber said: 'We are no longer participating in a total struggle for market shares, but getting away from this. This means more co-operation and stakes in shared operations.' However, Lufthansa intends to be more aggressive in its marketing, drawing on its strengths of geography through its central European location, quality through its Germanic thoroughness and efficiency, and economic pull as the national airline of one of the world's most prosperous countries. If Lufthansa's strategy works, Mr Wever hopes it will break even again after 1995. For all on board, it will be a long and tough haul.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LUFTHANSA Consolidated figures            1987            1988             1989  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total turnover              10,961.0        11,845.4         13,055.3 DMm  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-tax income                 206.9           240.9            259.8 (loss) DMm  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Employees                     47,150          49,056           51,942 (annual average)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Seat-kilometres             57,038.2        61,691.4         65,058.5 offered (m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Seat load factor (%)              70              69               69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of aircraft               151             156              197  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LUFTHANSA Consolidated figures            1990            1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total turnover              14,447.0        16,100.6 DMm  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-tax income                 142.4         (300.9) (loss) DMm  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Employees                     57,567          61,791 (annual average)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Seat-kilometres             75,504.6        81,661.8 offered (m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Seat load factor (%)              67              64  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of aircraft               220             275  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Lufthansa</p>

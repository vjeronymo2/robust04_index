			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / 15 schools may be converted into City technology colleges ABOUT 15 schools could be converted into city technology colleges next year under plans being developed by the City Technology Colleges Trust. The trust hopes to use a change to the law, introduced in the Education Bill now before parliament, which will allow established schools to take technology college status if they have opted out of local education authority control. The colleges, introduced in the Education Reform Act of 1988, were at first intended to be purpose-built new schools funded only by business sponsorship. Under the trust's plans commercial sponsors would provide a minimum of Pounds 50,000 a school, while the government would provide at least Pounds 200,000. This new route to technology college status is thought to offer similar standards for a lower cost than that of a purpose-built college, which requires backing of about Pounds 8m from companies. Sir Cyril Taylor, chairman of the trust, said 31 schools had already been approved to become technology college affiliates after increasing the length of the school day and introducing more science and technology courses. He said there was a backlog of schools wanting to apply. Between 10 and 15 of the 31 will be put forward for full college status once the Education Bill becomes law. The Department for Education said yesterday that the criteria used to vet each application had not yet been decided.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo], has postponed his trip to South Africa,  which was scheduled for tomorrow, until 4 February due to  organizational problems.    Dhlakama explained that the trip has been postponed because  contacts "with some South African businessmen," whom he did not  identify, have not been confirmed. The Renamo leader also said  he does not have confirmation on his meeting with the National  Party, but his supporters in South Africa "are making sure that  the meeting takes place."    He stated that the visit is aimed at establishing friendship  ties between Renamo and South African parties, including Nelson  Mandela's African National Congress [ANC].    "The planned visit to Portugal and Spain will still take  place in February," but the dates have not yet been set.    Meanwhile, Afonso Dhlakama said that he met with U.S.  Ambassador to Mozambique Dennis Jets in Maputo on 27 January,  with whom he discussed issues linked to the implementation of  the peace process.    Afonso Dhlakama said "I am the one who requested the meeting  with the U.S. ambassador to discuss the peace process, and for  me to explain my concerns with the Social Economic Council,"  adding that he discussed the same issue with UN Special  Representative Aldo Ajello.    Dhlakama said "both the U.S. ambassador and Dr. Ajello found  Renamo to be right and said that it is up to Renamo to convince  the Mozambican Government on this issue".    The Renamo leader reiterated that he will continue "fighting  for Renamo's right to know how the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo] is managing state funds, because, in South Africa for  instance, the ANC does not allow the government to use a cent  without its knowledge."    Some observers noted, however, that the South African  Government and the ANC "guide themselves through an agreement,  and that the Mozambican Government and Renamo also guide  themselves, or should guide themselves, through the agreement  signed by both--that is, the situations are completely  different, as there are differences between ANC and Renamo."</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KIROV'S (PROVISIONAL) ORANGE COUNTY CAST  </P> <P> The Kirov Ballet has announced partial, tentative casting for its nine-day  engagement at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, opening  Aug. 18.  </P> <P> However, Kirov artistic director Oleg Vinogradov revises casting as he goes  along, as he told The Times recently in New York.  </P> <P> The opening night Aurora in "The Sleeping Beauty" in Costa Mesa will be Galina  Mezentseva, with Evgeny Neff as Prince Desire and Lubov Kunakova as the Lilac  Fairy. Mezentseva, a controversial ballerina, and Neff were both prominent in  the Kirov's 1986 engagement at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Also on Aug. 18: Tatiana Terekhova as Princess Florine, and Kirill Melnikov, a  stylish classical dancer not on the previous tour who is emerging as one of the  company's strongest dancers.  </P> <P> On Aug. 19, the roles in "Sleeping Beauty" will be taken by Zhanna Ayupova,  Farukh Ruzimatov, Yulia Makhalina, Elena Pankova and Vitali Tsvetkov.  </P> <P> Ayupova was a secondary dancer on the 1986 tour and recently attracted  attention in the title role of "Giselle," a ballet not to be seen here.  Ruzimatov, known for flashy temperament, has generated much excitement during  recent tours.  </P> <P> At the Aug. 20 matinee of "Sleeping Beauty," the roles will be taken by  Kunakova, Konstantin Zaklinsky, Mezentseva, Veronika Ivanova and Melnikov. Both  Kunakova and Zaklinsky also were prominent in the 1986 tour. Zaklinsky appeared  in American Ballet Theatre's production of "Swan Lake" in March in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Petipa's "Le Corsaire," as reconstructed by Pyotr Gusev and Yuri Slonimsky,  will open at 8 p.m. on Aug. 22 with Altynai Assylmuratova, Neff, Pankova,  Zaklinsky and Ruzimatov.  </P> <P> Assylmuratova, arguably the company's international favorite, appeared with  Zaklinsky, her husband, in ABT's "Swan Lake" in Los Angeles and previous to  that with Ruzimatov in "La Bayadere" in New York.  </P> <P> The cast for "Le Corsaire" at 8 p.m. on Aug. 23 will include Terekhova, Eldar  Aliev, Irina Chistiakova, Tsvetkov and Melnikov. Terekhova, a strong classical  dancer, was seen briefly when she guested last season with the Moscow Classical  Ballet at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.  </P> <P> The cast for "Le Corsaire" at 8 p.m. on Aug. 24 will be the same as on Aug. 22.  </P> <P> Casting for the repertory bills is yet to be announced. Vinogradov has said  that although the company's historic ventures into Balanchine repertory --  "Scotch Symphony" and "Theme and Variations" -- are not scheduled on the Costa  Mesa run, "sometimes there are surprises." These ballets were seen in New York  and Washington.  </P> <P> Information: (714) 556-2787.  </P></p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Motoring: A sporting treble from Honda There is a scurrilous rumour, spread by young men whose favourite reading matter is go-faster motoring magazines, that all Honda cars leave the factory with an orange disabled parking sticker on the windscreen and a Zimmer frame in the boot. This is as untrue as it is unfair. Of course, people with the wisdom that comes only with age do buy lots of Hondas. They know they are reliable, hold their value, and combine the refinement of the Jaguars and large Rovers they once drove with running costs a pensioner can afford. It would have been amusing to have had a member of the 'Hondas are fit only for the well over-60s' brigade sitting beside me for the last three weeks. I have been enjoying entertaining (though safe and responsible) motoring in a trio of Honda coupes. You might call them Honda's sporting treble. First, the Civic Coupe. A cynic would dismiss this pretty, semi-sporting four-seater with a realistic boot as a sheep in wolf's clothing but that is to miss its point. A lot of people are buying cars mainly because they like their looks and can afford the price. The Civic coupe looks as if it would be a high performer. In fact, it goes well, but no better than the Civic hatchback or saloon whose mechanical bits and pieces (1.5-litre, 16-valve engine and five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission) it shares. Power steering is standard. Its suspension is reasonably taut and handling reactions agreeably quick. On some road surfaces there is a surfeit of tyre noise but this little coupe - made in Honda's US factory to traditional Japanese quality standards - is really quite urbane in character. One could use it for commuting or shopping in the week and head for the open road - should you be lucky enough to find one - at the weekend. It would perform either role just as capably. The price is the pleasantest surprise of all; from Pounds 10,900 (manual) or Pounds 11,670 (automatic) and its fuel consumption up to 39mpg or 7.5 l/100km). Grandmas and women in their 20s alike fell for its charms while I had it on test. Next, I moved on to the latest Pounds 21,445 Honda Prelude with a 2.2-litre V-TEC engine. V-TEC stands for variable valve timing and lift electronic control. What it does is to endow an engine with a benign form of schizophrenia. At low speeds it thinks it is a carthorse, at high speeds a racehorse. The result is that you can drive the Prelude at 30mph in 5th gear without a hint of protest. But floor the accelerator in second or third, see the rev counter needle flick past 5,000rpm, and the engine totally changes character. There is a musical rasp from the exhaust and the quiet, easy-going plodder becomes a sprinter. Honda claims a top speed of 140mph/225kph and 0-60mph (0-96kph) acceleration in 7.1 seconds. In the real world of speed limits, it is the Prelude's other virtues that impress. For example, the unique electronic all-wheel steering. This makes it almost disconcertingly nimble in town traffic and takes the threat of tail-wag out of emergency manoeuvres on wet roads. This beautifully built four-seater (children fit better in the back than adults) comes with air conditioning, anti-lock brakes, twin airbags and powered sunroof. It will do around 31mpg (9.1 l/100km) - providing the V-TEC engine is not in racehorse mode too often. Finally, the NSX is a true supercar, in the same performance class as a Ferrari. It is made almost entirely from aluminium alloys - the technology is more aerospace than automotive - and the engine is a 270 horsepower V6 3-litre with V-TEC. I had driven it previously on the de-restricted German autobahn and on the banked high-speed circle at Millbrook proving ground in Bedfordshire. So I knew that the faster it went, the safer it felt and that Honda's claimed 160mph/257kph maximum was attainable. But this time I used it in the real world of main roads with speed cameras and country lanes where a tractor and trailer or a child on a pony could be round the next corner. It is incredibly easy to drive, with quite a light clutch, precise gearshift, power steering with maximum assistance at low speed, diminishing as you go faster, anti-lock brakes and electronic traction control. I found the driving position perfect. Just like the Prelude, it trickled down to my local supermarket in top, ran with suppressed eagerness in the motorway pack and drifted unprotestingly through the lanes of Kent and Sussex. The ultra-squat and hugely grippy tyres thump a good deal and on concrete-paved motorways their roar half-drowns the radio. At an angled junction, visibility to the rear quarter is poor. Driven like a normal car, the NSX will give about 26-27mpg (10.6 l/100km) on a journey. Looked at with a cold and logical eye, it is a pure indulgence. But what a wonderful toy. One final thought. If cars were watches, all Hondas would be chronometers.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (1): In the teeth of the gale - The avalanche of bankruptcies, many caused by mismanaged cash flows, and the tenuous state of company finances have dramatised the need for better credit controls by borrowers and lenders. They have also fuelled demands for legislation to penalise late payers CREDIT management has traditionally been seen as an unglamorous, back-office job. While the sales team got the expense account lunches and the smart cars, the credit controller ate in the canteen and went home by bus. Until the onset of the recession, that is. Spiralling failure rates, ever-lengthening payments delays and a crunch on company cash flows have brought home the importance of efficient credit management. Ineffective credit controls have meant that many otherwise viable businesses have gone to the wall. The old excuses for not taking action to reduce credit risk have been discredited, says Ms Barbara Bennett, corporate affairs manager at Trade Indemnity, Britain's largest insurer of domestic trade credit. Among the famous last words of doomed businessmen she lists: 'All my clients are blue chip' and 'I have known the company for 20 years. I was playing golf with the managing director only last week.' The credit management sector has two main elements: the in-house credit controller who attempts to ensure the company only does business with customers who can pay on time; and the external suppliers of credit services. These include the business information providers which credit rate companies, the factors, the credit insurance groups and the debt-collection agencies. Companies in Britain employ about 80,000 credit controllers or managers, calculates Mr Peter Allen, chairman of the Institute of Credit Management. But there is often no career structure and their status in many companies is low. 'Many senior managers are reluctant to employ a specialist,' says Mr Allen. 'This is despite the fact that the person in charge of the debtor ledger typically is in charge of 40 per cent of the business's current assets, more than anyone else in the company apart from the managing director.' To boost standards the institute, which has 8,000 members, runs training programmes around the country and plans to move to a system of exam-only entry. A more professional approach to credit management is the only way to improve the payments position of British companies, says Mr Peter Rowe, the institute's director general. The welter of proposals which have been made to ensure that companies, particularly small businesses, get paid on time will not solve the problem, he believes. One proposal, so far rejected by the government, is for legislation to give companies a statutory right to interest on unpaid bills. This idea has the backing of the Forum of Private Business, a small business lobby group, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a business information group and Intrum Justitia, a debt collection agency. But others, the institute included, believe it would be unduly complex to administer and unlikely to make a difference to companies which did not wish to offend their customers. The government has responded by financing three pilot projects run by a chamber of commerce and two trade associations to establish 'model' procedures for speeding up payments. It has also streamlined county court procedures for collecting debt. The improvements include dispensing with preliminary hearings in all but exceptional cases, allowing judges to help litigants who are not legally represented and requiring judges to explain their decisions orally. Another move by government is to require large companies to declare in their annual report the time it takes them to pay their suppliers. The government has published a consultation paper aimed at finding the most acceptable method of providing this information. But many finance directors and accountants are sceptical that the numbers would be meaningful unless the average contractual payment terms agreed by individual companies and by the industry sector were also published. A separate initiative has also been taken by the Confederation of British Industry. More than 400 CBI members have signed up to a register of companies which guarantee to make prompt payments. The code has been criticised as depending on the goodwill of participants and for lacking real teeth. The institute, for its part, has suggested that payments performance should be one of the areas included in BS5750, the quality management standard which has been adopted by several thousand companies. But the government wants to see if other methods work first while the British Standards Institution is unwilling to add another element to its standard. A separate prompt payment kitemark might be the answer, says Mr Allen. That some action needs to be taken is evident from the poor payments performance of British companies. UK suppliers normally quote payment terms of 30 days but wait 80 days to get paid, according to the British Association of Factors and Discounters. German and Dutch companies also normally quote 30-day terms but wait just 50 and 45 days for payment. A recent survey by Trade Indemnity showed that of the 600 UK companies it contacted just 3 per cent had been paid on time. Large companies frequently pressurise small suppliers with the threat of losing all their business unless they agree to very disadvantageous payment terms. Despite the fact, or perhaps because, the payments record of British companies is so poor, the UK has the most developed credit management industry in Europe. 'We are ahead of continental Europe in terms of the amount of business information which is available and our expertise in assessing risk,' says Mr Brian Bailey, managing director of UAPT-Infolink, a large provider of business and credit information. Business information groups such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet International, Infocheck, ICC and UAPT-Infolink provide a wide variety of credit assessment services in both hard copy and electronic form. A salesman can now call up credit information in his car before visiting a potential customer. The factoring companies have been expanding their business in recent years and could benefit from the end of the present recession if the banks prove reluctant to provide conventional overdraft lending. The factors provide a range of services ranging from taking over the management of their client's sales ledger to simply providing cash against invoices. More than 9,000 companies with a combined turnover of Pounds 16bn make use of factoring or invoice discounting companies. The domestic credit insurance industry has been dominated by one company, Trade Indemnity. But new competition in the form of NCM Credit Insurance, a Dutch group which acquired the short-term export credit insurance arm of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, has emerged. NCM claims a 5 per cent market share after its first year of operations against the 80 per cent held by Trade Indemnity. These different sectors of the credit management industry make extensive use of each other's services. The factors offer credit insurance as an add-on to their core activities of managing sales ledgers and providing cash while the credit insurers and the factors make use of the business information groups. Many of these groups have also diversified into related fields of business. Dun &amp; Bradstreet and UAPT-Infolink both have debt-collection operations. Trade Indemnity has a half-share in a factoring company, Trade Indemnity-Heller Commercial Finance, while Infocheck has developed a credit insurance service and also linked up with International Factors to provide factoring and invoice discounting. 'Businesses have become aware that they can substitute one service for another,' says Mr Bruno Tavernier, a director of ICC. 'There is more competition between the different parts of the credit management industry.' But before they make use of outside services such as these, managers must ensure that their internal credit controls are good. 'People don't help themselves,' comments Mr Philip Mellor, marketing manager of Dun &amp; Bradstreet. 'They don't agree terms in advance or call to check that the goods delivered were satisfactory.' Three years into a recession the credit specialists still find alarming examples of poor credit management. Says one: 'If people put as much professionalism into credit management as they do into sales they would be much better off.'</p>

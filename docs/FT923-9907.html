			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Directors' pay outpaces profits MANY DIRECTORS enjoy substantial pay rises although their companies perform poorly, according to the latest survey of directors' pay by the Labour Research Department. LRD found 462 top executives in 217 companies earning at least Pounds 250,000, with 69 being paid between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m, and 17 more than Pounds 1m. Seventy-eight top directors received a rise while company profits fell. The most extreme mismatch between directors' pay rises and corporate performance is reported at Britannia Hotels. There, Mr Michael Morton and Mr Alexander Langsam received a 98 per cent rise, taking their pay to more than Pounds 4m each, while the company recorded an Pounds 8.5m loss. Mr Robin Biggam of BICC had a 22 per cent rise as profits fell 56 per cent; Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith of Sears had an 8 per cent pay rise while profits fell by 45 per cent; and Mr Ron Nathan of Waterglades received a 161 per cent rise when the company lost Pounds 5m. Sir James Blyth of Boots received a 67 per cent rise to Pounds 571,000 while the company's profits rose only 7 per cent. At the Kalon paint group, Mr Mike Hennessy received a 619 per cent pay rise to Pounds 910,319 while the company's profits increased by 57 per cent. LRD found that just over half the directors on Pounds 250,000 or more were either chairman, chief executive or managing director of their companies. Of those, 172 received a pay rise and 47 saw their pay fall. The average pay rise was 9.3 per cent.</p>

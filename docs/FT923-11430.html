			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Blueprint for a shrinking state: New Zealand's assault on public spending might hold some lessons for the UK 'In general, those individuals and families with reasonable means should attend to their own needs. As a broad principle, the top third of all income earners can be expected to meet most of the cost of their social services' - Ms Ruth Richardson, New Zealand's minister of finance, December 1990. If Mr Norman Lamont wants some relief from his post-election spending hangover, he might holiday in New Zealand, where Mr Jim Bolger's National (right-of-centre) government is engaged in one of the toughest assaults on public spending taking place in the developed world. Mr Bolger's main target is social spending, and since he started with a welfare state comparable to Britain's - completed a decade before Aneurin Bevan inaugurated the National Health Service - his progress is of particular interest to British observers. 'Within weeks of taking office, we began the redesign of the welfare state,' says Ms Ruth Richardson, principal architect of the reforms. Two budgets later, universal welfare benefits are all but extinct, targeting has been widely extended in the context of reduced or fixed budgets, higher earners are paying for health and tertiary education, and market structures are under construction throughout. It is a conscious attempt to limit the social role of the New Zealand state. Not all Ms Richardson's cabinet colleagues would subscribe to the opening quotation: several have been sniping away, with intermittent support from a prime minister by instinct far more cautious than his finance minister. But five agreed propositions underlie the changes: that the state's share of national wealth is excessive and must be reduced if the economy is to flourish; that government debt is too high; that social spending must be more narrowly targeted; that the margin between benefit rates and post-tax income is too small; and that raising extra revenue from tax is not an option. Mr Lamont would probably say 'aye' to them all. The validity of these propositions is debatable. New Zealand has a comparatively high ratio of net debt to gross domestic product: 46.5 per cent, against an OECD average of 33 per cent. But at 39.6 per cent, the share of NZ national income consumed by the state is not comparatively large; nor, at 33 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively, are its top rates of income tax and general sales tax excessive. New Zealand has no capital gains tax. Says Mr Jonathan Boston, public policy lecturer at Victoria University, Wellington: 'There is no convincing evidence to suggest that democratic countries with relatively small state sectors grow any faster than countries with relatively large state sectors.' Yet among the New Zealand elite - politicians as well as businessmen - it is virtually axiomatic that the state does consume too much and that taxes cannot be raised without stifling growth. Ms Richardson's latest budget projects public spending falling to 37.4 per cent of GDP by 1994-95 (in the UK, by contrast, it is 41.7 per cent, and projected by the Treasury to rise to 42.2 per cent by 1994-95). It is a product of New Zealand's recent past, eight years of economic stagnation, mounting debt, and a steep decline in relative living standards, creating an abiding sense of national crisis. The Labour opposition broadly accepts the premises for all its opposition to particular changes. But accept them, and short of dramatic growth the only option is welfare cuts. No peace dividend is available: defence accounts for only 4 per cent of spending. After debt charges, three-quarters of New Zealand's budget goes on welfare and social services. The issue is not whether but what to cut. New Zealand's reforms divide into two parts: structure and funding. Institutions are being restructured to devolve managerial authority, keep politicians at arm's length, and separate 'purchasers' from 'providers' of services. The 14 integrated area health authorities are being split into four regional health authorities, which will buy services from some 25 Crown Health Enterprises managing the hospitals. School governors are gaining control of their salary budgets, with an experiment under way in total budgetary devolution. Under the controversial Employment Contracts Act existing national contracts with teachers have been terminated, and the government wants more flexible - possibly local - contracts to replace them. Much of that is familiar to British eyes, but in many areas change is being taken further. For secondary schools the market is already a way of life. Onslow College, Wellington, a typical secondary school, publishes company-style annual accounts and last year raised 20 per cent of its income from non-government sources. Donations - including a small 'voluntary fee' charged to parents - account for some of the extra; but a sizeable chunk came from trading activities and full-cost fees charged to 18 pupils from overseas. 'I am 100 per cent committed to free state education,' says Mr Neale Pitches, the principal. 'But it's a simple case of making ends meet.' However, the most profound changes are in funding: Health. New Zealanders have always had to pay part-charges for visits to general practitioners, but those on average and above-average incomes must now foot the full bill of about NZDollars 30 (Pounds 9) for such visits as well as all their dentist and optician fees and most of their prescription charges. Those on low incomes or benefits gain some - but not total - relief; so do heavy users. Charges for hospital services were introduced earlier this year for the first time. The population is divided into three groups by income, with a so-called Kiwicard introduced for identification purposes. The top third - families with an income of about NZDollars 32,500 (Pounds 10,000) - now pay up to NZDollars 50 a night for hospital visits, up to a maximum of NZDollars 500 a year per family. Allowing for concessions, about 20 per cent of patients will pay the charges. The government is also working on a definition of 'core health services'. Only these will continue to attract public subsidy, while users will bear the full cost of such 'non-core' services as cosmetic surgery. Critics estimate that once the new regime is fully operating about 23 per cent of national health spending will be met by charges - up from 11 per cent in 1980. State benefits. All universal transfer payments except the state pension have been abolished, and significant cuts in that are under way. Over the next 10 years, the age of eligibility for the pension will be raised from 60 to 65, and its payment is now targeted. The last Labour government introduced a 25 cents in the dollar surcharge - additional to income tax - for all pensioners paying income tax. That has been increased to 25 cents, making a marginal rate of 58 cents for top-rate payers. Other benefits have been cut across the board. To give an idea of scale, unemployment benefit for a single person was cut by 10 per cent in cash terms last year. It is no longer payable to those aged below 18, and at reduced rates up to 25. Housing. The government intended last year to withdraw from social housing entirely, selling off much of its stock, managing the rest on a commercial basis and fulfilling social obligations through a targeted accommodation subsidy. The plan has since been modified (the new housing body is to have social obligations), but the main lines of the reform will proceed. Education. School spending is to be held constant in real terms. Total spending will rise slightly to support a 13 per cent increase in tertiary student numbers projected over the next three years, but funding for student allowances is to be reduced by about half this academic year alone by means of a large-scale shift to loans. Most students must now meet the full cost of their maintenance, and a proportion - about 12 per cent - of the cost of their fees. Higher education institutions are now allowed to charge top-up fees. 'University graduates have considerably higher income than those without qualifications,' argues the Treasury. 'This difference can be drawn on to pay for their education over time.' It cites research showing that whereas only 44 per cent of the parents of all those between 18 and 19 years old have incomes of more than NZDollars 35,500, 73 per cent of parents of university students do so. The use of such figures is revealing, not just for their emphasis on the 'top third', but because of the assumption that the family unit should be the basis for assessment. If all that seems radical enough, the government initially planned to go further on all fronts, not just on housing. Last year's budget envisaged pensioners with taxable income facing a 93 per cent marginal tax rate. It also planned far narrower targeting of health spending and a 'multiple funder' health care plan, under which individuals would have been encouraged to take their risk-adjusted premium out of the national health service entirely and contract with insurance companies for provision. But the resulting storm was so severe that the changes were modified. At one point the government's poll ratings sank to 20 per cent: but with the concessions, and evidence of economic recovery, the National party is now almost level-pegging with Labour and the odds-on favourite to win next year's election. Even if it loses, Labour is unlikely to return to the status quo ante. So are the reforms the end of Zealand's welfare state? Talk of straightforward dismantling is simplistic, for it fails to recognise the extent to which the previous system - like Britain's - already comprised fees and targeting. Charges for visits to GPs are a case in point. Mr Simon Upton, the astute health minister, uses them to argue that charges for secondary care were positively necessary to 'discourage cost-shifting between different budgets, and encourage people to consider the costs and benefits of various services'. None the less, the reforms mark a fundamental reassessment. Says Mr Mark Prebble, until recently a senior Treasury official responsible for welfare policy: 'The important shift is away from a commitment to income support at a level so that recipients could 'belong and participate' in society . . . to a modest safety net to maintain individuals in the daily essentials of food, clothing, power and housing at a decent level.' Doubtless Mr Lamont would return from Wellington convinced of the political impossibility of such notions. But should Britain, too, be in for a decade of stagnation, remember it was Aneurin Bevan who remarked: why gaze into the crystal ball when you can read the book?</p>

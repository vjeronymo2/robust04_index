The article says: We must strive to foil the peaceful  evolution scheme in order to firmly maintain the political  situation; defend our national independence and freedom; build  the fatherland; and triumphantly fulfill the objectives of  making our people prosperous, our nation powerful, and our  society civilized. Opposing peaceful evolution has become a  very pressing task of our people and the war veterans force.  Indeed, members of the WVA have actively participated in the  struggle against peaceful evolution and have, together with  people throughout the country, strived to heighten vigilance  against the enemy's schemes and tactics. They have promptly  detected and consistently monitored work of various  organizations of reactionaries, especially their sabotage  activities. Moreover, the WVA has also seriously implemented  the foreign policy of our party and state, carried out tasks in  accordance with our party lines and orientations, and motivated  various people's strata to actively participate in the struggle  against wicked schemes of the hostile forces.</p>

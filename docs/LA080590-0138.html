			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE VOTES TO SCALE BACK ON 'STAR WARS'  </P> <P> In a major rebuff to President Bush, the Senate voted Saturday to overhaul the  controversial "Star Wars" program and slow the President's plans for a possible  early deployment of the "Brilliant Pebbles" anti-missile system.  </P> <P> The unexpected setback for the White House came as the Senate gave final  approval to a $289-billion defense bill for fiscal 1991 by a margin of 79 to 16  and departed on a monthlong summer recess. The House adjourned on Friday.  </P> <P> The defense spending measure adopted by the Senate is $18 billion less than  sought by the President but $6 billion more than recently approved by the House  Armed Services Committee. The House will take up the defense budget after it  returns from its recess.  </P> <P> The Senate legislation represents a relatively modest adjustment to the  dramatically reduced Soviet threat to Western Europe, and opponents said that  they favored much larger cuts in next year's military outlays.  </P> <P> In other actions, the Senate gave final congressional approval to a bill  allocating $4 billion over five years for treatment of AIDS patients and grants  to cities hard hit by the disease. It also passed a $29-billion appropriation  bill that threatens to withhold highway funds from states that do not pass laws  suspending the drivers' licenses of convicted drug offenders.  </P> <P> In an early morning voice vote, the Senate adopted a 1991 intelligence budget  that would eliminate U.S. support for a covert war in Cambodia and reduce  funding for rebels in Afghanistan, sources told the Associated Press. Most of  the bill's provisions are secret.  </P> <P> The House, meanwhile, voted unanimously to increase the potential oil spill  liability of shippers and require double hulls on all tankers by the year 2010.  The measure now goes to Bush, who is expected to sign it.  </P> <P> The Senate-approved revisions in the Strategic Defense Initiative, also known  as "Star Wars," would impose considerably more congressional oversight on the  futuristic missile defense program conceived during the Ronald Reagan  Administration.  </P> <P> The Senate voted in favor of the restrictions despite opponents' contentions  that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week had shown that SDI might be needed to  defend against limited missile raids from smaller nations as well as possible  major attacks by the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Voting 54 to 44 along party lines, the Senate slashed $200 million from the  President's requested funding for research on Brilliant Pebbles, thousands of  small rocket weapons that would be placed in orbit so they could seek out and  destroy incoming missiles.  </P> <P> The Senate voted to freeze Brilliant Pebbles funding at its current level of  $129 million and delay indefinitely a planned presidential decision in 1993 on  whether to deploy the weapons. It also directed a greater focus on ground-based  missile defense systems.  </P> <P> The Senate bill would limit overall spending on SDI to $3.7 billion next year,  compared to current funding of about $3.8 billion. Bush is seeking $4.7 billion  for the program, while the pending House defense measure would reduce it to  $2.9 billion.  </P> <P> The "Star Wars" restrictions were endorsed by Senate Armed Services Committee  Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who noted that the Pentagon has proposed four  different SDI systems in four years, while the Administration has not indicated  where it would find the estimated $100 billion needed to pay for the first  phase of the program over the next decade.  </P> <P> "What we really need to do is send them (the President and his aides) a message  on phase one and tell them to get off this kick of a 1993 deployment decision,  which doesn't make any sense," Nunn told the Senate.  </P> <P> Opponents of the changes, however, noted that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein  possesses short-range missiles. "We need to support the President in taking  decisive action against this kind of threat," Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) said.  </P> <P> In another move affecting SDI, the Senate voted, 97 to 1, to earmark $300  million of SDI research funds for weapons that could be used against tactical  missiles that might one day be fired by terrorists or outlaw countries.  </P> <P> The White House fought unsuccessfully to defeat an amendment by Sens. Jeff  Bingaman (D-N. M.) and Richard C. Shelby (D-Ala.) that called for a  restructuring of SDI, placing more emphasis on basic research rather than  possible deployment in the 1990s.  </P> <P> In the end, 52 Democrats and two Republicans voted for the changes, while 42  Republicans and two Democrats sided with Bush in the dispute over exotic space  weapons.  </P> <P> The Senate, however, killed separate attempts to trim $594 million and $400  million from SDI funds after Nunn indicated that he wanted to preserve the  Senate's bargaining position in a conference with the House on the  controversial programs.  </P> <P> While some Administration officials have warned that Bush would veto the  legislation if SDI priorities were altered, both Nunn and Sen. John W. Warner  of Virginia, the Republican floor manager, said they had not been told that  Bush would reject the measure as it now stands.  </P> <P> Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), a liberal critic, voted against the bill,  contending that it did not cut Pentagon spending enough. "We don't need all  this exotic weaponry," he told the Senate. "I'd rather have brilliant students  than Brilliant Pebbles."  </P> <P> Nunn, however, insisted that the bill took into account the lessened Soviet  threat without endangering the national security.  </P> <P> The bill would substantially reshape the nation's conventional forces,  recognizing that the threat of an invasion of Western Europe has nearly  evaporated. But it proceeds more cautiously in trimming the strategic nuclear  arsenal, reflecting a concern that the Soviets are continuing to modernize  their own long-range bombers, missiles and submarines.  </P> <P> The bill would kill off most of the 13 weapons programs proposed by Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney for termination. It also would cancel 15 other programs,  the most significant being the MILSTAR communications satellite, saving $1.1  billion.  </P> <P> By a narrow margin, the Senate voted to continue production of the B-2 Stealth  bomber, authorizing $4.6 billion to develop the radar-eluding plane and buy two  more.  </P> <P> It also approved development funds for the two mobile intercontinental  ballistic missiles, the Midgetman and the MX, but it denied $1.1 billion  requested to begin buying launcher trains for the MX.  </P> <P> The Senate approved $1.2 billion for an 18th Trident missile-launching  submarine. But it denied the entire $1.7 billion requested for two C-17 cargo  planes and all the money -- reported to be about $1.5 billion -- requested to  build A-12 bombers for the Navy.  </P> <P> It also reduced the amounts requested to develop the ATF fighter plane and the  new armed helicopter designated LH.  </P> <P> The bill would steer the Pentagon toward a proportionally greater reliance on  National Guard and reserve forces, rather than active-duty units.  </P> <P> Compared to the reduction of more than 38,000 military personnel recommended by  Cheney, it would cut active-duty personnel by 100,000 from the current level of  2.1 million.  </P> <P> By 1995, active-duty personnel would be reduced to 1.6 million, a cut of more  than 20%. The Army would absorb the biggest cuts, shrinking over five years by  one-third, to 510,000, as its traditional mission of guarding Western Europe  becomes less pressing.  </P> <P> The bill would require that the Pentagon remove 50,000 of the 311,000 Army and  Air Force personnel stationed in Europe. The President could waive that  requirement by certifying to Congress that it was not in the national security  interest.  </P></p>

He said that in the "super-election year" of 1994 it was  easier for Austrian politicians to capitalise on disputed Czech  issues.    Jajtner recalled the words by Austrian President Thomas  Klestil during his visit to the Czech Republic last December  that "not even Temelin might violate our good relations." In  the meantime, however, the two countries' relations have  worsened, the ambassador admitted, and described a welcome in  Linz during his recent visit as "very cool."    Jajtner said he understood the concern of Upper Austrians  (who live close to the Czech border), but, as he said, there was  no reason for panic. The Prague government had considered  Austria's concern and would operate only half of the plant's  envisaged capacity. Temelin's completion, however, is a  significant step towards the improvement of environment in  Bohemia, Jajtner said. "Children and trees in the most severely  affected region of northern Bohemia must breathe," he said.  After the completion of Temelin, two thermal power plants which  harm the environment most will cease to operate, he concluded.</p>

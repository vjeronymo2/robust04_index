			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HISTORY IS JUST A HANDSHAKE AWAY WITH FRIENDLY FRED  </P> <P> If you saw Old Fred and didn't know him you would think he was one of the  legion of America's homeless, a drifter perhaps. But you can't always tell a  book by its cover.  </P> <P> Fred Litzner -- known to everyone in this area as Old Fred -- wears a well-worn  flannel shirt, old trousers, a seedy black coat and faded black hat, walks with  a cane and always carries a shopping bag. His get-up belies his standing as an  extraordinary historian.  </P> <P> For 20 years, Litzner, 75, has lived in a tiny house filled floor to ceiling  with hundreds of his handwritten notebooks, with boxes brimming over with  historical records, with books and artifacts. He has no telephone or TV.  There's hardly room for him to move about in his one-room modest dwelling.  </P> <P> Old Fred is the best-known character in the small towns along the byways and  highways in the sparsely populated counties where Lakes Michigan and Huron come  together separating Michigan's Upper Peninsula from the Lower.  </P> <P> "He waves at everybody, talks to everybody. Tell him your name and if you're  from around here he'll tell you all about your family, tell you things about  your ancestors you have never heard before. He's uncanny," said Joe Nowak, 48,  a long-time Michigan state trooper.  </P> <P> "Old Fred hitchhikes everywhere. He doesn't have a car. He's a roamer.  Everybody picks him up. He's such a friendly, fascinating person. He's a  walking encyclopedia. And, he traces everyone's family tree," said Janet  Peterson, 33, executive secretary of the St. Ignace Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> "The Ballad of Old Fred," published in the St. Ignace News, captures the  essence of this remarkable man. It begins:  </P> <P>  This is a story of a man named Fred  </P> <P>  It's true and correct and should be said,  </P> <P>  For he's not a bum or tramp as seems,  </P> <P>  But a gentle old man who shares his dreams.  </P> <P>  Ain't that something though, Old Fred,  </P> <P>  You keep a record of everybody, living and dead.  </P> <P>  You knew my uncles, my aunts and even my paw;  </P> <P>  Tell me their life, then say "good luck to ya."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Litzner grew up on a Michigan farm. His grandparents came to Michigan from  Germany in 1885 after seeing signs painted on barns urging Germans to migrate  to Michigan, where the land was good, plentiful and almost free. The Germans  came in droves.  </P> <P> Litzner graduated from high school in Saginaw. He farmed. But history was his  avocation, his passion, his obsession. He purchased historical items at  auctions and presented them to universities, museums, historical societies.  </P> <P> "He is known to historians at the University of Michigan, at Michigan State, to  historians and librarians throughout Michigan. He is a most extraordinary  person," said James Moody, 53, professor of history at Lake Superior State  University, Sault Ste. Marie.  </P> <P> "I would like to sit down with Mr. Litzner for six months and tape everything  he knows. He is a tremendous resource. I have just completed a paper for the  National Academy of Sciences on the history of railroads in the Upper Peninsula  and the industries that grew up with the advent of the railroads.  </P> <P> "Fred knows more about this than anyone I know. He knows the players. He knows  the location of dozens of sites of towns that no longer exist. He can take you  right to them. He has a tremendous collection of books and artifacts not only  in his humble home but in storage that he maintains. He talks to everyone. He  is as close to St. Francis of Assisi as anyone I have ever met."  </P> <P> Katherine Punch, 72, a librarian at the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada,  library from 1937 to 1981 and on the library board ever since, is one of  numerous librarians throughout Michigan and Ontario befriended by Litzner over  the years.  </P> <P> "He knows history on a personal basis. He does so much for history. I've never  met anyone quite like him. For 25 years he has been hitchhiking to our library  from his home, bringing information to add to our historical collection," Punch  said.  </P> <P> "I won't hear from him for months. Then one day he appears. He searches out  small clues. Anything he runs across pertaining to the history of our area he  collects, saves, then presents to us -- papers, maps, photo documents. He has  added immeasurably to our collection."  </P> <P> Litzner sends information to libraries as far away as Switzerland, Germany and  Sweden about immigration to Michigan that might be of interest to them. He  often hitchhikes to Detroit, Lansing, Ann Arbor and other places in Michigan to  do his research.  </P> <P> "He is an incredible human being. He digests everything. He has an uncanny  memory. He does all sorts of wonderful things for so many people out of the  kindness of his heart," said Donald Heldman, director of archeology at the  Mackinaw City State Historic Park.  </P> <P> Ft. Michilimackinac in Mackinaw City, population 900, was built by the French  in 1715, and occupied by the British from 1761 to 1781. Litzner is an authority  on the period and has closely followed Heldman's excavations at the site.  </P> <P> "You would think Old Fred was dirt poor, a lost soul in his old clothes  carrying a shopping bag, hitchhiking all hours of the day and night. On the  contrary, he is brilliant. He speaks beautiful German. He is an historian's  historian," Heldman said.  </P> <P>  So, if you see Old Fred standing by the road,  </P> <P>  And, it's starting to rain, it's windy and cold,  </P> <P>  Pick him up, don't hesitate,  </P> <P>  For the stories he's got are really great. ...  </P> <P> </P></p>

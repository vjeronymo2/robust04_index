			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The 30 April edition of KUNGMIN ILBO on  page 4 reports on an elite men's private organization, the Seoul  Forum. The author, Han Pyong-kwon, said that with only 52  members, the Forum is the "ultimate in elite men's private  organizations in South Korea". Membership is by invitation  only. The Forum's members come from various fields: academia,  media, law, business, and economics. Each member is expected to  be well-versed in international politics.    The Forum was established in October 1986. Han Pyong-kwon  noted that the Forum's organizers believed that Korea needed a  non-political and non-government organization to exchange  information, analyze and assess international trends quickly and  independently.    Charter members were Han Sung-chu (current Foreign Minister,  then Korea University professor), Yi Sang-u (Sogan University  professor), and Yi Hong-ku (current Deputy Prime Minister, then  Seoul National University professor). In addition, the Forum's  current membership from academia includes An Pyong-chun, Chong  Ku-hyon, Kim Tal-chung, Kim Se-won, Yu Se-hui, Chong Chong-uk  (current presidential advisor). The economic sector's elite  include Sagong Il (former Minister of Finance) and Pak Yong-chol  (Director of the Financial Training Institute). The national  security arena is respresented by Yi Tong-pok (former NSP  official, North Korea expert). The legal sector has Yi Hoe-chang  (former Prime Minister). The business sector has Kim U-chung  (Chairman of the Daewoo Group), Cho Sok-nae (Chairman of the  Hyosong Group) and Pak Song-nyong (Chairman of the Kumho Group).  The Forum's current chairman is Kim Kyong-won, former  ambassador to the United States.</p>

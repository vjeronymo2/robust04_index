The  burial site at Qiryat Arba' is temporary, and his body will be  moved eventually to the Jewish cemetery in Hebron. Speakers  eulogizing Goldstein praised both the man and his actions. Mark  Weiss was at the funeral:    Eulogies were recited at the Shamgar funeral parlor in  Jerusalem and at the yeshiva in Qiryat Arba', and the message at  both venues was militant and uncompromising. Speakers praised  the massacre as a selfless act committed on behalf of the Jewish  people as a whole. The victims were described not as innocent  worshippers, but as the people who stabbed innocent Jews and the  descendants of the Hebron residents who murdered almost the  entire Jewish population of the town in 1929. A million Arabs  are not worth the fingernail of one Jew, said one of the  speakers. We are all Goldstein, shouted one of the mourners at  one stage. Again and again, the speakers denounced the  government and the media, and above all the fact that an armed  Palestinian police force is about to be established. All this,  together with the fact that Dr. Goldstein had repeatedly treated  the victims of Arab terror, combined to create a situation where  he just couldn't take it any more. All the eulogizers said  Goldstein should be praised as a righteous man. A few hundred  people attended the eulogies in Jerusalem. Many hundreds more  joined in at Qiryat Arba'. [passage omitted]    For many other mourners, the most radical elements among the  settlers, the funeral was an occasion to come together and  express solidarity. And, that was definitely the feeling of a  community under siege. There was intense hostility toward  journalists, and much of the talk among the crowd was of a witch  hunt and the possibility of informers planted within the  settlements.</p>

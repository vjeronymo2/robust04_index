			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India to harvest smaller jute crop BESET BY unfavourable weather in all jute growing areas, India will be harvesting a lower jute crop of around 6.5m bales of 180kg each in the season beginning July, against 9.2m bales in 1991-92 and 9m bales in 1990-91. However, the Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA) is more concerned that the high quality jute needed for producing fine yarn, hessian and carpet backing cloth will be in acute short supply. Jute mills producing these high value items will be required to import superior grades of fibre which are expected to command a handsome premium in the world market, according to trade sources. The Jute Balers Association (JBA) says that farmers in the traditionally early sown areas of Assam and north Bengal had to postpone the sowing of jute seeds by more than a month because of hot dry weather and no rainfall. It is estimated that there is a shortfall of more than 30 per cent in the area under jute in Assam and north Bengal. The situation in Bihar, another area which comes under the early sown zone, is even grimmer. The JBA survey finds that the progress in sowing is 'highly disappointing' in all jute growing areas of Bihar which have hardly received any rains. The fate of the crop in terms of quantity as well as quality is decided at south Bengal, which accounts for nearly 50 per cent of the country's raw jute production. Here also hot dry weather has hindered the progress of sowing. Since the sowing has been delayed, the new crop will start arriving in the market two months behind schedule. Yet as industry and trade sources point out, the late crop arrival will not have much of an impact on raw jute prices. This is because the 1992-93 jute season will be opening in July with fibre stocks of around 3m bales, against the earlier projected 1.7m bales.</p>

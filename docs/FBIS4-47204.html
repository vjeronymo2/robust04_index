			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "Business: Energy </F> Supplies": "Nuclear Electric Power Stations Are Ukraine's  Fastest Developing Energy Source"]    [Text] Despite the post-Chernobyl wave of protests in  Ukraine against the exploitation of nuclear electric power  stations [AES] and the development of nuclear power as such, the  latter remains the most effective energy source in the world. No  one in the world is giving up the energy produced by nuclear  power stations, and Ukraine is no exception to this. In 1993,  Ukraine's AES produced 32.7% of the total volume of  electricity  generated by the country's electric power stations. From the  standpoint of production effectiveness, the figure "32.7" can be  regarded as a unique achievement, for as recently as 1990 this  indicator measured only 25.5%.    Understandably, a prolonged energy crisis makes it  impossible  to be overly particular regarding the choice of electric power  sources, and it is for that reason that the government will  never renounce the services of the nuclear power engineers at  this time. A clear demonstration of the government's position on  this issue was the visit on 27 May of the president and the  acting prime minister of Ukraine to the Chernobyl AES, during  which Leonid Kravchuk showed unusual interest in the methods of  measuring radiation both at the Chernobyl AES and in the  surrounding area. It also became clear after this visit that the  Chernobyl AES would not be shut down in the near future (no  matter how much many representatives of the relevant  international organizations might want this). That is the only  explanation for the president's promise to the residents of  Slavutych near Chernobyl to build a 100-unit apartment building  in the city using government funds appropriated for this purpose.    On the other hand, the expansion of the production  capacities  of Ukraine's nuclear power plants in recent years also means  that the load of the AES has increased, thereby increasing the  theoretical probability of the occurrence of unexpected  incidents at these stations. This is the other side of the coin,  and control of this aspect must be the first order of priority.  How to do this is up to the experts. As to the numerical  analysis of the performance of Ukraine's electricity producers,  the results are as follows:    Of the 75.2 MWh of energy produced by nuclear electric power  stations, 27.5 MWh were produced by the Zaporizhzhya AES, 11.8  MWh by the Rivne AES, 5.8 MWh by the Khmelnytskyy AES, 12.6 MWh  by the Chernobyl AES, and 17.5 by the Southern Ukrainian AES.  The most powerful thermal electric power stations TES today are  those in Zaporizhzhya, Vuhlehirsk, Kryvyy Rih, and Burshtyn.    The production of electric power began to decline in 1991  synchronously with the downturn in industrial output: the number  of megawatts of electric power produced equals the amount of  energy consumed by industrial customers. The inability to sell  noncompetitive Ukrainian production because of its too high  power-output ratio was the reason for the protracted idling of  enterprises to conserve electric power. In 1993, according to  the Ministry of Energy and Electrification, Ukraine exported 2.7  MWh of electric power as against the period up to 1990, when  annual exports amounted to nearly 30 MW.    According to Vasyl Protsenko, deputy chief of the  administration of the Ministry of Energy and Electrification,  the sharp decrease in the export of electric power from Ukraine  was due to the production of electric power for Western  countries at a loss while its price dropped: the purchase price  of one kilowatt of energy fell from from 5.1 to 2.3 cents. The  production cost of one kW of Ukrainian electric power amounts to  2.55 cents.    The Ministry of Energy and Electrification predicts a  continuing decrease in electric power production in 1994. The  state order for the production of energy by combined electric  power and heat generating plants TETs amounts to 134 billion  kWh, but in reality no more than 113.5 billion kWh will be  produced. The production of electric power by hydroelectric  power stations [HES] will decrease in 1994 to 9.46 MWh, and by  nuclear electric power stations [AES] to 70 MWh. One of the  reasons for the predicted decline in the production of  electricity, apart from a decrease in industrial consumption, is  a shortage of fuel needed to produce electric power.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

In physical terms, the amount of coal consumed  was 42.9  million metric tons, mazut -- 4.8 million metric tons, and gas  -- 20.2 billion cubic meters.    According to Vasyl Protsenko, the deputy chief of the  administration of the Ministry of Energy and Electrification, in  1993 Ukraine imported 6 million metric tons of coal, mainly from  Russia. Forecasts for this year estimate that only one million  metric tons of coal will be imported. As expected, the main  reason for this decrease in the volume of coal imports is a  shortage of funds. Consequently, the predicted shortage of coal  in Ukraine for this year will reach 9.3 million metric tons.    The shortage of mazut in 1994 is expected to reach 2.9  million metric tons. Compared with 1990, when the annual demand  for mazut was 18 million metric tons, the current level of  consumption has dropped to 3.8 million metric tons, because  50%  of Ukraine's power station units are not operating.    During the summer, when, as a rule, electric power  consumption drops 30%, electric power stations, for the  most  part, use mazut and gas as fuel, thus creating a reserve of coal  for the winter ranging in amounts from 800,000 to one million  metric tons.    But the fuel shortage is already creating a potentially  dangerous situation in the electric power system (in particular,  the reduction of the frequency in the network below 49.5 Hertz)  and threatens to result in the total collapse of Ukraine's power  system. The Ministry of Energy and Electrification is solving  the problem by disconnecting some consumers from the general  network. Even now, close to 3,000 enterprises are disconnected  every day from the power system.    Last year, nuclear electric power stations used nearly 24  million metric tons of equivalent fuel and produced 32.7 percent  of the total electric power generated in Ukraine.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

Today these relations are in a state of crisis,  which promises to be of long duration.    According to Ivan Mahda, deputy minister of energy and  electrification of Ukraine, his ministry is now totally  bankrupt. To some extent, the financial collapse of the Ministry  of Energy and Electrification has been brought about by  consumers -- enterprises that pay back only 50% of what  they  owe daily. The principal consumers of electric power in Ukraine  are listed in Table 2. In 1993, they received 187.9 MWh of  power, while the electric power stations used 16.8 MWh for their  own needs and 22.5 MWh were lost due to over heating in the  transmission lines.    Consumers are not paying the Ministry of Energy and  Electrification what they owe, and, judging by the steady  decline of production in Ukraine, they will not do so in the  near future. At the same time, Alfred Turos, the chief of the  administration of the Ministry of Energy and Electrification,  reports that government credits issued at the end of March to  the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Machinebuilding,  Defense Industrial Complex, and Converstion for settling the  debts owed by their enterprises for energy supplies were not  used for this purpose.    But even if consumers were to pay off their full debt to the  supplier, which totalled 9.5 trillion karbovantsi at the  beginning of May, the financial crisis at the Ministry of Energy  and Electrification would not be completely solved. The reason  is simple: the Ministry of Energy and Electrification owes its  consumers 9.8 trillion karbovantsi, including 1.525 trillion for  coal, 1.469 trillion for mazut, and 1.952 trillion karbovantsi  for gas.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |ESTABLISHED CAPACITY OF UKRAINE'S ELECTRIC POWER STATIONS ON 1 JANUARY 1994 (|  |in million

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Management: Bending minds to a new learning circle - The latest business fashion Peter Senge looks and sounds rather like a younger, slimmer and more respectable version of Jimmy Swaggart, the American revivalist preacher. He is one of the most charismatic speakers around. Yet Senge, a star professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who also has a consultancy business with a list of blue chip clients, disparages charisma in the business world. Most of the outstanding leaders he knows do not stand out in a crowd, he says: they are often mediocre public speakers who fail to mesmerise audiences with either brilliance or eloquence. Instead, what distinguishes them is the clarity and persuasiveness of their ideas, the depth of their commitment to their companies, and - above all - their openness to continually learning more, both individually and in partnership with everyone around and below them. Senge (pronounced Sengee) is one of a growing cohort of evangelists for the concept of 'The Learning Organisation'. Though its intellectual roots are heavily European, and reach back into the 1940s, it shows every sign of becoming the next American-spawned management fashion after 'total quality', time-based competition, and 'change management'. The notion is potentially extremely powerful, although its ambitious nature increases the chance that, like most management fads, companies will rush to adopt it in a half-baked way. It rests on the argument that, in an age when quality, technology and variety are all becoming widely available at relatively low cost, the only sustainable competitive advantage that a company can create may be the ability to learn faster than its rivals and to anticipate changes in the business environment. The concept has various degrees of depth and breadth, simplicity and complexity, according to which pundit one follows. In essence, a 'learning organisation' is considered to be one which: encourages continuous learning and knowledge generation at all levels; has processes which can move knowledge around the organisation easily to where it is needed; and can translate that knowledge quickly into changes in the way the organisation acts, both internally and externally. As Senge puts it, such an organisation is one 'that is continually expanding its capacity to create its future'. Hence his view, in common with many other academics and consultants, that good 1990s leadership has less to do with the 1980s muscular virtues of intuitive charisma and visionary strategy than with the quieter ones of what he calls 'organisational design, stewardship and teaching'. To Senge, model 'learning organisations' include Hanover Insurance, a New England company, Herman Miller, the mid-west furniture maker, and Analog Devices, a Massachusetts microchip manufacturer. In many respects, he also admires the way Shell, the European oil giant, manages its learning process. Senge's prescription of what it takes to build and sustain such a paragon is contained in a book called 'The Fifth Discipline - The Art and Practice of The Learning Organisation'. It was one of 1991's best-selling business books in the US and has just been published in Europe*. To Senge, five interrelated disciplines need to be fostered among individuals and groups in an organisation if it is to reach the heights of Hanover Insurance and the others: SYSTEMS THINKING Though he deals with this first in the book, and in by far the greatest depth - he is, after all, a professor of systems thinking - he actually calls this the 'fifth discipline'. As Senge says, individuals and organisations in all walks of life tend to focus only on one or two obvious parts of a problem, rather than on its entire 'system'. Hence their tendency to choose simple explanations and 'solutions'. Systems thinking, on the other hand, draws from a century of theory and practice to provide a set of techniques which help people to 'see the whole': to perceive the inter-relationships or 'structures' that underlie complex situations. Systems thinking also detects patterns of change over time, so that people can cease taking what Senge calls 'snapshots', and come to see that cause and effect are seldom close in time. Systems thinking also helps people realise that the most obvious solutions usually fail to work; a perfect example is Britain's 1970s rent control legislation, which simply dried up the supply of private rented accommodation. Senge illustrates the effect of systems thinking - and the lack of it - very effectively through several examples, from the arms race and environmental pollution to a business simulation game played at MIT. This demonstrates the disastrous effects that can be experienced by the various links in a brewing production, distribution and retailing chain (or 'system') when each link makes entirely independent decisions on levels of ordering and supply, without any knowledge or understanding of what decisions are being taken by other links. Optimising sub-systems in this way works only when demand is stable. When it rises or falls, the knock-on effect on the entire system is panic, crisis and chaos. One of the other keys to systems thinking, Senge suggests, is the ability to recognise structures that occur repeatedly. He provides nine detailed examples of 'systems archetypes', or 'generic structures', that occur time and again in private and organisational life. PERSONAL MASTERY. A ghastly term, this translates as 'personal growth and learning'. Among other points under this heading, Senge stresses the importance of intuition to systems thinking; denies that change only occurs in the face of crisis; and warns of the dangers of 'empowering' people before they have learned at least some of the other disciplines. MENTAL MODELS These are deeply engrained, often subconscious, assumptions which affect what we think about people, situations and organisations, often creating contradictions between what we say and do. Senge suggests that a General Motors' belief that cars are basically about styling, rather than performance, has impeded any real cultural and strategic change at the car giant. And he makes much of Shell's use of scenario planning since the 1970s to challenge its managers' comfortable assumptions about how the company and the oil world worked. With the help of one of Senge's mentors, the widely influential Chris Argyris of Harvard, Hanover Insurance has used the concept of mental models as a key part of its process of organisational learning. SHARED VISION. This must not, as it is so often, be imposed, since it will at best command compliance - not commitment. That will actually discourage people in the organisation from learning - as may charismatic leadership by a very strong individual. TEAM LEARNING Some theorists argue that learning can be done only by individuals, not by teams - nor organisations, for that matter. Senge dissents. Borrowing from Argyris, he outlines various 'defensive routines' which impede learning within teams, and can 'reduce to 63 the collective IQ of a team of managers with individual IQs above 120'. All five disciplines are obviously powerful in themselves, let alone in combination. But Senge's claim that they are all integrated by the fifth, systems thinking, is arguable. Surprisingly for a professor of this subject, his book does not actually contain a model of how an organisation learns; instead, it is full of helpful systems thinking models. Senge also draws inadequately on the wealth of past European research into systems thinking and learning organisations: his is a very American approach, yet it also omits at least one of the keys to Argyris' work: a much-quoted concept known as 'double loop learning'. All the same, Senge has accomplished the praiseworthy task of popularising both systems thinking and 'the learning organisation' for the wider business public. Characteristically, he does so on the page, almost as much as in person, in charismatic fashion. *Century Business Pounds 20/Doubleday Dollars 25</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Election hopes push Nikkei above 20,000 HOPES OF a further stimulus to the economy after elections to the lower house took the Nikkei average to a close above 20,000 for the first time since June 15, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index rose for the third consecutive day, ending 200.42, or 1 per cent, higher at 20,180.42. It registered a low for the day of 19,967.60 at the beginning of the session; but institutional and individual investors bought interest rate-sensitive issues on hopes of lower interest rates, while arbitrage-related demand during the last half-hour of trading pushed it up to a high of 20,243.02. Volume rose to 320m shares from 229m. Advances led falls by 825 to 190, with 127 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 21.63 at 1,635.31 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.75 to 1,244.73. Aside from arbitrage-related buying, which had led trading in recent days, traders said banks and some life assurers were buying interest rate-sensitive issues. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel commented: 'Some investors are starting to believe that the market will firm after the weekend elections.' Interest rate-sensitive financial issues were higher on hopes of monetary easing. Industrial Bank of Japan moved ahead Y90 to Y3,150 and Bank of Tokyo Y90 to Y1,660. Traders said the Long Term Credit Bank's decision to end its financial support for EIE International, the unlisted property developer, prompted hopes that other banks will follow suit in cutting off restructuring support. Companies linked to EIE International drew heavy selling orders. Sea-Com, listed on the second section, closed at an offered price of Y385, down Y80, and Electronic &amp; International Enterprises closed on the over-the-counter market at an offer price of Y850, a fall of Y100. Interest rate-sensitive, large-capital stocks were firm, Nippon Steel adding Y9 at Y372 and Kawasaki Steel Y4 at Y341. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone jumped Y37,000 to Y915,000, regaining the Y900,000 level for the first time since June 24. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 230.68 to 22,188.90 in volume of 16.2m shares. The index advanced for the fourth consecutive trading day, exceeding the 22,000 level for the first time since June 16. Roundup DISCERNIBLE trends were hard to find among the region's markets yesterday as a general period of consolidation took hold. HONG KONG ended marginally higher, supported by the banking and utilities sectors. The Hang Seng index gained 3.51 at 6,956.10. Property issues were sold partly on fears that mainland investors might sell holdings because of China's tightened credit policies. Cheung Kong retreated 50 cents to HKDollars 25.60 and Henderson Land 20 cents to HKDollars 20.90. SEOUL was lower for the third straight session on institutional selling. The composite index lost 6.13 to 762.94 in turnover down to Won478bn from Monday's Won505bn. Lucky-Goldstar group shares went against the trend on an announcement that the group planned to sell eight subsidiaries and merge five units by the end of 1995. Goldstar Instrument and Electric rose Won400 to Won22,900. TAIWAN continued its downward trend in the absence of positive news. The weighted index fell 65.53, or 1.6 per cent, to 4,013.18. Turnover came to TDollars 17.2bn, against TDollars 16.3bn. AUSTRALIA was supported by brisk trading in Woolworths, but easier gold shares later in the day dampened sentiment. The All Ordinaries index finished a net 2.4 up at 1,804.2. The golds index receded 8 full points to 2,215.7. About 17.4m Woolworths shares were traded after Monday's ADollars 2.5bn flotation, and the stock lost a cent at ADollars 2.80 after reaching ADollars 2.83 earlier. NEW ZEALAND retreated from Monday's three-year high to close slightly lower. The NZSE-40 index slipped 3.12 to 1,723.73 in a turnover of NZDollars 767m. KARACHI ended sharply higher after a positive round of meetings between President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif lifted sentiment. The KSE index rose 15.67 to 1,259.85.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Timeframes for hearing <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The proposed regulations provide that a practitioner's or other person's request for a preliminary hearing must be received within 15 days of receipt of an OIG exclusion notice. Once such a request is received, the preliminary hearing is to be held and a decision rendered on the ``serious risk'' issue within 45 days. In those cases where the ALJ grants a stay of the exclusion, a full hearing must be held and a decision rendered within six months. These timeframes developed for the ALJs are intended to balance the right of a ``rural'' practitioner or other person to receive timely due process against the OIG responsibility to ensure that substandard or unnecessary health care services are not provided to program beneficiaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Sanctions Notification Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1156(b)(2) of the Act requires reasonable notice to the public of a sanction action being taken against a practitioner or other person based on the PRO's recommendation. Under the current implementing regulations, when a sanction action is taken by the OIG against a practitioner or other person, the OIG is required to notify the general public of such action. This notice to the public specifically identifies: (1) The sanctioned practitioner or other person; (2) the obligation that has been violated by this person; (3) the specific sanction action imposed; and (4) if the sanction is an exclusion, the effective date and duration of this action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this public notification process has worked well in most instances, we believe the present publication procedure may not always yield the most effective results of informing affected parties and program beneficiaries of a specific sanction action taken under the program. As a result, we are considering permitting practitioners and other persons to select an alternative method of notification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed regulations would amend 42 CFR part 1004 to offer sanctioned health care practitioners and other persons the option of informing all their patients directly of a sanction action taken against them. If they select this option and comply with its requirements in a timely fashion, this compliance would constitute public notice and would replace the public notice currently published by the OIG. Among other things, a practitioner or other person opting for this method of notification would be required to certify to the Department that they have undertaken to inform all their patients of the action taken and, in the case of exclusion, that they will notify new patients before furnishing services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Method of direct notification of patients by practitioner or other person <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . We considered a variety of methods for practitioners and other persons to notify and inform patients of a sanction action. For example, we considered having the sanctioned party (1) post a sign in his, her or its office; (2) verbally communicate the information to patients when they called for an appointment or came to an office visit; or (3) send written notification to each of his, her or its patients. After evaluating the options, we believe that the first two methods indicated above would not effectively meet the proposed requirement that all existing patients be informed within 30 calendar days since it is unlikely that all of these patients would make an appointment or come for an office visit in the specified period. In addition, the Department would be unable to verify that the proper information had been adequately conveyed to the patients if either of the first two notification methods were selected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We, therefore, propose that each sanctioned practitioner or other person opting for this alternative notification procedure alert both his, her or its existing patients and all new patients through written notification based on a suggested (non-mandatory) model that will be provided to the sanctioned individual by the OIG. If the sanctioned party is a hospital, the hospital would be required to notify all physicians having privileges at the hospital, as well as post a sign in its emergency room, business office and in all affiliated entities regarding its sanction. (Practitioners and other persons must also notify all new patients orally at the time an appointment is set to provide services, as well as provide written notification to such patients at the time they arrive to see the provider for treatment or services.) We believe that only through this method can the OIG assure that all patients are properly informed of a sanction action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

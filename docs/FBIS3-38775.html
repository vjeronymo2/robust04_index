			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kaa Eneberg: "Tough Confrontation on </F> Unemployment"]    [Text] The government expects more horse trading with  New Democracy this spring over introduction of the child care  allowance and unemployment insurance.    Social Democrat Goran Persson said the government  should show some humility and promised that there would be a  traditional Social Democratic budget as an alternative when the  budget is submitted to the Riksdag.    The government can expect a tough confrontation with the  Social Democrats, especially on the subject of the high  unemployment rate, which the government is considered to have  accepted all too casually. Specific proposals regarding measures  for creating jobs will be the main item in the SDP's [Social  Democratic Party] financial bill two weeks from now.    Minister of Finance Anne Wibble (Liberal Party) promised  during the Riksdag debate that she would be interested in  studying any of the SDP's proposals, saying she hoped it would  not take a full four months to present them, as she said it did  when Allan Larsson was the party's financial spokesman last  year. She did not feel, however, that economic spokesman Goran  Persson's talk about the SDP's usual solutions for creating jobs  and faster growth inspired any hope.  <H5>  Irresponsible Expenditure </H5>   SDP leader Ingvar Carlsson said at a news conference that it  ought to be possible to convert the many billions of kronor that  a 14-percent unemployment rate will cost into jobs. He also said  that his party opposed the child care allowance, which he called  an irresponsible expenditure of from 2 billion to 6 billion  kronor whose only purpose was to hold the four-party coalition  together.    "Typically, they are choosing to cut back on the allowance  for more than one child to make room for the child care  allowance dictated by the KDS [Christian Democratic Party],"  said Carlsson. He pointed out that the government's policy was  characterized excessively by special party-political interests.    "The Center Party is demanding subsidies for the farmers,  the  KDS is demanding the child care allowance, and the Moderates are  insisting not only on tax relief for stockholders but also on  more money for the police and correctional treatment," said the  SDP leader, who avoided drawing attention to the Liberal Party's  special interests.    The various areas in which the SDP wants to save money were  not revealed on Monday [10 January], which was reserved for  attacks on the government's policy. But Carlsson mentioned the  Armed Forces as one area where the Social Democrats think it is  possible to achieve savings.  <H5>  Foothold </H5>   The SDP's spokesman on economic affairs, Goran Persson,  called the Bildt government's economic policy the biggest  political failure of the postwar period because mass  unemployment has gotten a foothold in Sweden. He rejected as  pure falsification the government's promise to cut unemployment  in half by the turn of the century.    At the same time that he accused the government of cutting  back the budget too drastically -- higher taxes, cutbacks in the  construction industry, and selective purchase taxes -- he  complained that the government had been unable to come up with  any new proposals for savings that would reduce the budget  deficit.    Persson feels that Anne Wibble ought to show more humility  now that she has the "answer sheet" regarding economic policy in  her hand. Besides record unemployment and the continuing high  budget deficit, he also criticized the fact that at 13.5 percent  of GNP, the investment level is now at "the 1930's level." That  puts Sweden in last place among the industrialized countries.  <H5>  Wider Gaps </H5>   Johann Lonnroth of the Left Party criticized the government  for widening the gaps in society with its tax reductions for the  rich. He proposed a 5-percent tax hike for all upper incomes. He  also brought up his party's old proposal to introduce a six-hour  workday to bring unemployment down.    He tried to get Goran Persson to say where he stood on his  relations with the Liberal Party, but had to be content with  reminding him that "you need us to tear up the tax on stock  shares and in connection with the labor law."    Lonnroth also called for radical new thinking aimed at  creating new jobs in such areas as environment and education.  Anne Wibble delightedly drew attention to the budget's unique  appendix on the environment, but he dismissed it as being as  good as worthless since it made no proposals and provided no  funds.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |State Budget, 1994-95                                                      |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Revenues                             |Expenditures                         |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Item              |Billions of kronor|Item              |Billions of kronor|  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other revenues    |38                |Investments and s-|21                |  |                  |                  |o on              |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Income, property  |63                |Debt service      |85                |  |taxes             |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Statutory social  |71                |Consumption       |128               |  |security contribu-|                  |                  |                  |  |tions             |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Value-added tax a-|187               |Subsidies         |297               |  |nd other taxes on |                  |                  |                  |  |goods and services|                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Budget deficit    |38                |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total             |531               |Total             |531               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      New Democracy's Ian Wachtmeister insisted that he would be  able to accept the child care allowance bill that the government  is going to submit in February only if it is paid for out of the  budget for family policy. He described the government's proposal  to reduce the extra allowance for more than one child as a move  by the government to placate New Democracy.    That opened up the possibility of more cutbacks in family  policy. The 82 billion kronor that family policy is already  costing can be reduced even further, he said. He spontaneously  mentioned time off to care for sick children.  <H5>  Certain Conditions </H5>   New Democracy is also placing certain conditions on its  acceptance of the unemployment insurance proposal that will be  presented in March. Wachtmeister thinks it will be possible to  influence the deadline for terminating unemployment benefits.    Wachtmeister also wants to include in discussions with the  government the question of a general basic security system so  that the cost of the entire social security system can be met in  the future. He outlined a tax-supported basic security system  paying the same as the cash labor market assistance benefit,  which the party has gotten increased to 245 kronor per day.  Anything over that amount would be paid for by individual  contributions.    New Democracy said, however, that increasing the subsidy by  400 million kronor was "ridiculous," and it feels that cutting  aid to developing countries in half would be more appropriate.    New Democracy's financial bill will also call for cutbacks  in  refugee policy.</p>

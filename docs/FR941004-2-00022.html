The estimated margins of sales at less than fair value are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Case History <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the initiation of this investigation on March 21, 1994 (59 FR 14148, March 25, 1994), the following events have occurred: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 11, 1994, the United State International Trade Commission (``ITC'') issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ITC Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;694). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b), the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') issued its antidumping duty questionnaire to B.K.L. Fittings Limited (``BKL''), on April 29, 1994. BKL is the only U.K. producer and exporter named in the petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner requested a 50-day postponement of the preliminary determination on June 30, 1994. The request was granted by the Department of Commerce on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 37961, July 26, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 16, 1994, petitioner alleged that BKL was selling the subject merchandise in the U.K. at less than its cost of production. After analyzing petitioner's allegation we found reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales in the home market were being made at less than the cost of production. On August 15, 1994, we issued a cost of production/constructed value questionnaire to BKL. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 4, 1994, petitioner alleged critical circumstances with regard to imports of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from the U.K. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The products covered by this investigation are certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings (``pipe fittings'') having an inside diameter of less than fourteen inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished condition. Pipe fittings are formed or forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems where conditions require permanent welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of fastening ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). Butt-weld fittings come in a variety of shapes which include ``elbows,'' ``tees,'' ``caps,,'' and ``reducers.'' The edges of finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. These pipe fittings are currently classifiable under subheading 7307.93.3000 of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (``HTSUS''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Period of Investigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The period of investigation (``POI'') is September 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Product Comparisons <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In making our fair value comparisons, in accordance with the Department's standard methodology, we first compared sales of merchandise identical in all respects. If no identical merchandise was sold, we compared sales of the most similar merchandise, as determined by the model-matching criteria contained in Appendix V of the questionnaire (``Appendix V'') (on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce (``Public File'')). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We were unable to compare United States sales to home market sales at the same level of trade in accordance with 19 CFR 353.58 (1994), because the computer tape submitted by respondent did not identify the level of trade for each sale. For purposes of our preliminary determination we compared sales without regard to level of trade. However, we will request that respondent submit the necessary data on level of trade to the Department within the regulatory deadlines ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 19 CFR 353.31) and we will take it into consideration in accordance with 19 CFR 353.58 in our final determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

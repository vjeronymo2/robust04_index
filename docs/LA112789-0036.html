			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BISHOP BARS RITE FOR KILLEA  </P> <P> I am appalled at the decision of Maher barring Killea from receiving her  church's sacrament. As a former Catholic, Maher validates my decision to leave  the church.  </P> <P> The Catholic Church has a right to oppose abortion, however, this country has a  deep-seated belief in separation of church and state. Trying to coerce an  elected official by means of religious blackmail is inexcusable. Does Bishop  Maher not believe that Killea first and foremost is answerable to the  constituents who elected her? After all, if we do not like the way she does her  job, we will not reelect her. What if 75% of the voters agree with her. Does  she ignore them because of the church's beliefs?  </P> <P> Religious intimidation has no place in the government of a free people.  Decisions of old men who are so far outside the mainstream of lay life styles  do not reflect the complex problems in this century. What they really want is  long gone -- women in the kitchen and pregnant.  </P> <P> I would rank Maher's actions with the church's attitude on condoms to combat  AIDs. Their apparent lack of care for the individual is abhorrent to any  thinking person.  </P> <P> JEANNE RAY  </P> <P> Fallbrook  </P></p>

			<p>BSP   Examined  <H4>  Kansi, Mayavati Key Players </H4>  <F P=102> 94AS0246A Varanasi AJ in Hindi 16 Mar 94 pp 1, 7 </F> <F P=103> 94AS0246A </F> <F P=104>  Varanasi AJ </F> <F P=105>  Hindi </F> CSO     [Text] New Delhi, 15 March. The criticism by Kanshi Ram and  Mayavati of the SP-BSP [Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party]  coalition government in Uttar Pradesh hints toward the future  strategy of the BSP. The BSP does not appear to be willing to  play the political game with the SP in Uttar Pradesh for long.  Kanshi Ram and Mayavati appear to have already started to write  an introduction to their separate political existence. However,  Kanshi Ram is not ready to uproot the present U.P. government  yet. He did make a public announcement to this affect. It is  assumed that the BSP will continue to support the government  because it has its own vested interests there along with Mulayam  Singh. It is important for this party to remain in the  government in order to establish a basic structure for ruling  the state. Kanshi Ram is well aware of this practical fact.  Kanshi Ram is already rallying popular support by his and his  supporters' sharp criticism [of the government]. He will  announce his separate political stand at the right time while  all this is going on. He wants to stay in the government and  create an atmosphere in which he can point to his criticism as a  proof that he had given enough time to Mulayam Singh to improve.  Mulayam Singh having failed to meet the criteria, however, he  (Kanshi Ram) was forced to make this decision.    Kanshi Ram's whole political strategy is based on this kind  of politics now. He is preparing for the future. Under this  plan, some times he talks about evaluating Mulayam Singh's  government in about six months and other times he talks about  dislodging it.    During this period, Kanshi Ram wants to establish his new  image. This image will portray him as not willing to compromise  when the interests of the Dalits are at stake. So much so that  he would not compromise even with the government in which he is  a partner. Mayavati's criticism of Gandhi is the climactic point  of this effort. The BSP wants to demonstrate that it does not  think much of Gandhi as compared to Ambedekar.    The BSP has assumed that if it succeeds in keeping the sword  of its politics sharp, it will be able to establish its  government in Uttar Pradesh by itself whenever the next vidhan  sabha elections are held. Kanshi Ram and his supporters are  working based on this assumption. Keeping this in mind, he is  more or less acting like the opposition leader even though he is  in the government.    Kanshi Ram has another target. He is hoping that if the  Congress Party, which has supported the state government, is  forced to take back its support because of the BSP criticism,  then it would prove to be politically beneficial to the BSP.  However, the Congress Party has also started its preparations  perceiving the imminent political changes. It has started a  regular campaign against the BSP so that it does not face  problems in the future.</p>

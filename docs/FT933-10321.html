			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / (CORRECTED) World Trade News: ABB wins Athens airport contract Correction (published 13th August 1993) appended to this article. A consortium led by Mannheim-based ABB Schaltanlagen, part of Asea Brown Boveri, has won a Dollars 420m (Pounds 282m) contract to provide and install all the electrical equipment for the new Athens airport at Sparta, writes Andrew Baxter. The contract from the Greek government follows last week's selection of a consortium led by Hochtief, the German construction company, to build the airport. The complete project is worth about Dollars 2.3bn. ABB companies are partners in the overall consortium, and will account for about Dollars 235m of the electrical work won by the subsidiary consortium. CORRECTION In the Financial Times of August 4, a contract for a new airport near Athens was recorded as being at Sparta. It should have read Spata.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Painful sting of business rates - In a Nutshell Business rates have risen by 28 per cent over the past three years compared with an increase of just 20 per cent in the retail price index, according to the latest NatWest/Small Business Research Trust small business survey. Rates account for an average 2.3 per cent of the sales of small businesses; but for the very smallest businesses, with sales of less than Pounds 20,000, they account for 5.1 per cent of turnover. Unlike corporation and income tax, rates must be paid whether or not the business makes a profit, the survey noted.</p>

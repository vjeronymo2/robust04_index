			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Senate approves budget deficit cuts THE US Senate yesterday handed President Bill Clinton another substantial political victory when it approved the broad outlines of his plan to cut the federal budget deficit by Dollars 500bn (Pounds 352bn) over the next five years. The critical vote on the Dollars 1,500bn Budget Resolution Bill for fiscal 1994 was 54-45. Only two Democrats broke ranks with the president - Senator Richard Shelby, a conservative from Alabama, and Senator Bob Krueger of Texas, an interim senator fighting for full-time election from the state in May. Another Democrat, Senator Daniel Inouye from Hawaii, was away from Washington and did not vote. There are a few minor differences between the Senate bill and that which passed the House with ease last week. These must be reconciled by a conference committee of the two chambers. The Senate then moved on to debate Mr Clinton's Dollars 16bn short-term stimulus plan amid predictions that it would be harder to keep the Democrats in line. The passage by both houses of the deficit reduction plan is an indispensable first step in the budgetary process. Although the hard programme-by-programme spending cuts and tax-by-tax revenue increases have yet to be addressed, defeat for the president in the initial stage of the legislative process would have severely undermined his authority. His victory shows his political clout and the loyalty of his party. In a TV interview on Wednesday night, Mr Clinton was confident he would carry the day. He also argued strongly in favour of the stimulus plan. The public, he said, would be 'outraged' if the opportunity to create an extra 500,000 new jobs was passed up. The Senate, by a 73-24 margin, also gave Mr Clinton the 'line item veto', which would enable him to overrule individual spending and tax allocations without sacrificing a whole bill. Though this was granted only in the form of a non-binding resolution, without immediate practical effect, it is a test of Senate sentiment on the issue. Former President George Bush never persuaded the Democratic majority to grant him the veto. The Democratic leadership in the Senate has resisted all attempts this week substantially to change Mr Clinton's proposed package. The toughest challenge was overcome with the defeat of a Republican amendment to prevent the administration from increasing taxes on wealthier pensioners.</p>

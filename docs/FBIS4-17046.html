			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 19, BNS -- The representative of  Russian radical nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky's  Liberal Democratic party in Estonia, Pyotr Rozhok, was elected  the chairman of the presidium of Tallinn's League of Russian  Citizens.    The organization of Russian citizens in the Estonian capital  was established on April 9.    Rozhok said the new body is to defend the interests of  Russian citizen residents of Tallinn. He added that this was to  be done "only within the limits set by legal acts," by  bringing, as he said, to the world's notice all violations of  the rights of Russian citizens in Estonia. The new body is to  address the United Nations and the Russian parliament on the  issue in the near future, Rozhok said.    He added that there are about 30,000 legal Russian citizens  living in Tallinn.    The organization in Tallinn will also prepare the documents  necessary for its registration with the Estonian authorities.  "But I'm more than sure that we will never be registered,"  Rozhok said.    The league is also an in corpore member of the Russian  Community of Estonia, another hardline Russian-speakers'  organization that has failed so far to gain a formal status with  Estonia's authorities.    More than 42,000 Estonian residents have taken Russian  citizenship by now.</p>

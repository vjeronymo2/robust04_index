			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (8): It's not so easy as ABC - Prospects in Asia and its biggest market, Japan That the country which took the lead in making electronic devices portable should have also led the way with portable computers is not surprising. Seiko Epson claims to have been the first company to put a transportable computer on the market with its liquid crystal display in 1982. Toshiba defined the laptop class with its T1100 series, released in 1989, and was also ahead of the field in making computing truly mobile with the Dynabook, the first notebook computer, in 1989. Japanese companies are still virtually the only suppliers of a key component that makes mobile computers mobile: liquid crystal displays. And these days, the only computers exported from Japan are portable models. Japan is also far and away Asia's largest single computer market. Sales of personal computers in Japan rose steadily through the 1980s, but have been stagnant for the past three years at about 2.2m units a year, of which about 40 per cent are laptops and notebooks. Apart from Japan, reliable figures on the Asian mobile computer market are hard to come by. Dataquest Japan, the market research company, estimates the combined volume of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore at roughly equal to Japan's market, but puts the share of mobile computers at far less, at around 10 per cent. Analysts forecast a resumption of growth in Japan's PC market this year, expanding to 3m units or more a year by 1995. Japan has the world's highest ratio of portables and remains Asia's most important mobile computing market. Japan's affinity for portables, however, is not based on their mobility but on their size. In Japan - and to some extent in Korea - notebook computers are not used for computing on the go, but in place of desktop systems. They take up less space in cramped offices than their bulky, full-sized cousins. And therein lies the nub of differing views over future directions of Japan's market. According to Dataquest, although volume has been stagnant, the value of the market has crept up. A price war initiated in Japan by Compaq of the US has cut prices to half or less what they were just two years ago. But rather than go downmarket, buyers have been tempted to stretch their budgets, buying computers with faster processors, more memory and bigger hard disks. Mr Katsushi Shiga, a Dataquest analyst, sees this trend carrying over to the notebook market. In particular, as colour liquid crystal displays become more affordable, he expects notebooks with colour displays to replace desktop systems for applications needing colour. He says this could help boost the notebook segment to 60 per cent of a growing market. A contrary view comes from Mr Makio Inui, a Kleinwort Benson International analyst. He also sees an upturn in personal computer sales beginning this year, based on rising demand from corporate users, who account for some 70 per cent of the market. But he believes purchasing managers in Japan will be under pressure to get as much computing power as they can for as few yen. This, Mr Inui concludes, favours the more economical desktop systems, and he sees a fall in the share of the market held by notebook computers. While the majority of mobile computers in Japan move no further than from one corner of a desk to another, the electronic organisers that slip into a jacket pocket get carried around. These are seen as the forerunners of the personal digital assistants now coming onto the market. The new devices, relying on pen-input, will be a boon in Asian countries, such as Japan, which use Chinese characters for the written language. One reason that computers - mobile or otherwise - are rarely used by senior Japanese executives is that they never learned to type. There were mechanical analogues to western typewriters for Chinese characters, but they were unwieldy and difficult to use. The younger generation has grown up using word processors and computers, but their elders are afflicted with 'keyboard allergy'. But the same Chinese characters that would make pen-input devices particularly useful make them extremely difficult to realise. The algorithms that are slow and error-prone in recognising the 26 letters of the English alphabet have a more daunting task in trying to identify the roughly 2,000 characters used in Japanese newspapers. Pen-input machines and software with acceptable speed and accuracy are likely to emerge later in Asia than in the US and Europe. This means that except for a number of specialised niches, the size of the keyboard is still likely to limit the extent to which machines for serious mobile computing can shrink, even more so in Asia than in America and Europe. The pen-input personal digital assistants are likely to find a niche in Asia as specialised tools. They might be used, for example, to tick off deliveries on an electronic form. For more general use, PDAs may prove their worth for checking electronic mail and as sophisticated paging devices. Mr Inui sees the ability to send 10 to 20 lines of text to roving sales staff and travelling executives as creating a niche for PDAs equipped with receivers. But the growth of this market will require the blessing of telecommunications authorities, which he sees as slow in coming in Japan.</p>

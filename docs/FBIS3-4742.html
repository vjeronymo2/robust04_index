			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 27 (KCNA) -- A document of the  International Fellowship of Reconciliation (IFOR) concerning the  "comfort women" issue was distributed as an official document of  the 50th meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights.    The document recalls that at the UN sub-commission on  prevention of discrimination and protection of minorities held  in August, 1993, Japan admitted to the war-time enslavement of  "comfort women" by the Japanese Army and Government.    The facts admitted by Japan belong to such paragraphs as  expulsion, enslavement, inhumanity and political and racial  oppression, crimes against humanity, it says, adding that  prescription does not apply to the acts of the Japanese Army and  they must be punished by international law.    It says Japan should therefore take necessary measures for  the punishment of those responsible for the above-mentioned  crimes.    Recalling that in 1932 Japan signed the convention on forced  and compulsory labor which was adopted by the International  Labor Organisation in 1930, the document notes that the present  government should still be obligated for punishment under the  convention.    The criminal acts against "comfort women" should have been  punished by the then Japanese "law", too, the document says.    It stresses there cannot be any prescription with Japan's  obligation under the international law.    It calls attention to the fact that Japan has not yet  punished the criminals who had inflicted sufferings upon the  more than 200,000 "comfort women for the army".    Noting that Japan still refuses to admit that the acts  committed against Asian "comfort women", mostly Koreans,  recrimes, the document says such an approach is a disgraceful  insult and discrimination against the Asian women.    The document points to some matters, urging the Japanese  Government to take all measures including legislature,  investigation, trial and punishment and make adequate  compensations to all the "comfort women for the army" so as to  fulfil its obligations under the international law regarding the  punishment of those responsible for the criminal acts committed  against the victimized "comfort women".</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 22 March, Acting Foreign Minister Jose Miguel  Insulza reiterated that Chile is open to discuss either of the  two possibilities for trade integration with the United States.  The possibilities are the signature of a free trade bilateral  treaty or the incorporation of Chile into NAFTA, of which the  United States, Mexico, and Canada are members.    According to Insulza, Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat  informed U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor of these  alternatives during his visit to Chile to attend Frei's  presidential inauguration. Insulza said the two countries' trade  representatives will define an agenda to begin talks soon. For  this, it must first be decided whether Chile will use the  bilateral agreement or NAFTA.    He added that the United States has not decided which  countries will join the "fast track" [preceding two words in  English] to begin the negotiations. This mechanism consists of  an authorization granted by the U.S. Congress to the executive  branch to negotiate quickly and then present a general agreement  to the legislative branch for its approval.    The acting foreign minister said the two alternatives have  advantages and disadvantages. He said a bilateral agreement is  quicker because it does not include all the items of NAFTA,  which foresees more complex trade relations between the United  States, Mexico, and Canada. As for NAFTA, Insulza said the  advantage is that Chile could join a broader trade association  and the items to be negotiated are already known and defined.    Another aspect of bilateral relations between Chile and the  United States is connected with the case of cyanide-poisoned  grapes, which caused an embargo of Chilean fruit in March 1989.  Regarding this subject, Insulza said the diplomatic  negotiations are compatible with the lawsuit filed by Chilean  fruit exporters. He added that some of the negotiation's  elements could change according to the status of the lawsuit.    Regarding the approval of the ambassadors named by Chile,  Insulza said that so far Argentina, Peru, and Mexico have given  the "agreement" [preceding word in English] for Eduardo  Rodriguez, Carlos Martinez Sotomayor, and Carlos Portales,  respectively. He said this is due not only to the good relations  maintained with these countries, but also to the expeditious  processing of the documents, which sometimes is complex. He  cited as an example the fact that in Europe the approval of  ambassadors is made by a council of state and in some Latin  American countries it is made by the Foreign Ministry, which  grants the "agreement" directly and without delay.</p>

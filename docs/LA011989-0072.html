			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COLLECTIBLES: KEY FACTORS HELP ASCERTAIN DOLLAR VALUE OF PADLOCKS  </P> <P> Question: I have a fairly large padlock collection. What are some of the more  collectible names that would give some of these pieces a higher dollar value?  -- F.E.  </P> <P> Answer: Company names that appear to attract a lot of collector interest  include Wells Fargo, Winchester, Yale &amp; Towne Mfg. Co., Eagle Lock Co. and  Miller Lock Co.  </P> <P> Padlocks began being mass-produced in the United States in the middle of the  19th Century; more than 150 such firms have been identified by collectors.  </P> <P> American-made padlocks seem to be the most popular among collectors, even  though padlocks had been manufactured in Europe for a couple of hundred years  before appearing in this country.  </P> <P> Iron and brass padlocks are considered among the most valuable. They should  have company names on them to maintain their collectibility.  </P> <P> Some collectors specialize in specific lock companies; others look for subject  areas, such as railroad padlocks.  </P> <P> Collectors say it's not necessarily important to have a padlock's original key,  although this would enhance its value. But the padlock itself, they say, should  be in reasonably good condition -- that is, relatively free of rust and cracks.  </P> <P> Because valuable padlocks can carry price tags of $100 and up (although the  beginning collector can find interesting padlocks for under $30), it's a good  idea to have an expert authenticate the one you're interested in purchasing.  </P> <P> Desmond Leigh-Hunt writes: "I have nearly 100 new-car brochures for American  automobiles dating back to 1952. I know there must be people out there with  cherished 25- and 30-year-old cars who would dearly love to have the sales  brochure that was printed when their cars were new. I'd like to sell them if I  could." Telephone: (805) 569-0741.  </P></p>

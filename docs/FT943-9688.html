			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Singapore sees 10% growth Singapore's economy grew at an annualised rate of 10.5 per cent in the first half of the year, said Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in a speech marking the island republic's national day yesterday, Kieran Cooke reports from Kuala Lumpur. Singapore's planners had forecast economic growth of between 6 and 8 per cent in 1994 but full-year forecasts are now likely to be revised upward to between 9 and 10 per cent. Last year Singapore's economy expanded 9.2 per cent. 'All sectors of the economy are expanding,' said Mr Goh. Manufacturing output had increased well above expectations, driven in part by continuing demand for electronics products. The financial sector also turned in a better than expected performance in the first half of the year, despite a slowdown in foreign exchange activity and in the stockmarket. Mr Goh said per capita income in Singapore was now higher than in Britain but, he said, one of the main problems Singapore would face in future would be 'overindulgence in materialism, subsidies and welfare'.</p>

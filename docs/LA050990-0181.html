			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARL CHANNELL; CONVICTED IN IRAN-CONTRA  </P> <P> Carl R. (Spitz) Channell, a conservative political fund-raiser who became the  first person convicted in the Iran-Contra scandal, has died.  </P> <P> Channell, 44, died Sunday in a Washington hospital of pneumonia related to  injuries suffered in a car accident.  </P> <P> Former Rep. Dan Kuykendall, a friend of Channell who worked on pro-Contra  causes during the time Channell also was involved, said Channell had been  undergoing chemotherapy for lung cancer and had recovered enough to do  consulting work.  </P> <P> But about two months ago, as he was getting out of his car near his office in  southeast Washington, he was struck by a car, according to Kuykendall, a  Tennessee Republican who is now a Capitol Hill lobbyist.  </P> <P> Channell operated a motel in West Virginia until 1979 when he became a major  national fund-raiser for conservative causes. He founded or controlled numerous  conservative organizations, including two political action committees, a  tax-exempt foundation and Western Goals, an organization co-founded by the John  Birch Society.  </P> <P> In 1987, Channell pleaded guilty to using his nonprofit National Endowment for  the Preservation of Liberty to raise more than $2 million to arm the Nicaraguan  Contra rebels.  </P> <P> Two years later, he was sentenced to two years of probation for conspiring to  defraud the government of taxes due on the money he and former White House aide  Oliver North raised for the guerrillas.  </P> <P> Channell's confession was part of an agreement reached in exchange for his  testimony against North, the fired National Security Council aide identified as  the chief operator in covert U.S. arms sales to Iran and the diversion of  profits to the Contras.  </P></p>

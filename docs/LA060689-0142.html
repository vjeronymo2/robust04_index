			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SPORTS;  </P> <P> LAKERS' SCOTT TO MISS FIRST 2 FINALS GAMES  </P> <P> Starting Los Angeles Lakers guard Byron Scott will miss at least the first two  games of the NBA finals because of a partially torn left hamstring, team doctor  Robert Kerlan announced today.  </P> <P> Scott suffered the injury, which Kerlan described as "moderately severe," while  landing awkwardly during the club's workout Monday at the Palace, site of  tonight's opening game of the best-of-seven series between the Lakers and  Detroit Pistons.  </P> <P> Scott, a starter for the Lakers who averaged 19.9 points as the team won a  record 11 straight playoff games to reach the NBA finals, will continue to  receive treatment and will be reevaluated before Sunday's third game of the  finals at the Forum in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> According to a press release, Lakers Coach Pat Riley will make a decision about  who will replace Scott in the starting lineup shortly before tonight's game. A  strong possibility is veteran Michael Cooper.  </P></p>

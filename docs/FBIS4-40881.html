			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["The program of Vyachaslaw Kebich, candidate for the </F> presidency of the Republic of Belarus"]    [Text] Dear compatriots!    As a candidate for the presidency of the Republic of  Belarus,  I am ready to take upon myself the responsibility of expressing  and defending the interests of the people of my Republic by  constitutional means.    I am convinced that the primary goals of our people and our  state are peace and accord, security, material prosperity,  revival of national culture, strengthening of democracy and  lawfulness, and observance of human rights and freedoms.    Belarus should create a society of high economic  effectiveness and social justice, which guarantees the right to  employment, free-of-charge secondary [bazovoye] education and  medical service, as well as pension and social protection. The  state is called to create conditions allowing every man to  secure his family's living by means of his own work.    These are hard times for all of us. Securing our statehood  and economy is a difficult task.    Notwithstanding all measures taken by me, the disruption of  traditional economic ties, as well as political and economic  instability in our partner countries have not been conducive to  stabilizing our economic situation. We are shouldering a heavy  burden of costs connected with the aftermath of the Chernobyl  catastrophe. The Republic has been left practically alone in  the face of this misfortune. National income and the standard  of living have decreased.    Belarus, as other countries of the CIS and East Europe, was  not able to join the world economy for objective reasons. A new  social and economic system for the organization of society has  not been formed. A legislation basis for deep transformation  and a mechanism for implementing resolutions has not been  created. Such is the truth about our life. This is our fault  and our misery.    However, notwithstanding these extremely difficult  circumstances, our population has been provided, through  superior efforts, with all the basics: electricity, heat, gas,  foodstuffs.    Our industry, agriculture, culture, science, and education  have not been allowed to break down. The manageability of our  economy and the social achievements of the people have been  preserved. National accord in our society has been preserved.  We live in peace and friendship with other nations.    We have eliminated many barriers in relations between  Belarus  and Russia, as well as taken the first steps toward our economic  unification. We defeated fascism together, we will overcome the  crisis together, we should head toward the future together!    I heartily thank you, all the people, for your great wisdom  and endurance, selfless labor, and faith in our Belarus during  this hard period in our history. This gives strength to my  assurance that we will overcome all difficulties and obstacles  on the way toward a worthy and prosperous life.    I appeal to the people of Belarus, the soviets at all  levels,  trade unions, all parties and movements to unite our efforts to  overcome the crisis and to lead our Republic toward normal  development. I do not belong to any party, and I will defend  the interests of all citizens regardless of their political  views and their ideological or religious beliefs. The interests  of the people come first for me.    I believe that the president should serve his people  honestly  and be a guarantor of the Constitution, as well as civil rights  and freedoms. I will create every possible condition for the  revival and development of the national culture and the  Belarusian language. I will guarantee the right to profess any  religion.    The people of Belarus should live in dignity, without fear  for the future, and be proud of themselves and their Motherland!    I will resolutely and uncompromisingly fight corruption and  crime. I will safeguard personal immunity and protection from  interference in the individual's personal life.    Our way is that of a civilized humane nation, the way  without  ruining the existing social achievements, the way of rational  transformations without impoverishing the people.    I definitely oppose the ruining of our national intellectual  potential -- the Republic's most valuable possession; I oppose  the decreasing of the social significance of intellectual work  and the immigration of intelligentsia.    I will not allow any manifestation of militant nationalism  and chauvinism, as well as any political confrontation with  neighboring countries or others. I believe that inciting ethnic  feuds is a grave crime. There are, and will always be,  "second-class" citizens in Belarus. I reject violence as a  means of resolving political and interethnic problems.    I am against economic isolationism, against unreasoned  sociological and economic experiments, against pseudo-reforms.    I will be consequently seeking rapprochement, as well as the  strengthening and development of cooperation with Russia,  Ukraine, and other democratic states of the world community.    The future of our nation lies in the health and prosperity  of  our children today. I guarantee the president's special  attention to the protection of maternity and childhood. I will  seek additional preferential measures for working women and  mothers. I will propose a national program, "The Future of  Belarus," which will not only protect, but also develop  national health.  <H5>  The Republic of Belarus Should Have a New Social and </H5> Economic System    The basis for a new social and economic system should be the  Constitution, the principles of national security, economic  effectiveness, and social justice, and the need for harmonizing  interests of all segments of society.  <H5>  Economic Transformations Should Serve Each and All the People </H5>   It is necessary to establish the priority of economic over  political interest and to create a system of civilized  management of the economy without administrative restrictions.    I see the creation of a new social and economic system in  Belarus as connected with structural transformations in all  spheres, above all, with the distribution of ownership and the  optimization of money and credit system, financial relations,  tax policies, the implementation of a new structure of the  national economy and foreign economic relations, the improvement  of state management, and the social protection of the population.    Privatization controlled by the state will be oriented  toward  overcoming the crisis, restructuring and stabilizing the  economy, as well as increasing the economic effectiveness and  the people's welfare. I am behind privatization.    These goals will be achieved by:    -- Clear definition of ownership;    -- Simplification of procedures for privatization in the  interest of the workers;    -- Redistribution of state property between Republican and  local levels on behalf of the latter;    -- Clear definition of state enterprises' status as well as  the conditions for owning, using, and managing state property;    -- Creation of an infrastructure of market economy;    -- Creation of Republic's mortgage funds as guarantees to  big domestic and foreign investors.    State Regulation of the Economy. It is necessary to leave  basic and socially important branches under state control: the  fuel and energy sector, finance, transportation, communication,  science and education, social protection, ecology, and natural  resources.    The president and the government will ensure:    -- Control over state enterprises and sectors not subject to  privatization;    -- Reorganization and redirection of state enterprises based  upon the concept of new economy;    -- Management of state investments and subsidies;    -- Management of employment and job placement for young  people in order to prevent mass unemployment.    The clear and just criteria for distributing financial and  other means between central and local authority bodies will be  established on a legislative basis.  <H5>  Monetary and Credit System; Financial, Currency, and Tax </H5> Policies.    In the new social and economic system and socially oriented  market economy, the banking system will play a significant role.    Banking legislation will be improved and a new system of  management of the National Bank will be implemented to further  the development of the Republic's economy. The state will  ensure support for basic and socially important branches.    I will implement a network of anti-inflation measures,  including:    -- Restoration of ruined financial and economic relations;    -- Utmost use of effective production capabilities;    -- Indexation of pensions and bank savings, the curbing of  the increase of prices;    -- Introduction of a new mechanism for issuing credits to  enterprises and people;    -- Encouragement of state activities in investments;    -- Control over the formation of prices and tariffs for  certain types of foodstuffs and services;    -- Developing free business and trade zones.    I will make every effort to implement a progressive system  of  taxation and to develop the stock and bond market.    All conditions to attract foreign investors will be created.  <H5>  Restructuring Industry </H5>   The primary task is to halt the crisis and stabilize  production. The strategic goal for Belarus is to join the world  economic system.    All conditions for encouraging production of domestic and  foreign investors will be created. Scientific and production  potential of military industry will be oriented toward science  intensive technologies, technological reequipment of the  economy, needs of social sphere, and the production of consumer  goods.    I head the work for restructuring our economy, therefore I  will not allow bankruptcy of enterprises producing goods  necessary for people; I will assist and support such enterprises.    To form market and develop private business, I will  guarantee  the freedom in choosing directions and spheres of activity,  including foreign trade, as well as the equal chances for all  economic entities and support for small- and medium-sized  business in the interests of all society.    I will pay special attention to legal protection and  economic  support of industry, agriculture and private business, as well  as to protection of our manufacturers from unreasonable imports.    I will decrease taxes on imports of modern technologies,  equipment for industry and agriculture, and especially necessary  consumer goods.    In the period of transition to a market economy, I will  establish a state antimonopoly control and prevent any  interference in business undertaking activity.  <H5>  Land Should Be Taken by Landlords To Revive the Countryside </H5>   I guarantee state support for agriculture.    I believe that a man working on land should be able to sell  his produce without difficulties and live prosperously by his  work. Guided by this principle, I support a transition to modern  multistructured agriculture which comprises various  complementary forms of ownership -- state, cooperative, and  private.    I uphold kolkhozes and sovkhozes; I will support their  voluntary transformation into joint-stock companies. I uphold  the formation of a reliable structure for agricultural  production. I uphold the development of strong personal truck  farms free from taxes.    I will support agricultural and agro-industrial enterprises  financially; I will introduce only two taxes in agriculture --  the differential tax and the property tax.    I will disallow profiteering in land and administration  interference in farming. Farming will be operated solely  according to economic levers and the principle of a just parity  of prices.    Qualified agricultural workers are our national pride. They  are called on to safeguard the Republic's needs in foodstuffs.  Carrying out rational transformations in the countryside is  their responsibility.    I believe it necessary to introduce state subsidies for  prospective branches of agricultural production --  highest-quality seed farming, livestock breeding, flax growing,  implementing modern and ecologically clean technologies.    I will safeguard the social revival of the countryside.  <H5>  The Government is for the People, Not the People for the </H5> Government    This slogan by our national hero Kastus Kalinowski [leader  of  the anti-czarist uprising in the 19th century] is, in my  opinion, a basic principle underlying the formation of a new  system of state management.    I believe it to be my holy duty to safeguard the  unconditional fulfillment of the Constitution and the laws of  the Republic of Belarus.    I will seek to ensure the precedence of law over the current  authority, observance of personal rights and freedoms, and  equality of all citizens before the law regardless of their  official positions. I will safeguard strong control over the  implementation of adopted laws and resolutions at all levels.    I will resolutely and rationally lead an uncompromising  fight  against crime and corruption.    Guided by the Constitution, I will propose a new Cabinet of  Ministers consisting of competent, highly-educated, and  trustworthy people who are loyal to the principles of democracy  and national sovereignty. I am ready to invite experts from  various parties and movements to participate in the government.  <H5>  Security of Citizens and the State, Resolution of Ecological </H5> Problems Means Order in Our Common Home    The president will be a guarantor of security for citizens  and the state. I will create a reliable system of national  security. The Republic will take part in the CIS collective  security system. A buildup of the Belarusian Armed Forces and  the maintenance of their combat readiness will be accomplished  in the interests of the people and according to the Belarusian  Constitution and the state military doctrine.    I will firmly defend the personal security of every citizen,  every family, and all economic entities by all legal means.  Safeguarding security and justice, strengthening of law and  order, and protection of human rights are the most important  tasks of the presidency as well as priorities for the nation.    The accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is the  most  serious catastrophe in the history of mankind. Along with the  entire nation, I am extremely concerned about the ecological  situation in our Republic.    I will initiate the adoption of a law on protection of the  nation's ecology. I will seek to focus all means and resources,  allocated by our Republic and the world community to deal with  the aftermath of this terrible tragedy, to restore a healthy  environment and to abandon harmful technologies.    I will ensure that every person will have the right to due  process and material compensation for injuries due to toxic  accidents.    We are doomed to live on land contaminated by Chernobyl. I,  as the president, will do everything under these difficult  circumstances no only to preserve the nation but also create  conditions for its development.  <H5>  Social Policy Will Be Pursued in Everybody's Interest </H5>   The formation of a new social and economic system is  impossible without a strong social policy by the president.    My new social policy provides for the following:    -- Preservation of social achievements of the people; the  indexation of pensions and savings in 1994-95;    -- Creation of conditions for every able-bodied citizens to  enjoy their right to work with a guarantee for protection of  other rights and freedoms;    -- Legislative regulation of high incomes through the system  of progressive taxation with the purpose of eliminating economic  stratification and economic inequality;    -- Legislative guarantees for a minimum income with  definition of a clear mechanism for changing this minimum;    -- Increase of living space funded by the state and means  from other sources; a guarantee of housing for socially  unprotected citizens of Belarus.    I favor improving the social protection system. I will pay  special attention to the introduction of social benefits for  sick people, invalids, single mothers and large families,  orphans, mothers of perished sons, and veterans.    A system of multipurpose credits for young people and young  families will be implemented to promote and upgrade vocational  training, facilitate obtaining housing, and expedite acquiring  personal property.    An important task of the state will be to support families  and women -- mothers and educators of our children. As early as  1994, I will introduce special state deposits to obtain housing  for every newly-born Belarusian citizen.    Special attention will be given to health care to heighten  its effectivity and quality. I guarantee available and free  medical care for all segments and groups of society. The  development of paid forms of health care will be pursued without  replacing free health care. New forms of financing will be  provided, as well as improved medicines and new equipment,  produced due to conversion; incomes of medical workers will be  increased.    The state will become a guarantor of fair compensation for  servicemen and workers of law enforcement bodies, considering  their difficult service of protecting the people and the state.  Before having been transferred to the reserve, every serviceman  will have an opportunity to retrain to a civil profession. I  guarantee preferences for servicemen in pension and housing  security.    I will pay special attention to youth employment. Graduates  of higher educational institutions and technical high schools  will be provided jobs. Stipends for students will be  established at a level no lower than the minimum wage.    I will submit a proposal for granting amnesty to certain  categories of citizens.    I will support the development of physical training and  sports as well as the Olympic movement. We are proud of our  celebrated sportsmen and Olympic athletes.    I consider the partnership between the government and  employers, trade unions, and other social organizations as  important.  <H5>  Culture, Education, and Science Are Our Priorities </H5>   Man should have the highest value in our society. The  Republic of Belarus should join the global system of education,  science, and culture.    Regarding education, I propose:    -- To create a system of modern preschool and school  education, directed toward the formation of a highly moral  person and toward inculcation of spiritual values, patriotism,  respect toward parents and the older generation; I will ensure  a significant increase in teachers' incomes;    -- To develop an open state vocational and technical  education ensuring modern professions to people.    Young people will have the possibility to be educated on a  competitive basis at the state's expense in domestic educational  institutions and leading foreign educational centers. Every  needy student will be granted a place in the student dormitory  on preferential terms.    The harmonious development of the Belarusian nation cannot  be  separated from the Russian culture and language. I support the  idea of establishing an open Slav university. I will uphold the  development of schools with instruction in the national  languages of Belarusian minorities on the basis of unified state  programs.    I will strive to restructure science, as well as concentrate  the efforts of academic and branch scientific research  institutes in resolving priority problems. I will ensure  first-priority subsidies for fundamental research based on state  orders.    I guarantee fair compensation to scientific workers,  stipends  for scientific degrees, and intellectual property protection for  scientists and inventors.    The situation in culture is an indicator of the moral health  of the people!    Using all the president's prerogatives, I will support the  revival of all ethnic cultures, the Belarusian language,  traditions, and moral values; I will ensure the protection of  monuments of culture and architecture, art and history.    I will assist in the creation of Belarusian cultural centers  in foreign countries; I will develop relations with Belarusian  immigrants.    I will oppose allowing low-quality culture into Belarus, as  well as the disruption of scientific, cultural, and  informational spheres.    I will ensure state financial support for culture, science,  and education.  <H5>  Belarus Is Open to Mutually Beneficial Cooperation </H5>   Our foreign policy will be based on the principles and norms  of international law, on the rejection of the use of force or  the threat to use force.    The strengthening of our statehood and sovereignty as well  as  the use of our geopolitical location is a necessary basis [as  published] for joining the system of new international relations  by Belarus.    I will pay special attention to the strengthening of a  mutually beneficial political and economic union with Russia and  Ukraine -- a reliable core of the CIS -- and to the development  of friendly and equal relations with all states.    Essential steps will be taken by Belarus toward integration  with the European and the global system of political, economic,  and trade relations.    The proposed program will be implemented in two basic  stages.    The first stage, 1994-95, will focus on stabilizing the  economy, overcoming crises, and implementing a strong social  policy in the interests of the people. The second stage,  1996-97, will focus on an intensive structural transformation of  the economy and state system, an equal global partnership, and a  significant increase in the peoples' prosperity.    Dear compatriots!    Everyone of us faces an important decision on the day of the  presidential elections. Your future and the future of your  children depends on who you will elect the president.    I have served my nation honestly and conscientiously during  all my life. In the course of preparing these programs and  meeting with people, I had to reconsider and reevaluate many  issues. How to lead Belarus out of the crisis? How to make  people's lives secure and happy? The solutions to these  problems are proposed to a considerable extent in my program.    I think that I will express the opinion of the majority of  my  fellow citizens by stating that we need a strong executive  power, discipline, and responsibility to overcome today's  crisis. I fully realize that all the responsibility for  implementing this program should be shouldered by the president.    My experience as well as the powers vested in the presidency  by the Constitution strengthen my certitude that this program  will be fulfilled.    I declare my intent to seek your confidence through  constitutional means during the election of the president of the  Republic of Belarus.    On 23 June, you will make your choice prompted by your  wisdom, mind, and heart.</p>

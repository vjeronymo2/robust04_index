			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee futures surge past Dollars 1,600 mark Coffee prices surged 5 per cent to fresh five-year highs on the London Commodity Exchange yesterday, surprising even bullish traders by the speed of the rise. The continued tightness of physical supplies, coupled with a shortage of stocks, pushed the July second position for robusta futures to a peak of Dollars 1,655 a tonne. A buoyant opening in New York helped London maintain most of its gains, with the July contract closing Dollars 80 up from Friday's close at Dollars 1,643. In early afternoon trading in New York, the second position arabica contract was 3.80 cents higher at 93.65 cents a pound. Yesterday's surge through Dollars 1,600 in London came less than two weeks after the July contract broke the Dollars 1,500 barrier and put it 37 per cent up on the year so far. The market is at its highest level since mid-1989. Growing interest in soft commodities among investment funds looking for diversification is helping to fuel a market driven by a lack of readily available robusta from west Africa and Indonesia and falling consumer stocks, said one trader. 'It's a little bit of everything,' he said. 'But even so the severity and speed of the move, particularly today, is surprising.' Buying came from the trade as well as chartists and funds. 'There were just no sellers around from the beginning.' The continued squeeze on short positions was reflected in the nearby May contract's Dollars 57 premium over July. But Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at GNI, the London brokers, pointed out that July was at a growing premium to September, 'which means people think this tightness could last through till then.' The fact that the world price for robusta has now reached the level where export stocks can been released appears to be having little effect. The Association of Coffee Producing Countries is not due to discuss the release of stocks until a meeting on May 23. The LCE yesterday reported a 41 per cent rise in volume in April compared with March, with 333,874 contracts traded. That reflected more active physical markets and growing investment fund interest, it said.</p>

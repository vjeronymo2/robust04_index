			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Normandy Without Kohl"] </F>   [Text] Helmut Kohl will not be among those present at Omaha  Beach on 6 June, much to his great displeasure. The  chancellor's participation in the celebrations of the 50th  anniversary of the Normandy landings, together with Francois  Mitterrand, Bill Clinton, and the Queen of England, would have  been the pinnacle of his career as a statesman and, moreover,  would have been of considerable help in a decisive electoral  year.    We remember the emotion of 22 September 1984 when the French  president and the German chancellor paid their respects  hand-in-hand before the Verdun war memorial. This symbolic  gesture was a prelude to the strengthening of Franco-German  cooperation and a boost for European unity that culminated in  the Maastricht Treaty. Ten years later, in a world turned  upside down, a unified and sovereign Germany was shocked to find  itself excluded from the ceremonies of 6 June and has voiced its  displeasure, if we are to believe the daily newspaper  FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU, by asking its diplomats to withdraw from  any ceremony related with the event.    The affair is obviously a delicate one. What is being  celebrated on Omaha Beach is the fraternity of the allied armies  which managed, at an immense cost in human lives, to begin to  win back the land held by the Nazis. It is not, as was the case  at Verdun, a shared homage to the war dead. Neither is this  celebration a private affair between the French and the Germans.  It is not certain whether the British would have appreciated  seeing yesterday's enemy treated on the same level as the  allies. Therein lies the whole ambiguity of the celebration of  the battles -- it is unlikely that next year Francois Mitterrand  and the Queen of England will celebrate the 180th anniversary of  the Battle of Waterloo. If we had wanted to stress the  reconciliation of yesterday's enemies, the Normandy ceremonies  ought to have been a purely military affair, a reunion of  comrades in arms who had lived through a terrible event  together. The capitulation of Nazi Germany and the great  political show of remembrance should have been left to the  following year. Perhaps there has been an error of "mistaken  scenario" for which the French president should take the blame.    The task of the French leadership would perhaps have been  made easier if, on several occasions, Chancellor Kohl had given  less cause for criticism: From the visit of Ronald Reagan to  the Bitburg cemetery in 1985 to last year's inauguration in  Berlin of a plaque dedicated to the memory of "all the victims"  of World War II, he has showed that he sometimes confuses -- for  reasons of domestic politics -- reconciliation and the assigning  of responsibility.</p>

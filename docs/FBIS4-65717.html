			<p>BFN     [Text] The tanaiste [Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring]  said this morning the British reply to Sinn Fein's demands for  clarification of the Downing Street declaration ought to remove  the last barrier to ending the violence. He told a conference  in Tralee that the British Government had once again repeated  what most already knew -- that the future of the Irish people  was in the hands of the Irish people. Mr. Spring said it would  be a future won by negotiation, agreement, and consent. It  would not rely on coercion and terror. He said everything would  be on the table.    The tanaiste described the violence of the past 25 years as  cruel and unjust. He said it had robbed the country of a  significant part of its potential. He said peace would be the  foundation for a dramatic surge in opportunities for investment  and in development support from the European Union.</p>

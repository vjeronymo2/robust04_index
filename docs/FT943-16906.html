			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Trump project boosts New York The struggling economy of New York City was yesterday given a significant boost when Mr Donald Trump, the property developer and casino operator, announced the go-ahead for a Dollars 2bn project on Manhattan's largest undeveloped site. The Riverside South project, comprising 5,700 apartments, 1.8m sq ft of office space, 350,000 sq ft of retail space and parking for 3,500 cars, will be built on the 75-acre site of the old Penn Central rail yards on Manhattan's west side, between 59th and 72nd streets. Mr Trump acquired the site in 1984 but spent years arguing with community groups about his development plans. By the time he won approval for the plans in 1992, his property and casino empire was on the brink of bankruptcy and he no longer had the money to proceed. Yesterday the money became available, when Mr Trump signed a joint venture agreement with a consortium of Asian investors led by two of Hong Kong's biggest property developers, the New World Development Company and the Shui On Group. The consortium has undertaken to fund the development of the site over the next six to 10 years in return for a share of the profits. Mr Henry Cheng, managing director of New World Development, said Mr Trump's company, The Trump Organisation, was a good strategic partner because members of the consortium were interested in diversifying their holdings. 'We intend to jointly become a major player in New York's recovering real estate market,' he said. Mr Trump paid tribute to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City for helping the east Asian investors 'feel comfortable' with development issues in New York. Mr Giuliani said the project would create thousands of construction jobs, thousands of permanent jobs, and bring hundreds of millions of dollars in sales and tax revenues to the city. The Trump Organisation said the development would also help keep the middle class and the affluent in Manhattan by offering new, high quality accommodation. Construction work was expected to begin shortly.</p>

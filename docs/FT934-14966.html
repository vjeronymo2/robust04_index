			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Sixties buccaneer deals in high-tech piracy IN HIS DAYS as a Radio Caroline pirate broadcaster Mr Chris Cary was known as Spangles Muldoon. Now he drives a blue Rolls-Royce, number plate THE 60S, and runs a multi-million-pound business from an industrial unit in Camberley, Surrey - although he describes himself as a consultant. Mr Cary, who is also chairman of Buzz FM, the Birmingham commercial radio station, has come a long way from his pirate radio days but he still has the air of the buccaneer. The Camberley company's main line of business is the manufacture and sale of unauthorised decoders and decoder cards for a large number of continental European subscription television channels. If you want to watch the scrambled pictures of Scandinavian channels such as TV 1000 or the three channels of TV3 complete with pornography or films channels such as FilmNet (broadcast in English) or Filmmax, Mr Cary is your man. In the past seven years Mr Cary says he has turned over Pounds 30m and made more than 230,000 unauthorised decoder boxes. 'It was like selling sweets,' Mr Cary says. However, he would like to change direction and is offering to sell his piracy system to those behind EuroCrypt - the system that he is breaking. He said: 'I want EuroCrypt to buy me out. It would be worthwhile provided no one else has pirated it from me. If they were to buy it for Pounds 5m they would be buying something worth Pounds 25m. 'Our system is fantastic and needs to be nipped in the bud.' Yesterday the Financial Times called Hi-Tech Innovative Electronics, a company run from Mr Cary's Camberley premises, and asked for a card to unscramble the main European channels. A woman said the combined card, which would unscramble TV3, TV 1000, FilmNet and Filmmax, would cost Pounds 200. 'It's good. And we guarantee the card for a year,' she said, adding that the company took all leading credit cards. The 'guarantees' are needed because the satellite broadcasters are always trying to disable pirate cards. A consultant for a large accountancy firm, who asked not to be named, said that when he came back from holiday he found that counter-measures had been taken and his Hi-Tech card no longer worked. 'I put the old card in the post last Wednesday and the new combined one arrived last Friday,' he said. Mr Cary said that originally it had taken him a week to crack FilmNet and another week to crack the Sky Television scrambling system VideoCrypt. Sky had changed its system twice but pirate operators had produced a substitute card within days. The integrity of scrambling systems for satellite channels is vital not just for the channel's finances but also for access to film rights. The US studios sell film rights on a country-by-country basis and would be reluctant to provide films, say for UK film channels, if they were going to be pirated all over Europe. Mr Cary said that widespread piracy of the VideoCrypt card used by Sky (in which Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, has a significant stake) represented a Pounds 100m problem for the company. 'I'm horrified for them. It's the biggest problem they are ever going to have. It's their moneybox,' said Mr Cary, who believes that Sky may have to change the processor in its system and start all over again. Last week the FT bought an unauthorised card for all the Sky subscription channels from Satellite Decoding Systems, a company in Warrington, Cheshire, run by Mr David Lyons. Sky Television has already issued a writ against the company. Mr Cary, who claims to have acted as a consultant on piracy to 'a lot of big companies', said he would like to turn gamekeeper and sell his expertise to companies such as FilmNet, which he sees as a limited business in the UK, and advise on anti-piracy measures. 'We don't want to be pirates,' he said. He plans to change the name of the company to Key TV to get away from the past.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 19 (XINHUA) -- Russian deputy  foreign minister and presidential envoy on Bosnia, Vitaliy  Churkin, said today that any NATO air strike on Bosnian Serbs  would lead to a real crisis in relations between Russia and the  West.    In an interview with the Ostankino State Radio and  Television  Broadcasting Company, he said he had never accepted the NATO  ultimatum on Bosnian Serbs as a way to solve the Bosnian crisis.    "What is this ultimatum? We are not a member of the NATO,"  Churkin said, adding that it is the action of the U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Sarajevo and the resolutions of  the U.N. Security Council, not NATO, that count.    He said Russia and NATO are just beginning to learn how to  establish "partnership for peace" and if NATO takes what he  called "frivolous and absurd" action, a crisis could result in  the Russo-NATO relations.    He also was confident that the crisis in Sarajevo would end  with all sides accepting a Russian proposal, which calls for the  withdrawal of heavy weaponry by both the Serb and Muslim sides  and the dispatch of Russian peace keeping soldiers, now serving  in the UNPROFOR in Croatia, to Sarajevo to guarantee peace.</p>

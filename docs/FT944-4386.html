			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Prudential plans changes to meet policy sales rules Prudential Corporation yesterday became the latest life insurer to respond to new rules on giving more information to customers buying policies, by promising to introduce changes next year. The new requirements on those selling investment, pension and life policies to inform customers about the policies and costs of selling, are causing significant changes in products, payment methods for sales agents and advisers, and brochures across the retail financial services sector. Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, has already made several changes to its product range and the costs of selling, but is planning more changes, including discontinuing a handful of unpopular policies. In particular, the balance of commission paid to the direct sales force for pension policies is expected to shift towards renewal payments and away from the heavy emphasis on initial commission. The commission structure for savings products was similarly changed when the Prudence savings account was launched in the summer. Regular premium pensions policies sold by independent financial advisers already give them the option of spreading commission over the lifetime of the policy rather than from early premiums. In both cases, Prudential is bearing more of the cost of the initial commission than occurs with many traditional products. This means that the values available if a policy lapses early should be higher than they would otherwise be. The moves are also intended to give sales agents and advisers more incentive to ensure policies do not lapse. Mr Jim Sutcliffe, managing director of Prudential's home service division, said the group's worst lapse rates, where 25 to 30 per cent of policies were surrendered in the first couple of years, were in pensions policies sold to young people. However, other pensions policies had the lowest lapse rates of just 2 per cent in the first two years. Mr Keith Bedell-Pearce, chief executive of Prudential financial services, said the cost of meeting the compulsory elements of the new disclosure regime came to about Pounds 3m each for the direct-sales operation and the services for independent financial advisers.</p>

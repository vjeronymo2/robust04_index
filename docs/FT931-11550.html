			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Far right in Austria fails with petition AUSTRIA'S right-wing Freedom Party (FPO) and its charismatic leader, Mr Jorg Haider, suffered a stinging setback yesterday, when a mass petition directed against foreigners only drew the signatures of 415,00 people, half the number he had sought. Only 7 per cent of voters put their signatures to the petition, which calls for stricter immigration laws and a constitutional amendment stating: 'Austria is not an immigration country'. Mr Haider had hoped for backing from more than 1m people. Even though the petition is non-binding, a higher turnout would have put the coalition government on the defensive. Because more than 100,000 signed the petition during the eight-day registration period, the Austrian parliament is now required to debate its contents, although it can then safely ignore it. But as he is riding on a wave of economic and social discontent, Mr Haider is expected to score further successes in regional elections later this year. The Freedom Party leader blamed what he called unfair local authority restrictions for the disappointing results. But mobilisation of a broad coalition against the petition had deterred voters from signing. Last weekend 200,000 people demonstrated in Vienna against racism.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 23 February broadcasts its regular  10-minute "Details" program, introduced by Sergey Dorenko, which  deals with the case of scientist Vil Mirzayanov who is accused  of divulging state secrets connected with the development of new  chemical weapons.    Vil Mirzayanov, who was detained on 27 January, was released  yesterday on condition that he would not leave Moscow while his  case was being reexamined. He is shown at home with his wife  and two children. He says the conditions in the prison were  unbearable and told a story when a fellow prisoner was severely  beaten up by a warden.    In the past Mirzayanov headed a technical  counterintelligence  department at a Scientific Research Institute in Moscow.    Mirzayanov cannot explain why his colleagues in the West  keep  silent. He expresses the hope that scientists working on  similar weapons for NATO will rebel against the system. He  says: "Although my colleagues told me that there was a  breakthrough in the field of developing new types of chemical  weapons in the United States too, but, you see, this is nothing  more than a guess. Of course, most likely, scientific research,  whether we receive information about it or not, usually goes in  parallel. I will not rule out that the United States has also  developed similar substances."    According to Sergey Dorenko, Lev Fedorov, Mirzayanov's  colleague and doctor of chemical sciences, says that Russia has  already developed a chemical agent formula that was not included  in the conventions prohibiting tests of chemical weapons and  therefore, was not subject to elimination. No international  organization can check whether that was true. In Fedorov's  words, even Yeltsin "will never be able to check the fact that  there are binary chemical weapons that are ready for use in  combat operations."</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESONANCE IN THE BALTIC  </P> <P> In moves so harmonic they seemed orchestrated, the Soviet government admitted  Thursday that the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were  illegally stripped of their sovereignty in 1939, and the Soviet Parliament  decided to give some of it back. These developments promise a brighter future  for these republics, the Soviet Union as a whole and for U.S.-Soviet relations.  </P> <P> In 1939, dictators Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler made an agreement that  essentially gave a green light to the Soviet Union's forced annexation of the  independent countries the following year. The Soviets have consistently denied  the very existence of the protocols, insisting that "progressive forces" within  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania asked that their republics be incorporated into  the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This falsification of history has  vexed Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians ever since. Fifty years later, the  record has finally been set straight.  </P> <P> But this was a historical vexation, not a contemporary one, so it is entirely  fitting that the Soviet Parliament responded to a current grievance at the same  time, giving preliminary approval to Estonian and Lithuanian economic autonomy.  The Baltic republics, by far the most prosperous of the Soviet Union's regions,  have long felt that their economic know-how was being exploited by  less-prosperous regions. They have been forced to conform to economic dictates  from Moscow, often at the expense of their local interests. The proposals for  economic autonomy, which still need to be worked out in detail, will both  harness the full economic potential of the the region and grant the republics a  measure of control over their own affairs that is historically justified and  long overdue.  </P> <P> Economic autonomy for the republics will benefit the Soviet Union as a whole.  Leonid I. Abalkin, a Soviet deputy prime minister, told the Supreme Soviet  Thursday that autonomy should be introduced in the Baltic republics as an  initial step toward achieving an entirely new, decentralized system of economic  management for the entire country, a system that should be far more efficient  and responsive than the Moscow-dictated production quotas currently in place.  Finally, the moves are beneficial to the United States, soothing old  irritations in U.S.-Soviet relations.  </P> <P> Once again, in a pattern that would be monotonous if it were not exhilarating,  Gorbachev has taken a revolutionary step in his campaign of liberalization, one  that was inconceivable just a few months ago. Rarely do historical wrongs and  contemporary rights converge with such resonance.  </P></p>

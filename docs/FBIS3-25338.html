			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from correspondent in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] This morning, the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] presented its position on the  general principles of national reconciliation. In the  afternoon, the government delegation went to the Mulungushi  Conference Center to counter the superfluous contents of the  document presented by the Black Cockerel negotiators. The  mediators say only two issues are delaying the conclusion of the  first chapter of the fourth point of the Lusaka negotiating  round. It is expected that tomorrow the mediators and troika of  observers will deliver the new version of the master document to  the delegations for a study, before a second meeting by the  sides is held.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News Analysis by Wang Nan: "U.S. Commercial Interests in </F> China: The Lure and The Drag"]    [Text] Washington, March 30 (XINHUA) -- From wheat to oil,  from aircraft to software, from jeans at fashion stores to  transformers at Toys `R' Us, the whole truth of U.S. commercial  interests in China is coming out.    The pros and cons of doing business in the world's most  populous country and the fastest-growing economy were again at  Washington's spotlight as the debates over China's trade status  heated up.    With the commerce department keeping secret on the  classified  document - "U.S. commercial interests in China to the year  2000", outside the beltway, traders could barely wait to ride  the oriental express.    "China is now defined by great expectations," "Beyond MFN",  a  new book on China's most favored nation status, noted in its  preface. "the (U.S.-China) relationship is of rapidly increasing  importance to Americans."    Then, where are the real commercial interests of the U.S. in  China, which, according to some projections, will be the world's  largest economy in 20 years and which, among other handicaps,  lack modern infrastructure?    Over the years, U.S. exports to China, according to official  sources here, have been led by aeronautic equipment, power  generating machinery, fertilizer, electric machinery, medical  equipment, grain and chemicals.    Among the U.S. imports from China were, in line with imports  value, apparel, toys and games, electronics, footwear, leather  goods, power generating machinery and plastics.    "In the future, Mainland China will certainly be the center  of a web of investment and trade relations because of its vast  population and market potential," said Claude Barfield, director  of trade studies at the American Enterprise Institute, at a  symposium today.    The area of China, China's Taiwan and Hong Kong is the  America's fourth largest export market and third largest  supplier. "The overwhelming amount of U.S. sales is in  manufactured goods," Jeff Garten, undersecretary of commerce,  said in a recent speech in Tokyo.    Over the past five years, U.S. imports from China have been  increasing at a rate of five times faster than exports. While  U.S. exports to Japan have remained unchanged since 1990, its  exports to China have risen by 55 percent.    According to the U.S.-China Business Council, China plans to  spend over 200 billion U.S. dollars on imports from 1993 to  1995. Many of these imports are in the areas in which U.S.  industries are particularly strong.    Among other things, China's import markets in the next two  years of power-generating equipment, aerospace, computers and  telecommunications will be respectively 100 billion, 40 billion,  40 billion and 30 billion dollars.    Apparently, there are worries.    While every other western country has rearranged programs to  actively promote exports to and investment in China, "the U.S.  Government has not," wrote Jerome Cohen, a China expert at New  York University School of Law.    Actually, U.S. private direct investment in China, as  percentages of the total amount of such investment in the  people's republic, has dropped from 4.6 percent in 1991 to 2.8  percent in 1992.    "As the greatest industrial power in the world and the  destination of fully one-third of China's exports, the U.S. has  received only a paltry share of the huge China market, a cause  for some concern," he stressed.    The book "Beyond MFN-Trade With China and American  Interests", meanwhile, noted that in China and Asia, there had  been "diminishing dependence" on the U.S. as the major purchaser  of their products.    What's worse, the U.S. consumers, buying some 30 billion  dollars of goods from China and Hong Kong last year, have to pay  seven to 10 billion dollars more if China's MFN status was  revoked by the white house.    Jobs and profits in the U.S. companies doing business with  China, observers here noted, will be jeopardized.    Noting that U.S. businesses are at "a significant  disadvantage" in competing for China's favor, Jerome Cohen  stressed that "one should not underestimate the importance of  favorable U.S. policies for promoting U.S. business interests."    Said a senior Chinese official last spring, "if (the U.S.)  come into the Chinese market too late, it will be occupied by  others. It is a big cake. Come early and you get a big piece."</p>

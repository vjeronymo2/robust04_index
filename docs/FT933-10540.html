			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The ERM: EC economies, the opportunities and risks - The Netherlands The continued link to the DM in the old 2.5 per cent band is seen as vindicating 'strong guilder' policies of the past decade, writes Ronald van de Krol. The Netherlands expects low inflation by maintaining the link, although it will probably try to lower interest rates independently of the Bundesbank. This may be small consolation, however, to Dutch companies which could lose exports because of the effective devaluation of other EC currencies. However, 30 per cent of Dutch exports go to Germany. Short term, Dutch exporters will be at a disadvantage, raising the prospect of an acceleration in unemployment. Many companies must now choose between accepting a loss in market share or trimming profit margins to retain business overseas, says the industry federation. Exporters to Germany will face heightened competition in that market from companies in weaker currency countries. They will also encounter difficulties in other EC markets, which together account for half of all exports. Sectors bracing for the new challenge include livestock and meat, traditionally dependent on Italy and Belgium. One benefit, though not easily quantifiable, is continued investor confidence in the guilder, a legacy of more than 10 years' commitment to pegging the currency to the DM.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "E.W.": "Government, Trade Unionists, and </F> Employers, on Privatization Law; Commission Is Critical of  Government and of Itself"]    [Text] A two-day meeting of a Trilateral Commission  for Socioeconomic Affairs began at the Labor Ministry on Monday  [16 May]. Throughout Monday and Tuesday, representatives of the  government, employers, and trade unions [TU's] will jointly  debate behind closed doors the strike demands put forward by  Solidarity, and they will discuss the government's proposals  regarding changes in the law on state-owned enterprises. They  will also be speculating as to a justification for raising  prices on energy carriers and how to improve the situation of  budget-sector employees.    The law on privatization of state-owned enterprises is the  sixth and final part of a batch of laws comprising the Agreement  on State-Owned Enterprises. The Ministry of Ownership  Transformations has suggested several changes to the document  that had been agreed upon with the previous government. Among  the proposals approved by the Council of Ministers' Economic  Committee, the following are included:    --A change in the principles of distribution of preferential  employee shares of an enterprise being privatized, from 10 to 15  percent of the total number of shares.    --The adoption of a principle that the initiative regarding  transformation of an enterprise into a Treasury-owned  joint-stock company is up to the organs of the enterprise in  question.    --A promise to come up with a "privatization map," which  means defining economic areas and the methods through which the  state will control those areas.    The government intends to give up on a legal provision that  speaks of emission of privatization coupons, and it is being  planned that it is the chief of the Ownership Transformations  Ministry who will decide on the particular privatization path an  enterprise will follow. Still, enterprises would have a month  in which to submit their vetoes of the privatization paths  suggested for them, and the government's assurances are that the  veto will prove efficient in practice.    Representatives of the Solidarity trade union were critical  of the changes in the governmental draft privatization law. The  trade union wants the government to present its justification  for withdrawing from the draft law a legal provision concerning  the possibility of issuing privatization coupons. As NOWA  EUROPA was told by Longin Komolowski, trade union  representatives find unsatisfactory the proposal to raise the  percentage of employee shares in a company being privatized from  10 to 15 percent.    The All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] has suggested  that details of the law be debated during the commission's  sessions, instead of within a specific topic-oriented group, as  provided for in the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises.  Solidarity fears that a substantive discussion of the law will  be transformed within the Trilateral Commission into an  ideological debate concerning the vision of privatization. "The  privatization law should be discussed by those trade unions that  have signed the Agreement," Piotr Zak, press spokesman for  Solidarity, told NOWA EUROPA. But OPZZ Deputy Chairman Maciej  Manicki voiced the reservation that, if the debate takes place  at three tables--for employers, for trade unions, and for  Solidarity--the OPZZ will withdraw from the negotiations.</p>

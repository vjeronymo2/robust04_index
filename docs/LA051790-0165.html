			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: IS GASLAMP RIGHT SPOT FOR CONDO TOWER?  </P> <P> Developer Neil Senturia, a former television sitcom writer, is about to spring  some high drama on the city of San Diego.  </P> <P> Senturia wants the city to approve a 325-foot-high building in the historic  Gaslamp Quarter downtown, an area zoned for a maximum of 125 feet high.  </P> <P> Several key people within the city's urban planning system are opposed to the  project's height, including City Architect Mike Stepner; Max Schmidt, Centre  City Development Corp.'s urban planning expert, and Pam Hamilton, CCDC's  executive vice president.  </P> <P> During the coming months, Senturia will try to persuade the City Council to go  against the advice of its top planners, arguing that the design fits in with  nearby high-rises. Going against aides' advice would not be unprecedented. Last  year, the council approved a 38-story luxury condominium project on lower  Broadway, despite Stepner's reservations about its height and bulk.  </P> <P> Some council members said they won't make a decision until they get a good look  at Senturia's project, probably this summer, after an environmental impact  report is completed.  </P> <P> The site Senturia has optioned (he doesn't own it yet) for the project, Park  Plaza, is bounded by 5th Avenue, K Street, 3rd Avenue and Harbor Drive, at the  southern entrance to the Gaslamp Quarter across from the San Diego Convention  Center.  </P> <P> The $75-million complex would include 25,000 square feet of retail space and  150  </P> <P> condominiums. The building would have a six-story base and a 27-story tower,  set close to K Street and 100 feet back from 5th Avenue.  </P> <P> Senturia, a short, wiry, articulate, gregarious man and a preference for crisp  dress shirts and well-polished shoes, has been working as a developer in San  Diego since 1985. Some of his projects include the Union Bank building at 5th  and University avenues in Hillcrest, One Harbor Drive (a pair of 41-story  downtown luxury condo towers scheduled to break ground June 15), a single-room  occupancy hotel at 4th Avenue and Fir Street and a large parking structure  being built on 6th Avenue, between A and Ash streets downtown.  </P> <P> Senturia laid out his argument for Park Plaza last Friday in his offices in a  downtown high-rise, where he enjoys sweeping views of the city.  </P> <P> The project has already gone through many design revisions. Senturia initially  worked with Arquitectonica, the hip, slick, Miami firm, but its design  apparently didn't please either Senturia or city officials.  </P> <P> "It was some of the poorest site planning and design I'd seen," said City  Councilman Ron Roberts, the lone council member trained as an architect. "There  were four buildings, with two on Harbor Drive, and none of the architecture or  site planning related to anything around it."  </P> <P> Senturia now agrees that the scheme wasn't right for the location.  </P> <P> Senturia's argument in favor of his 325-foot tower is that, because several  larger high-rises are about to be built  </P> <P> nearby along Harbor Drive (including his own One Harbor Drive), and because the  Park Plaza site actually stretches beyond 4th Avenue (outside the western  boundary of the historic district), his tower is really as much a part of  intense adjacent redevelopment as it is a part of the low-scale historic  district.  </P> <P> That doesn't placate people like Howard Greenberg, a Gaslamp Quarter Planning  Board member who is converting the low-rise Pioneer Warehouse to apartments,  across K Street from Senturia's site.  </P> <P> "I fought long and hard for the increase to 125 feet, and I thought that was  pushing the envelope," Greenberg said, referring to the area's initial height  limit of 75 feet. "For someone to come in over 300, I think, is pushing the  envelope too far."  </P> <P> Architect Ralph Roesling, who sits on the Gaslamp board, prepared a computer  model of the Gaslamp Quarter, including Senturia's project, to study building  heights and bulk. Roesling also helped write the plan that convinced the city  to increase the height limit to 125 feet from 75 feet in select cases.  </P> <P> "I think it's too high," Roesling said of Park Plaza. "That project is  definitely within the Gaslamp Quarter district, and they're asking for 325  feet. That would be so out of scale with everything else, I think it would be  wrong." According to Roesling, the tower would cast large shadows across 5th  Avenue in the afternoon, besides towering over surrounding buildings.  </P> <P> High-rise units generally bring premium prices, and Senturia said a lower  building would be "less economically feasible."  </P> <P> Over the past decade, several Gaslamp Quarter businesses have struggled or died  during delays in the building of the Horton Plaza shopping center and the San  Diego Convention Center. However, even after those projects opened, many  businesses continued to stagger, and members of the Gaslamp Quarter Council  (now Gaslamp Quarter Planning Board) began thinking that a few large new  projects, probably hotels, would help turn business in the right direction.  </P> <P> When the city of San Diego wrote a plan to limit new buildings to 60 feet (75  in some cases), the Gaslamp Quarter Council commissioned its own height study.  The conclusion: buildings up to 125 feet should be considered for four large  parcels, including Senturia's.  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council passed a Gaslamp planning ordinance solidifying this  policy late last year, with Senturia's project excluded.  </P> <P> Judged without consideration for height, the present design is a sound piece of  architecture, though not the masterpiece that Senturia claims could spawn a  whole new phase of downtown architecture.  </P> <P> In fact, the six-story portion of the project, along 5th and K, looks very  good, with Senturia promising to use high-grade stone such as granite, brick  and ceramic tile on the base, and reinforced concrete panels for the tower.  </P> <P> Low-rise facades along K and 5th are well articulated, and these buildings  would be punctuated by bay windows echoing the bay windows found on many other  Gaslamp buildings.  </P> <P> Senturia rightly described the site as the gateway to the Gaslamp Quarter, an  important "transition" block. The corner of the project closest to Harbor Drive  would be anchored with a low, open pavilion. Broad stairs would lead from 5th  Avenue to second-level terraces.  </P> <P> The design of the project's back portion is crucial because it would face the  pedestrian-oriented "linear park" designed for the city under the direction of  San Francisco landscape architects Peter Walker and Martha Schwartz, with the  local Austin Hansen Group and several artists.  </P> <P> Park Plaza's two tiers of restaurants would step down to meet the park, and  Senturia is offering to donate part of the land for park use at one corner of  his site.  </P> <P> The tower steps back and would be crowned with Mission tile. It would feature a  circular sundial emblem created by local artists. The proportions are good, but  the tile seems too cute a way to incorporate local Spanish influences.  </P> <P> There is also some question as to whether the existing buildings on Senturia's  site should be destroyed. None is great architecture, but one was designed by  early 20th-Century architect William Hebbard, who gave architect Irving Gill  his start here.  </P> <P> Historic Site Board chairwoman Kathryn Willetts said there's a valid argument  that the buildings should remain, if only to retain the scale and character of  the district.  </P> <P> Senturia's project isn't yet scheduled for hearings at the CCDC, Historic Site  Board or City Council. Tuesday, he made the latest of several presentations to  the Gaslamp board.  </P> <P> The most logical response to his 325-foot fantasy seems to be the one offered  by Stepner and echoed by many others:  </P> <P> "I think it's a very handsome building that deserves to be built somewhere, but  my question is, is it in the right location?"  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Here are the details of the agreement achieved by  Israel and the PLO. Israel has consented to the Palestinian  administration's issuing its own laissez-passers [travel  document] featuring the term passport. The Palestinians will be  able to print stamps under the heading -- Palestinian Authority.  The autonomy will have its own international telephone area  code. Israel has agreed to a temporary international presence  in Gaza and Jericho composed of representatives of countries  donating to the autonomy.    Possibilities of expanding the Palestinian powers on the  Gaza  coast and the al-Mawasi strip abutting on the Qatif Bloc will be  explored. No agreement has been achieved on the Palestinian  territorial waters. Israel refused to permit the appointment of  a Palestinian overseer at the Rafah terminal.    Our correspondent adds that 'Arafat has pledged to propose  annulling the Palestinian Covenant at the next Palestine  National Council session. 'Arafat has further pledged to enter  the territories as PLO chairman and not to claim any other  title. He has not reiterated his demand to pray in Jerusalem.  'Arafat has again promised to make an effort to forward to  Israel additional information about its POW's and MIA's.    Tonight the parties will probably conclude the issues of  prisoner release and pardon for fugitives. The committee  planning the 4 May ceremony has already launched preparations.    [A related report on Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television  Network in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 28 April adds that "Israeli  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will begin on 5 May, the day  after the agreement is signed in Cairo."]</p>

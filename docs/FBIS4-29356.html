			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The ruling and opposition  parties intensified their confrontation over the House of  Representatives Budget Committee's decision Thursday [16 June]  to summon former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa over his  financial dealings.    The opposition parties forced a motion through the lower  house budget panel to summon Hosokawa on June 21 to testify  under oath about his questionable personal finances. The ruling  parties committee members shouted "opposition," but they failed  to override Budget Committee chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi's  declaration that his panel summon the former premier. The  opposition demanded that Hosokawa be summoned as his former  secretary Masatoshi Miyama's testimony Wednesday was not enough  to clarify his allegedly dubious money transactions.    In April Hosokawa gave up the premiership of the first  coalition government in almost four decades when the opposition  delayed Diet debate on the fiscal 1994 state budget, demanding  clarification of his financial affairs.    The ruling parties, upset by the committee's decision to  summon Hosokawa, appealed to lower house speaker Takako Doi to  brand the decision a result of "improper" procedures and nullify  it. The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which  was forced out of power last August by Hosokawa's coalition  government, is now assessing the timing of submitting a  no-confidence motion against the minority government led by  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, political sources said. Hata, when  asked about the decision to summon his predecessor, declined to  comment, only saying "it is painful."    The Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic  Party of Japan], the No. 2 opposition party which in April left  the coalition, also aims at taking advantage of Hosokawa's  plight to bring down the Hata cabinet. The opposition said that  what Miyama told the panel Wednesday was not consistent with  Hosokawa's earlier explanation about a 100 million yen loan from  the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm in 1982.    Hosokawa insists he repaid the money by 1991 and that he had  not known the interest arising from the loan was used as a  political donation until two days before he announced his  resignation in April. But Miyama told the panel he has informed  Hosokawa's office that he handled the interest as a political  donation at the end of 1993.    The opposition suspect Hosokawa might have used the entire  100 million yen as illegal political donations. Several months  after he received the money, in February 1983, Hosokawa ran  successfully for election as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture,  southwestern Japan.    Hosokawa is also suspected of having been directly involved  in purchasing several profitable stocks of Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone (NTT) Corp. in 1986. Although Hosokawa denies direct  involvement in the deal, Miyama testified that the former  premier has instructed him to help Hosokawa's father-in-law buy  some NTT shares. Former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu reportedly  told former Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, who heads the LDP's  intraparty Political Reform Group, that he would support the  submission if Hosokawa's summoning could be settled in a way  easily understood by the public.</p>

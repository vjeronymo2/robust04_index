			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (18): Widespread complaints / Review of the agricultural sector THE FARMER'S gesture as he drew his hand up to his nose left little to the imagination. The water, he was saying, had risen to the drowning point. He was one of a thousand who marched through central Warsaw just before the fall of the government last month to demand more state aid for farming. The farmer and his neighbours from Krzywda in Siedlce province, east of Warsaw, were despondent. 'Nothing has changed for the better in the three years since the end of non-communist rule - and none of our neighbours have profited either.' Their holdings were not small by Polish standards. Several farmers had more than 10 hectares of land each, as do some 20 per cent of the country's 2.1m private farmers. But their frustration at not having the funds to develop was greater than the smallholders' who, as Mr Alexander Luczak of the PSL farmers' party says, have simply turned back to subsistence farming. The complaints which brought the farmers to Warsaw were simple; food prices were too low; farming equipment and materials costs were too high; and the price of credit was prohibitive. They reiterated a common fear; that subsidised food from the European Community would bang the final nail into their coffin. Such feelings are widespread in the countryside where more than 30 per cent of the Polish population still lives and works. Their complaints have posed a bigger political problem for successive Polish governments. But all have resisted repeated demands for farm subsidies and sought to keep trade barriers as low as possible since the collapse of the communist regime in 1989. The statistics paint a slightly more optimistic picture. Poland enjoyed a modest Dollars 193m surplus in its food trade last year with the EC, which accounted for 8 per cent of the country's total 1992 foreign trade turnover. However, such figures did nothing to restrain farmers' anger at the recent ban on Polish exports of baby calves to the EC. The government rejected a demand by Brussels that the calves be subjected to a 14-day quarantine before shipment, a demand which strengthened fears that farming is being subjected to unfair competition. Brussels cited outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in the former Soviet bloc countries as justification. But the Poles replied that the last incident of foot and mouth in Poland was in the early 1970s. Farm incomes as a whole have fallen by a half since 1988, although last year saw relief for some as farm gate prices rose by 62 per cent compared with a 37 per cent rise in the cost of farming inputs and a 43 per cent increase in consumer prices. But this apparent improvement was largely the result of a natural calamity. Grain prices rose sharply as drought hit last year's harvest, which fell by 25 per cent to 20m tonnes - from 28m tonnes in 1991. Overall, farming incomes still dropped by 4 per cent on the previous year. This year, the third consecutive year of lower fertiliser useage which reflects the farmers straightened circumstances, the grain crop is expected to reach about 22m tonnes. But it is the declining animal population, both pig and cattle, which tells the fuller story. Meat production is dropping in response to depressed demand as working families who queued for hours for cheap, heavily subsidised meat during the communist period have adjusted to buying less of the now abundant, but expensive unsubsidised meat on offer at the largely privatised shops. Per capita meat consumption is set to drop further this year from 70 kg in 1992, below the 1980 level when meat shortages provided the backdrop to the workers' strikes which presaged the downfall of communism a decade later. The greatest challenge facing Polish farmers is how to face up to the structural problems left over from 40 years of communism whose post-war leaders tried and failed to collectivise the farms and then left them alone in a patchwork of small holdings. In 1989 a fifth of the land was state owned and the rest was in private hands. But the patchwork smallholdings are estimated to be six to seven times less efficient than the operations of farmers in the EC. Farming units will have to be larger if Poland is to compete on world markets. For the moment, however, little is being done to address these issues; successive governments hope that the squeeze on farm incomes will, of itself, lead to more efficient production on the 14.3m hectares privately farmed. Efforts are currently being focused on privatising the state farming sector, mostly large farms in those parts of western Poland depopulated by the forced exodus of ethnic Germans at the end of the war. A new state body, the Agricultural Ownership Agency, was established last year to take over and sell the 1,495 state farms with their 261,000 employees and 3.1m hectares of arable land. Ironically, it is the once heavily subsidised state farms which are the right size for modern farming methods and which have the best chance of matching production costs abroad. Traditionally, grain yields have been higher in the state sector, which had privileged access to seed, fertilisers and equipment. Even in the 1992 harvest, when 15 per cent of the state farm arable land was left fallow, their grain yield per hectare was 34 per cent higher than on the private farms. But the privatisation task will not be easy. The state farms remain indebted and many were neglected in the first couple of years of non-communist rule when subsidies were removed and their fate remained undecided. Foreigners in general and Germans in particular are not welcomed as potential buyers; they have to obtain a special permit from the Interior Ministry before a purchase can be made. But domestic buyers are also scarce. By March 31 new Polish owners had been found for a mere 24,000 hectares of former state land and another 204,000 hectares had been leased to individual owners or employee owned companies.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Gainsborough fetches Pounds 350,000  -Saleroom A CHALK drawing by Gainsborough, 'A peasant family going to market' (detail right), sold for Pounds 352,000 at Christie's yesterday to an anonymous telephone bidder. The price was plumb in the middle of the saleroom's estimate and is the second-highest sum paid at auction for a drawing by the 18th century English artist. A year ago Christie's sold 'A lady walking in a garden' for Pounds 616,000. Gainsborough made the drawing in Bath in the 1770s. It gives an idealised view of rural life and owes something to the landscapes of Rubens. It comes from the estate of the late Lord Clark, of 'Civilisation' fame. The auction of British drawings and watercolours did well, totalling Pounds 830,863 with only 9 per cent unsold. A watercolour by Turner, 'The Splugen Pass', was near the top of its estimate, selling for Pounds 242,000. It was painted in Switzerland in 1843 and in 1878 had been given to Ruskin by a group of his friends. The watercolour sold at Sotheby's in New York in 1984 for Dollars 275,000. A pencil and chalk drawing by Sir Thomas Lawrence of Lady Selina Meade beat its estimate at Pounds 16,500. Five of the top ten prices were paid for works by Turner. His major oils have been difficult to sell lately but there is obviously still a good demand for his more modestly priced watercolours. On Monday, Sotheby's set a record price of Pounds 92,400 for a golf club, of circa 1700. Yesterday in Edinburgh Phillips established a record for a golf ball when a gutta ball made by Allan Robertson in 1849 sold for Pounds 19,250, beating the previous auction record by more than Pounds 6,000. Robertson is best known for his feathery golf balls and only reluctantly, and briefly, produced balls made from the new latex material.</p>

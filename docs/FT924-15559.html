			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions THE WEEK has seen a very even balance between purchases and sales. It began with the disposal of 1m shares by Sir Tom Cowie, chairman of T. Cowie, the eponymous contract hire and leasing company which is one of the few in the motor sector to have performed consistently well since the dark days of 1990 (although it failed recently in its bid to acquire a rival car and coach company, Henlys). The share price performance of Menvier-Swain resembles that of Cowie: it reached a low point at the end of 1990 and has performed well ever since. The chairman, Charles Swain, has sold 290,000 shares at 425p, more than double their price at the beginning of 1991. He retains more than 1.25m. Nursing homes is one area of the economy which appears to have bucked the general downward trend. Takare is the UK's largest operator of nursing homes and has benefited accordingly. Keith Bradshaw and Deverok Pritchard, chairman and deputy chairman respectively, each sold 800,000 shares at 201p. The sales were made to enable them to repay borrowings, and each retains more than 11m shares. Bryant, the housebuilding group, reported final results recently which were better than analysts' best expectations. On the day they were announced, chairman Alan Bryant, together with his wife, bought a total of 8,169,250 shares at 75p. The stake was acquired from Royal Insurance and, effectively, doubles his holding.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  No of Company                  Sector      Shares        Value     directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbott Mead Vickers        Medi     61,440          224            3 Beattie (James) A          Stor     10,000           12            1 Candover Investment        InvT    250,000          585            1 Cowie T                    Moto  1,000,000        1,380            1 Croda International        Chem     91,000          184            2* EMAP                       Medi      8,000           21            1 Greene, King &amp; Sons        Brew    161,988          711            1 Gresham Telecomptg         Eltn  1,050,000          304            1 Headline Book Publ         Medi    182,250          335            2 Johnson Matthey            Metl     41,200          189            1* Lloyd Thompson             InsB    110,000          236            2 Macallan Glenlivet         Brew    250,000          378            1 MAI                        OthF      7,710           10            1 Menvier-Swain              Elec    290,000        1,233            1 Protean                    EngG    158,333          172            2* Radius                     Eltn     50,000           20            1 Scapa Group                OthI    172,089          325            1* Sphere IT (Pref)           InvT     35,000           23            1 Stirling Group             Text     36,925           14            1 Takare                     Hlth  1,600,000        3,216            2 Tomkins                    OthI     10,000           27            1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Allen                     Cont     130,900          82             3 Ashley (Laura) ADRs       Stor       5,350  Dollars 29             1 British Aerospace         EngA     113,500         142             5 Bryant Group              Cont   8,169,250       6,127             1 Buckingham Intl           Hotl     426,000          12             1 Estates &amp; General         Prop   2,150,000          65             3 Fairhaven                 OilG     350,000 Dollars 126             2 Granada Group             Hotl     384,172         939             2 Great Southern Pref       Misc      17,461          17             1 Helical Bar               Prop      70,000          66             1 Henderson Strategic       InvT       9,000          12             1 Henlys                    Moto      18,000          11             1 Hillsdown                 FdMa      20,250          17             1 Mid-Wynd                  InvT       7,000          16             1 Peel Holdings             Prop      25,000          23             2 Protean                   EngG      50,000          56             1 Ransomes                  EngG     100,000          10             1 Stirling Group            Text      77,850          22             3 Try Group                 Cont      50,000          11             1 Ward Group                BdMa      80,000          11             1 Whitecroft                OthI      81,000          23             7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev [No dateline as received] -- On 24 March a  debate on Ukraine's accession to the CIS economic union treaty,  with the rights of a full-fledged and not an associate member,  was taking place at the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine upon the  initiative of Vice Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk. Valentyn  Landyk explained the necessity of acceding by the existence of  customs barriers which "hamper the movement of commodities  within CIS" as a result of which "Ukraine is losing market  outlets". Deputy Minister of Economy Leonid Minin, and Mykhaylo  Umanets, chairman of the State Committee of Ukraine for the use  of nuclear energy, who, in particular, referred to Ukraine's  dependence on Russian nuclear fuel, supported him.    Vice Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov, Minister of the  Environment Yuriy Kostenko, and Ihor Podolev, the president's  adviser on credit and financial issues, were resolutely against  Ukraine's accession to the CIS economic union treaty with the  rights of a full-fledged member. Vasyl Yevtukhov reminded those  present that earlier, when the issue on the accession to this  union was raised, Ukraine made eight reservations which were to  be taken into account. Ihor Podolev remarked that this treaty  should be considered as a political rather than economic  document and that it "gives nothing" to the economic  integration. He also emphasized that it is possible to accede  to the treaty only taking into account the current situation but  not prospects for the future. In his opinion, such a union will  be ineffective "because the CIS markets will not contribute to  improving the quality of products".    Yevhen Marchuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine,  also  warned against this step in view of the negative consequences  for the economic independence of Ukraine in 5 to 10 years time.    Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko reminded of the  foreign political consequences for Ukraine in its relations with  the West European countries in case it joins the treaty, in  particular, in view of the signing of an agreement with the  European Union on 23 March. He was inclined to the opinion that  it was necessary to analyze the text of the treaty in detail.  Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy agreed with the  proposal made by Anatoliy Zlenko and proposed that this issue be  considered later.    On 25 March chief of the department for relations with the  CIS countries at the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Kostyantyn  Petrov remarked during his conversation with a UNIAN  correspondent that "talks to the effect that Ukraine should  fully accede to the treaty have long been in progress, some  people really believe that Ukraine will have more opportunities  within a single economic space. However, those documents are  being worked out so far which relate only to Ukraine's associate  membership in the economic union." The final say, as Kostyantyn  Petrov emphasized, belongs to the president.</p>

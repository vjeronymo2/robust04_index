			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Philips buoyant despite flat sales Philips, the Dutch electronics group, nearly trebled profits in the third quarter as it compensated for flat sales in Europe by winning increased business in higher-growth markets such as Asia Pacific, US and Brazil. The buoyant results, which exceeded analysts' forecasts, came after a sharp drop in financing costs and a restructuring that over the past few years has rid Philips of several loss-making businesses. Net profit jumped to Fl 530m (Pounds 193m) from Fl 133m, taking results for the first nine months to Fl 1.19bn, against Fl 1.45bn a year earlier, when results were flattered by a Fl 1.1bn extraordinary gain on the sale of a Japanese joint venture. The quarterly figure also included a Fl 75m extraordinary gain on the sale of a small part of Philips' 40 per cent stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which was recently floated in Taipei. Group turnover was virtually unchanged at Fl 14.19bn, but sales grew by 6 per cent if deconsolidations and exchange rate movements are taken into account. Europe, which accounts for just over half of group turnover, generated flat sales, with German subsidiaries, such as Grundig, the consumer electronics maker, and PKI, the telecommunications group, facing a reluctance by consumers to spend. By contrast, Asia, which accounts for 15 per cent of sales volume, was showing faster growth, allowing Philips to generate higher profit margins. Lex, Page 16</p>

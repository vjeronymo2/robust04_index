			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: Macbeth in a mess - A revival of the ENO production of Verdi's opera THE outgoing administration of English National Opera must be cursing the fact that money could not be found for their celebratory end-of-term performance of Verdi's Requiem. Instead, they will be departing to a 'special farewell' performance of the same composer's Macbeth, no doubt with a cackle of delight at having left so ghastly a production for their successors. To the usual cast of the opera they add Hecate as an extra character and she has cast her most grisly spell over this revival. In a year or two regular patrons at the London Coliseum will no doubt be sharing memories of the many inspiring nights that Mark Elder (conductor) and David Pountney (producer) gave them during the years of that team's partnership. But on Thursday those happy occasions seemed a long way off. There are various reasons why Verdi chose to turn Macbeth into an opera. One theme, as in so many of his operas, is the use (or misuse) of power and it is possible to imagine a production which would bring this element up-to-date, since Verdi's own feelings on the subject were a response to the events of his day. Pountney has toyed with that approach, but not convincingly followed it through. The whole production is a cauldron full of clever ideas that do not work. The witches are a haggle of middle-class ladies, together with a few men in drag, who seem to be living in suburban Glasgow sometime in the 1950s. Banquo is murdered by a trio of cross-dressing hit-men wielding handbags. Birnam Wood has become a sort of Scottish Garden of Eden inhabited by rows of naturist locals who have all left their sporrans at home. What a mess] Eye of newt would be a delicacy after all the tripe that Pountney has tipped into this unholy brew. It might have mattered less if the performance had been as exciting as the opera usually is. Unfortunately, there was a limited sense of the drama powering towards its crisis points, which was strange, as Elder himself was conducting a taut and well-paced account of the score. The most likely answer is that, if the production is unrelievedly overworked, the performance will respond by seeming all on a level. For all their hyperactive emoting, Malcolm Donnelly and Kristine Ciesinski as the Macbeths never really led the drama. Donnelly has the experience for the role, but made heavy weather of any passage that called for the singing of a sustained line. Ciesinski has power and commitment, but not the precision for the music, and a troublesome wobble is starting to beset the voice. John Hudson gave notice of a promising new tenor as Macduff; Gwynne Howell was the reliable Banquo. When one producer has given his time so abundantly in furnishing his company with new productions, it is inevitable that his style will become familiar to the point where it only irritates. After this Macbeth it is time for somebody else's cliches. Further performances until June 26</p>

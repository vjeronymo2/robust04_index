			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> R. J. REYNOLDS CANCELS TEST OF CIGARETTE AIMED AT BLACKS  </P> <P> R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., under fire for targeting its new Uptown cigarette  brand to black smokers, said Friday that it would cancel test-marketing of the  brand in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> The company did not say whether it would ever introduce the mentholated brand.  </P> <P> In a news release announcing its action, Reynolds complained of the "unfair and  biased attention" the brand had received. "This represents a loss of choice for  black smokers and a further erosion of the free enterprise system," Reynolds  said.  </P> <P> Black and Hispanic groups, as well as anti-smoking interests, had harshly  attacked Reynolds for the new brand, which the company acknowledged was  intended to appeal to blacks.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Dr. Louis Sullivan, the nation's top health official, bitterly  denounced Reynolds and urged it to cancel the plans for the test-marketing,  which was to begin Feb. 5.  </P> <P> Peter Hoult, the Reynolds executive quoted in the company's news release, said  a "small coalition of anti-smoking zealots" forced the tobacco firm to cancel  its plans.  </P> <P> "Our intentions in test-marketing Uptown in Philadelphia have been misconstrued  and misrepresented by the anti-smoking lobby," said Hoult, who is executive  vice president for marketing. "Our sole purpose, plainly and simply, was to  test market a cigarette among smokers who currently buy competitive products."  </P></p>

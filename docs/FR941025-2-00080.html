			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Cape San Blas tract, located in Gulf County, is also proposed for ACEC designation. The tract would be managed to protect the coastal dune habitat. The tract would be closed to motorized vehicle use, would be classified as an avoidance area for rights-of-way, would be withdrawn from entry under the 1872 mining law, and closed to mineral material sales and lease of solid minerals. Oil and gas leasing would be subject to a no surface occupancy stipulation. The tract would be available for cooperative management with other government agencies and/or private organizations, or for conveyance under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, provided that the proposed use would follow the stated management objectives and land-use allocations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A tract of public land adjacent to the Peace River was evaluated to determine if it was eligible to be studied for possible inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic River System. It was determined that it was ineligible for further study because it would be unmanageable due to the lack of other public lands adjacent to the river. The 37-acre tract of BLM-administered land adjacent to the river comprises only one percent of the land area within a corridor of one-quarter mile on either side of the River for the nine-mile segment evaluated. The remaining acres in the corridor are predominantly under private ownership and are used for agricultural and ranchland purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 19, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert V.

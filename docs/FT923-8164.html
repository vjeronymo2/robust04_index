			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / People: Nelson moves to avoid conflict of interest Elizabeth Nelson, one of the leading lights of the market research industry, has stepped down as chairman of Taylor Nelson AGB, Britain's biggest market research company which she helped to found. The 60-year-old Nelson indicated some time ago that she intended to retire following her company's Pounds 15m acquisition of AGB, part of the late Robert Maxwell's private business empire. In March she was appointed chairman of the UK Ecolabelling Board, part of an EC initiative to identify products which are less harmful to the environment than others. It had been thought that she would wait until a permanent successor could be found at Taylor Nelson, which more than doubled in size with the AGB acquisition. However, it seems she was concerned about possible conflicts of interest and was keen to sever her ties completely so that she could 'pursue more freely' her new role. The Ecolabelling board is likely to need a considerable amount of market research data. John Treasure, 67, will take over the non-executive chairmanship of Taylor Nelson for the time being, pending a long-term external appointment. Treasure has been on the board for three years and is a well known figure in the communications and market research industry; he is a former Dean of the City University Business School. Nelson says she is 'sure the ecolabelling scheme will be a great success'. The UK has led the way in Europe in proposing criteria for the first award of Ecolabels - for washing machines and dishwashers. Further studies for criteria for light-bulbs and hairsprays are nearing completion and the first European ecolabels could start appearing in the shops by the end of the year. At the end of July the government named Nelson's 14-strong board, which includes a director of Tesco, a professor of environmental technology and a vice-chairman of the Consumers Association.</p>

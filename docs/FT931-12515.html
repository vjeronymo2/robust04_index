			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Family life shows the imprint of recession: Share ownership accompanies household spending into decline - First fall in real household disposable income for 10 years THE FOOTPRINTS of the recession are to be found in almost every area of a typical family's life, judging by the image of Britain in the latest edition of Social Trends published yesterday. In recent years Social Trends - described by its publisher, the Central Statistical Office, as the 'biography of the nation' - has presented a picture of unstoppable consumerism fuelled by credit. This year's biography is of a different nation, where rising unemployment, redundancy and home repossessions are the priorities. Real household disposable income - the money people have to spend, save or invest - fell for the first time in a decade between 1990 and 1991, following a 71 per cent real-terms rise since 1971. Household spending went down as well - for the first time in 15 years. There was a 2 per cent overall fall between 1990 and 1991 with spending on motor vehicles - down 18 per cent - suffering the biggest fall. People spent less on alcohol and tobacco, less on household durables and less on books and newspapers. The only categories where expenditure increased were television and videos, and fuel and power. Share-ownership - one of the growth areas and symbols of the 1980s - accompanied household spending into decline. By 1990 about a quarter of the adult population owned shares. This fell last year to 22 per cent, although it remains far ahead of 1981's 7 per cent. The changed economic conditions have led to the disappearance of another late-1980s phenomenon. From 1987 to 1989, saving as a percentage of household disposable income was negative, meaning that overall the nation's families were spending more than they earned. Savings are now positive again, and amounted to 2.5 per cent of disposable income in 1991. Consumer credit has started to fall slightly, although the amount outstanding excluding home mortgages - Pounds 53bn - still nearly doubled in real terms between 1981 and 1991. Social Trends says: 'After violent crime and long-term illness, one of the greatest fears haunting society is probably that of redundancy.' Figures up to spring of last year show that the risk of redundancy was highest in the east Midlands and lowest in Scotland. Unemployment is particularly severe among the young - last year nearly one in five young men and one in seven women under 19 were unemployed - and is far higher for ethnic minorities than the white population. The problem is worst among the Pakistani and Bangladeshi group, where a quarter of people in economically active age groups are without jobs. Social Trends catalogues an array of factors such as house repossessions, mortgage arrears, rising social security claims and declining housebuilding figures that have a direct link with the recession. There are other areas that provide far more room for debate. Does the first decline since 1987-88 in the number of people attending first-division football matches say something about the recession, or something about football? One of the most serious areas for this debate concerns the crime figures, where there is heated disagreement about the possible connection between deprivation and offending. Reports of offences like burglary, robbery and theft which, it is sometimes argued, can have a link with the recession, all increased between 1990 and 1991. Social Trends 23, HMSO, Pounds 26.</p>

Applied to sewage treatment, the rotary disk module  allowed us to consistently obtain recycled water of T-N &lt; 5  mg/l, BOD &lt; 2 mg/l, SS trace. When the module was applied to  cafeteria waste water treatment, we were able to obtain recycled  water of BOD &lt; 2 mg/l, SS trace. Flux through the module was,  in both cases, able to be maintained at 1.5  m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]d while filtering liquid of 10 to  15 g/l MLSS.  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   As pollution in closed water regions grows worse and urban  redevelopment becomes more extensive, it becomes all the more  urgent to recycle sewage and commercial building waste water.  Here, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry conducted  a six-year (1985 through 1990) project, Research and Development  on General Recycling Systems for Water. In conjunction with  this, the authors supervised a project, Research and Development  on Biological Nitrogen Removal Technique, directed at developing  membrane reactors for sewage recycling. In the field of water  treatment, membrane reactors have been utilized for grey water  production devices[.sup]1[/] that combine membrane treatment  with the activated sludge process. However, while this approach  does have its advantages, it is limited by the large amount of  power required to membrane-separate the highly concentrated  activated sludge.    Here, we created a rotary disk module[.sup]2[/] for the  low-power separation of highly concentrated liquid and, in  extension, developed a membrane reactor that combines this with  the biological nitrogen removal process. In this paper, we  introduce this rotary disk module and the newly developed  membrane reactor for sewage treatment. In addition, we access  the performance of this system as applied to the recycling of  cafeteria waste water and compare its cost to that of  tubular-type modules.  <H5>  2. Design of the Rotary Disk Module </H5>   A conventional membrane module circulates the treatment  liquid at a high flow rate so as to obtain a rapid flow at the  membrane surface and a high flux through the surface. However,  much power is consumed, because the pressure loss within the  module is correspondingly high (i.e., a higher pressure is  maintained than what is required for filtration alone). As  opposed to this, rotating the membrane would, we thought, allow  us to maintain a high liquid flow rate at the membrane surface  without having to maintain high pressure. Therefore, relatively  little power would be required to run the system.    The water collection mechanism of a rotary disk module is  shown in Figure 1. A membrane disk, comprised of two support  plates covered with a membrane over their surface, is fastened  to a hollow rotary shaft which acts as a water collection tube.  Filtering is carried out while the shaft rotates. To modularize  the system, it is of course necessary to increase the filling  density of the membrane by attaching many such disks to the  rotary shaft. However, merely adding on extra disks decreases  the flux through the surface by approximately one-half in a  liquid having a high concentration of microorganisms. Here,  installing baffle plates between the disks restores the flux to  very nearly what it would be with only one disk.[.sup]3[/]   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-18A>      Figure 1. Water Collection Mechanism of Rotary Disk Module </FIG>     The engagement-type module (Figure 2) utilizes the disks of  an adjacent rotary shaft in place of the baffle plates. Here,  two shafts comprise one module. Not only is membrane filling  density increased with this arrangement, but turbulent flow at  the membrane surface is encouraged, thereby increasing the flux.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-18B>      Figure 2. Engagement-Type Rotary Disk Module </FIG>   <H5>  3. Advanced Sewage Recycling System (a part of the Aqua </H5> Renaissance '90 Project)    3-1. Experimental Apparatus    The experimental apparatus is comprised of a nitrogen  removal  tank (1.25 m[.sup]3[/]), a nitrification tank (1.25  m[.sup]3[/]), and a rotary disk module (Membrane Area 7.44  m[.sup]2[/]). Standard treatment capacity is 10  m[.sup]3[/]/d. Retention time in the bioreaction tank was set  at 6 hours. The rotary disk module consisted of two shafts, each  with 12 disks of 500mm in diameter. The membrane was made out of  a polysulfone. The data presented here was taken when using  membranes having a cut-off molecular weight of 600,000.    The types of raw water were tested: sewage (case 1); water  from methane-fermentation of sewage (case 2); and water from SS  separation and from SS methane-fermentation of sewage (case 3).  Flow paths and operating results are shown in Table 1. Figures  for water quality shown in the table are average values  throughout the operating period.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-19A>      FIGURE </FIG>     3-2. Membrane Reactor Effectiveness    The rate of nitrogen removal in the activated sludge process  increases with an increase in the recirculation ratio. Figure 3  [not reproduced] presents data showing the effect of  recirculation ratio in a membrane reactor. In both cases 1 and  2, we see that, relative to theoretical removal rates for  conventional processing, higher removal rates were obtained even  at lower circulation rates. This is because of (a) nitrogen  removal in the nitrification tank due to a higher concentration  of microorganisms and (b) removal by the membrane of nitrogen  components resulting from SS. Here, we note that using membranes  is very effective. Furthermore, the very high rate of nitrogen  removal observed in case 2 is due to nearly complete  nitrification and denitrification resulting from efforts to  remove nitrogen after nitrification.    The microorganisms had been acclimated from some time back,  so this trial did not last long. Even so, we did achieve stable  operation from the 15th to 70th day, producing, with retention  times of 3 to 6 hours, treating water having 5 ml/l or less of  T-N and 2 mg/l or less of BOD. Furthermore, the amount of excess  sludge in this period was one-fifth of that resulting from  conventional process.    Operating results for case 2 are shown in Figure 4 [not  reproduced]. From the 150th day of operation, we began adding  ammonium chloride to the raw water to increase the nitrogen  load. Even with this, we were able to maintain stable operation  throughout the year. In average values throughout the year,  water quality was 31.3 mg/l total nitrogen and 9.5 mg/l BOD for  the raw water and 0.93 mg/l nitrogen and less than 2 mg/l BOD  for the treated water -- the treated water was fully able to be  recycled. Very little excess sludge was generated during the  operating period, and nitrogen was removed very efficiently.  Furthermore, use of the rotary disk module forestalled any  problems with flow blockage or the like -- the membrane reactor  operated very smoothly.    3-3. Membrane Module Performance    Figure 5 [not reproduced] shows the change with time in flux  upon continuous operation. Nearly the same flux is obtained in  cases 1 and 2. In case 2, a flux of 1.5  m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]d was obtained over 180 days of  operation without chemical cleaning. The pressure at this time  was low at 0.09 MPa, and the concentration of microorganisms in  the module was 12 to 15 g/l. The power required to draw water  through the membrane at this time (cutoff molecular weight =  600,000, motor efficiency = 85 percent, pump efficiency = 60  percent) was about 1 kWh/m[.sup]3[/]. By this, we confirmed  that we could separate highly concentration liquid with  relatively little power.    3-4. Comparison With Conventional Method    Table 2 presents a comparison for sewage between the  conventional process (nitrified liquor recycling activated  sludge process[.sup]4[/]) and the newly developed membrane  reactor. Because a high concentration of microorganisms was able  to be maintained with the membrane reactor, treatment time could  be reduced by about two-thirds, even at low temperatures, and  the volume of excess sludge was reduced by about four-fifths.  The newly developed system consistently produced water of a  quality -BOD = 2 mg/l max., T-N = 5 ml/l max. -- significantly  higher than that produced by the conventional system. These and  other results demonstrate the effectiveness of membrane  reactors. However, it should be mentioned that the membrane  reactor is probably not advantageous if the water is to be  discharged after treatment -- it is only economically feasible  when the treated water is to be recycled.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-20A>      FIGURE </FIG>   <H5>  4. Cafeteria Waste Water Recycling System </H5>   4-1. Experimental Apparatus and Methods    Figure 6 shows the flow of the experimental apparatus  (treatment capacity: 3 m[.sup]3[/]/d). The raw water is waste  water from a cafeteria within the Matsudo Works of Hitachi Plant  Engineering and Construction. After screening (2.0mm mesh) and  oil separation (in a tank), the raw water is fed into a  bioreaction tank (0.8 m[.sup]3[/]) for anaoxic and oxic  treatment. Afterwards, the water is fed to a rotary disk module  for solid/liquid separation. By this, treated water is obtained  for recycling. Concentrated liquid from the module is fed back  to the anaoxic tank. As treated water is removed from the  system, an equal quantity of raw water is fed into the  bioreaction treatment tank.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-21A>      Figure 6. Cafeteria Waste Water Recycling System Flow </FIG>     The rotary disk module is comprised of two rotary shafts;  the  disks on one shaft run between the disks of the other. In this  experiment, disk diameter is 500mm, and each shaft has six  disks. The membrane is made of a polysulfone; the cutoff  molecular weight is 750,000. A constant volume pump was attached  to the treated water line (offtake) of the rotary disk module.  The water was pulled through the membrane by the suction force  of this pump. No chemical cleaning was performed within the  period of this experiment.    4-2. Results of Continuous System Operation    The experimental apparatus was run in such a way that BOD-SS  load was kept at 0.15 kg/kg-d. Figure 7 [not reproduced] shows  the progression in flux over two months in continuous operation;  Table 3 shows the results of water quality measurements taken  over that period (``raw water'' in the table refers to water at  the inlet of the biological treatment tank). At this time,  liquid temperature in the biological treatment tank was 25 to  33C, and MLSS was controlled to about 10 g/l. From Table 3,  we note that high removal rates of over 90 percent were obtained  for all water quality items and that the treated water was of a  quality sufficient for recycling. Through this experiment, we  have confirmed the efficiency of membrane treatment -- flux in  the rotary disk module averaged 1.5  m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]d, and simple screening was enough  to prevent any problems from blockage by foreign objects.

Running Cost    Table 4 presents a comparison of running costs between a  rotary disk module and a tubular membrane module. Equipment  depreciation and maintenance costs are not included. Because the  rotary disk module, in comparison to the tubular membrane  module, requires less power for filtration and has a higher  flux, costs for power can be reduced by about half and costs for  membrane changes can be reduced by about two-fifths.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4.

Summary </H5>   Advanced sewage recycling system (a part of the Aqua  Renaissance '90 Project)    (1) The use of a biological nitrogen removal process has  enabled us to obtain recycled water of T-N &lt; 5 mg/l, BOD &lt;  2  mg/l, SS trace.    (2) By maintaining the microorganism concentration in the  bioreaction tank at 10 to 15 g/l, we have succeeded in  shortening the treatment time to one-third of that required by  the conventional biological nitrogen removal method.    (3) With the rotary disk module, we have achieved stable  performance and high flux. We also showed that it is possible to  drive the rotary disk module with less power than required for a  plate &amp; frame-type module.    Cafeteria waste water re-use system    In continuous operation, we obtained a stable supply of  recycled water with a good quality of BOD &lt; 2 mg/l, SS trace.  Also, we were able to maintain a flux of approximately 1.5  m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]d without chemical cleaning.  <H5>  6. Literature Cited </H5>   1. K.

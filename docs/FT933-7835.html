			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / People: De Beers This is turning out to be a year to remember for Chips Keswick, chairman of Hambros Bank. Knighted in the New Year, he then joined the illustrious group who are directors of the Bank of England - and now has topped all that by becoming a director of De Beers, the South African group which dominates the world diamond business. As a regular visitor to South Africa, Sir Chips is well-known to the business community there and, more important, is well-known to Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of both De Beers and its sister organisation, the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa. Rupert Hambro, a former chairman of Hambros Bank, has been a non-executive director of Anglo for more than ten years. The connections between Hambros, De Beers and the diamond market go back many more years. The UK merchant bank is reputed to have provided a vital link between De Beers and the former Soviet Union in the days when international politics decreed there should be no formal relationship between them. According to trade sources, Hambros bought most of the Soviet rough (uncut) diamonds and made sure that most ended up safely with De Beers' cartel, which controls about 80 per cent of the market. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was no longer any need for this ruse and Russia quickly joined the cartel.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Canary Wharf plan approved THE administrators of Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf, the office development in London's Docklands, have won High Court approval to put together an arrangement that could take the project out of administration. The significance of the move was played down by the administrators, who said it was 'merely a technical stage in the administration process'. It will allow them to put formal proposals to the project's creditors, if and when such proposals are developed. The administrators, from Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, have won permission to put together either a company voluntary arrangement, which involves an informal scheme of compromise by creditors, or a scheme of arrangement, a more formal route out of administration.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a special news conference held in the  parliamentary building today, Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party  of the Democratic Left [SDL], rejected accusations levelled  against the SDL that they had attempted to blackmail Prime  Minister Meciar and the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  [HZDS]. Weiss said that on the basis of the 17 February debate  on the endorsement of privatization projects, Deputy Juraj  Plesnik, as the vice chairman of the parliamentary committee for  privatization, had examined certain procedures adopted by the  government when endorsing privatization projects during the past  days. He had come to a conclusion that a suspicion existed that  the law had been violated.    Weiss went on to say that, in view of the seriousness of the  content of the speech Deputy Plesnik had planned to make to the  National Council, he had deemed it appropriate to inform  parliamentary speaker Ivan Gasparovic. The latter had visited  Vladimir Meciar and had given him the first version of the draft  resolution. According to Weiss, that version had been different  than the one Deputy Plesnik had delivered to the National  Council.    Weiss regards the move made by Meciar as being a pretext to  prevent an agreement on holding an early election and a  referendum.</p>

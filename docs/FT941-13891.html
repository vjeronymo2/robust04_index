			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Sport: Winter greens - Golf You know those calendars which show tiny greens perched precariously on clifftops, with minuscule tees 100ft below? l have news. Places like this really exist. I have recently played in one of the world's most unusual golf tournaments. It took place - as it does every year - in mid-winter, on the island of Arran, off the west coast of Scotland. The Arran Challenge is held at Shiskine Golf Club, near the tiny fishing village of Blackwaterfoot. It is a curious tournament. It lasts 10 days, although most 'foreign' competitors (anyone from the mainland) do not stay that long. You are required to play 36 holes although you can play as many practice rounds as you choose. To describe the conditions while I was there as cold, wet and windy would be to fall a full-wedge short of accuracy. Most people would not have put a disobedient dog out in them. Players sat in the bar of the only hotel drinking Scotch broth and Scottish beer until they felt brave enough to go outside. The course has only 12 holes. This is a much more convenient number than 18, since you can get around in a 1 1/2 hours. The locals claim it is the only 12-hole course in the world (although I have it on good authority that others exist in Ireland and Australia). The course is short, (six of the 12 holes are par-threes and only one is par five) but in spite of this, and in spite of the fact that several international golfers have played it, par was not broken for more than 40 years. 'We've had some Walker Cup players here,' says John McLean, the tournament organiser (who will tell you without the hint of a smile that the course is as good as Augusta or Pebble Beach). 'For some strange reason though, they never seem to score very well here. l think they underestimate it.' The course was designed over the years by three Open champions, Willie Fernie, Willie Park and James Braid. Two attempts have been made to extend it to 18 holes, but world wars intervened on both occasions. 'The challenge starts well before you tee it up on the first,' McLean said. 'It doesn't finish when you sink your last putt either. Just getting to and from Arran at this time of year can be a test in itself.' To reach Blackwaterfoot, you must make your way to the depressed Ayrshire town of Ardrossan, board a ferry for the 70-minute crossing to Brodick, then journey 10 miles across mountains. The course is eccentric. At the third hole you play to a slim post high in the sky some 130 yards away. The right club for distance is somewhere between a driver and a nine-iron, depending on the wind. The right instrument for elevation is anything from a catapult to a rocket launcher. There are reasonably handicapped golfers still trying to hit a wedge as high as you need to hit one here. The third is by no means an exception. This is old-fashioned golf at its most capricious. There are blind shots galore (three on the first three holes) and marker-posts everywhere. At the second, a par-four of 375 yards, there is a blind second shot. Fair enough. What some would argue is not quite so fair is the Swilcan-type burn which hides like a trip-wire at the front of the green. As far as l know there were no Walker Cup players this year, just a bunch of rough and ready hackers willing to pit themselves against the sheep and the elements. Legend has it that Americans and Australians have travelled over for the event, but l saw no evidence of them either. I did not win the Arran Challenge. It was won by a local. No surprise there, locals have won for the last three years. Because the competition lasts 10 days, they have the advantage of being able to wait for a gap in the wind and rain before darting out to play their rounds. Some of us had to catch the ferry. We feared that the weather would set in, the ferry would not sail and we would be stuck on the island.</p>

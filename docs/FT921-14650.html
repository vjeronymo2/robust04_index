			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / AT&amp;T, Dutch PTT in Ukraine deal AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph and state-owned PTT Telecom of the Netherlands have formed a joint venture with the Ukraine government to modernise and operate the long-distance and international telecommunications network in the former Soviet state. The deal represents a significant expansion in eastern Europe for both companies, particularly for AT&amp;T, the biggest US long- distance telephone operator, which will own 39 per cent of the venture. The Dutch company will hold 10 per cent and 51 per cent will be owned by the Ukraine's state committee of communications. AT&amp;T, which has been expanding rapidly outside America and wants to become the leading global telecommunications company, said this was the first time it would play a leading role in building and operating a long-distance voice network outside the US. The Ukraine venture has two main elements. One involves building, owning and operating a new international network. At present international communications to and from the state is routed through Moscow on 150 circuits. Ukraine's state communications committee is adding 60 new circuits - 30 to western Europe and Israel via PTT Telecom's Amsterdam facilities and 30 to North America. The second element involves building and operating a long-distance network connecting 13 of the Ukraine's 25 telephone districts. AT&amp;T's main financial commitment to the joint venture will take the form of 13 switching systems to link the regions. PTT Telecom's stake will take the form of an unspecified sum in hard currency. Both foreign investors see big opportunities in the Ukraine, which has a population of 52m people and already has 7m telephone lines, high by the standards of the former Soviet Union. The government wants to have 22m lines in service by the turn of the century and the joint venture will work on plans to double the number of local lines to 13m. For PTT Telecom, which is 100 per cent state-owned but operates at arms length from the Dutch government, the Ukraine deal represents a further step to expand internationally and overcome the limited size of its home market. PTT Telecom also has a presence in Czechoslovakia, where it has set up a consultancy joint venture to help the country build a modern telephone system. AT&amp;T has been building its business in eastern Europe over the past two years, with the emphasis on Poland. In October it inaugurated a direct dial service between Armenia and the rest of the world.</p>

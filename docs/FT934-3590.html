			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Delors fights work deregulation: Brussels believes unemployed cannot be 'priced into jobs' Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, will tell European Union leaders at their summit starting on Friday that cutting wages and wholesale labour market deregulation are not the ways to beat the jobs crisis and strengthen Europe's competitiveness. Cutting wages and pruning welfare payments to price Europe's unemployed into jobs would be 'socially unacceptable and politically untenable', and would 'only worsen the crisis by depressing domestic demand', according to the Commission white paper on growth and jobs. This strategy document, circulated yesterday to member state governments, is intended to be the centrepiece of the two-day Brussels summit. The Commission's approach contrasted sharply with the call yesterday from Unice, the EU employers' confederation, for a comprehensive reduction in labour costs and the privatisation of welfare systems. Unice's report, called 'Making Europe more Competitive', is timed to gain employers a voice in the summit debate. It wants: To reduce Europe's high non-wage labour costs, especially social security contributions for the low paid and young workers. Real wage increases below rises in productivity. Higher wage differentials, especially by cutting minimum wages and marginal tax rates. The Euro-employers also want relaxation of rules on working hours, easier hire-and-fire laws, lower unemployment benefit and more limited access to the social security system. In a manifesto that only the UK among the 12 would feel altogether comfortable with, Unice also wants a general roll-back of the public sector and a review of EU legislation with a view to scrapping regulation which implies costs for industry. The central employment section of the white paper emphasises lifelong training and retraining, lifting non-wage costs off low-skilled work, job-sharing and more part-time working within companies rather than as a national scheme. It envisages a big push to develop services for those seeking employment. 'Unemployment benefits can only be reduced so far before the poverty line is reached,' the white paper says, adding: 'These limits have already been reached in several countries.' A senior Commission official described the approach as 'not deregulation, but readjusting regulation to fit the present situation . . . social engineering that goes with the market.' The paper maintains that restored growth might deal with cyclical job losses, and advocates a big investment drive in information technology and pan-European rail, road and energy networks to raise competitiveness. But Mr Delors and Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner whose department designed the jobs strategy, say structural unemployment requires government and industry to promote more employment-intensive work patterns.</p>

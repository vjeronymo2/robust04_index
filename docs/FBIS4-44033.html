			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hans O. Alfredsson: "Center Party Congress </F> Supports Party Leader Johansson"]    [Text] Falun -- Olof Johansson has the support of his  party. This was made clear when the Center Party congress in  Falun was yesterday given the opportunity to discuss the  political situation after the maneuverings around the Oresund  bridge -- and on this issue there was no debate.    Bengt-Ake Berg from Jonkoping County was a voice crying in  the wilderness when he declared that he feels concern about  where the Center Party is going. When he joined the party 20  years ago the Center Party had 25 percent of voters behind it.    Today support has shrunk to a quarter of this figure.  "Perhaps we should do what our fellow Centrists in Norway did,  when they found themselves in the same situation -- that is,  leave the government," Berg wondered.    No one took him up on this. Instead Per-Ola Eriksson,  Andreas Carlgren, Rolf Kenneryd, and Michael Artursson set the  tone by praising Olof Johansson in quick succession and  asserting that both he and the party have acted completely  correctly.    "I think that we should be proud to have a party leader who  demonstrates that politics means something," Artursson said to  warm applause.    As he put it himself, Olof Johansson only wanted to add a  few  "footnotes" to what is contained in the Center Party's election  platform. He also wanted to clarify his reply the other day  when he was asked whether he can envisage ruling together with  the Social Democrats.    The election platform remains firm, the Center Party leader  assured his audience.    This means that the Center Party is striving for a  nonsocialist majority with increased influence for Center Party  policies. There is no other "objective" in this fall's election.    Since both the political and the economic situations are a  little "unstable" it might be wise not "to go around ruling  things out," Olof Johansson declared.    That was what he had wanted to say in his remark about not  ruling out cooperation with the Social Democrats.    "We must talk about what we want. We must be clear when it  comes to our election platform, but we must not rule out  different options. But this does not mean a greater desire to  work with the Social Democrats, for example, on an objective  foundation. Nothing has changed on this point."    In the light of recent events Johansson himself has "not  found any reason to make even a single correction, to change a  single comma" in the election platform.    On the subject of the Oresund bridge he told the congress  yesterday that "the bridge was more important than an intact  government for three of the present government's parties: They  had a very clear choice. Our view was no secret. They knew  what it was."</p>

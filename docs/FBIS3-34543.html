Does Moscow  believe that it can restore peace in Nagorno-Karabakh and  Tajikistan all by itself, or does it need the assistance of  countries such as the Islamic Republic of Iran and the  international organizations?    [Tretyakov] The visit by ambassador Kazimirov, the Russian  presidential special emissary, to Iran is a clear answer to your  question. Russia does not wish to take any measures in these  regions alone. It has been repeatedly stressed by the Foreign  Minister and all other high level officials of our country that  Russia has taken and continues to take steps independently as  well as in relation to international organizations such as the  CSCE Minsk group.    At the same time, Moscow attaches great value to cooperation  with regional countries such as the Islamic Republic of Iran,  and around the world. We consider our recent consultations with  Iranian officials extremely important and worthwhile. The  officials of the two countries announced that Tehran and Moscow  can cooperate in resolving the wars in Nagorno-Karabakh and  Tajikistan. They have also announced that they support the  peace efforts of international organizations and other countries.    [ABRAR] Are you optimistic about resolving these conflicts  or do you believe that the Nagorno-Karabakh and Tajikistan  conflicts will continue?    [Tretyakov] It is natural for Russia to be sincerely  interested in a solution to these conflicts, which not only  affect the countries involved but will also have negative  effects on the CIS politically, economically, and militarily.  Therefore, we are seeking to end these conflicts as soon as  possible.    [ABRAR] How do you view the scope for cooperation between  Russia and the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)? Some  Russian media recently threatened the Central Asian countries  and the Caucasus that have joined the ECO, saying that in the  event of their broadening ties within the ECO, they will be  expelled from the CIS. Do the Russian political circles also  contribute to this view?    [Tretyakov] Perhaps some individuals and officials have  aired their personal views. Russia maintains that the domestic  and foreign policies of the countries of Central Asia and the  Caucasus are to be respected above all else. It is up to them  whether they wish to be members of the ECO or the CIS.    [ABRAR] In your opinion, is it a problem if they are  simultaneously members of the ECO and the CIS?    [Tretyakov] We have always stressed that we are opposed to  competitiveness among various countries in this region.  However, on the other hand we favor constructive cooperation in  the region. In this regard, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani had  stressed that the aim of the ECO is constructive cooperation  among countries and the creation of a climate of confidence and  security in the region.    Russia has bilateral relations with all the ECO member  countries. As for Russia joining the ECO, we must wait and see  the working of this organization. Naturally, when joining any  organization every country should keep its own national  interests in mind.    [ABRAR] What is Moscow's policy with regard to the Middle  East? For example, there are potential dangers such as altering  Iraq's borders and the possibility of the creation of an  independent Kurdistan in that country. What is your opinion in  this regard?    [Tretyakov] Issues pertaining to national boundaries and  their territorial integrity are among the most sensitive issues  for all the countries of the world. In some cases, border  issues have evolved into disputes. For this reason, not only  are we in favor of safeguarding the territorial integrity of all  countries, we do not want any border disputes among countries to  threaten the peace of the region and the world with instability  and insecurity.    [ABRAR] So is Russia opposed to changes in the borders of  Iraq?    [Tretyakov] All issues should be resolved within the  framework of international rights. One determine the objectives  of the circles suggesting these actions.    [ABRAR] How do you appraise the Tehran-Moscow relations in  the Middle East?    [Tretyakov] In all the meetings that take place between the  two countries, we exchange views on the issues of the Middle  East and the Persian Gulf, and on most occasions there is a  unanimity of views.    [ABRAR] It appears that Russia has recently made some moves  in the Persian Gulf, for instance a military-security pact with  Kuwait. Similarly, we may refer to the remarks by Lukin, the  Russian ambassador in Washington, who has stressed the sale of  arms to Iraq and criticized the U.S. policy of refraining from  arms sales to other countries. Does Russia intend to become  active again in the Middle East and in the Persian Gulf?    [Tretyakov] If the United States, Japan, and Western Europe  are to pursue their economic and political interests in the  various regions of the world including the Persian Gulf, why  should we not act accordingly? Geographically, the Persian Gulf  is closer to Russia and has a special importance to us for  economic and security reasons.    [ABRAR] The West is competing with Russia for arms sales in  regions such as the Middle East and East Asia. It is for this  reason that the West wishes to prevent sales of Russian arms to  these regions and is opposing them. In this regard, Bill  Clinton signed an agreement with Yeltsin during his visit to  Moscow. What is your opinion on this?    [Tretyakov] It is natural that Russia, which is one of the  major arms producers of the world, should be interested in  expanding its arms market. I do not believe that this rivalry  is commercial, as you state. At the same time, this competition  does not have a political aspect. Here I should assert that  Russia is one of the signatories of the treaty banning the  production and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  Therefore we will act only in accord with this treaty in  dealing with other countries on armament matters.    [ABRAR] In the wake of the victory of the nationalists and  communists in Russian parliamentary elections, U.S. policy  toward Russia has become dichotomized. On the one hand, it  declares full support for Yeltsin and his free market policies,  while on the other hand it seeks to counter Moscow's influence  in the neighboring countries? What is your analysis of this  two-pronged U.S. policy?    [Tretyakov] Some Western circles have greatly magnified the  result of the Russian parliamentary elections when it is not  nearly so bad.</p>

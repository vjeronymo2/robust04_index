			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Observer: Quiet exit Daniel Ludwig, who died last week at the grand old age of 95, was an unusual tycoon. In his hey-day he was an even more important figure in the international shipping industry than Paul Getty or Armand Hammer were in the oil industry, and yet he never craved respectability like they did. He was in business to make money and seemingly couldn't care less what people thought of him. He had been in the shipping industry longer than either the late Aristotle Onassis or Sir Y K Pao and led the development of the super-tankers. At its peak, Ludwig controlled a fleet of around 4.35m tonnes. However, unlike several of Europe's shipping families, such as the Cayzer's, Niarchos's and Moller's, he seemed unable to protect his huge fortune by diversifying successfully away from shipping. As a result there is a danger that he will be remembered more for ventures such as his ill-fated Amazonian Jari project and investment in failed US thrifts, than for his contribution to the development of world shipping. Ludwig was more invisible than most billionaires. However, a few anecdotes survive. One of the more memorable concerns a ship which Ludwig had used as security for a bank loan and had gone missing in a hurricane. 'How's my collateral?' a worried banker asked Ludwig. 'When we find the godamn thing I'll let you know,' replied the tycoon.</p>

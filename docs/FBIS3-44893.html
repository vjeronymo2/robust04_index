			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan. 8 KYODO -- Premier Li Peng and  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen expressed concerns Saturday [8  January] over recent Japanese-Taiwan relations in meetings with  Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata.    Hata arrived in Beijing Saturday afternoon for a two-day  visit and immediately had talks with Qian and Li.    In a two-hour meeting with Qian, also a vice premier, Hata  expressed hopes to further develop relations "in a future  oriented and global context," a Japanese Foreign Ministry  spokesman said.    Replying to Chinese concerns over recent Japanese-Taiwan  relations, Hata said Japan's one-China policy has not changed,  as stated in the 1972 Japan-China Joint Communique in which  Japan recognized China as sole legitimate government, the  spokesman said.    China's concerns are believed to be based on a high-level  visit to Taiwan by Hiroshi Sakamoto, chief of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry's Industrial Policy Bureau.    Japan switched diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing  in  1972 and no Japanese cabinet ministers have visited Taiwan,  which China regards as a renegade province.    Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Vincent Siew,  Taiwan's economic minister, exchanged greetings at the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seattle last  November, the first-ever contact between a Japanese premier and  a senior Taiwanese official since 1972.    Leaders of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a partner in  Hosokawa's seven-party coalition government, have sought the  opening of ministerial-level ties between Tokyo and Taipei.    Both Hata and Qian expressed satisfaction with North  Korea's recent agreement to allow international inspections of  its nuclear facilities, with Hata stressing Japan's expectation  that China play a positive role to "dispel the doubts of the  international community" concerning the nuclear program in North  Korea, the official said.    Qian said he expected "the issue to be solved soon" and  recognized its importance to the "peace and stability of  Northeast asia," he said.    The Japanese foreign minister also told Qian that Japan  expects more transparency in China's military expenditures, and  urged him to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime,  which aims at preventing proliferation of ballistic missile  technology. Hata also indicated that human rights improvements  in China would be conducive to "respect and trust" in the  international community.    Qian reiterated active participation in efforts toward a  comprehensive ban on nuclear weapons, a nuclear test ban treaty,  the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and registering  conventional weapons with the United Nations, the spokesman said.    It was agreed that Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, known as a  reformer and believed to be the main force behind China's  ambitious economic reform, would visit Japan in February, the  official said, while Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is hoping  to visit China as soon as possible. The Chinese side also  accepted an invitation for President Jiang Zemin to visit Japan.    Japan vowed to support China in its efforts to become a  contracting nation in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Concerning a new arrangement for Japanese development loans  to China, both sides agreed to a new arrangement shortening the  loan term period from five and six years to a three-year and  two-year arrangement with yearly reviews of loan projects  according to the principles of Japan's official development  assistance (ODA), the spokesman said.    Hata later made a courtesy call to Premier Li Peng and  discussed several issues including the economic situation in  both countries, the official said.    The Japanese foreign minister also went over the principles  of ODA with the Chinese premier, which stipulate that loans can  be offered to nonmilitary projects that promote further  democratization and basic human needs.    Japan has agreed to loan China 810 billion yen for the 1990  to 1995 period, of which 528 billion has already been loaned.    Li said Japan and China enjoy a good relationship. He  praised Japan for its one-China policy towards Taiwan and  welcomed the new developments on the Korean peninsula, the  spokesman said.    Hata will meet with President Jiang Zemin Sunday, before  returning to tokyo the same day.</p>

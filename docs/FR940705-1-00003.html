As for recruitment bonuses (discussed above), payment of relocation bonuses should be considered before requesting approval of special salary rates for difficult-to-fill positions. The proposed regulations would allow an agency to pay a relocation bonus to any employee the agency wishes to relocate to a position that would otherwise be difficult to fill. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Length of appointment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In &sect;575.203, the current definition of ``employee'' for relocation bonus purposes requires an appointment of at least 2 years. The proposed regulation would allow the employee's appointment to be any length of time determined appropriate by the agency. Also, the proposed definition would make a technical change to clarify that a relocation bonus may be paid to an employee whose duty station is changed to a different commuting area permanently as well as temporarily. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Written determination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In &sect;575.204(d), the current regulations provide for exceptions to case-by-case approvals of relocation bonuses with prior OPM approval. The proposed regulations would allow such exceptions without prior OPM approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reporting requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In &sect;575.208(b), the current regulations for relocation bonuses require an annual written report by each agency on its use of relocation bonuses. The proposed regulations would remove this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Retention Allowances <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Length of appointment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In &sect;575.303, the current definition of ``employee'' for retention allowance purposes requires an appointment of at least 2 years. The proposed regulations would allow the employee's appointment to be any length of time determined appropriate by the agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Length of service. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In &sect;575.304(a), the current regulations permit payment of a retention allowance only to an employee who (1) has completed 1 year of continuous service with the agency immediately prior to such payment, or (2) has completed a period of employment established under a service agreement for a recruitment or relocation bonus. the proposed regulations would allow an agency to pay a retention allowance to an employee with less than 1 year of continuous service. However, the proposed regulations continue to require that an employee under a service agreement for a recruitment or relocation bonus complete such an agreement before receiving a retention allowance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reason for being likely to leave. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In &sect;&sect;575.304(b) and 575.305(c), the current regulations permit payment of a retention allowance to an employee only if he or she is likely to leave the Federal service for employment outside the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Federal Government. The proposed regulations would allow payment of a retention allowance to an employee who is likely to leave not only for employment outside the Federal Government, but for a reason other than employment, such as retirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reporting requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In &sect;575.308(b), the current regulations for retention allowances require an annual written report by each agency on its use of retention allowances. The proposed regulations would remove this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Miscellaneous <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;575.103, the definition of ``commuting area'' is not germane to the payment of recruitment bonuses and would be removed by the proposed regulations. (The definition would remain in &sect;575.203 for payment of relocation bonuses.) Finally, the proposed regulations add a new paragraph (d) in &sect;575.306 to clarify that a retention allowance is not pay for purposes of a lump-sum payment for annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 5551. (See Comptroller General opinion B&hyph;249816, March 8, 1993.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E.O. 12866, Regulatory Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with E.O. 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I certify that these regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they would apply only to Federal agencies and employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

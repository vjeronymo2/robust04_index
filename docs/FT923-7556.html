			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Edinburgh director confident of success THE 1992 Edinburgh Festival opened last night with Mr Brian McMaster, who is directing the festival for the first time, confident that the Pounds 4m cost will be covered. Ticket sales, which are planned to achieve 70 per cent of seating capacity, are slightly below target at nearly Pounds 900,000 but late booking has become commonplace in the recession and the festival has successfully raised Pounds 770,000 in sponsorship, the same as last year. For the next three weeks the Scottish capital will fill with such performers as American dancers, German actors and Danish musicians among the thousands of participants in the largest arts festival in the world. The most persuasive of this year's four main themes at the festival is the music of Tchaikovsky, with 30 performances of his work, including the rarely-performed opera The Oprichnik. There will be an unprecedented concentration of Scottish music, from the 8th century to the present day. On the final evening of the festival, this will culminate with a performance by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra of James MacMillan's new Percussion Concerto written for Evelyn Glennie. After many years in which foreign drama has dominated the festival the main feature of the theatrical programme this year is the work of two neglected British playwrights, the Edwardian Harley Granville Barker, best known for The Madras House and The Voysey Inheritance, and the Glasgow born CP Taylor, who wrote Good and Walter. Other highlights include the first British performance of the Mark Morris Dance Group from the US and the first for 10 years of the Pina Bausch company from Germany, Andrei Serban's production of An Ancient Trilogy performed by his Romanian company in ancient Greek, and Elisabeth Soderstrom singing Poulenc's opera for solo voice, La Voix Humaine. The fringe festival this year threatens to be the largest ever with more than 1,100 different shows. The television and film festivals will also run alongside the main festival.</p>

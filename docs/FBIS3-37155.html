On the  airfield's runway he noted that friendly relations with Ukraine  have not yet been enshrined in law. Neither he nor Leonid  Kravchuk have not yet had any time for this owing to their own  big and acute problems. But both presidents are stressing the  importance of this treaty, which will certainly be signed.    As regards recent events in the Crimea, Ter-Petrosyan had  this to say: "God forbid that the Crimea turns into another  Karabakh."</p>

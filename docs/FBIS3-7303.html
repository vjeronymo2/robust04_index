Jonan Denki Co., which operates a discount store chain in  the  Tokyo area, said it plans to sell 29 tons of a popular domestic  rice brand harvested in Akita Prefecture, starting on Sunday.  The company said the agency asked it to call off the plan,  warning that selling rice without a government license will  constitute a violation of the Domestic Food Control Law.    Toshio Miyaji, president of the company, told reporters he  has no intention of changing the plan at present.</p>

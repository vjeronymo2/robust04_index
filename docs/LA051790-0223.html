			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Chocolate Contest -- A caption appearing in the May 3 Food section incorrectly  named the winners of a truffle contest held during the Chocolate Weekend at Le  Meridien in Newport Beach. According to Josseline Tamers of the hotel: "The  confection picturing Newport Beach Marina is the work of Yvan Valentin of  L'Orangerie in Los Angeles. The French chef received the top prize of $300  along with Russell Armstrong of Trees restaurant in Corona del Mar, who also  won first place for his truffle presentation."  </P></p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (15): China in the limelight - As Japan struggles to come to terms with its success, two other potential economic superpowers in the region are stirring / Asia WHILE Asia's most advanced economy is struggling to cope with the problems of success, the region's other giants are stirring. Economic reform is the fashion in most of the countries previously led by socialist-inspired bureaucracies. Notwithstanding Japan's problems, Asia stands out for its continued rapid economic growth. This year, China has again burst on to the scene. If its present growth rate is maintained its economy (though not per capita income) would be as large as that of the US within just over 20 years. That, as has already been seen since China embarked on the road to economic reform, is a big if. Since the changes spearheaded by Deng Xiaoping, China's 88-year-old senior leader, began in 1979 the economy has boomed and bust twice. Reforms generate bursts of economic activity as regions, businesses and individuals test out the new limits. They put tremendous pressure on the barriers which remain in the system, especially in the price system, and tend to push up inflation. This year has seen another such burst. In January, Mr Deng visited the southern coastal areas which are the showcase of Chinese reform, and urged the whole country to speed up its efforts to boost economic growth and change. His visit had a strongly political aspect. Mr Deng no longer has any official posts, but he was still engaged in a struggle for supremacy with more conservative hardliners who fear that over-rapid reform will loosen the Communist party's grip on power. Mr Deng believes growing prosperity is the party's best hope of keeping power - and the crushing of the 1989 demonstrations in Tienanmen Square showed that he, like the other leaders, was determined its position should remain unchallenged. It took two months for the media to report Mr Deng's visit to the most open and free area of China, only just over the border from Hong Kong. But when they did, his message was taken up with astonishing vigour throughout the country. The Tienanmen Square massacre had occurred just after the beginning of an economic austerity drive which responded to a reform-induced surge in inflation. This year, the tight reins on the economy could be relaxed. Credit became more free. Mr Deng's exhortations triggered a wave of competition between regions for greater freedom along the lines of the south's special economic zones. Industrial production and investment soared, as all types of enterprises sought to grow and as foreign investment, especially from overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Taiwan, poured in to the south. The official target for 1992 economic growth had been 6 per cent. But conservatives such as premier Li Peng have been forced to abandon it as the growth rate surged to 12 per cent in the first half of the year, compared with 7 per cent in the whole of 1991 and an average of 9 per cent since reforms began. Already, the planners in Beijing are worried about the economy overheating, even though official measures of inflation so far show little cause for alarm. An official newspaper, the Economic Information Daily, asked in early September: 'How long can our current fast speed of economic growth continue? When will the 'express train' turn into a 'slow train'? Will it be like 1989, when we had to use the emergency brakes?'. It pointed out: 'Our country has had 22 straight months of high economic growth. The pace of growth has prompted discussion both at home and abroad on whether the economy is overheated.' However, the government freed the prices of a number of key materials for manufacturing production from the beginning of September. Apart from a tightening of banks' reserve requirements, there is little sign yet of action to slow growth. The challenge which the government faces is central to the transformation away from a centrally planned economy to one in which the private sector is given much greater play: how to maintain macroeconomic control while at the same time loosening the restrictions on economic activity. The need is for sharper, more delicate tools, but less bureaucracy. China has already come a long way. Private sector activity accounts for more than half the economy. Though state-owned industry remains a huge burden on the budget, privately driven growth is progressively making it a smaller problem in relative terms. The region's other giant, India, has also undertaken a radical reform programme which has its friends excited that the country's massive economic potential could be released. Many of its problems were the same as China's: unprofitable state industries and banks and excessively bureaucratic central planning. Unlike the government in Beijing, however, that of prime minister PV Narasimha Rao has to change the direction of the economy in a domestic political cauldron, with many politicians and senior bureaucrats deeply suspicious of a policy which promotes the private sector. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has already abolished licensing - the need for bureaucratic approval for corporate investments - and started to dismantle the trade barriers and investment and currency restrictions which had isolated the economy. But he faces political challenges in reducing subsidies, cutting tariffs and privatising state-owned industries. A similar reform programme is under way in Pakistan, with licensing also abolished, all barriers to foreign investment discarded, and a rapid programme of privatisation under way. With communist Vietnam heading for a market economy, and Mongolia struggling to do so in the face of huge economic difficulties, there are few countries left in Asia whose economic policies espouse socialism (China's current catchphrase is 'socialist market economy'). China has been exerting pressure on North Korea, which still has a communist dictatorship, to go the same way. None of this yet threatens the other rapidly growing countries of south-east and north-east Asia directly. Hong Kong and Taiwan are full participants, through investment, in China's economic surge. But a continuation of convincing reforms in the former socialist economies may soon have a wider range of foreign manufacturers re-considering the location of new export-oriented factories.  ------------------------------------------------                     GDP GROWTH  ------------------------------------------------              1987    1988    1989   1990   1991  ------------------------------------------------ India         4.2    10.5     6.0    5.6    2.0 Pakistan      6.5     7.6     5.0    5.3    6.5 China        11.5    11.5     4.0    5.2    7.0 Vietnam               6.1     7.1    4.5    3.8 Mongolia      4.5     5.1     4.2   -2.1  -18.0  ------------------------------------------------ Source: Asian Development Bank  ------------------------------------------------</p>

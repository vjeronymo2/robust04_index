			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / People: Mounting an assault Steven Gerard, the new chief executive of Mountleigh, is used to the problems of over-borrowed companies - but from the other side of the desk. His experience stems from his stint as Citibank's senior managing director responsible for all credit, portfolio and risk management in Europe, North America, Japan and Australia. But the strong link between Mountleigh and Citibank - one of its lead banks - did not influence Gerard's decision, according to Mountleigh. Gerard sees Mountleigh as a 'company with significant economic value which is hampered by the well-documented problems in the property market and an inappropriate debt structure'. Indeed, Mountleigh has had a turbulent ride over the past few years as excessive borrowings and difficulties in making property sales hindered its ambitious plans. A Pounds 96m rescue rights issue last year sparked controversy because of its unconventional underwriting structure. Gerard aims to implement a 'strategically focused operating and financial plan which will be satisfactory to all creditors and which will result in maximising value for shareholders'. It would include unlocking the value in its property assets and in Galerias, the Spanish department stores. Now 46, Gerard joined Citibank in 1976 from the American stock exchange where he headed the securities division. At Citibank, he was also head of the national corporate finance division, head of the institutional recovery management group and national head of the leverage capital division.</p>

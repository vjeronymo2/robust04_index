			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Stitching up designers to use computers - In a nutshell Designers in the fields of clothing and textiles are under increasing pressure to create garments in response to rapid swings in fashion. Computer-aided design and manufacture (Cadcam) allows designers to experiment with new ideas before committing them to paper or sample and saves time spent painting up or altering sketches. Suggestions for how textile designers can make use of Cadcam are contained in a new booklet* produced by The Design Council. It contains information on systems available, price guidelines, suppliers and training and three case studies of how large and small manufacturers can employ Cadcam. Contact: The Design Council, 28 Haymarket, London SW1Y 4SU. 54 pages. Pounds 25.</p>

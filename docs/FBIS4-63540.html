			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian president Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin today  answered journalists' questions concerning the situation in  Crimea.    [Begin Yeltsin recording] I spoke with Ukraine President  Kravchuk yesterday. We discussed these issues. I gave a  warning and he promised that Ukraine will not use any force  whatsoever in Crimea. He promised me this, and we hope that the  president, a respectable person, will keep his promise. Crimea  is a sovereign republic and it has a right to make its own  decisions. And it will make those decisions--but it is vital  that neither we nor Ukraine should interfere. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Sales rise across most retail sectors THE ENCOURAGING rise in shop, store and supermarket sales last month was spread fairly evenly across all retail sectors, the Confederation of British Industry says in a report today. Clothing and footwear were the most buoyant sectors reported in this month's distributive trades survey, with a positive balance of 55 per cent in both categories reporting an improvement in sales. Neither sector expects the positive trend to be reversed in the near future. Clothing retailers forecast sales to be well above average this month, and most respondents in the footwear sector expect sales to be about average for the time of year. Sales of cars rose in July, reversing the falls reported in May and June. A positive balance of 8 per cent of traders in this category saw a rise in sales last month. Although a higher number of respondents expect to sell more vehicles this month, they do not think sales will match August's usual level. In the wholesale sector a positive balance of 35 per cent of respondents reported higher sales in the year to July - the fifth month of year-on-year increases. However, while sales have increased faster than orders, a larger number of wholesalers now consider stock levels to be excessive. The survey, conducted between July 20 and August 4, covered 15,000 outlets in retailing, wholesaling and the motor trades. Its findings also include: With orders placed by retailers with suppliers increasing at a slower rate than the volume of sales, fewer retailers reported excessive stock levels. A positive balance of 20 per cent of retailers felt stocks were excessive, down from 26 per cent last month. Mail order companies were the only category to report stock levels that exactly matched expected demand. For the eighth consecutive month grocers reported a sharp increase in sales compared with the previous year. A positive balance of 38 per cent expect sales to increase next month. Off-licences reported a further sharp fall in sales in the year to July. Sales in this sector have decreased every month since June last year. Booksellers and stationers had another month of healthy sales growth, with almost half of the respondents reporting an improvement. Chemists reported a sizeable increase in sales, but in spite of 12 months of almost continuous improvements, sales are still below normal. Sales of furniture and carpets increased in the year to July.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       BROAD BASED RETAIL GROWTH: REPORTED CHANGE IN SALES VOLUMES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Jul 92   Aug   Sept   Oct   Nov  Dec  Jan  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Retailing                   -15   -12     +4    -4    -9   -4  +11 Grocers                            +3     0     +1   +19    +2  +34  +44 Specialist food                   -54   -65    -50   -28   -24  -67  -11 Off-licences                       -3   -88   -100   -56   -47  -40  -49 Clothing                          -25   -27    +42    -8   -18   +2  +19 Footwear and Leather              -30   +68    +39   -49   +11  -11  +28 Durable household goods           -10    -2    -11    -1   -10  -18   -4 Furniture and carpets             -43   +33    +48   -12   +15   -3  -35 Hardware, china &amp; DIY             -28   -22    -52   +11   -38  -33   +6 Confectionery                     +26   -57    +37    +4     0  +21  -31 Booksellers &amp; stationers           -9   -18     -1   -39   -53  -39  -18 Chemists                          +36   +20    -28   +58   +79   +6  +66 Other retail                      +13    -5     +5   -23   -44  +20   +5 Motor traders                     -44   +15    -33   -30   -31   +3  +20  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Retailing                       +19   +25   +17   +18   +30   +32 Grocers                               +30   +42   +24   +21   +43   +38 Specialist food                       -13    -3   -31   +49   +18   +13 Off-licences                          -11   -24   -26   -35   -35   -23 Clothing                              +10   +27   +24    -1   +40   +55 Footwear and Leather                  +74   +37   +43   -55   +43   +55 Durable household goods                +5    +1   +23   +37   +10   +12 Furniture and carpets                 +48   +40   +27   +34   +54   +31 Hardware, china &amp; DIY                  +6   +46   +29    +3    -5   +10 Confectionery                         +12   +36   +10   +20    +3   +13 Booksellers &amp; stationers              -12    +4   +47   +46   +37   +49 Chemists                              +48   -12   +44   +27   +44   +44 Other retail                           +4   +30    -6   +11    +8   +14 Motor traders                         +30   +29    +2    -2    -6    +8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance = % reporting an increase minus % reporting a decrease in sales compared to a year ago  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

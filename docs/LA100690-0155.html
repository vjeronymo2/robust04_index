			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE;  </P> <P> RANCHO ALAMITOS' TRAMMELL RUNS FOR 244 YARDS, FOUR TOUCHDOWNS  </P> <P> It was a night for pageantry at the Rancho Alamitos High School homecoming game  Friday, so Vaquero tailback Ulysses Trammell decided to put on a show of his  own.  </P> <P> Trammell rushed for 244 yards in 20 carries and scored four touchdowns to lead  Rancho Alamitos over Kennedy, 34-12, in front of about 1,500 at Bolsa Grande  High School.  </P> <P> "Ulysses Trammell saved our bacon," Rancho Alamitos Coach Mark Miller said.  </P> <P> That he did.  </P> <P> The senior scored on a 60-yard run the first time he touched the ball and later  on runs of 52, one and 24 yards, breaking would-be tacklers numerous times. He  had 95 yards in six carries in the first half.  </P> <P> In fact, Rancho Alamitos (5-0 overall, 2-0 in league) could not come up with  much of an offensive output in the first half and held a 7-6 margin at  intermission.  </P> <P> The Vaqueros were stunned on Kennedy's first possession of the game when  quarterback John Guthrie connected with wide receiver Rod Rosales on a 51-yard  pass play to give the Fighting Irish the early lead with 8 minutes 34 seconds  left in the first period.  </P> <P> Rancho didn't help its cause by being penalized for 80 yards in the half.  </P> <P> But Trammell took control in the second half to bail out the Vaqueros.  </P> <P> He set up his second touchdown with a 26-yard run midway through the third  period and then ran the ball four times in a six-play drive a couple of minutes  later.  </P> <P> Kennedy (2-3, 0-2) could not capitalize on Rancho's penalties and had to settle  for only one more touchdown, on a five-yard pass from Guthrie to tailback Vince  Church with 5:31 remaining in the third quarter.  </P> <P> The Vaqueros wrapped up their scoring with a five-yard run by Leon Vickers  early in the final quarter.  </P> <P> Rancho held Church to 60 yards in 14 carries. Guthrie completed seven of 16  passes for 110 yards.  </P> <P> The victory almost proved costly for the Vaqueros, however. Senior  fullback/tackle Vince Otteman suffered what originally was believed to be  possible torn ligaments in a knee on his first carry of the game, but Vicki  McAdams, a physician's assistant at Kaiser Permanente in Anaheim, said the  injury was diagnosed as a knee strain.  </P></p>

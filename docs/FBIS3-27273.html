			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Feb. 19 (CNA) -- The main purpose of  President Li Teng-hui's recent informal visit to Southeast Asia  was to demonstrate the Republic of China [ROC]'s desire to play  an active and constructive role in the international community,  a Presidential Office spokesman said Saturday.    "President Li expressed Taiwan's intention to share its  experience in economic development with other countries during  his three-country Southeast Asia tour," Raymond Tai, deputy  secretary-general to the president, explained at a forum  sponsored by the CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY.    Tai said Li's visit was also aimed at promoting trade and  economic cooperation with Taiwan's neighboring countries.    "The president hoped to find new regional cooperation fields  through his visit to The Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand,"  noted Tai who accompanied Li on his Feb. 9-16 visit, also billed  as a "vacation trip."    Speaking on the same occasion, opposition legislator Lu  Hsiu-yi praised Li's pragmatic attitude in expanding Taiwan's  international presence.    "Albeit unofficial," Lu said, "the eight-day visit has  spotlighted Taiwan's existence, which Beijing has persistently  tried to ignore or deny."    "Li's effort to promote economic cooperation with Southeast  Asian nations also complies with the post-Cold War world trend,"  Lu noted. Regional economic cooperation is the catchword in  today's international relations.    "It is a correct strategy for Taiwan to strengthen economic  ties with Southeast Asian nations as a way to balance its  rapidly growing investment in Mainland China which remains  hostile toward Taipei," Lu added.    Jeffrey Ku, chairman of Chinatrust Commercial Bank and a  dollar-a-year adviser to the cabinet, said at the CNA forum that  Li's Southeast Asia visit would help encourage more Taiwan  industrialists to invest in the region.    Ku, also a member on Li's entourage, said Beijing had tried  every possible means to block Li's unofficial visit. "We quietly  swallowed all disgrace on many occasions in order to accomplish  our task," Ku recalled.    "Li's low profile and sincerity have won him friendship and  respect of political leaders in the three countries, including  Philippine President Fidel Ramos, Indonesian President Suharto  and Thai King Phumiphon Adunyadet," Ku observed.    The business tycoon added he believes that following Li's  visit, the three countries will take gradual steps to improve  services for Taiwan investors.</p>

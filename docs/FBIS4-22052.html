			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 8 Mar [date as received]  (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio  announced today that he will act with a "firm hand" against the  terrorists, whom he labelled "Neanderthals" who started a wave  of political violence in the country. He also dismissed the  possibility of decreeing a state of emergency.    "Unfortunately, there are people in Guatemala who think like  Neanderthals, and for many years they have fought ideas with  bullets, not with words," he said. Upon reiterating his  condemnation of the murder of Constitutional Court President  Epaminondas Gonzalez on 1 April and the attack against Deputy  Obdulio Chinchilla on Wednesday, De Leon emphasized that he is  "worried" about the recent violence.    "The government rejects any kind of violence and will act  strongly to counter it," the president told reporters. He added  that security forces have been given precise instructions to get  to the bottom of their investigations and find the people  responsible for Gonzalez' murder and the attack against  Chinchilla.    De Leon pointed out that Guatemala must enter without  further  delay a phase of reconciliation to stop the violence and the  civil war that began in 1960 so it can achieve welfare and  social development. The president asked the groups causing the  violence to reconsider and reflect on the "serious damage" they  are doing the country through their actions. "It is not  violence but dialogue that will solve our problems," the  president emphasized. [passage omitted]</p>

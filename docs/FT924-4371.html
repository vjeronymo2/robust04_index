			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Brazil calls off talks with IMF BRAZIL has called off crucial talks with the International Monetary Fund because of 'uncertainties over economic policy'. The planning and economy ministers and central bank governor had been due to leave for Washington on Saturday to try to revive an IMF accord signed in January which collapsed because of Brazil's failure to meet targets. However, their trip was cancelled after a Brazil congressional commission delayed its decision on a Dollars 12bn fiscal reform programme essential for balancing next year's government budget. The cancellation is the strongest sign yet of the disarray within the government of President Itamar Franco who took office two months ago as a result of the impeachment of President Fernando Collor. Failure to secure an IMF accord could jeopardise Brazil's accord with creditors over restructuring of its Dollars 44bn commercial debt.</p>

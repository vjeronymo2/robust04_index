			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Shephard emphasises help for job-seekers A TOTAL OF 60,000 career development loans are to be made available over the next three years, Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, announced yesterday. This is part of the government's strategy of focusing resources on practical help for job-seekers, she told MPs. During a Labour-originated debate on unemployment, Mrs Shephard also said an extra 180,000 new places were to be provided next year in Jobclubs and on the Job Interview Guarantee Scheme. Job Review Workshops will get an additional 10,000 places. The figures confirm, as indicated last month at the time of the Autumn Statement, that the government intends to target a greater proportion of overall funds on such non-training initiatives. Expenditure on training programmes is to suffer a cut in real terms of 3 per cent. Running the gauntlet of a string of Labour MPs making interventions on specific plant closures, Mrs Shephard said the career development loans  - which are provided by the clearing banks with the government paying interest until training has been completed - would be available for people in and out of work. The government's focus in drawing up its plans was on individuals in greatest need and measures that had proved themselves successful, she said. 'We will give priority to those measures which help people the most.' Opening the debate, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, placed his emphasis on training, claiming that the government's training budget per unemployed person was less than half of what it had been only 'three short years ago.' Statistics showed the unemployed stood less of a chance of getting a job if they had been on employment training than if they had not, Mr Dobson argued. The Autumn Statement had been 'so feeble' that Ms Shephard and her colleagues had refused to estimate how many jobs it might create. Mr Dobson strengthened his plea for a long-term and Europe-wide commitment to 'aim for full employment', arguing that mass unemployment was a threat not only to the cohesion of the European Community but to 'democracy itself'. 'Getting Europe back to work should have been top of the agenda for the summit in Edinburgh' rather than 'theological' arguments about abstract concepts like subsidiarity, he said.</p>

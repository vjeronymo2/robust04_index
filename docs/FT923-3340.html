			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Smith faces party unrest on Europe: Senior Labour MPs add to strong criticisms of Maastricht accords MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday faced renewed and outspoken statements on Europe by some of the party's senior spokesmen. The economic criticism of the Maastricht treaty and the European exchange rate mechanism, continued yesterday to be the theme of Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow heritage secretary. High exchange rates were 'throttling' industry by pricing British goods and jobs out of the market, he said at a conference in Neath, south Wales. 'It is in these circumstances that we are invited to make the straitjacket permanent and to place it beyond political debate or action by signing up for the Maastricht treaty. 'It almost beggars belief that we are now invited to hand over our economic policy to unaccountable bankers who are instructed by the treaty to give overriding priority to price stability above all other economic goals and who would require massive cuts in public spending at a time of deep recession. Mr Gould warned of a risk of entrenching as a permanent feature of European life the policies that have created the worst recession in two generations. 'No wonder the people of Europe are rebelling against their leaders,' he added. Labour scepticism on Europe will be bolstered today by a warning from Mr David Blunkett, another shadow cabinet member, that enthusiasm for further European integration could risk an increase in racism and fascism in the UK. Other Labour MPs, including Mr John Morris, the shadow attorney-general, yesterday added their voices to those calling for a British referendum on Maastricht. While Labour's leadership has come under fire for lacking a clear position on Maastricht and for not bringing the Euro-sceptics back into line, party officials say there is little to be gained by refining the party's policy until after the French referendum. Labour's line both on Maastricht and on the ERM in the circumstances after the French decision will be thrashed out at the meetings of the national executive committee, Labour's ruling body, and the shadow cabinet in the week before the start of the party conference in Blackpool at the end of the month. Mr Smith has already made clear that he does not favour a referendum. After a week in which Labour Euro-sceptics have, unusually, been more vocal than their Tory counterparts, the issue has gathered steam in the run-up to Labour's conference. The forthcoming elections to the national executive committee are also thought by some at Westminster to have contributed to the higher profile of the Euro-sceptics. Labour officials played down the MPs' statements, arguing that, for example, Mr Gould's stance on the ERM was well known and had not found much support during his unsuccessful challenge for the party leadership. Mr Blunkett's call today is for European policy to take a new direction, in order to 'root out racism'.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN BACKER HELPED KILL THRIFT PLAN;  </P> <P> BANKING: LEAGUE OF SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE LIMITED RISKY  INVESTMENTS.  </P> <P> Working on behalf of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, Gov. George Deukmejian's top  political fund-raiser participated in a behind-the-scenes effort in 1985 that  killed a proposed regulation that would have limited the kinds of risky  investments that contributed to the thrift's failure, The Times has learned.  </P> <P> Los Angeles attorney Karl Samuelian, Deukmejian's campaign finance chairman,  joined other prominent supporters of the governor at a November, 1985, meeting  in the office of then-Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale in an  effort to persuade the lawmaker to fight the proposed industry-backed  regulation.  </P> <P> Also at the meeting were Deukmejian's former savings and loan commissioner,  Lawrence W. Taggart, and San Diego financier Tom Stickel, a top GOP fund-raiser  and a gubernatorial appointee to the board of trustees for the state university  system.  </P> <P> At the meeting, officials of the California League of Savings Institutions --  trying to clean up its own industry -- sought Nolan's endorsement for a  regulation restricting risky direct investments in real estate, stocks and junk  bonds by state-chartered thrifts. But the opposition to their proposal by  Nolan, Stickel and Taggart was so strong that the League simply backed down and  abandoned its effort, industry officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> "We just felt whipped," recalled Jerry Barrone, then the chairman of the League  and president of Coast Savings in Los Angeles, who attended the meeting.  </P> <P> Barrone said he had not known who Samuelian was before the meeting, nor was  Deukmejian's name ever mentioned in discussing the regulation. In fact, he  said, Samuelian was relatively quiet during the discussion. But, in the middle  of the meeting, a Nolan staffer interrupted the session to tell Samuelian that  the governor had telephoned him and he needed to return the call.  </P> <P> Samuelian could not be reached for comment but his attorney confirmed he  attended the meeting.  </P> <P> "There was a call from Karl's secretary saying that the governor was trying to  reach him," Robert S. Draper, Samuelian's attorney, said. Although Samuelian  was representing Lincoln at the meeting, "the call had nothing to do with (the  investment issue)," Draper said.  </P> <P> However, Barrone remembers suspecting at the time that the interruption was  done for effect. "We thought it was done for saber-rattling purposes," he said,  to show that "these people were in with the governor."  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Deukmejian emphatically denied any knowledge of efforts by  Lincoln and its owner, Charles H. Keating Jr., to pressure his Administration  into approving expansion of its high-risk investments and authorizing bond  sales of its parent corporation, American Continental Corp.  </P> <P> In April of this year, American Continental declared bankruptcy and federal  regulators took over operations of the thrift. It has been estimated that  Lincoln's collapse could cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion.  </P> <P> In the wake of the American Continental bankruptcy this year, Samuelian was  among a long list of people associated with the company who were named in a  series of lawsuits filed on behalf of 23,000 investors in the Irvine-based  thrift. The investors, many of them Southern California retirees, claim to have  lost $250 million.  </P> <P> Keating and his thrift have been heavy contributors to Deukmejian and Nolan --  as well as many major politicians of both parties. Keating, his business  enterprises and associates have contributed an estimated $189,000 to  Deukmejian's campaign committees and at least $20,000 to Nolan.  </P> <P> Nolan was the author of 1982 legislation that lifted restrictions on savings  and loans investments. The purpose was to make the thrifts more competitive  with banks.  </P> <P> But as increasing numbers of savings institutions began to fail, the industry  itself sought regulations to ensure the safety of its investments. It proposed  that State Savings and Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford adopt a rule  limiting high-risk investments to 20% of an institution's holdings.  </P> <P> However, Nolan said Thursday that he was fearful that the California League  proposal would be too restrictive and would not get at problems of poorly  managed savings and loans. "I had strong feelings that arbitrary regulations  wouldn't help, that they would hurt the good (savings) associations," Nolan  said.  </P> <P> The assemblyman said he convened a meeting at his office at the industry's  request, but also invited Deukmejian fund-raiser Stickel and former Savings and  Loan Commissioner Taggart to state their objections to the proposal. Confronted  with opposition to their proposal from the Assembly Minority Leader and  influential political allies of Deukmejian, the industry withdrew its proposal.  </P> <P> "The feeling was we got beat up pretty well at this meeting and we wouldn't get  anywhere with such a strong groundswell of opposition," Barrone said.  </P> <P> After the meeting, Nolan said, he called Commissioner Crawford to argue against  the proposed regulations. Crawford ultimatedly scuttled the proposal, but  contended that he did it at the request of the League, not because of Nolan's  call.  </P> <P> Stickel's opposition to the proposed regulation came less than a year after his  company, TCS Enterprises, went public and Lincoln bought 19% of its stock for  $2.9 million. Stickel had also hired Taggart as an executive, who was acting as  a paid consultant to Keating.  </P> <P> Stickel said he tried to ensure that Nolan's 1982 legislation was not tampered  with and that regulators "were very careful before they revised the laws in any  way that restricted savings and loans from doing business the way it had to be  conducted in the 1980s to survive."  </P> <P> In addition to Lincoln's investment in TCS, the Irvine-based thrift had a  further tie with Stickel's fledgling San Diego company, which pulled off an  industry coup by hiring Taggart after his resignation as the state's savings  and loan commissioner. Lincoln paid TCS an additional $200,000 in 1985 to use  Taggart's consulting services on industry and regulatory matters, Stickel said.  </P> <P> Stickel said Thursday that his opposition to the proposed 20% regulation was  "absolutely not" connected to the fact that Lincoln was the second largest  investor in TCS Enterprises.  </P> <P> But the San Diego Republican, who was one of those considered by Deukmejian for  appointment to the state treasurer's seat vacated by the death of Jesse Unruh,  conceded that he sometimes did favors for Keating and his company.  </P> <P> "Charlie Keating's political reach, in retrospect, was phenomenal," Stickel  said Thursday. "And I wasn't the only one taken in as it relates to being an  advocate for Charlie Keating. I had no reason -- in 1985, 1986, 1987 -- not to  be.  </P> <P> "People from his office would call me with concerns and if I shared their  concerns, I could be an advocate on their behalf," said Stickel. "If I ran into  a state assemblyman here or a state senator there -- and I am obviously a  Republican activist -- and, if given the chance to talk about issues relevant  to savings and loans and deregulations, I probably would have been off of the  same page as Charlie Keating."  </P> <P> Stickel said there was only one time when Keating himself asked the San Diego  financier for a favor.  </P> <P> "There was a prominent savings and loan executive who Charlie Keating wanted to  meet and I tried to put them together but the other executive said 'no,' "  Stickel said.  </P> <P> Stickel said he was not going to be an "apologist" for Keating, now the center  of several lawsuits, investigations and Congressional hearings.  </P> <P> "It's pushing the clock back four years ago and Monday morning quarterbacking,  but in 1985, I had no reason to believe that Charlie Keating was nothing other  than a good and well-intentioned businessman," Stickel said.  </P></p>

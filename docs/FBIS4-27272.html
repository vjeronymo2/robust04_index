			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The Justice Ministry and  Japan's largest lawyers' group launched a panel Wednesday [1  June] to study U.S. and European calls to allow foreign lawyers  to represent foreign firms in Japan as an arbitrator in reaching  out-of-court settlements of business disputes.    The panel, the study group on international arbitration  representation, called its first meeting attended by  representatives from the ministry and the Japan Federation of  Bar Associations (JFBA), JFBA officials said. The panel is  commissioned to come up with recommendations for legislative  changes needed to authorize foreign lawyers to represent firms  in Japan involved in business disputes and also citizens  involved in international disputes on business contracts and  products, they said.    The Code of Civil Procedures of Japan recognizes the legal  validity of out-of-court settlements of business disputes just  as the validity of court rulings are upheld. However, the  code's article 801 says when certain firms are represented by an  agent whose qualifications do not derive from Japanese law,  related parties are empowered to demand the cancellation of an  out-of-court settlement.    The United States and the European Union have been urging  Japan to alleviate such curbs so that foreign lawyers can  legally represent firms doing business with partners in Japan in  seeking dispute settlements.    The ministry and the JFBA compiled and submitted to the Diet  an amendment bill that would lift some restrictions on foreign  lawyers who wish to practice law in Japan. The panel aims to  produce specific legislative recommendations in response to an  earlier ministry-JFBA joint report that called for "moving  toward amending the system to expedite further liberalization"  on the issue of international arbitration, ministry officials  said.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Caught up in negative sentiment - International Japanese government bonds have not remained unscathed amid the recent turmoil in international bond markets, but have been caught up in the negative sentiment stemming from rising US interest rates. Long-term yields have risen to five-month highs, and although investors have expected weakness in the bond market ahead of the March year-end book closing, where institutional investors lock profits on their portfolios to shore up earnings, this year the decline has been exacerbated by worries of extra supply and hopes of an imminent economic recovery. The yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark, which breached 3 per cent to a record low at the beginning of January, rose briefly above the 4 per cent mark last week for the first time since September last year. Deteriorating investor confidence was also highlighted by the failure of last week's 10-year bond auction, where the average accepted price was 97.38, the second lowest on record. Such weakness in sentiment comes as activity slows ahead of the business year end. After an eight-month rally, investors rushed to realise profits, and few have been willing to buy bonds to take on new positions. The low trading volumes have made the bond market vulnerable to small-lot selling. On top of seasonal trading, worries of over-supply, triggered by the government's Y9,400bn economic package and Y5,850bn tax cut announced last month, have weighed down on the bond market. New bond issues by the central government for this fiscal year to the end of this month have risen by 52.5 per cent from initial plans to Y12,400bn, while bond issuance by municipal governments, initially slated at Y10,350bn, has increased by 30.4 per cent to Y13,500bn. For the next fiscal year to March 1995, the central government is planning to issue a total of Y13,640bn in bonds, a 10 per cent rise from the previous year, of which Y3,130bn will be in deficit financing bonds - which have not been issued for five years. On the municipal level, bond issuance is expected to rise by 9 per cent to Y14,730bn, of which Y1,650bn in deficit financing bonds, the first issued since 1976. While fears of additional supply are expected to be absorbed by the third quarter, uncertainty over the economy has shaken bond investors, as recent economic indicators have spurred hopes of a long-overdue economic recovery. Industrial production figures for January announced last week were stronger than previous forecasts by both private sector economists and the government's preliminary indications. Industrial output grew by 0.9 per cent from the previous month with the inventory to shipment ratio easing from a peak in December. Labour statistics for January were also encouraging, with the ratio of job offers to applicants rising for the first time since March 1991. Most investors also interpreted the Tankan, or quarterly survey on business sentiment, which indicated a sideways movement in sentiment, as reflecting a bottoming out of conditions surrounding the corporate sector. Sentiment levels were largely unchanged from the previous survey, with manufacturing sentiment remaining at -56, and non-manufacturing sentiment rising to -46 from -47. The level of confidence varied from sector to sector. Sentiment within the electric machinery sector, for example, rose to -53 from -63 and the retail sector posted an improvement to -60 from -65. However, many economists are loath to call a near-term recovery just on the recent economic figures. 'We know that the economy is indeed in a trough, but we don't know whether it's going to go sideways or headed for a V-shaped recovery,' says Mr Dick Beason, economist at brokers James Capel in Tokyo. The Tankan, for example, indicated that business conditions at small companies, usually leading indicators turning points in the economy, remained grim. Confidence at small manufacturers fell to -48 from -45, while they expect to cut capital spending by 32.3 per cent next business year, and predict financial conditions to remain tight. The sluggish business conditions, on top of a rise in the yen and mounting trade tensions between the US and Japan, have been a concern for the Bank of Japan, which has kept a wary eye on the recent rise in long-term yields. In an attempt to curb some of the upward pressure on interest rates, it has lowered the overnight call rate by 25 basis points to 2.125 per cent, cutting the yield spread between the official discount rate to a record low. Some traders hope the money market manoeuvers by the central bank is a prelude to a discount rate cut. 'The odds of an ODR reduction are higher than markets currently expect,' says Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. It believes that a discount rate cut of 25 to 50 basis points during the second quarter is possible. Although a discount rate cut will lift Japanese government bonds, an improvement in international sentiment towards bond markets is essential for a full fledged recovery. Mr Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International in London, believes that once the US Treasury market revives, the Japanese 10-year benchmark will reach 3 per cent by the summer.</p>

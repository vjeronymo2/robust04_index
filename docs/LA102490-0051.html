			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW ROSE QUEEN QUICKLY FACES A COMPOSURE TEST  </P> <P> Seconds after being named Tuesday to preside over the 1991 Tournament of Roses  parade, Cara Payton Rullman, 17, faced her first test of composure as Rose  Queen.  </P> <P> As the other six Rose Court finalists clustered around Rullman to congratulate  her, finalist Tisha Mei-Lin Kong -- apparently overcome by the emotions of the  moment -- fainted in Rullman's arms.  </P> <P> (  </P> <P> "What do we do now?" Rullman said. "This wasn't rehearsed."  </P> <P> But Kong recovered quickly and a smiling, yet startled, Rullman calmly turned  around to pose for photographers.  </P> <P> The ceremony -- with its small moment of drama -- capped a month of competition  among more than 700 San Gabriel Valley girls who vied for the title of the 73rd  Rose Queen. Rullman, a San Marino High School senior and member of the varsity  cheering squad, was selected to lead the 101st Rose Parade on New Year's day.  </P> <P> The parade theme, "Fun 'n' Games," mirrored the lighthearted approach with  which Rullman entered the contest. About 35 of her San Marino friends competed,  including Kong, a friend since the fourth grade, Rullman said.  </P> <P> Rullman lives in San Marino with her father, George; her mother, Linda; her  19-year-old sister, Courtney, and 12-year-old brother, Chas.  </P> <P> Rullman said she hopes to pursue a college degree in early childhood education.  </P> <P> For now, she wants to catch up on schoolwork missed during the weeks of Rose  Queen competition.  </P> <P> Rullman also planned to visit her brother, hospitalized after a weekend  accident in the San Gabriel Mountains. He broke his wrist on a Boy Scout hike.  </P> <P> "He was supposed to be here today and he has been at all the other events,"  Rullman said. "I've been thinking about him a lot."  </P></p>

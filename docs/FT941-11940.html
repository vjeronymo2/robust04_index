			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / IMF warning on further Russian loans The International Monetary Fund yesterday promised that its mission to Moscow would be open-minded in economic policy talks with the government, but warned that it would not be easy to agree to further loans. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said the mission, which began work yesterday and is expected to remain in Moscow for two to three weeks, would listen to the plans of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin's government, and would 'try to be helpful'. However, the IMF's willingness to release the next Dollars 1.5bn loan for which Russia could qualify under the fund's special facility for former Communist countries was 'not a foregone conclusion,' he said. From what the IMF had heard so far, the new government appeared to be diverging from the reform path agreed with the previous one. Mr Camdessus warned that efforts to reduce inflation and stabilise the rouble would not succeed for long without strong monetary and budget policies, but he refused to dismiss out of hand Mr Chernomyrdin's suggestion that the Russian government would try non-monetary ways of controlling inflation. 'If it means they will be stronger in bringing down the budget deficit, this is music to our ears.' But IMF officials said they were concerned that the new government appeared to be ready to let its inflation target slip back to 18 per cent a month by the end of 1994, compared with a rate of 12 per cent in December. They acknowledged, however, that the latter rate had been achieved in part by limiting the government's borrowing from the central bank by not paying its bills. Some of the accumulated arrears would have to be paid in the first quarter, probably bringing inflation back to a monthly rate of near 20 per cent, said the head of the IMF's Russia department. Mr Camdessus fiercely defended the fund against charges of being too insensitive in its dealings with Russia or too strict in the conditions it imposed. 'We are the scapegoat,' he complained, insisting that if the international community wanted to give unconditional aid to Russia, the money should come from bilateral grants. He acknowledged that the IMF had only lent a total of Dollars 2.5bn to Russia so far, rather than the Dollars 14bn announced in separate packages by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. 'We were unable to disburse more because we must respect our rules,' he said. He pointed out that western donors had delivered Dollars 20bn of the Dollars 21bn promised by the G7, and that official and commercial debt rescheduling, as well as money provided by Germany to rehouse Russian troops, brought the total of external financial assistance to Dollars 58bn.

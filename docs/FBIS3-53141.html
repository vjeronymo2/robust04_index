[Sha'th] Our return to Taba was aimed at achieving progress.  We are not here to gain time or waste time. We are here to  conclude the final agreement as soon as possible. Progress is  faster on the level of Civil Administration and the transfer of  civilian authority than it is on the level of security issues,  which will take a long time and need intensive talks. We are  doing just that. We have been discussing this all day today  inside the drafting committees. I think it is possible to  achieve progress and it is not a question of me being more  optimistic or pessimistic than others, the question is  commitment. We were committed to end these negotiations on 13  December. There has been a delay for various reasons, but we  are now back to where we were on 12 December, the little  progress achieved in Cairo and Strasbourg notwithstanding. So  why should this work take so much time? We have to finish this  job as quickly as possible. Two or three weeks are more than  enough provided there is a political will to finish this job at  the necessary time.    [Abu-Zayid] Have you sensed such a will and a desire on the  Israeli side?    [Sha'th] In fact, the head of the Israeli delegation,  General Shahaq, has expressed optimism and stressed the need to  reach agreement as soon as possible. I have not heard anything  to the contrary from him. However, we hear statements from  officials in Israel that are different from what we here from  the negotiating team. I hope these statements are not aimed at  exerting pressure. We should be pressing to end the work and not  to postpone it.    [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: What about the border  crossings problem?    [Sha'th] The border crossings issue is one of the special  and important problems that have taken so much of our time. I  think we can reach a solution to this problem that will meet our  aspirations and realize national and individual dignity for the  Palestinian citizens, as well as security for Israel and for us.  I think we will reach agreement on this issue.    [Abu-Zayid] Has there been any progress in this regard?    [Sha'th] I believe there was some progress indeed. But we  have not yet reached an agreement that we can sign.    [Abu-Zayid] And what about the size of Jericho?    [Sha'th] We still at the same point where we left off in  Cairo. Of course, we hope there will be progress and I do not  see why there shouldn't be progress. The Jericho problem can be  discussed as part of the immediate problems, to which we give  special attention in these talks.    [Abu-Zayid] Israeli sources reportedly said the Palestinians  have dropped the Jericho area demand...    [Sha'th, interrupting and chuckling] I have heard that and  that Mr. Glusca, to whom this statement was attributed, has  disassociated himself from this position. This was communicated  to me by General Shahaq, head of the Israeli negotiating team.  For my part, I deny that any agreement has been reached on that  score.    [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Are the Palestinians willing  to let the settlements remain in the self-rule area?    [Sha'th] The Declaration of Principles reached in Oslo and  signed in Washington provided for the settlements to remain.  This in no way means we approve of the settlements. It means  the fate of the settlements will await the negotiations on the  final status of the occupied land. For the moment, the sticking  point holding up the signing of an agreement is the exact area  of these settlements. The Israeli side shares our position that  the defense and security of the settlements must come from  within these outposts. There remains the problem, though, of a  definition of the settlements' boundaries.</p>

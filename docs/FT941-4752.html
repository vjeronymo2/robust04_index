			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / HK reform bill faces tough debate The second and final stage of governor Chris Patten's democratic reforms for Hong Kong, containing many of the more controversial elements that failed to win Beijing's approval after 17 rounds of negotiations, was introduced into the colony's Legislative Council (LegCo) yesterday. The bill which, among other proposals, gives the colony's 2.7m-strong workforce a second vote through the creation of nine new functional constituencies (industry-based groupings) replacing corporate votes with votes cast by individual employees, is expected to have a stormy ride through LegCo even in the absence of a further outburst from China. While Beijing itself has already made clear that it views the move as a unilateral step by Britain and therefore one which brings to an end co-operation between the two over the future of Hong Kong, and has further said it will unwind representative bodies on resuming sovereignty, LegCo members are also lining up for battle. Some believe the proposals do not go far enough; others will push for a watered down version. However, with the bill designed to prepare the way for elections this year, there will also be pressure to move swiftly. Legislation would need to be enacted before LegCo's summer recess in July to allow the administration to put in place the practical preparations for the elections, the government said. The government believes the proposals will lead to fair and open elections, and that broadening the franchise will strengthen the credibility of the functional constituency system. However, Mr CM Leung, deputy secretary for constitutional affairs, conceded it was still in a state of evolution. 'The system is not perfect,' he said. If the bill is passed, all adults aged 18 or above and registered in the electoral roll will be able to cast votes in up to two categories: their geographical constituency and their functional constituency. Non-working groups such as housewives will be restricted to a single vote. In addition to introducing nine new functional constituencies, four existing professional groups will be expanded. By scrapping corporate voting - whereby one authorised person casts votes on behalf of his company - the government claims it will rid the colony of the problem of multiple voting, which occurs when one director controls a number of companies and hence a number of votes. The first-past-the-post voting system will be adopted for all bar three functional constituencies, where the preferential elimination system will be retained in view of their smaller franchises.</p>

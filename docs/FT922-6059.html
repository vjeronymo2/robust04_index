			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Violence sparks fears of summer rioting: The background to clashes with the police in Coventry POLICE in Coventry are analysing extensive video footage and expect over the next few days to make more arrests after a series of clashes with youths a fortnight ago and over the three days of the holiday weekend. So far, 75 arrests have been made. Outbreaks of violence in Coventry, involving the stoning of police, attacks on fire engines, the use of petrol bombs, arson and stealing, have aroused fears in the Midlands and elsewhere that UK cities may be poised for a lawless summer. Mr Robert Ainsworth, Labour MP for Coventry North-East, where some of the disorder erupted, told the Commons in his maiden speech: 'Our cities are in great danger.' Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas, told a recent Birmingham conference: 'Companies cannot afford to ignore the problems of economic regeneration in their local communities.' The Coventry areas where the clashes took place are quite different. Wood End, scene of the first clash of youths with police, is an outer-city council estate of low-rise homes, notorious locally for its decay in human and physical terms. Hillfields, where there was disorder last weekend, is an inner-city area where the unemployment rates are the highest in Coventry and housing conditions are described by the city council as 'the worst in the city'. The two areas have poverty in common. Although half the Hillfields population is black, neither of the series of disturbances pitted one racial community against another. Rather, youths, white in Wood End, both white and black in Hillfields, have been attacking the symbols of authority. To that extent the outbreaks were similar, although they do not seem to have been connected. The gap in time between the series of incidents in Wood End and Hillfields did not suggest that one series set off the other. The catalyst for the disorder at Wood End is clear: the police made one of their periodic forays to stop illegal motorcycle riding through the estate and met resistance. At Hillfields, there was no clear reason for the outbreak, although recently the police have been acting against drugs and prostitution and therefore might be said to have been attacking local vested interests. In both cases the delicacy of the police position was clear. The police had to be seen to be acting against local lawbreaking, if only to dissipate pressures from residents to set up their own vigilante groups. Once attacked, the police, from their own point of view, had to react: there could not be a no-go area where the police writ did not run. If the police came down too hard, though, there was the chance that the antagonism of the youths - gangs of up to 40 in Hillfields and more than double that number in Wood End - would be exacerbated, thus storing up trouble for other warm nights. For the moment the question of authority seems to be resolved. In Hillfields yesterday police patrolling was normal and in Wood End the motorcycling terrorism has abated. Yet the question of why the authority should be contested, why the youths are so antagonistic, remains. Mostly the youths are unemployed or truants. There is an established coincidence between lawlessness on the one hand and unemployment and deprivation on the other. A Coventry City Council report on Wood End last year noted high levels of family breakdown, of child neglect and of debt. More recently the council has stated that in Hillfields, a district which has suffered 'substantial economic decline' and where there is 'limited access to jobs and higher education', the crime levels 'are among the highest in the city'.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RECESSION, MOST WOULD SAY, IS ALREADY BEING FELT;  </P> <P> MARRI'S CUSTOMERS 'WORRIED ABOUT TOMORROW'  </P> <P> Isaac Alexander is a co-owner of Marri's Pizza and Italian Restaurant, a block  from Disneyland in Anaheim. During summer, tourists generate most of the  28-year-old restaurant's business.  </P> <P> The restaurant has relied heavily on word-of-mouth and repeat business. Now,  however, Marri's is considering advertising to attract customers.  </P> <P>  "With people from town, we're doing OK. But with out-of-towners, business has  dropped 40% or more, easily.  </P> <P> "I was hoping (business) was going to pick up, . . . but with what's going on  overseas, with the banks, I don't think it's going to pick up.  </P> <P> "Customers are looking at the prices first. Before, they ordered despite the  price. We even have to lower prices in order for people to come in and eat. We  started to put a special two-for-one (meal) out. We never had done that before.  When you have high quality you don't have to do that.  </P> <P> "We used to sell a lot of wine. Every two weeks we used to order to 15 cases.  Now, for the last 1 1/2 months or so, it's been maybe five cases.  </P> <P> "Customers who used to come in every day now come only twice or three times a  week. They say, 'It's not your food . . . (but) everybody has to start cutting  down. . . .' They're worried about tomorrow. They're fearing for tomorrow."  GREG JOHNSON  </P></p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hagemeyer ahead 21% at Fl 103m HAGEMEYER, the Dutch-based trading company that is 65 per cent-owned by First Pacific of Hong Kong, yesterday reported a 21 per cent jump in 1992 net profit to Fl 103.1m (Dollars 55.7m) and a 5.6 per cent rise in its dividend to Fl 6.00. The company also announced plans for a two-for-one share split and an increase in authorised share capital to Fl 470m from Fl 290m. It added that it had no immediate plans for a share issue. Hagemeyer, which focuses on selling and distributing brand-name consumer and professional products, attributed the strong gain to its wholesale electro-technical subsidiaries and to its North American consumer electronic activities. Sales and profits from consumer and professional electronics were unchanged from 1991. Overall, turnover rose by 15.3 per cent to Fl 3.4bn and would have shown a 18.5 per cent increase but for exchange rate movements.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD economic affairs expert Uwe Jens, by </F> Rolf-Dietrich Schwartz; place and date not given: "`The Cake Has  To Get Bigger'"]    [Text] After the economic resolutions at the Weisbadener  party congress of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]  in November 1993, party experts and the voters are waiting for  the announced "financial framework" to pay for the demands.  Rolf-Dietrich Schwartz, Bonn correspondent of the FRANKFURTER  RUNDSCHAU, asked SPD economic expert Uwe Jens how the plans of  the party's top people can be fulfilled "without making any  promises that cannot be kept."    [Schwartz] Mr. Jens, you have difficulties in your own ranks  with an initiative of the parliamentary group for more growth  and employment. Why are there suddenly doubts about these  classic demands of your party?    [Jens] I am certainly in agreement with the basic position  of  the party leaders that we should promise only what we can pay  for. My motion, which is also supported by the financial,  social, and economic politicians of my parliamentary group, is  now held up in the SPD presidium and hopefully it can soon be  debated once again in the parliamentary group. I am very much in  favor of cooperation between the parliamentary group and the  party, but naturally we must not let things get too bogged down.  There is a need for discussion, because the fight against  unemployment costs something. But we have also made some  proposals on financing, among other things, the elimination of  tax subsidies and the reduction of administrative hierarchies.    [Schwartz] Put simply: Would your party leaders have  preferred to see the experts of your parliamentary group also  suspend their work until the elections?    [Jens] Naturally I hope not. My economic motion was intended  to force the Bundestag into a comprehensive debate. It is, after  all, a specific formulation of our resolutions at the party  congress. It aims at a national employment pact involving  consolidation of state finances and lowering of the short-term  Bundesbank interest rates, in which the parties in wage  agreements would have to be satisfied with securing their real  wages over a long time. It also includes an innovation offensive  with favorable loans or subsidies for an ecological renewal of  our national economy. Key words: development of remote heating  and linkage with power plants. Support must be given to  mid-level enterprises and to the provision of more risk capital.  So there is enough for us to do when we form the government with  our superior alternatives.    [Schwartz] Can that work without a specific financial  framework for your extensive demands at the party congress?    [Jens] I am certainly in favor of us giving careful thought  to how we can finance everything. Naturally an opposition cannot  do that to the penny but it can do it in broad outlines as in my  motion. Seen in macroeconomic terms, much pays for itself, as in  the ecological renewal of our national economy, in which the  stresses on the environment are to be made more costly through  taxation and hence labor less expensive through the reduction of  the supplemental wage costs.    [Schwartz] What do you say about the latest ideas in your  party about using special-purpose loans to finance specific  projects?    [Jens] I think that debt pots--and they also include loans  of  the most diverse kinds--to finance our tasks are virtually out  of the question. Even now, if we include all secondary public  budgets, we have a national debt amounting to about 66 percent  of the gross national product. But only 60 percent would be  permitted under the Maastricht stability criteria for entering  the third stage of the European Monetary Union. In addition,  rising state debt would only drive interest rates higher.    [Schwartz] So what remains for a serious opposition party  with respect to latitude to finance its demands?    [Jens] There are only four possibilities: cuts in public and  above all consumptive expenditures; tax increases; more debt;  and more economic growth, the source of higher tax receipts.  Thus, we must do everything we can to increase the size of the  cake that can be divided up. That is the objective of all of our  measures, which would therefore partially finance themselves.  But naturally we must also give thought to a clear restriction  of increases in public expenditures. There is also the  introduction of the solidarity contribution that has already  been decided by the Federal Government, from which small and  medium incomes must be excluded, however. Not to be forgotten  are the many tax loopholes, which must finally be plugged  through more effective control. After all, it must not happen  that individual federal laender are already using the argument  of somewhat laxer taxation to attract enterprises. I say that  the control of the revenue offices must be just as strict in  southern Germany as in the north or the central part of our  country.</p>

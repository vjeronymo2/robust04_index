			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Personal View: Treasury reform - low on culture shock The UK Treasury, Whitehall's most powerful civil service department, has gone back to first principles to justify its existence or, more accurately, its running costs. A penetrating report published last week recommends refocusing the department's work and a radical shake-up in its organisation. The report should be judged on whether it leads to a stronger Treasury. A strong central department is needed to fend off ever more powerful special pleading by vested interest groups, often articulated by other parts of Whitehall. There is certainly some modernising to cheer in the report. For the first time the Treasury has set itself objectives. It will concentrate on core activities and get out of others, such as checking on diplomats' cost-of-living allowances in Bogota or running civil service pensions. The report recommends removing much duplication of work done by others. It will reduce senior staff numbers by more than a quarter. Not bad. But a key test of this report is how far it enables the Treasury to change its culture. Does it address the common criticisms of the department that it is short-termist in outlook and insular in making decisions? To deal with short-termism, the report recommends the creation of a strategy group. I am not sure this is the answer. In my experience, there was no shortage of willingness or capacity among senior staff to think longer term, particularly when ministers demanded it. The problem was that so many were engaged in dealing with short-term crises that they rarely had time to take the longer view. Time will tell whether those advised by the strategy group will find themselves swamped by events, leaving the group's elegant reports to languish in their pending trays. The report distinguishes more clearly the roles of senior grades, and this may leave scope for long-term thinking by the top layers, who currently spend too much time second-guessing subordinates. Insularity is a bigger problem. I was astonished to discover that the Treasury often worked out important reforms (on pensions deregulation, for example) with little input from those with significant working experience of the field. Here the culture needs a fundamental change, with more people brought in from outside. Far more cross-fertilisation is needed between the Treasury and other professions. Ultimately that could mean differential pay for the same work to attract suitable outsiders. Providing posts for them would also erode the presumption that civil servants can expect a lifetime career. This is a bridge too far for the Treasury. True, the seven new 'directors' created by the report will be given enormous freedom, including power to recruit on short-term contracts. But the commitment to a lifetime service wins out: the report makes clear that short-term contracts are 'unlikely in our view to be a significant feature of a restructured Treasury'. It seems particularly odd to cling to the lifetime principle when the slimming at the top sends such a clear message to younger staff that there will be far fewer slots for them later on. Nonetheless, there are hopeful signs of greater openness in Treasury work, with far more secondments to industry. There is also a long overdue proposal that senior Treasury mandarins should have more experience of the areas of public expenditure they are responsible for (whether it is industry, schools, hospitals or whatever). Although the system of controlling public expenditure looks at risk from the proposals to reduce Treasury interference in departments and agencies, it is probably safe. The present system is certainly due for an overhaul: it requires the Treasury to approve minutiae such as the amount spent on leaving-gifts and 'novel' office parties. A little devolution on this close monitoring might leave the Treasury with more time to weigh up the short-term cost of spending against its long-term economic benefits. The report sensibly makes clear that the Treasury is going to give up these nit-picking powers only when departments demonstrate a greater willingness to share management and financial information with them. That is an essential safeguard. Departments are not like business profit centres, and decentralisation could all too easily lead to loss of spending control. The jury is out on these reforms. In some ways they do not go far enough. They may not be implemented. But at least they may prompt cuts in the upper echelons elsewhere in the civil service. A good place to start would be Whitehall's other ivory tower: the Foreign Office. The author was an adviser in the Treasury to former UK chancellors Nigel Lawson and John Major</p>

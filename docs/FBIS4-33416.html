			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 6 Jun (PL) -- Nine days after they  forcefully entered the Belgian ambassador's residence in Havana,  the group of occupants continue defying the Cuban and Belgian  governments' opposition to their stay in the building.    Foreign Ministry sources confirmed today to PRENSA LATINA  that normal conversations continue between Belgian diplomats and  local foreign ministry officials in a daily analysis of the  situation and of the mechanisms to apply for attaining a  definite solution to the issue.    Willy Verriest, special envoy from Brussels, and Paul  Vermkirsch, chief of the Belgian mission in Cuba, have already  met twice with acting Foreign Minister Isabel Allende. They  also exchanged viewpoints with Serafin Rodriguez, chief of the  Europe Department.    In all cases, the parties agree on recognizing the illegal  nature of the stay by the group occupying the Belgian residence,  which violates the security and extra territoriality of this  European nation's legation in the Caribbean island.    Likewise, the parties ratified the Cuban Government's  refusal  to recognize this type of action as a valid method to leave the  country, as it ignores the legal procedures established for  these cases.    The sources reaffirmed that as a show of good will, Cuba  will  abstain from taking measures against those who voluntarily leave  the ambassador's residence and decide -- if they so wish -- to  process in an appropriate manner their request to travel abroad.    This measure [words indistinct] was confirmed by the recent  departure of four occupants and their return, without any  difficulty, to their respective homes.    Foreign reporters and observers who reside in Havana feel  that this attitude by the other occupants of ignoring the joint  stand of Cuba and Belgium regarding their irregular presence in  the residence keeps them isolated, and it is deliberately  hindering a solution to the problem.</p>

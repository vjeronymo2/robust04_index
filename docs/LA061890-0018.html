			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Differences Attract: Ideological rivals Richard Nixon and radical lawyer  William Kunstler met backstage last week at "CBS This Morning" and there were  neither fireworks nor fisticuffs. "Where is he? I've got to find him," Kunstler  said.  </P> <P> He found Nixon in the makeup room, where they shook hands and chatted -- about  aging and baseball.  </P> <P> Alikes Attract: Sixty Soviet dancers, singers and acrobats got a taste of rural  Americana late last week with a feast of fried chicken, potato salad and beer  in Albertville, Minn. "President Gorbachev didn't have time," host Gary Meyer  said, referring to the Soviet leader's canceled visit to a Minnesota dairy farm  after the recent Washington summit. "Maybe this makes up a little for that."  "We feel very much at home," said Irena Charchevnikova, a dancer with the  Leningrad State Music Hall troupe, which is on its first U.S. tour.  </P> <P> Gambling With the Law: Donald Trump's casino tour for tennis star Gabriela  Sabatini broke state gaming laws because she's too young to go into the pit,  but no action is planned against him, authorities said Wednesday in Atlantic  City, N.J. The Argentine athlete was 19 when Trump led her on a nongambling  tour of the Trump Plaza casino in September. Visitors to gambling areas must be  21. "If we get a legitimate complaint, we'll investigate it," said Wayne  Marlin, spokesman for New Jersey's Division of Gaming Enforcement.  </P> <P> Lean and Mean: The once-hulking Speaker of the House, Rep. Thomas Foley  (D-Wash.), has switched from a modified liquid diet to a low-fat, low-calorie  regimen on his way to losing 80 pounds. "Baked potatoes, yogurt, skim milk,  vegetables, fruit," press secretary Jeff Biggs recited last week in Washington.  "It's the lean, mean look to balance all that kinder, gentler stuff." Foley has  shed more than 60 pounds since January.  </P></p>

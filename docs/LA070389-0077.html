			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRIENDSHIP FLIGHT: TONY CIRCLES THE GLOBE;  </P> <P> BOY MAY BE AT THE CONTROLS, PILOTS SAY, BUT HE'S GOT HELP  </P> <P> Although the round-the-world flight of 11-year-old Tony Aliengena may appear to  be the stuff of high adventure, aviation experts see it more as an affirmation  of the advanced state of modern aviation than the marvel of a boy wonder.  </P> <P> "Any 10-year-old could do this without any training whatsoever," said Philip  Lesch, 30, a flight instructor at Martin Aviation at Orange County's John Wayne  Airport. "This is a great experience for Tony, but he's really not flying that  plane."  </P> <P> Tony, a San Juan Capistrano fourth-grader, is now flying across Soviet Asia in  his quest to become, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, the  youngest person to circumnavigate the globe by air.  </P> <P> The trip, dubbed Friendship Flight, began June 5 in Orange County and is to  cover about 17,000 miles. A highlight came in Moscow last week when Tony  presented Soviet officials with a friendship scroll signed by thousands of U.S.  schoolchildren. On Sunday, Tony was passing over the Ural Mountains from  Kuibyshev to Tumen, 700 miles into Siberia.  </P> <P> The man who conceived of the trip, Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, is a licensed  pilot. When they are airborne in their Cessna Centurion 210, Aliengena sits at  Tony's side at all times, giving the boy the benefit of his years of flying  experience, much as he did last year when Tony became the youngest person to  fly across the United States. Aliengena also performs the bulk of the other  duties required for such an inter-continental air trip.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Official Observer  </P> <P> Also on board is Gunter Hagen, 58, a retired physicist from Malibu who is  serving as an official observer for the National Aeronautic Assn., the U.S.  body that sanctions all claims for world and national aviation records. It is  up to Hagen to verify that Tony remains at the controls of the craft throughout  the trip.  </P> <P> In addition, a chase plane carrying reporters and a film crew is tailing the  Cessna. The pilot of the chase plane remains in constant radio contact with  Gary Aliengena, swapping information on weather conditions and navigation to  make sure Tony remains on course.  </P> <P> While taking nothing away from the enthusiasm for what the boy is doing, Lesch  and other pilots stressed that it is Tony's father who is bearing the real  headaches and logistical details that come with piloting a small plane around  the world.  </P> <P> It is the father, they say, who is charged with charting the route, checking  weather conditions and talking with air traffic controllers, and who gives the  boy expert advice on handling the plane in difficult conditions.  </P> <P> "I don't see Tony as the pilot," Lesch said, echoing the view of other pilots  interviewed. "It's his father who talks to the controller, his father who makes  all the flight plans. I see Tony there with his hands on the controls, that's  all. It's like having a credit card and not being responsible for the charges."  </P> <P> The key to flying a plane, Lesch said, "is not the ability to manipulate the  controls but being able to accept responsibility and everything associated with  the airplane. Who is watching the weather and reading the maps? Who is talking  to the controllers and doing the weight and balance of the aircraft? Not Tony."  </P> <P> At the same time, Lesch said, he too is "touched how this thing has affected  some people, especially Tony's friends. They are living the excitement of this  flight vicariously. It's really great for the kids."  </P> <P> Gary Aliengena said in a recent interview that he saw nothing wrong with Tony's  not being involved in every aspect of the flight. Aliengena compared his role  to that of a commercial airline co-pilot whose jobs is to prepare the flight  for the pilot.  </P> <P> Aliengena emphasized that in the Cessna's cockpit, it is Tony who makes all the  critical decisions, such as whether to descend or ascend in bad weather.  </P> <P> Several times during the trip, Tony has described the flying itself as  "boring," and upon landing he has usually rushed off to eat something or watch  cartoons while his father sets about the business of preparing the plane for  the next day's journey.  </P> <P> According to local pilots, it is this expertise and backup that is making the  trip possible. The boy is taking but a minor role in guiding the craft through  the skies, they say.  </P> <P> Jim Parsons, owner of Avantair, a charter service operating out of John Wayne  Airport, compared Tony's role in the flight to that of "a kid who does real  well in a piano recital. But that doesn't mean he can go to a symphony and sit  down and pick up a piece of music and sight-read it. He just can't do it  without some help."  </P> <P> "It would take one hell of a guy to do that sort of thing by himself," Parsons  said. "But here he is with people chasing him, with support equipment and a  person riding in there on the right side. He isn't really piloting that plane."  </P> <P> "It's a nice trip for the boy and I think it is great for him, but what he is  doing is not a difficult chore," said Gregory Wilcox, a charter pilot for  Martin Aviation at John Wayne Airport who, like Tony, began flying with his  father when he was just 4 years old. "My kid, or anybody's kid, could do that."  </P> <P> "There is nothing inherently dangerous about flying an airplane anywhere,  anytime," he added. "In many ways, it is easier than driving a car. In this  case, Tony is just holding the wheel while somebody else does all the work.  </P> <P> "This is not Indiana Jones," he added. "It is not dangerous."  </P> <P> Tony's journey is not without peril, however. Pilots who have been following  the flight note that the Cessna 210, although it is a high-performance small  aircraft, has a limited altitude and distance range, and in colder weather is  prone to ice buildup on the wings. In Tony's case, this was avoided on the  North Atlantic crossing, for instance, with pre-flight planning to avoid storms  and icy conditions.  </P> <P> The pilots also note that while the general public may see a Cessna's crossing  vast expanses of Siberia as hazardous, given the relative lack of  sophistication of Soviet aviation, the journey will be made somewhat easier by  the multitude of sophisticated and redundant navigational systems on the plane.  </P> <P> In fact, Tony will not be able to obtain his pilot's license until he is 17,  and on this around-the-world flight, his father is listed as the pilot of  record.  </P> <P> Unlike those for driving, aviation regulations do not list a minimum age for a  person to be allowed to begin flying. The only requirement is that a licensed  pilot be at the controls. Although it is not a common practice, aviation  sources said many licensed pilots introduce their children to flying at an  early age, tutoring them on the intricacies of flying and allowing them to hold  the controls. Tony himself was introduced to flying at the age of 4, sitting on  his father's lap as they traveled through the air.  </P> <P> To set his record as the youngest person to fly around the globe, Tony must  perform all takeoffs and landings (although his father will be at his side to  intervene in an emergency).  </P> <P> Flight instructors generally commend Tony's ability in that regard, but they  note that most flying students master landings and takeoffs in the first five  hours of lessons.  </P> <P> Still, the flight has caught the imagination of many people, among them  corporate pilot Joe McElroy, who flies for a small Orange County computer  company.  </P> <P> "I flew airport transports across the Atlantic in World War II, and I can tell  you it can get hairy out there," said McElroy, 52, a Fountain Valley resident.  But, he added, "Tony doesn't need to know everything you need to know because  of his father. Tony is just doing the driving."  </P> <P> To Vi Smith, author of "From Jennies to Jets, the Aviation History of Orange  County," the journey has been something "that I have followed every day. It  takes me back to the days of Lindbergh, it's just so exciting. Everyone is  wishing the boy well."  </P> <P> FLIGHT LOG: Page 2  </P></p>

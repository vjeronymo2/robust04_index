			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT HARBOR STARTS QUICKLY, FINISHES STRONG  </P> <P> Newport Harbor High School marched 80 yards for a touchdown the first time it  got the ball en route to a 17-7 victory over Long Beach Wilson Friday night at  Davidson Field.  </P> <P> Running back Todd Farley capped off the 10-play drive with a 12-yard dash  around left end.  </P> <P> Sailor quarterback Stephen Scheck picked apart the Wilson secondary on the  opening drive, connecting on three of his first four passes. He finished the  night completing 16 of 31 for 169 yards.  </P> <P> Scheck kept rolling out of the pocket to avoid the charging Wilson defense and  he completed short passes to six receivers.  </P> <P> "We've got a pretty good package for blitz control," Newport Harbor Coach Jeff  Brinkley said.  </P> <P> Matt White caught five passes for 51 yards and set up Newport Harbor's second  touchdown of the night, catching a 19-yard pass from Scheck with 1:31 to play  in the first half.  </P> <P> Scheck did the rest, sneaking over from the one-yard line. Josh Klein kicked a  31-yard field goal in the first quarter and Newport Harbor held a 17-0 lead at  the half. MICHAEL ITAGAKI  </P></p>

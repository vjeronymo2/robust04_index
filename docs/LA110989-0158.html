			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHIELDS TO HEAD STATE SCIENCE COUNCIL  </P> <P> L. Donald Shields, former president of both Cal State Fullerton and Southern  Methodist University, has accepted a position as head of the new California  Council on Science and Technology, officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Shields had been president of Cal State Fullerton for nine years. At the time  he was appointed, he was the nation's youngest state university president at  age 34.  </P> <P> He resigned from SMU citing medical reasons in 1986, as a school football  scandal was unfolding. After it was revealed that the school's trustees, with  Gov. Bill Clements as chairman, had approved a play-for-pay scheme for  athletes, the NCAA imposed its "death penalty" on the school and its football  program was dropped for two years.  </P></p>

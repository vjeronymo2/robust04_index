			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO ZOO EAGLE STOLEN  </P> <P> For the second time in less than two weeks, thieves broke into a locked cage  and stole a rare bird from the San Diego Zoo. The stolen 30-year-old male  African bateleur eagle had lived at the zoo since 1961. On June 3, a female  African milky eagle owl was stolen from a cage about 100 yards away. Zoo  officials said the thefts apparently were well planned by someone with specific  knowledge about the birds. There was no evidence the thefts were committed by  the same people.  </P></p>

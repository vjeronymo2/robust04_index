			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Electoral Law did not pass muster last night at  the Constitutional Court. Only four of the 24 articles passed  the constitutionality test. The remainder were declared  unconstitutional.    The Court declared unconstitutional the article that fixed 8  May for the first round of presidential elections and 19 June  for the runoff.    The Court dismissed Law 84 of 1993. Therefore the old  Electoral Code enters in force.    The Court concluded that the 21 articles declared  unconstitutional can only be adopted within a statutory law and  not within a regular law.    The Court struck down the regulations that fixed the  electoral timetable and that blank votes should not be taken  into account at the time of determining the electoral ratio.    At the same time, the Court also struck down the regulations  that exempt former congressmen from resubmitting their  qualifications for election when they register as candidates for  Congress.    The Court's ruling took place in an atmosphere of heated  debate that divided the Court into blocs of five and four  justices respectively.    The Court's majority indicated that Law 84 contradicts what  is mandated in Article 152, Paragraph C.    Specifically, this provision provides that the organization  and the regulation of political parties and movements --  internal voting for mayor and governors, for example -- cannot  be included within a regular Electoral Law.    At the same time the Court left without legal force the  prohibition on candidates and political parties engaging in  publicity, giving interviews, or participating in media  reporting 24 hours before and during the day on which elections  are held.    Through this, the Court revived the use of all kinds of  mobile or audio propaganda, and the use of t-shirts, flags,  hats, and similar items related to the elections.    In the opinion of the majority of the justices, propaganda  restrictions can only be fixed through a statutory law, not  through a regular law.    The Court also dismissed the norms that prohibit the media  from conducting and publicizing polls or public opinion  inquiries on political or electoral preferences.    This was indicated by the Constitutional Court when it  settled the appeal filed against the Electoral Law (Law 84 of  1993).    The decision handed down yesterday is the result of a  three-week study, at the end of which four justices dismissed  the ruling when they decided that these electoral process  regulations should be fixed through a statutory law, not through  a regular law.    The justices who abstained were Jorge Arango Mejia,  Vladimiro  Naranjo Mesa, Carlos Gaviria Diaz, and Jose Gregorio Hernandez.    Meanwhile, Justices Hernando Herrera Vargara, Eduardo  Cifuentes Munoz, Alejandro Martinez, Fabio Moron Diaz, and  Antonio Barrera Carbonell supported the ruling.    According to the plaintiffs, the Electoral Law establishes  provisions that contradict the Constitution due to errors in  procedures or nonobservation of formalities. In addition,  electoral actions can only be regulated through a statutory law.    As was said, the Court also concluded that blank votes  should  be taken into account.    One justice said: "If this is not done, it would imply  disregard for the voting process."    The Court deemed that the blank votes allow gauging of  trends  for support or nonsupport of the proposals of the various  candidates.    With regard to regulations that exempt former congressmen  from resubmitting their qualifications for election when they  register, the Court said that these prerogatives not only impair  citizens' equal rights but also impair the guarantee of election  and being elected established in the Constitution.    The ruling (Article 22) that makes possible the election as  president or vice president of the Republic of senators and  representatives without application of the qualifier that no one  can be elected to more than one public corporation or post,  suffered the same fate.    In the Court's view, the provision contradicts Article 179  of  the Constitution, according to which "no one can be elected to  more than one public corporation or post, nor to a corporation  and a post, if the respective period coincides in time, even if  only partial."    On Justices Eduardo Cifuentes and Hernando Herrera's  positions, the Court supported provisions that authorize the  government to adopt budgets for the 1994 elections.</p>

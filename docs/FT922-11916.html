			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Letter: Co-operative money system better for world economy Sir, The leader writers of the Financial Times nowadays are clearly not economic historians. And we do not mean 19th-century economic history but that of the 1980s. The leader 'Chilly spring in Washington' (April 22) rejoiced in the end of the exchange rate co-ordinating role of the G7 summits, arguing that a healthy world economic system requires merely that all the participating countries put their own houses in order. Had the G7 taken your advice in the second half of the 1980s, it is very likely that the world economy would be even more on a 'knife-edge' than it is already. In brief, a rapidly depreciating dollar could have led to high interest rates and deflation in the US which could have got out of control given the precarious position of the financial system and the existence of a highly-leveraged corporate sector - the so-called 'hard-landing scenario'. In general, we have many examples where a co-operative international monetary system, or one that has been happy to follow a hegemonic leader, has been an important ingredient in a prosperous and dynamic world economy. We also have evidence of the 1930s and the period 1974-85 when, many economists consider, the lack of such co-operation was an important ingredient in poor economic performance. A little economic history can go a long way. Heather Gibson, Euclid Tsakalotos, lecturers in economics, Keynes College, University of Kent at Canterbury, Canterbury, Kent CT2 7NP</p>

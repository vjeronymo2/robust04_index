			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Viktorov: "The Authorities Have Decided </F> What Small Entrepreneurs Need"]    [Text] A special federal program is devoted to state  support of small business in Russia. It has been approved by the  decree "On Measures Regarding State Support of Small  Entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation for 1994-1995," which  was officially distributed yesterday. Such steps are in full  accord with the fashionable trend of world economic policy;  however, they can hardly yield a real economic effect.    The singularity of Russian economic policy is that the  authorities are simply compelled to regularly demonstrate  attention to the problems of small business. The reason for this  is that in the Russian social consciousness the economic reforms  have been associated for a rather long time already with the  support by the state of small private enterprises and  cooperatives in the struggle against the large state enteprises  which have monopolized the markets. Still more important is the  fact that such a stereotype exists also among Western creditors  and international financial organizations, which traditionally  require from the Russian authorities precisely the support of  small private enterprise--as evidence of adherence to the course  of the reforms. This is to be explained by the fact that now in  the industrially developed countries (especially in the USA)  state support of small business has become a fashionable trend  of economic policy. Western officials want in this way to  demonstrate their concern about increasing the competitiveness  of national products on world markets. It is considered that  precisely small business now moves scientific and technical  progress. The paradox, it is true, is that the need for state  support of small business is not at all incontrovertible. In the  Western countries a large number of small firms prosper not  thanks to but frequently in spite of the authorities (a vivid  example in this respect is Italy, where small business has  occupied a predominant position in the economy as a consequence  of the population's mistrust of the state).    However, the Russian authorities don't go into discussions  about the effectiveness of state support of small business. A  Fund for the Support of Entrepreneurship and the Development of  Competition under the Russian Federation State Committee for  Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic Structures was  formed as far back as April of last year and a wide-ranging  decree "On Top-Priority Measures for the Development and State  Support of Small Entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation" was  adopted in May. And, finally, now with the adoption of a Federal  Program of state support for small entrepreneurship for  1994-1995, this help has acquired as formalized a form as  possible.    True, the measures envisaged by the program are rather  vague.  Basically it is the development on order of all the same stock  of drafts of legislative acts concerning privileges for small  entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, it is not to be ruled out that,  thanks to the program, individual entrepreneurs will be able to  obtain preferential loans this year. Moreover, the chances for  this are higher among the representatives of the regions (the  program declares the fund's intention to give credit support to  the entrepreneurs of Murmansk, Novgorod, Pskov, Tula and Nizhniy  Novgorod (Nizhegorodskaya) oblasts). However, unbiased analysis  indicates that in any case realistic prospects for the  development of small business in Russia is rather connected not  with the strengthening of state support but, on the contrary,  with the weakening of state control over the economy.  <H5>  Financing of the Federal Program for State Support of Small </H5> Entrepreneurship in 1994-1995 (bill. rubles in 1993 prices)    From the Federal Budget--210.22, including:    --for the implementation of federal measures--18.38;    --for shared participation in regional programs--191.84.    From local sources--320    --including from local budgets--170.  <H5>  Basic Measures for the Support of Small Business Envisaged </H5> by the Program     -  Preparation of a draft law "On State Support of Small  Non-State Enterprises in the Russian Federation" (state support  will be enjoyed by enterprises operating in priority areas--the  production and processing of agricultural products; the output  of foodstuffs, consumer goods, medicines and medical equipment;  the rendering of consumer services; housing construction;  activity relating to innovation)    -  Preferential extension of credit and state guarantees for  loans  to small business (in individual cases--charge-free financing)    -  The granting of privileges and preferences to banks,  investment  and insurance companies which serve small business    -  Exemption of small enterprises from the obligatory sale of  export foreign currency earnings    -  Preferential sale to small business of licenses and  technologies and the leasing of machines, equipment and  production premises</p>

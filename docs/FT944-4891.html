			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Falling bond prices leave equities mixed Wall Street The US stock market closed mixed yesterday on the heels of a declining bond market, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.70 at 3,741.92, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 0.02 at 453.32, the American SE composite down 0.21 at 432.25 and the Nasdaq composite 0.69 firmer at 745.71. The day's NYSE volume was light at 258.5m shares. After Friday's surge, when the Dow jumped more than 40 points in the afternoon, the market opened with investors in a surprisingly upbeat mood, with the Dow gaining some 10 points by 1pm. Last week's late gains were spurred by a sharp increase in bond prices, and yesterday saw bonds fall all day, pulling stock prices down by the end of the day. Most economists attributed the declining bond prices not to renewed bearish sentiment, but to profit-taking after Friday's strong rally. With senitment on Wall Street divided about whether equities are likely to rally in the short term, the market traded within a relatively narrow band, never rising more than 18 points above Friday's close or falling in excess of 19 points below it. Analysts attributed the day's lows to program trading that took place late in the afternoon after share prices began to slide. A range of Dow issues achieved gains as buyers favoured cyclicals. Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 52, Aluminum Company of America Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 82 5/8 , International Paper Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 71 5/8 and Caterpillar Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 53 7/8 . Car issues were firmer in anticipation of another strong set of sales figures. General Motors appreciated Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 39 and Chrysler Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 49 7/8 . ICN Pharmaceuticals fell Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 19 1/8 after stating that, following advice from the US Food and Drug Administration, it was amending its application for approval of its treatment for chronic hepatitis C. On the Nasdaq, Figgie International climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 7 on news that it had hired an investment bank to advise on 'strategic alternatives' that could involve the sale of businesses or a recapitalisation. Canada A zig-zagging Toronto market ended mixed, thanks to another solid day of advances in heavily weighted bank stocks. Weakness in oil and gold shares was the main drag on the market. The TSE 300 index managed a minor gain of 3.57 points at 4,096.56, but declines led rises by 404 to 354 after volume of 54.5m shares. Nine of the 14 sub-indices were up, led by the paper, financial, conglomerate and communication sectors. Golds fell 1.25 per cent. Financial services added 0.79 per cent, with Royal Bank of Canada putting on CDollars 1/2 at CDollars 29 1/2. The bank is expected to release earnings today. Besides strong earnings, the banking stocks are gaining strength from growing belief that long-term rates are peaking. Brazil Shares in Sao Paulo ended 2.3 per cent higher after investors reassessed a central bank ruling requiring reserve requirements for repurchase of export notes, which sent stock prices lower at the start of trading. The Bovespa index rose 1,068 to 46,313.</p>

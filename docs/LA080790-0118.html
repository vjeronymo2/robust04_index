			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE TO CUT QUARANTINE ZONE IN WAR ON MEDFLY  </P> <P> Agricultural authorities announced plans Monday to scale back the Mediterranean  fruit fly quarantine zone in parts of four Southern California counties, while  a panel of medical experts and residents in Los Angeles complained about the  effects of the state's recent aerial spraying of malathion, insisting that  officials ignored the pesticide's potential dangers.  </P> <P> Federal agriculture officials announced Monday that they would lift the  quarantine on nearly 20% of the 1,313 square miles in Los Angeles, Orange, San  Bernardino and Riverside counties that had been declared off limits for the  sale and shipment of agricultural products.  </P> <P> That decision was tempered by the discovery of a fertile male fly in a peach  tree in the Orange County community of Brea. Although the area will remain  under the quarantine as a result of the discovery, state agriculture officials  said they had no plans to renew the spraying there.  </P> <P> Malathion spraying recently was suspended in the four affected counties. One of  the world's most destructive agricultural pests, the Medfly attacks 260  varieties of fruits, vegetables and nuts.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, during a special Los Angeles City Council committee hearing called  by Councilman Joel Wachs, a group of medical experts worried aloud about the  effects of malathion spraying. The experts, among whom were professors from  UCLA and USC, suggested that the state may have severely underestimated the  health effects of the spraying campaign.  </P> <P> "The only responsible course of action is to halt the spraying until we have  reassurances that it is not a health hazard," said Jorge Mancillas, an  assistant professor at UCLA Medical School.  </P> <P> There was also testimony from Los Angeles spray zone residents whose complaints  ranged from having flu-like symptoms to one man's insistence that exposure to  Malathion caused him to suffer temporary blindness.  </P> <P> Offering everything from photographs to neighborhood opinion surveys as proof,  residents said they have suffered ill health that they directly attribute to  the malathion spraying.  </P> <P> "They claim we're hysterically reacting, but my reaction is we're hysterically  being sprayed," said Jean Hinsley Norcott, a resident of an area affected by  the spraying.  </P> <P> Lorenzo Ulloa, manager of an Alhambra apartment complex, said he has been  exposed to the spraying three times, getting a dose while cleaning up after the  nighttime assaults against the Medfly. Since then, Ulloa said, he has suffered  periods of blindness, dizziness, lack of concentration and other neurological  symptoms.  </P> <P> But state and county health officials, who did not attend the hearing,  reiterated assurances that the spraying does not pose a danger because the dose  of malathion is extremely small.  </P> <P> "I think we've gone the extra mile to study this issue," said James Stratton,  the state Health Services Department's medical epidemiologist. "There's no  question that in sufficiently high doses, malathion can be significantly toxic.  But our position is that the small doses in an aerial program do not pose a  significant health risk to the public."  </P> <P> Wachs and others at the daylong hearing painted a far bleaker portrait.  </P> <P> "I've gotten hundreds and hundreds of calls and letters from people suffering  medical problems after malathion spraying," Wachs said before the hearing, held  by the council's Arts, Health and Humanities Committee. "The malathion health  problem is clearly greater than the state or county officials either know or  are willing to admit."  </P> <P> Alfredo Sadun, an ophthalmology professor at the USC School of Medicine, said a  small percentage of people can suffer damage to the nerves of their eyes from  exposure to malathion. More intensive examinations of people who suffer such  symptoms are needed, he said, to determine any connection.  </P> <P> "The absence of proof in this instance is used as proof that there are no  problems" from the spraying, Sadun said. "Even if the odds are one in 100,000  that something will occur, if we spray 1 million people that could mean 10  people might be blind."  </P></p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / The Monday Interview: The chef, the hotelier - and their profits / Nicholas Lander talks to French chef Joel Robuchon about his new venture Joel Robuchon is the most highly esteemed chef in France. His talent has taken him to the heights of his trade, in a country which believes it has taught the world how to cook. Among fellow chefs he is respected for his integrity and professionalism. Those who have eaten his food recognise his ability to extract the finest flavours, not only from ingredients such as lobster, caviar and truffles but from the more prosaic potato and salad. His 'pommes purees' are considered the best. By reintroducing them onto a top French menu in the early 1980s, Robuchon started a trend that spread around the world. His relatively simple salad of fresh herbs would have delighted the nuns who ran the seminary kitchen he started work in 37 years ago. It was there that he fell under the spell of food and its cooking. Despite his talent, Robuchon is not a man who likes to shock or steal the limelight. Softly spoken, with deep-set eyes, he smiles easily. He enjoys talking, particularly about food, the quality of the produce he uses and about the art and profession of cooking. Yet the latest stage in his career casts an intriguing light upon the economics of being a modern day super-chef. Last year he shocked peers and countrymen by announcing he would be closing his three star Michelin restaurant in Paris, Jamin, and transferring his entire brigade to the kitchens of Le Parc Victor Hugo, a new luxury hotel. In the process, Robuchon stepped into the arms of an international hotel chain. Le Parc Victor Hugo is owned by La Compagnie International Phenix Hotels, which operates 31 hotels, predominantly in Paris but also in London, Amsterdam and Geneva. Its main shareholders are Compagnie Generale des Eaux, one of France's leading utilities and Assurances Generales de France, a large, state-owned insurance company shortly to be privatised. Robuchon's standing has allowed him to command impressive terms from the two corporate giants. The combined workforce of the two companies is more than 250,000. Yet last week at the official opening of Le Parc Victor Hugo the collaboration between Robuchon and CIP was described as a 'partnership'. However, in spite of the status the deal gives him, a troubling question remains: why is it that a man at the peak of his career, as chef and proprietor of a three star Michelin restaurant, has chosen to compromise his independence ? The most suitable analogy for this unlikely partnership lies in the Middle Ages. Robuchon is the brilliant artist and CIP the powerful nobleman, whose patronage will ensure Robuchon's survival and eventual fortune. For these days few celebrity chefs can live by cooking alone. Born in Poitiers in 1945, the son of a mason and a mother who cooked simple French food, Robuchon entered a seminary at the age of 12 to train for the priesthood. He worked in the kitchens, alongside the nuns, and it was they who alerted him to the pleasures and satisfaction of cooking. 'Cooking is one of the very few professions,' Robuchon stresses, 'which demands that you use both your hands and your head to the same level of skill.' The need to supplement the family income forced Robuchon, aged 15, into the kitchen as an apprentice in the hotel and restaurant, Relais de Poitiers. A year followed as a Compagnon du Tour du France, during which like a medieval journeyman, he travelled France, reporting in each city to an appointed 'master' who set him to work. Robuchon believes, despite the hard work, that this training as part of a team, was invaluable. 'There are many, many chefs who can cook expertly but the hardest task facing any chef today is building a brigade, maintaining a team.' In 1965 Robuchon left the provinces for a job at The Berkley hotel in Paris to work under head chef Andre Moreau, who believed passionately in the professionalism inculcated by culinary competitions. It was Moreau who recognised Robuchon's talents and made him compete at every available opportunity. This competitive era convinced Robuchon to strive for the top. In 1968 while many of his colleagues were gripped by revolutionary fervour and several left the profession, Rubouchon ploughed on. By 1970 he had become the youngest chef to win the Prix Taittinger, perhaps France's most arduous culinary contest, and by 1974, aged 28, he was head chef of the Hotel Concorde Lafayette, responsible for 90 chefs serving 3,000 customers. In 1981 he opened Jamin which gained three Michelin stars within three years. Chefs became media stars in the 1980s, Robuchon believes partly because none of those cooking at the very highest level make a profit in the dining room. Dinner chez Robuchon will cost Dollars 200 per person with modest wines - but the perishable raw ingredients are only the very best and the labour costs are very high. At Robuchon's restaurants, staff of 45 serve no more than 50 customers. Robuchon believes that without a strong financial parent top chefs have had to find other sources of income - by writing books, making television appearances or endorsing a range of foodstuffs - to support their restaurants. So he was particularly vulnerable when the recession of the early 1990s brought empty tables, smaller bills and shrinking profits. In 1990 Robuchon met Jean-Marc Oury, CIP's chairman, as the company was embarking on a Dollars 5m plan to convert five 1912 townhouses into Le Parc Victor Hugo. Oury lured Robuchon to the hotel with a deal in which Robuchon owns the restaurant but pays rent to CIP. He does not get a salary but keeps the restaurant's profits and acts as consultant to the hotel's brasserie, which is considerably cheaper than the restaurant. Robuchon believes the security of this partnership will allow him to set new culinary standards and to shape the future of French cuisine. 'Cooking has changed fundamentally since I began in 1960. It used to be the quality of the sauces that was important. The produce itself was secondary and often you could not tell what you were eating. Today what is important is to respect the produce you are working with and fix in your mind its taste and flavour so that you can recognise the precise moment it is cooked. That is what I must teach.'</p>

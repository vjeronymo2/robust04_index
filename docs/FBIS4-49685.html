			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Josephine Ma in Brussels] </F>   [Text] Two mainland artists about to fly to Belgium for an  international arts festival were taken away by police at Beijing  airport, holding boarding passes and visas. Mou Sen, director  of Xijuchejian (Garage Theatre), an experimental drama group in  Beijing, and arts critic Lin Kehuang, were barred from boarding  the plane last Tuesday even though they had cleared Customs.  The reasons for the action remain unknown.    Other theatre group members were able to leave for Brussels.  It is understood the two artists were invited as members of the  official delegation sent by the Ministry of Culture. Both were  funded by the organiser, the International Arts Festival  Brussels.    More than 80 Chinese artists from the mainland, Taiwan, and  Hong Kong are now in Brussels for the festival's China  programme. Mou was to present his group's first piece, File 0,  and Lin was to give a talk about drama in China.    Festival director Frie Leysen vowed to express  dissatisfaction at the incident. "It is an emotional evening  but we are also angry. The Chinese authority has no right to  keep people who ought to be here," Ms Leysen said before the  first show by Xijuchejian.    Despite the absence of the director, File 0 had its premier  on schedule and won long applause.    Also participating in the festival were two non-official  mainland artists, independent film-makers Zhang Yuan and Wu  Wenguan. Their works have been banned by the Chinese  authorities. Cheung Fai, coordinator of the festival's China  programme, said Zhang and Wu were not on the official mainland  delegation.    Xijuchejian travels to France tomorrow.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Korean fund aims to raise Dollars 100m An investment fund investing in South Korean equities is to be launched next week by Coryo International (UK) and another UK investment company. The Korean Golden Gate Fund will be listed in Luxembourg as a SICAV, which will allow it to hold variable amounts of capital, and will be an open-ended fund. Coryo plans to raise around Dollars 100m, although this amount depends on investor demand, Coryo said. Coryo International is a subsidiary of Coryo Securities of Korea, South Korea's sixth largest securities investment company. The launch comes after the announcement by the South Korean government last week that the limits on foreign ownership of company shares will be raised from 10 per cent to 12 per cent on December 1. 'Very few emerging market funds invest in South Korea,' said a spokesman at Coryo International. 'It is a specialist market. This fund allows exposure to South Korea and will be preferred to investing directly in stocks.' He added: 'You can buy South Korean stocks at the moment above the 10 per cent ceiling, but you have to pay a huge premium.' Shares in the fund will be priced at Dollars 1,000 each and are expected to be offered to international investors in the coming weeks when the prospectus is issued and the SICAV listing is approved, Coryo said. An application is to be made for SIB authorisation so that UK private investors can take advantage of the fund. Coryo has invested Dollars 10m in the fund. It has raised a further Dollars 50m to Dollars 75m so far in Europe, mainly from institutional investors in France and Germany. It will complete a series of meetings with private investors in Europe next week, the spokesman said. The fund will invest in Korean equities and other instruments such as North Korean US dollar-denominated convertible bonds.</p>

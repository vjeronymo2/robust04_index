			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Consumers seem cautious amid rising credit demand Demand for consumer credit continued to rise in June although there were growing signs of reluctance to take on heavy or longer-term commitments, say two credit industry reports released today. Both the Finance and Leasing Association and Infolink, a credit information group, suggested that discussion of possible interest rate increases deterred some borrowers. The FLA said its members supplied consumer credit worth Pounds 1.37bn in June, an increase of 31 per cent compared with June 1993 but up only 1 per cent from May. While credit granted on store cards rose sharply, fewer people took out personal loans and motor finance fell 6 per cent compared with May. According to the FLA's non-seasonally adjusted figures, store card borrowings jumped 14 per cent to Pounds 415m between May and June and were up 51 per cent on June last year. However, personal loans at Pounds 219m in June were down 9 per cent compared with May and, although 12 per cent higher than in June last year, recorded their lowest annual rate of increase for 18 months. Infolink reported a strong 13.1 per cent year-on-year increase in demand for credit in the retail sector. However, applications for credit in the new-car sector slowed, while growth in demand for credit from finance houses was the lowest in recent months, it said. Mr Brian Bailey, Infolink chairman, said his company's figures provided 'anecdotal evidence that consumers were reluctant to make heavy credit commitments in June'. Mr David Hardisty, FLA chairman, said: 'The reluctance of consumers to take on longer term commitments in June confirms our view that consumer confidence remains fragile.' The FLA, whose members provide 80 per cent of consumer credit not provided by banks and building societies, and finance about 30 per cent of fixed investment in plant and equipment, said business finance at Pounds 1.21bn in June was unchanged from June 1993. Although business lending and leasing showed a typical end-quarter increase of 24 per cent between May and June, the second-quarter total of Pounds 3.18bn was only 1 per cent up on last year's second-quarter total of Pounds 3.15bn. The shake-out in manufacturing is coming to an end with companies shedding fewer staff and closing fewer production sites, says a survey by Remploy Manufacturing Services, a contract manufacturing company. Its survey of more than 7,000 manufacturing sites found 20 per cent increased their workforce in the year to June, 25 per cent reduced staff and 55 per cent reported no change in the workforce. The survey showed that just under 4 per cent of the sites had closed in the year to June, against 8 per cent in the previous year and 13 per cent the year before.</p>

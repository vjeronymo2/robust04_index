			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hospital Corporation Pounds 2.1m in the red HOSPITAL Corporation International Group, which was created in January when HCI of the US reversed into Bioplan Holdings, the UK healthcare group, incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.1m in the six months to June 30. In the nine months to December 31 losses totalled Pounds 21.4m, after exceptional charges of Pounds 16.8m - a result of the new management's adoption of a more conservative approach to Bioplan's accounting policies. In the period under review turnover was Pounds 13.3m and operating profits for continuing businesses Pounds 327,000. However, there were exceptional costs of Pounds 641,000 relating to losses from the West Peaks hospital in Macclesfield, now sold for Pounds 2.4m to the National Health Service, and interest charges of Pounds 1.78m. Mr James Mills-Webb, finance director and chief executive of the UK operations, said that borrowings - below Pounds 17m, with Pounds 5m of lease obligations - were about the same as the end-December figure. In the half year to September 30 1991 - not comparable, said Mr Mills-Webb, because the figures, albeit restated, were only for Bioplan's UK operations  -turnover was Pounds 7.49m, operating losses were Pounds 5.85m after exceptional costs of Pounds 4.61m, and pre-tax losses were Pounds 6.14m. The company currently has nine hospitals in the UK, one in Panama and one American Medical Centre in Moscow, with AMCs in Beijing and St Petersburg opening by the year-end. Mr Mills-Webb said that occupancy levels in the UK stood at 45-50 per cent, but that it was not like the hotel business; the number of patients treated was what made profits. Some 75 per cent of the company's assets and Pounds 9m of its Pounds 13.3m turnover was in the UK, he said. Losses per share emerged at 2.63p (16.7p) and again there is no dividend.</p>

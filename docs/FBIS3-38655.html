			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry on 5 </F> February; place not specified]    [Text] An mortar attack on Sarajevo today -- a city which  has been under a Serbian siege for a long time and which is  constantly being bombed -- killed 51 civilians including old  people, women, and children, and injured more than 100.    The fact that the bomb was thrown on a Saturday [5  February],  when the people of Sarajevo go out with family, and the fact  that it was thrown at a market place where there are large  crowds, is irrefutable proof of the absolute necessity to stop  the crazed and merciless aggressor.    We strongly condemn this latest act of savagery committed  against the people of Sarajevo almost as if in provocation. This  place was visited by our prime minister and minister a few days  ago to observe the unacceptable conditions and problems of these  people, and we promised them help. We reiterate to the world  the call made by our prime minister to stop these inhuman  incidents.    The attacks and inhuman acts being perpetrated against  Sarajevo can be stopped in two ways: The first is by means of  international intervention. Turkey is ready to participate in  intervention where NATO's means are also used.    The second is this: If the international community is  incapable of intervening at this stage, then it must enable  Bosnia-Herzegovina to protect itself.    Turkey is determined to be on the side of Bosnia-Herzegovina  in its just struggle and to continue to support it.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties clash over waiting list figures - Health THE TWO main parties traded assertions about health service activity yesterday, as a record fall in the number of people waiting more than two years for an operation was announced yesterday by Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary. The tension between the parties on the issue was reflected in another rowdy and fevered bout of pre-election sniping at prime minister's questions in the Commons. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, attacked Mr John Major for ignoring complaints by cancer specialists that they were 'unable to treat patients because of shortage of beds', while Mr Major again insisted that the government had exceeded the sums suggested by Labour spokesmen when providing more resources for the NHS. In a speech to the conference of NHS managers, Mr Waldegrave said that a second wave of family doctors would become GP fundholders from the beginning of April, bringing the total in the scheme to more than 3,000 GPs. He clashed with Mr Robin Cook, the shadow health secretary, over the number of people treated by the NHS since the reforms came into effect. Mr Waldegrave said that the first months of government reforms showed the health service on course to treat 5.6 per cent more acute in-patients than last year. But Mr Cook said claims of more patient care did not square with information sent to him by regional health authorities. There are now just over 20,000 patients waiting more than than two years for an operation - a reduction of nearly 9,000 since last December. As part of the Citizen's Charter initiative, the government has set the target that, from April, no-one should have to wait longer than two years. Mr Waldegrave conceded that the number of patients waiting for up to a year had risen, but said that the number waiting more than one year had almost halved. At a press conference with doctors who oppose the government's health reforms, Mr Cook said that the real figures showed that on present progress the NHS would treat 7.45m patients this year, not the 7.9m patients claimed by ministers. In the Commons Mr Kinnock had to struggle to make himself heard above persistent barracking from Conservative MPs. 'I am telling the truth about the NHS, and they do not want to hear it,' he protested.</p>

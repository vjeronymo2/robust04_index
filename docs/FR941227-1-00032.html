			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Standard No. 216 seeks to achieve this purpose by requiring vehicles to be certified as complying with a performance test in which a load of 11/2 times the unloaded vehicle weight (up to a maximum of 5000 pounds for passenger cars) is applied to the vehicle roof by means of a rigid unyielding block whose lower surface consists of a flat rectangle 30 inches wide and 72 inches long.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the test, the plate is required to be positioned so that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) When viewed from the side of the test vehicle, the test plate is angled 5 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; toward the front of the vehicle; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When viewed from the front of the test vehicle, the test plate is angled 25 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; below the horizontal on the side of the vehicle to which the test plate is applied; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The initial contact point of the test plate with the test vehicle roof is 10 inches from the forwardmost point of the test plate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The test plate orientation and placement are illustrated in Figure 1 of Standard No. 216.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These requirements were initially proposed in a notice published on January 6, 1971 (36 FR 3) and are patterned after the specifications in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Standard J374. At that time, most vehicle roofs were less rounded than today's designs, and there were no raised-roof vehicles to be tested. Thus, the specifications for positioning the test plate ensured that it would be positioned to measure the roof's strength in the A-pillar region and to ensure that the strength was sufficient to prevent sudden collapse of the roof above the A-pillars and front seating areas during rollovers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Petitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> A. RVIA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> RVIA recently submitted a petition asking that vans, motor homes and other multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses that have raised roofs and that are now subject to Standard No. 216 be tested according to the requirements of Standard No. 220,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> School Bus Rollover Protection.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Standard No. 220 subjects vehicles to the same force on the roof as does Standard No. 216 (11/2 times the unloaded vehicle weight), but the force is applied differently. The test plate used in Standard No. 220 is larger than the 30&times;72 inch plate used in Standard No. 216. In addition, instead of concentrating the load in the vicinity of the A-pillars the test load is evenly distributed over the entire roof in Standard No. 220. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RVIA used the following arguments to support its petition: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

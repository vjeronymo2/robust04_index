			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russians reject plan to liberalise coal prices THE RUSSIAN government was yesterday unable to agree to proposals to liberalise low domestic prices for coal, but said it would press ahead with plans to reduce import subsidies on other commodities to defend its own producers and cut the budget deficit. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, said that given opposition to his proposals to free coal prices and cut big subsidies to coal miners, 'we are now looking at a compromise to have one big price increase and then slowly increase prices every month'. He described as 'crazy' a proposal by the state price committee, which he oversees, to levy a tax on other industries to help subsidise the coal industry and another similar tax sought by the agriculture ministry to support agriculture. Mr Fyodorov said the cabinet decided to reform the price committee so that it would start fighting unfair pricing practices and deal with forecasting rather than coming up with price-regulating schemes that were 'incompatible with a market economy'. Having recently declared that import subsidies would be cut by 40 per cent, Mr Fyodorov said yesterday the idea was to abolish subsidised exchange rates that encouraged state organisations to import grain, sugar and metals instead of buying them inside Russia. He did not spell out which import subsidies would be cut, not least because he is still struggling with other ministries to get the plan implemented. But the subsidies would be maintained on critical goods that were not produced in Russia in sufficient quantities, such as medicines.</p>

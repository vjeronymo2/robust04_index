			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORLANDO GETS BIT OF MAGIC, BEATS KNICKS  </P> <P> The expansion Orlando Magic got its first-ever NBA victory Monday night,  winning in its second game by beating the defending Atlantic Division champion  New York Knicks, 118-110.  </P> <P> Reggie Theus scored 24 points and Jerry Reynolds and Terry Catledge each added  19 for the Magic. Orlando broke a 94-94 tie by outscoring the Knicks, 12-2, and  stayed in front by making 10 consecutive free throws in the final 1:33.  </P> <P> A sellout of 15,077 -- the same crowd that saw the Magic lose its opener to New  Jersey -- watched Orlando stay close all night. The Knicks, who got 29 points  from Patrick Ewing, never led by more than three points.  </P> <P> Gerald Wilkins scored 21 and Johnny Newman had 19, including a three-point shot  that trimmed the Magic's advantage to 110-107 with 32 seconds left.  </P> <P> The Knicks (1-2) were hurt nine seconds later when Newman was called for a  breakaway foul. Theus hit two free throws and Orlando retained possession of  the ball.  </P> <P> The Magic, 2-6 in the exhibition season including a victory over the Detroit  Pistons, pulled away during a four-minute stretch midway through the fourth  quarter.  </P></p>

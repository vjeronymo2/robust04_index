			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / China warns over debts bail-out Chinese officials at the weekend sought to distance the government from responsibility for debts incurred by state-owned companies following reports in the international media about difficulties over payments. At the same time, Beijing has hit back at what it regards as negative foreign reports about China's investment climate. Strong official criticism of recent western reporting indicates growing sensitivity to stories that affect China's credit rating and confidence in China as a safe investment destination. Mr Liu Zhiben, director general of the foreign investment division of the Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Ministry (Moftec), charged that the 'flimsy linkage of corporate disputes to the government's credibility is a thinly veiled attempt to mar the image of China as an investment magnet'. But Mr Liu also warned foreign investors that they could not take for granted a government bail-out of projects that had gone sour. Mr Liu told Business Weekly newspaper: 'Some investors are fond of the idea that doing business with Chinese state-owned companies means gaining a secure link with the Chinese government - a link that could come in handy if the state-owned Chinese investment partner suffers losses. 'But the reality of the arrangement is different. For many years, Chinese enterprises, whether state, collectively or privately-owned, have had to sink or swim on their own. The days of rigid central planning and responsibility for state firms has gone. 'It's not strange to see contractual conflicts. However, these cannot be regarded as anything relating to government action.' In the past few weeks, China's reputation as a reliable business partner has been buffeted by three high-profile cases. These involve a dispute with Lehman Brothers, involving prominent state corporations, about losses of Dollars 100m (Pounds 64m) on currency trading; an argument with the London Metals Exchange over Dollars 30-Dollars 40m in trading losses incurred by the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic); and the non-payment by state enterprises of Dollars 500-Dollars 600m to joint venture leasing companies. Western banks and credit agencies have stepped up their monitoring of the credit performance of Chinese organisations in the light of these developments. Concern about the ability of Chinese enterprises to meet their obligations to foreign creditors is leading to an increase in borrowing costs for Chinese institutions. China's foreign debt is expected to reach Dollars 100bn this year. This will mean a debt-service ratio of around 12 per cent. About two-thirds of China's debt is sovereign: in other words, government-guaranteed. China's state auditors have been instructed to investigate foreign debts of local authorities as part of attempts by Beijing to tighten the screws on foreign borrowing. Business Weekly reported that the State Audit Administration would monitor commercial loans obtained by provincial governments. A spokesman for the SAA said that 'few foreign loans to local government have been audited in the past few years as it had been focusing on projects financed by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and other international organisations.'</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Playing for high stakes at Lloyd's: Loss-making Names, hoping to come up trumps, are holding a complex hand There is a complex game of poker going on between loss-making Lloyd's Names and the insurance market's authorities. Names - the individuals whose assets support the insurance market - are trying to decide whether to accept a Pounds 900m settlement deal, which offers the great majority less than 40p in the pound for every pound of loss. They could reject the deal in the hope of securing much greater compensation for losses of more than Pounds 3bn through the courts. With less than a month to consider the offer, the odds are that the number of acceptances will be insufficient to make the deal feasible and that the protracted legal war between Names and their agents will continue, possibly for the rest of the decade. Two of the largest groups of Names taking legal action - members of Gooda Walker syndicates and Merrett syndicate 418 - have indicated that they will reject the deal. Another large group, the Feltrim Names, meet this afternoon and are widely expected to follow suit, making it unlikely that the majority required by Lloyd's for the offer to go ahead - 70 per cent of Names by value of the offer - will be reached by February 14. Assessment of the merits of the Pounds 900m offer, announced by Lloyd's last month, is complex. Lloyd's has financed the deal from three sources: Pounds 450m from its central fund - which meets claims when Names cannot meet their obligations; Pounds 50m in voluntary contributions from Lloyd's agents involved in the legal actions; and about Pounds 400m from errors and omissions insurers which cover Lloyd's agents against the cost of legal awards for negligence. It seems clear that neither the central fund contribution nor agents' contributions can be increased, but considerable uncertainty surrounds the contributions and potential exposure of the E&amp;O insurers, which, to complicate matters, are themselves Lloyd's syndicates. The document detailing the offer terms states that the total exposure of the E&amp;O insurers to the agents named in the legal action stands at between Pounds 820m and Pounds 1,085m. However, according to some market sources, not all of this cover would be triggered even if all the Names' legal actions were completely successful, an outcome which must be regarded as unlikely. Even then the money would not be paid out for some time, since it will be years before all the legal cases are heard and awards made. Action group leaders insist that Names can obtain better terms than those currently on offer, by pressing ahead with legal action and, possibly, by bringing E&amp;O insurers and Lloyd's back to the negotiating table. The leaders argue, for example, that successful legal action would make it easier for E&amp;O insurers to make claims on their own reinsurance policies, mainly placed with large European companies. Lloyd's arguments have cut little ice with those Names hardest hit by the market's losses, who argue they cannot afford to settle. 'All the settlement does is reduce you from being bust twice over to being bust once,' says Ms Marie Louise Burrows, chairman of the Lime Street Action Group, whose members have been offered compensation of more than 50p in the pound for average losses to date of Pounds 2.4m per head. Even so the cost of rejection could be high. Success by Names whose cases come to court first could rapidly deplete funds available for other groups. Many Names are members of several loss-making syndicates, so they might find gains from one action offset by losses elsewhere. Names will also face heavy legal costs. Even if successful they would be liable to pay not only their own legal fees, but also, under the terms of E&amp;O policies, their opponents' fees. Most importantly, Names run the risk that following the strengthening of Lloyd's capital base - with capacity increasing by 20 per cent in 1994 - their ability to extract concessions from the market could be reduced. In the words of Mr Charles Sturge, co-editor of Chatset, which monitors the market, Lloyd's could 'let the whole thing expire quietly and go ahead and forget about the distressed Names'.</p>

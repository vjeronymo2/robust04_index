			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Astra warns of slower growth over the year ASTRA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday said pre-tax profit rose 63 per cent to SKr1.74bn (Dollars 236.7m) in the first three months, but it warned that profit growth over the rest of the year would be slower. The latest figure was at the top end of stock market expectations and compared with a profit of SKr1.06bn in the same 1992 period. 'Given the large revaluations during the fourth quarter of 1992, the profit development for the whole of 1993 will not reach the same rate as during the first quarter,' the company stated. Sales for the quarter rose 36 per cent to SKr5.02bn from SKr3.70bn, although excluding currency factors, the increase was 16 per cent. The company said it had strong volume growth in many markets, particularly the UK and France. But sales in its most important market, Germany, fell 16 per cent because of what it called 'political interference' in the country's pharmaceutical industry. Sales of Losec, the company's anti-peptic ulcer drug, rose to SKr1.5bn from SKr991m, although if sales through licensees are included, the figure rose to SKr2.64bn from SKr1.55bn.</p>

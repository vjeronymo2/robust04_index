			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Council may appeal on High Court swaps ruling ISLINGTON council in north London is considering appealing against last week's High Court ruling that it should repay more than Pounds 1m to Westdeutsche Landesbank. The ruling came in the first test case to reach court since the House of Lords said two years ago that local authorities had no power to enter interest-rate swap agreements. The Lords' decision left 80 banks facing losses of Pounds 560m, some of which they are seeking to recover through restitution - reclaiming the interest paid to councils under the invalid swap agreements. Islington is involved in a number of transactions, and could face problems in repaying the substantial sums it would owe if the principle of restitution were applied to other agreements. Because Islington frequently acted as a third party - dealing with other local authorities rather than directly with banks - it is difficult to form a clear picture of its involvement, but bankers estimate it could owe more than Pounds 10m. The ruling means the council owes WestLB about Pounds 2m in principal and interest. Islington is also the third party in a case between Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, and Welwyn and Hatfield council, Hertfordshire, which is due to come to court in April. Islington accounts for most of the Pounds 2.2m in principal sought by Morgan Grenfell. Islington council officials declined to comment on the sums involved. Other councils used swaps to hedge interest-rate exposure, but Islington in effect used the swaps market to raise money without breaching its borrowing limits. Bankers said the council was involved in 'deep-discount' swaps, in which banks made potential interest payments up-front. This has increased the amount of restitution banks can now seek from Islington. Other councils, such as Hammersmith and Fulham, west London, were more heavily exposed, but some put aside money to repay swaps, or have since made provisions against potential claims. Islington would not comment on whether it had made provisions. The council needs to cut its 1993-94 budget of Pounds 220m by Pounds 8m to avoid capping. Cost-cutting measures are due to be decided next month. From a legal point of view, the banks involved welcomed Friday's ruling as it has established that restitution is an appropriate path for them to pursue. Mr Konstantin Graf von Schweinitz, head of derivatives at Kleinwort Benson, said the ruling 'confirms the validity of pursuing restitutional claims, which councils at one stage disputed'. The High Court also heard points of law concerning a dispute between Kleinwort Benson and Sandwell council in the West Midlands, and ruled that restitution could be applied to swap agreements which had already been closed. The next test case is due go to the High Court on Monday. Kleinwort Benson is seeking restitution of Pounds 1.6m of payments made to South Tyneside. If Islington does decide to appeal, the pace of out-of-court settlements between banks and local councils, which would otherwise be expected to speed up as a result of Friday's ruling, could subside until the process is completed. Interest continues to accumulate during the appeal process, which could last another year.</p>

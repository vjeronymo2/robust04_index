President Mubarak said that Egyptians are committed to the  continuation of the economic reform program, even though they  have suffered from some of its side effects, because they  realize that today's sacrifices will ensure economic prosperity  in the future.    In a comprehensive interview with the French magazine  POLITIQUE INTERNATIONALE [INTERNATIONAL POLICY], President  Mubarak said fundamentalism is a phenomenon that exists in all  societies and it is wrong to view it as concerning only Islam.  He added that the real objective of the terrorist groups is to  seize power and they are using Islam as a cover.    The president said: We are capable of resolving the  terrorism problem and of putting it in its true perspective.    He also stressed that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles is irrevocable because it reflects the feelings of  the great majority of Palestinians and Israelis even though the  agreement is not ideal. He added that the UN resolutions are  the reference point and framework for the peace process and that  the current negotiations are hard and need both patience and  time. He stressed that history does not repeat itself.    On the current Arab developments, President Mubarak said: No  one is happy with the Iraqi people's tribulations. We are  looking forward to the day when it will be over.</p>

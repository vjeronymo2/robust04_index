			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / The appeal of an incoherent ideology: It is five years since the Wall fell and the world changed. Western politicians have not yet adjusted Five years have crawled by since the fall of the Berlin Wall and still we have not begun to comprehend the consequences for liberal democracy. Before November 9 1989, political discourse in the west was clear. Today all is murky. Before the fall, an era that historians may come to label BF, the foreign policy of members of the Atlantic alliance could be defined in a single sentence. We had to counter the Soviet threat. Now, AF, the most powerful incentive for action by US or European governments is the appearance of this war or that disaster on the little screen. In the four decades BF, Nato was our bulwark; in year 6 AF we must wonder, as a distinguished American did privately the other day, whether there is any point to a defence alliance that everyone wants to join. In that other, BF, world the political union of the nations of western Europe seemed a sensible form of defence against ideological seepage from the east. Now the reasons for the existence of the European Union are less clear. As a regional market it may make sense. As a political unit, an embryonic super-state, it does not. The number of members will nearly double if all potential applicants to the east and north join. The likely outcome is that there will be a loose Gaullist confederation, its affairs heavily influenced by a tight, German-managed, inner circle. No one has begun to learn how to handle that. While the wall stood, domestic politics were not difficult to understand. In most developed western democracies the choice lay between parties that broadly supported the free market and those that did not. In the US the Democrats were perceived as the purveyors of big government, the Republicans of minimalism. Today, AF, all serious politicians embrace the market and some question the purpose of government itself. As a pair of generalities that is clear enough. The trouble is that, once having uttered them, no party seems to have a coherent idea of what to do next. While they savour their triumph in this week's mid-term elections, the Republicans might reflect that they are as ideologically confused as the rest of us. Daniel Finkelstein, who recently picked at the intellectual threads of US conservatism, could vouch for this. Mr Finkelstein is director of the Social Market Foundation, a think-tank that publishes papers more or less apposite to its name. He has discerned four separate intellectual strands among thinkers on the American right. Some Republicans remain wedded to what Margaret Thatcher, as she then was, called rolling back the frontiers of the state. Others would reform government by deregulating, decentralising, and cutting taxes. A further group looks to the re-establishment of moral values, particularly in regard to sexual behaviour. That lot should be watched. Protestant fundamentalism is a peculiarly US menace. Finally, the Republicans harbour protectionists, isolationists, and those who would erect barriers to immigration. These disparate factions just might come together now that they see a chance of winning the presidency in 1996. Do not bet on it. There will be as many different ideological messages preached as there are Republicans who picture themselves running for the White House. Echoes of many of the elements in US conservative thinking could be found among Bill Clinton's 'new Democrats' during the latter's victorious campaign two years ago. The Republicans' 'Contract with America', published in time for last week's elections, implied continued federal spending and promised a balanced budget as well as lower taxes. The 1992 offering by the Clinton Democrats made about the same amount of sense. The American middle class, which dominates the voting, is plainly as mixed up as the politicians it elects. Nowhere is the frustrating search for a political programme suited to our AF era more evident than in Britain. The Conservative party is an unruly coalition of free market liberals, continental-style Christian Democrats, would-be fundamentalists, ranting little Englanders and sophisticated internationalists. The resemblance to Mr Finkelstein's conservative Republicans is plain. The government wants more privatisation, but is hamstrung over the Post Office. It wants to be at the heart of Europe, yet fight 'federalism'. It proposes less government, yet seeks to extend the hand of the state into every classroom, hospital and police station. It offers individual liberty, while preaching 'family values'. The policies put forward by Tony Blair's 'new' Labour party seem less self-contradictory, but that may be because there are so few of them. The Labour leader does not seek to return Britain to the 1970s, when his party was last in charge. After the fall that would be impossible. We must move on, he said this week. He spoke of Britain's 'world-class firms and industries', talked of 'putting customers first', sought to tackle 'welfare dependency', and, in a fit of inspiration, spoke of individual business men and women helping a Labour government in a 'whole range of quasi-governmental activities'. His listeners, executives who support 'business in the community' may have fancied they saw the speaker grow pretty blonde hair and sprout a handbag on his wrist. At the next election in 1996 or 1997, British voters may well choose a business-friendly Labour party, complete with the promise of seats on quangos for Tories and businessmen. The leader of the people's party says that you will not even have to contribute to Conservative funds to get such an appointment. He has no manifesto yet, but, believe me, it will promise welfare reform, national renewal, a sense of community, more jobs, better education - and low taxes. It will speak to the disquiet many people feel at 'unfettered' free markets. The Conservatives will offer the same, with tax cuts up front. In the AF world there are no competing philosophies, just competing nuances.</p>

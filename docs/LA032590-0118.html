			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: USC NOSE TACKLE SUFFERS BROKEN LEFT ANKLE IN DRILL  </P> <P> USC nose tackle Don Gibson suffered a broken left ankle Saturday in a game-type  spring practice scrimmage at the Coliseum.  </P> <P> Gibson played only in the Rose Bowl game against Michigan after being sidelined  during the regular season while recuperating from surgery on his left knee.  </P> <P> USC Coach Larry Smith said losing Gibson in 1989 was a blow to the team, and he  had expected to rebuild the defensive line around him this year.  </P> <P> On the last play of the scrimmage, watched by about 3,000, freshman quarterback  Reggie Perry suffered a dislocated left elbow. Perry, a 6-foot-2, 195-pound  athlete from Denison, Tex., reminds Smith of Rodney Peete because of his  running style. MAL FLORENCE  </P></p>

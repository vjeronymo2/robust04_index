			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (2): Stimuli for freer trade / Probing the reasons for the continuing spread of bilateral tax treaties Double tax treaties form a crucial link between the tax systems of nation states. They allocate taxing authority between contracting countries and bring certainty to the taxation of cross-border transactions. The presence or absence of a tax treaty is often a factor in international business and investment location decisions. It is now fully accepted that treaties facilitate international flows of goods, capital, services and technology. However, countries sign treaties for different motives. Most OECD countries regard treaties as providing a standard framework for all countries in allocating taxing jurisdiction. The US now sees treaties as primarily a tool for obtaining information for tax compliance purposes and to deal with double taxation in relation to specific trading and investment relationships. Developing countries view treaties as an indication of fiscal stability. The most dense network of bilateral treaties is among OECD members. The network between the most industrialised countries is now largely complete and activity is generally limited to re-negotiating and updating treaties to deal with changes in domestic law and new thinking on treaty issues. Among emerging market countries, however, the treaty network is expanding rapidly. India, Mexico and South Africa are swiftly expanding and updating their tax treaty relations as they modernise their economies and open up to increased foreign investment. Such countries commonly view tax treaties as a key tool in giving foreign investors confidence in their stability. As a result, most new treaties entered by emerging market countries tend to be with major capital exporting countries. Although the basic framework of international tax treaties has been established for some time, both in the OECD and United Unions Model Treaty, several key issues have emerged recently. In order to encourage investment in developing countries, a number of them have introduced so-called tax sparing credits. This arrangement is designed to ensure that tax incentives given in developing countries are not neutralised when foreign investors repatriate their profits to the home country. The mechanism treats income which has not been taxed in the developing countries, because of local incentives, as if it had been taxed for the purpose of applying the foreign tax credit at the multinational's corporate headquarters. A number of countries are increasingly questioning this policy. The UK, for example, is only prepared to provide tax sparing relief for very specific incentives in developing countries. This has largely arisen as a result of the fact that businesses in emerging markets are now competing with those in developed countries aided by the tax sparing credit. This is particularly so in the area where local tax reliefs are aimed at export industries. The US has never agreed to tax sparing in its treaties and has stated that it will not do so. In many cases, the tax issues in double tax treaties end up involving issues of allocation of tax income between the two countries in question. The taxpayer is caught in the middle of this process and, in some cases, may even have little interest in the outcome. Arbitration clauses are becoming a popular way to resolve these issues. New treaties negotiated by the US with Germany, Mexico and the Netherlands contain arbitration clauses. Similar clauses are also found in new German treaties with Sweden and France. While there are many unresolved questions, this is an idea whose time has come. Treaty shopping is also emerging as a crucial issue in relation to both the negotiation of new tax treaties and the application of existing treaties. While most tax administrations seem to agree that this is a bad thing, there is little agreement on the solution. The US has taken the lead and sought to include extremely broad comprehensive anti-abuse provisions. In testimony before the US Senate foreign relations committee, assistant Secretary (Tax Policy) Leslie Samuel said that the previous Dutch tax treaty was one of the most widely abused of the US treaties. He claimed it was used by investors from all over the world for investing in the US in order to receive benefits to which they were not properly entitled. In the new US-Netherlands Treaty, there is a detailed rigorous anti-abuse provision. Other countries take a more focused view. The UK Inland Revenue, for example, has stated that it prefers narrowly targeted responses to perceived problems. These have mainly comprised specific provisions on such matters as interest and royalties. The Netherlands too has taken a more pragmatic approach. It has been suggested there, for example, that the concepts of beneficial ownership and residence provide a reasonable basis for combating improper use, particularly when supplemented by an adequate exchange of information.

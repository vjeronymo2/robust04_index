			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Yefimovich Nikolayev, president of </F> the Sakha Republic, conducted by Robert Serebrennikov: "Mikhail  Nikolayev, President of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) and Federal  Assembly Deputy, Is VOSTOCHNYY EKSPRESS' Guest"]    [Text] [Serebrennikov] Mikhail Yefimovich, what has the  past year meant for your republic?    [Nikolayev] The main goal we set was to prevent a decline in  production. Today the republic's budget is balanced -- as we  earn, so we will also live. I can say with confidence that power  production, the diamond industry, gold mining and the coal  industry will achieve their proper levels.    We are shifting our economy to a market-based system, but in  the Far North there are some industries and individual  enterprises that are unprofitable for the republic. For example,  a combine that mines and manufactures tin concentrates in the  Arctic. Its annual output as measured in current prices  established by the government of the Russian Federation is  around R12 billion [rubles]. Yet our expenditures for it are  R50-60 billion! We would shut the combine down as unsuited to a  market economy, but we must also consider Russia's interests.    Also, we mine approximately 14 million tonnes of anthracite  coal, yet we consume only 4 million. We export the rest. And the  more coal we mine, the more money we lose! Worse yet, our  customers -- Amur Oblast, Khabarovsk and Maritime krays and  Chelyabinsk -- are not paying for the shipments they receive. So  we have to make up for the shortfalls out of our meager budget.    Additionally, there are also strategic issues. For example,  construction of a railroad. We would have to build it and equip  it at our own expense. But it is Russia that really needs the  railroad!    We have a great many problems. If they are not solved that  will be bad for Russia. It is time for us to move away from  political games and toward practical action. Else it will only  be words when we talk about "reviving Russia" or a "great  Russia." I hope that beginning in 1994 our parliament will begin  working for the good of all citizens.    [Serebrennikov] How is the situation with regard to  attracting foreign investment to your republic?    [Nikolayev] The Sakha Republic currently has economic ties  with 22 countries around the world, and approximately 30 joint  ventures with foreign companies have been established. We intend  to update equipment in the coal, diamond, food and local  industries and in the river transportation system.    However, by establishing joint ventures to solve some of our  problems we divide the profits with foreign companies, i.e. we  create jobs in their countries. In my opinion this problem  should be resolved with the help of Russia's lines of credit, by  creating and expanding internal debt. That way we could take our  larger loans, using a large mineral deposit as collateral, using  our gold, of which we have more than enough untapped reserves.  Then we would pay back that loan in 5-10 years.    [Serebrennikov] When people talk about Yakutia they never  fail to mention its diamonds...    [Nikolayev] In 1993 our republic's diamond industry met its  plan goals in every regard, both financially and in terms of  output.    Shifting that industry to market-based structures has been  one of the main achievements of the past year. We have  established a joint-stock company called Almazy Rossii-Sakha,  which hold the reins to the mining, sorting, storage and sale of  diamonds and the production of gem-quality stones. This very  large diamond company, which is without parallel either in  Russia or anywhere else in the world, ended its first year of  operations with a profit.    Right now the issue is not how to increase diamond  production, but rather how many diamonds we can sell. Therefore  we follow this rule: we will only mine as many diamonds as we  can sell.    Last year six stonecutting plants opened in the republic.  There are plans to start up another eight diamond-cutting  enterprises in 1994. They will employ approximately 2,000  diamond cutters.    It is our hope that in 1994 the Russian Federation will open  a diamond exchange, the first in our country and only the fourth  in the world. Why should we export our diamonds and sell them in  London or Belgium? Let foreign buyers come to us!    We need a real market for the sale of gem-quality diamonds.  Incidentally, the first auction of gem-quality diamonds was held  in Yakutsk in late December.    I should add that the well-known agreement between Russia  and  the South African firm De Beers is being complied with 100  percent, and that the other side has had no complaints.    As for diamond deposits in Arkhangelsk Oblast, the Almazy  Rossii-Sakha Company is prepared to help develop them on a  shareholder basis, depending on the volume of diamonds to be  mined.    [Serebrennikov] What is your view of your republic's future?    [Nikolayev] We have many problems, but the work is  interesting. The most important thing is that no one hold us  back. Right now it is not inflation that bothers us, but instead  mutual payments and the confiscatory tax and lending policy  (with interest rates for loans of up to 400 percent!). The Far  North cannot go on like this: we need government protectionism  and a favorable lending and tax policy.    We are currently considering establishing an International  Bank for the Reconstruction and Development of the Arctic, of  which we would like to be the founders. We also intend to work  on establishing an academy to study the Arctic. And much is  being done toward social protection for our people.    Despite the difficult times we live in, our republic remains  peaceful and calm. And that, I am sure you will agree, is no  small accomplishment.</p>

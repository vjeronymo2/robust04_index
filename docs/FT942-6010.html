			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Lines open up to Europe's information society: The long-awaited Bangemann report says liberalisation of telecoms is unstoppable It is too late for member states of the European Union to stand in the way of telecommunications liberalisation, Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, insisted yesterday. Presenting a summary of recommendations from his long-awaited 'Information Society' report, Mr Bangemann said: 'Our purpose is to make clear that we cannot hold up this process. Nobody can.' To be presented to EU leaders at next month's summit in Corfu, the report says member states must accelerate the process of liberalisation by opening up to competition those infrastructures and services that remain monopolistic. Flanked by senior figures from the electronics industry, Mr Bangemann said: 'Private investors will only get involved in a market which promises a return on their investment.' The report highlights some of the challenges that lie ahead for the Union if it is to keep abreast of rapid developments in the field of telecommunications. For example, it raises the prospect that out-dated and anachronistic laws in areas such as media ownership, intellectual property rights and security of information will have to be replaced if the EU is to have an appropriate regulatory framework. It identifies a number of areas where cross-border differences could continue to hinder an internal market in telecommunications. It recommends, for instance, that urgent attention be paid to the problem of media ownership, where divergent national legislation could undermine the free movement of information. Currently, rules governing media ownership between the member states differ widely. With different media services gliding ever more easily across frontiers, failure to harmonise these rules could lead to problems of access. The report adds that effective rules to ensure that ownership is not concentrated in one or two powerful hands must also be put in place. On intellectual property protection, the report lacks specifics but highlights the need to adjust the present outdated rules, many of which were invented before information and creative products could be dispersed as easily as they are now. The report also urges the EU to speed up the process of European standardisation, making interconnection of networks a primary objective. And, as a matter of urgency, international long-distance and leased-line tariffs should be adjusted to bring them into line with rates practised in other advanced industrialised regions, it says. The group of industrialists that helped Mr Bangemann have also recommended that tariffs for mobile telecommunications be reduced, and that a regulatory framework for satellite be established. As for funding, the report says that 'the creation of the information society should be entrusted to the private sector and to market forces'. However, the recommendations are vague on the issue of existing public funding, saying only that it should be 'refocused more specifically to target the requirements of the information society'. Finally, it recommends that, given the urgency of the tasks ahead, member states should now nominate individual ministers to represent it at a new council of ministers dedicated to the information society.</p>

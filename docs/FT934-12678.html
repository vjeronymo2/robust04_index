			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UN warns Haiti of new sanctions THE United Nations Security Council yesterday threatened additional sanctions against Haiti's military rulers unless an accord calling for the restoration of deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was fully implemented. The new warning was announced as UN special envoy Dante Caputo continued intensive efforts in Haiti aimed at Mr Aristide's return by a Saturday deadline. Mr Aristide's return was originally agreed as part of a United Nations-brokered plan aimed at restoring Haiti to democracy. The plan was signed on New York's Governor Island last July by Mr Aristide and army chief General Raoul Cedras, who overthrew him in a 1991 coup. The threatened new sanctions would include a complete trade embargo, on top of an arms and oil ban and a freeze on financial assets that were reimposed last week. Haitian legislators will begin debate today on new laws proposed by pro-military parliamentarians, which would include a broad amnesty for all political crimes committed since the military forced Mr Aristide out two years ago. Legislators are also to consider the broadening of Mr Aristide's cabinet to include supporters of the military, and legislation to separate the army and the police. 'It is essential the parliament meets (today),' Mr Caputo said yesterday. Mr Robert Malval, the premier appointed by Mr Aristide, and Gen Cedras, the army leader, met last night to discuss Gen Cedras' undertaking to step aside as soon as parliament ratifies the new laws, but little progress was made in the talks and the two will meet again on Wednesday. There are doubts that MPs who support Mr Aristide will attend parliament today. Most went into hiding a fortnight ago when an armed gang, held to be supporters of the military, invaded parliament and abducted some members.</p>

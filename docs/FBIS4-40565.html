			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Yuriy Kozlov and </F> Boris Krivoshey]    [Text] Moscow June 16 TASS -- Russia should remain the  "locomotive of reform", and the stronger the Russian state will  be politically and economically, the better it will be for the  other CIS countries and integration, according to Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.    Speaking at a Foreign Policy Council meeting devoted to  further integration in the Commonwealth of Independent States,  Kozyrev noted that Russia is also interested in the all-round  strengthening of the CIS member-countries, so that she would be  surrounded by stable states. He said Russia was ready for as  much integration as its partners desired.    Kozyrev pointed out that there are a lot of far-reaching  ideas being bandied about now, such as Kazakhstan President  Nursultan Nazarbayev's proposal to create a Euroasian Union, or  ideas about forming a confederation.    From Russia's point of view, any of these proposals would be  acceptable. However, "it would be best to avoid a situation in  which the proposal and discussion of such promising ideas does  not hinder us in solving specific pressing problems, or distract  our attention from them", Kozyrev said. He stated that it was  most important to concentrate joint efforts on coordinating  legislative activity and searching for ways to make the CIS  interparliamentary assembly more effective.    The Foreign Policy Council's meeting was attended by  representatives from the parliament, various ministeries and  departments, political and public organisations, and the clergy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["(mst)"-signed report: "Ruml Does Not Want a Deputy From </F> the Christian Democratic Party"]    [Excerpt] Prague -- Interior Minister Jan Ruml declared  yesterday that he does not need another deputy in his ministry.  He was replying to a question on whether he accepts the demand  from Christian Democratic Party [KDS] Deputy Chairman Vaclav  Benda for one of the deputy interior minister's posts for his  party, a post that -- according to Benda-- should compensate the  KDS for the fact that his party did not obtain the post of  attorney general. The interior minister declared that, at the  moment, he has three deputies from the coalition parties and  Deputy Minister Fendrych, "whom he needs." According to Jan  Ruml, he does not need to increase the number of deputy  ministers merely to satisfy the ambitions of certain people from  the KDS.    Nevertheless, Ruml admitted that the KDS has a claim to this  post in accordance with the coalition agreements. If, however,  coalition representatives begin to negotiate on a potential  deputy interior minister from among the ranks of the KDS, Jan  Ruml intends to "enter very forcibly" into these negotiations.

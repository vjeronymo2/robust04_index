			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / New strike threat at General Motors TENSION between General Motors, the largest US car-maker, and the United Auto Workers union mounted yesterday after workers at a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, authorised strike action and talks over the weekend failed to resolve a dispute over job security and sub-contracting, writes Nikki Tait from New York. Industrial action by 2,300 workers at a metal stamping facility in Lordstown has already shut down production there, forcing GM to close two car assembly plants. Late on Friday, UAW leaders at the second Lordstown plant, a smaller car assembly factory, authorised strike action within five days.</p>

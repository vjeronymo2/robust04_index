			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, New York, April 20, IRNA -- Iran's  deputy foreign minister for international affairs, Mohammad  Javad Zarif here today called for the establishment of a zone  free from weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East,  formation of security and cooperation arrangements in the  Persian Gulf area, and reduction of military expenditures  including agreement on a ceiling for international arms purchase  and transfer to each country in the area.    Addressing the United Nations Disarmament Commission, he  also  called for the establishment of a forum in which concerns and  suggestions of Persian Gulf states in the area of security and  armaments could be aired and debated.    He also called for the inclusion of new items on illicit  arms  trade on the agenda of the commission.    He added, "This issue, which has very direct and close links  to international drug trafficking as well as terrorism, has had  serious consequences for the security of a number of states  across the globe. Like terrorism and drug menace, illicit arms  trade is an international problem, requiring international  cooperation, and a common approach. The commission can thus  play a very constructive role by establishing guidelines and  pointing areas of mutual effort and cooperation."    Stressing nuclear disarmament and destruction of existing  nuclear weapons, he said, "It is also self evident that the most  effective guarantee against the use of nuclear weapons is  nuclear disarmament, including destruction of all existing  nuclear arsenals. Furthermore, the obvious fact that no  non-proliferation scheme will succeed so long as nuclear  disarmament is not clearly in perspective should not be  overlooked."    Referring to the collapse of the bipolar world order, he  said, "States that hold massive stockpiles of nuclear weapons  have, at least, a moral obligation to explain to the  international community as to what remains as the logic behind  maintaining nuclear weapons. The world has the right to know who  these weapons are intended for and who they are to deter any  more."    "It is quite shocking that no major country possessing  nuclear weapons really come forward in this regard. At the same  time, they seek unlimited extension of the Non-Proliferation  Treaty, making it absolutely clear that even the ultimate goal  remains non- proliferation rather than eradication of nuclear  weapon which is indeed the stated objective of the treaty,"  Zarif said.    Referring to the discriminations inherent in the  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), he said, "Probably the most  important and fundamental flaw in the international  non-proliferation regime is the application of double standards  which has led to selective proliferation of nuclear weapons."    This has not only gravely undermined the authority and  relevance of the NPT, but also had serious ramifications for  international and regional peace and security, and retarded  regional initiatives, he added.    On Israel's negative role in the establishment of a  nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, Zarif said, "In our  region, the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Israel has foiled  all efforts for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone  in the Middle East, despite General Assembly's unanimous and  continuous endorsement for the past two decades of the idea put  forward originally by Iran in 1974."    Elsewhere on the NPT Zarif said, "The states which are  renouncing the nuclear option through the NPT must be granted  full access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes."    On the chemical weapons, Zarif said that the arbitrary  limitations on transfer of material and technology has already  had its negative effects on discussions to formulate  verification mechanisms related to the convention on the  prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of  bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and their  destruction.    The enthusiasm of many countries to sign the convention will  give way to reluctance and indifference when the time for  ratification and implementation arrives, he said.    An intrusive verification system may hamper development in  the field of peaceful use in another very significant area, he  said, adding that real guarantees and commitments for removal of  all restrictions as well as transfer of material and related  technology by the producing countries before considering new  verification system is necessary.</p>

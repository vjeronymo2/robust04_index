			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to financial liability for extra hospital days, the adjusted average per capita cost calculation includes these costs. We would be overpaying if a separate payment was made to plans for these charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We will not shift these costs to the Medicare enrollee because fee-for-service beneficiaries are already protected, and we believe that beneficiaries should be treated similarly whether they choose managed care or fee-for-service. We do not believe this difference in protections should have to be a factor in the beneficiaries' choice. Further, we believe that financial responsibility for extra hospital days related to an appeal would be a strong disincentive to any beneficiary who questions the appropriateness of a discharge decision. Such a requirement would undermine the intent of an appeals process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that we mischaracterized the HMO's and CMP's responsibility for discharge decisions in the preamble of the proposed rule. The commenter stated that the final authority for discharge rests with the physician and that HMOs/CMPs cannot discharge enrollees from a hospital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree that the preamble should have referred to ``noncoverage'' decisions by the HMO/CMP rather than ``discharge'' decisions. The right to immediate PRO review affects  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> noncoverage  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> decisions in cases in which the HMO/CMP and its affiliated physicians agree that a Medicare enrollee no longer requires hospitalization and the hospital does not make the noncoverage decision. We also believe that the use of the term ``attending physician'' in proposed &sect;&sect;417.440 (f)(2) and (f)(4) (which require concurrence of a physician in the discharge decision) does not clearly express the relationship between the HMO/CMP and its affiliated physician providers. Therefore, in the final rule we have removed the term ``attending physician'' and inserted ``its affiliated physician responsible for the hospital care of the enrollee, or other physician as authorized by the HMO or CMP'' in its place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the attending physician should be allowed to represent his or her patients and request PRO review of noncoverage decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Usually, the HMO/CMP-affiliated physician makes the decision that a Medicare enrollee is ready for discharge. Some HMOs/CMPs make use of an extended treatment team, such as case managers, discharge coordinators, or utilization review coordinators, and a member of this team may believe an enrollee is ready for discharge when the physician does not. In these situations, the health plan's internal procedures will provide guidance for making the discharge decision. HMO/CMP physicians have legal arrangements or contracts with their health plans, and must abide by the plan's procedures. We support the HMO/CMP structure for the delivery of health care, and we would not support a policy that undermines the nature of managed care operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In cases in which the physician caring for a hospitalized enrollee is not under contract or bound by the terms of an arrangement with an HMO/CMP, the physician could represent the patient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter believed that the time period (1 working day) for the HMO/CMP to submit information to the PRO is unreasonable and is concerned that PROs may take longer than 1 day to complete their review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We do not agree with the commenter. Under the fee-for-service Medicare program, hospitals have their charts ready to submit to the PRO at the same time that the notice of noncoverage is given. This, in effect, gives the PRO another working day to review the medical chart. We believe HMOs/CMPs can adopt the same efficiencies and that it is in the financial interest of the HMO/CMP to ensure that all records are submitted as soon as possible. In regard to PRO timeliness, the PROs have an excellent record for completing these reviews in the time allotted and, in many cases, earlier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters believed that the proposed appeals process should be available to Medicare enrollees in nursing homes and those receiving home health services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We will consider this comment for regulatory action at a later date. This modification is significant enough to require issuance of a second proposed rule, and we believe that this final rule should not be delayed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked that &sect;417.440(f)(3) be revised to add the date of discharge to the list of information the notice of noncoverage will include.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We believe that HMOs and CMPs should have the flexibility either to use the Medicare hospital notice of noncoverage or to develop their own. In our interactions with PROs and hospitals on this matter, the inclusion or absence of the discharge date on the notice has not been identified as a problem or a concern. Therefore we have not modified this provision in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several provisions of &sect;417.454 appear to have been dropped as part of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The revision to &sect;417.454 as published in the proposed rule does remove existing paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3). This was done in error and is corrected in the final rule. In the final rule, a paragraph heading is added to existing paragraph (a); the new provision that limits charges for inpatient hospital stays is added as a new paragraph (b); and a paragraph heading is added to existing paragraph (b), and the paragraph redesignated as paragraph (c). No modification is made to other existing text in section &sect;417.454.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

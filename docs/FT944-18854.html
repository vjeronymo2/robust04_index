			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth boosts Chesterton Chesterton International, the property agency and consultancy which made its Stock Exchange debut in June, has reported an increase in full year pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 5.2m, beating its forecast at flotation. Turnover increased to Pounds 55.8m (Pounds 48.8m) reflecting growth in both fee-earning advisory business and agency commissions. Agency income, which depends heavily on the level of trading activity in the property market, accounted for 31 per cent of turnover, up from 28 per cent. Mr Giles Ballantine, chief executive, said all regions of the UK showed strong growth. The company's offices in the North of England and Scotland turned in especially strong performances, with turnover rising to Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 6m). Revenue from London offices grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 23.6m, about half of UK turnover. Despite its position as one of the largest UK agents, Chesterton estimates that its domestic market share is only 2-3 per cent. During the year it acquired Consolidated FPM, the facilities management company and Conroy Hunter, the Scottish property agency. Chesterton also formed a joint venture with Binswanger, the US property consultancy, to handle facilities management projects for multinational clients. Turnover in property management rose from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 10.75m; professional advisory work, including rating and valuations, from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 16.4m and specialist services from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 6.25m. Overseas turnover was Pounds 4m, up from 2.9m. Earnings per share were 7.1p, against 5.8p. Lex, Page 22</p>

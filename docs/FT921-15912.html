			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / The Guinness Trial: Seelig statements on invoice 'differed' MR ROGER SEELIG, a former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, gave Mr Graham Walsh, then head of the corporate finance division, inconsistent explanations of a Pounds 1.65m invoice the bank sent to Guinness, Mr Walsh said yesterday. Mr Walsh told the jury at Southwark Crown Court that Mr Seelig initially told him that Pounds 1.35m represented commission on the placing of Distillers shares converted into Guinness shares. Mr Seelig had said that other items accounted for the balance. Mr Seelig had not suggested that the invoice related to a loss Morgan had made or might make on Guinness shares it had bought from LF Rothschild, a New York investment bank. After Department of Trade and Industry inspectors began investigating Guinness Mr Seelig told Mr Walsh the invoice had included a 'cushion' to protect Morgan against loss on Guinness shares. Mr Walsh, now a non-executive director of Haslemere Estates and Moss Bros Group, said he had been surprised, because there had been no loss. 'I was astonished that anybody would agree to pay the bank for a paper loss which had never been realised,' he said. Miss Elizabeth Gloster QC, prosecuting, asked: 'Did you consider that was consistent with what he had told you earlier?' Mr Walsh: 'I did not.' He was giving evidence in the trial in which Mr Seelig and Lord Spens, former corporate finance managing director at the Henry Ansbacher merchant bank, deny fraud and false accounting. Mr Walsh said he had not known during Guinness's bid for Distillers in 1986 that LF Rothschild had bought Guinness shares at Mr Seelig's request. After the bid closed Mr Seelig told him he was trying to organise an orderly disposal of Guinness shares purchased during the bid by 'friends' of Guinness, including LF Rothschild. Mr Seelig had said there had been no agreements or arrangements requiring the purchases to be disclosed under takeover rules. Miss Gloster asked what Mr Walsh's reaction would have been if Mr Seelig had told him LF Rothschild had been indemnified by Morgan Grenfell against loss. Mr Walsh said it would have been that the LF Rothschild purchase would in effect have been on Morgan Grenfell's behalf and should have been disclosed. What if Mr Seelig had said that Guinness would be covering any LF Rothschild loss? Miss Gloster asked. Mr Walsh said he would have been concerned about a possible infringement of section 151 of the 1985 Companies Act because he would have thought Guinness would have been giving financial assistance for the purchase of its own shares. The trial continues.</p>

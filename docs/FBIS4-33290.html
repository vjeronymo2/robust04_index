			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Colonel Pablo Rodriguez Meza by </F> reporter Marianela Samper; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Contemporary history has a few examples of armies,  which during times of economic recession in their countries,  have made small contributions to help their countries emerge  from the crisis. Today, I want to discuss certain  characteristics of the Cuban military, which throughout all  these years of revolution, has directly contributed with  agricultural, construction, investigative, and medical services,  with direct links to the people they belong to.    Without neglecting their primary defensive work, the Cuban  Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] currently carry out a number of  economic tasks intended both to reduce the state budget and  guarantee troop provisions, with the surplus going to the people.    I found one example of this in the Eastern Army's Chemical  Defense Regiment. Beside being the best of its kind in  accomplishing its fundamental work, the regiment keeps its  armament and techniques in an excellent state, despite special  period difficulties. The regiment cares for 20 caballerias of  land to boost the troop's food program. This work goes beyond  their area of responsibility with tasks that are coordinated  with civilian institutions for the benefit of the population.  This work is explained to us by Col. Pablo Rodriguez Meza:    [Begin recording] [Rodriguez] We have participated in  several  assignments together with civilians. For example, the  fumigation of several municipalities because of the recent  mosquito outbreak in the city. We have carried out this  fumigation jointly with the Public Health Ministry; we have  rendered this service. We have done the same in some schools.    [Samper] In these cases, you supply both the experience and  the equipment?    [Rodriguez] The service and the equipment.    [Samper] Do you have a plan to work jointly in areas where  the environment has been contaminated?    [Rodriguez] No, our work it not with the environment. We are  working with certain factories that use toxic industrial  products; we help to neutralize these products and transport  them to safe places. For this, we have detailed plans. We  recently worked along these lines in the Artemisa Municipality.    [Samper] When you say neutralize, is this some sort of  substance you apply or is it a protection system?    [Rodriguez] It is a protection system that allows us to  neutralize the toxic products, ensure they do not contaminate,  and transport them in containers to safe places. [end recording]</p>

According to data from the republic's Institute for  Preventative Medicine, last year there were 561 cases, as  opposed to 922 in 1992. The Director of the Institute for  Epidemiology and Microbiology, Dr. Dusko Panev, cautioned that  brucellosis remains a serious problem in the republic. In view  of the unquestionable effect of the struggle against the spread  of this animal disease among humans, there will not only be a  continuing campaign against it in the forthcoming period, but  also a determined "plugging" of some "cracks" in the defensive  lines.    First and foremost, explained Dr. Panev, the number of  opstinas [townships] and inhabited places where the disease has  been registered does not show such a great decline. More  precisely, if in 1992 brucellosis was in evidence in 177  inhabited places within 22 opstinas, last year the disease  "climbed" in 150 inhabited places within 19 opstinas, in other  words, it remained present on the territory throughout the  republic. In the previous period, the "hottest" places were the  districts of Strumica (133 as opposed to 154 cases in 1992),  Radovis (103), Valandovo (45), Skopje (59), Kumanovo,  Veles...[as published]    In contrast to the still problematic private sector, the  social sector is much more effective in the struggle against  this animal disease. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated  that the reasons for the spread are most often connected with  contact of the individual producers and through the consumption  of impure milk and cheese from goats and sheep.    According to Dr. Panev, "Despite all the effort, it is still  possible to find milk producers at the market who do not have  adequate safety certification. And it is exactly from such food  items that people have become ill with brucellosis in the past  few years. Earlier, this disease was a job-related illness of  herdsmen and veterinarians. But now, the victims are those who  have not observed commonly accepted preventive measures,  (pasturizing milk and cheese) both among families raising  livestock and those supplied by them."    The struggle against brucellosis is a complex, longterm  process that may take several decades. Since 1980, when the  disease appeared here in epidemic form, the main forces in the  eradication campaign have been veterinarians and health workers.  Dr. Panev explained that, last year alone, medical personnel  carried out more than 13,000 serological tests and more than  14,000 medical examinations, placed 426 inhabited places under  medical supervision, and visited 1,184 sites....    With early detection of the disease and the use of effective  medicines, the intensity and the channels through which the  disease is transmitted from one medium to another are localized  and defenses are established. In this area, cooperation with  veterinary bodies is exceptional. Meanwhile, the "gates" have  opened a little for some other organizations whose participation  is necessary to increase the effectiveness of the effort.  Foremost in this respect are the police organzations that are  often overlooked in the transportation of livestock; they should  be demanding the compulsory "veterinary" certificates which are  shown for exactly these reasons. The services should also  provide compensation for the sick animals that are destroyed.  But when the "injured parties" are humble, it is not surprising  that some shepherds see the solution to their problems in  marketing products from sick animals in a neighboring villages  or opstinas.... This cycle, in any case, must be stopped.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Matif in link-up talks with competitors Matif, the French international futures and options exchange, is discussing electronic trading links with competitors in at least three additional European countries, its president said yesterday, writes Andrew Jack. The links would build on the system recently opened between Matif and Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), its Frankfurt-based equivalent, which allows French Matif members to trade two products offered by the DTB. Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, Matif president, said he had already had expressions of interest in building similar connections between Matif and its counterparts in Spain, the Netherlands and Switzerland.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: IBM bytes back IBM had no choice but to match Compaq's sharp price cuts for personal computers. Big Blue has already lost lead position in the US pc market to its slimmer and faster rival and cannot afford to see the erosion go much further. Even so, the company will be hard pressed to win a head-to-head price war. Compaq not only has lower costs. It has proved more adept at selling its boxes through dealers and has successfully established a reputation for selling high quality computers at low prices. Given that IBM's pc business is scarcely profitable, the price cuts of up to 27 per cent will cost it dearly. IBM's only alternative would be to differentiate its products from those of its rivals. Until recently, that seemed its strategy. It planned to push PowerPC, the chip it has developed with Apple and Motorola, as a new industry standard for personal computers. The snag is that software is typically written to work with the Intel chips which sit inside most pcs and, without a wide range of software, customers are unlikely to switch technology. The latest comments from IBM's new pc chief Mr Rick Thoman indicate that he is retreating from the PowerPC strategy. IBM is therefore reduced to joining the price war. To hold its own, the pc division will have to slash costs and transform its sleepy culture. IBM, under its chairman Mr Louis Gerstner, has already surprised financial markets by how quickly it can cut costs. So success cannot be ruled out. In the meantime, the real winner from the price war will be Intel.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Nestle/Perrier The warring parties in the Perrier struggle may have squared each other. But they have not yet satisfied the European Commission. Notwithstanding Nestle's efforts to belittle its significance, yesterday's decision that Brussels is to proceed with a full investigation caught markets on the hop. Given that the merged businesses will have French market shares exceeding 50 per cent - even after ceding Volvic to BSN - there certainly seems a prima facie case for having a very close look. And with Sir Leon Brittan coming to the end of his term in charge of competition policy, the case may be his final opportunity to ruffle French feathers.</p>

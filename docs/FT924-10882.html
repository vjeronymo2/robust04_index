			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Martonyi moderately optimistic over Gabcikovo dam Hungary's chief negotiator, Mr Janos Martonyi, said yesterday he was 'moderately optimistic' that a way out of the impasse over the Gabcikovo dam could be worked out by Hungarian, Czechoslovak and EC negotiators who are now meeting in London. Hungary, which considers itself the aggrieved party because the dam changes the flow of the Danube river and could alter the international boundary with Slovakia, is pressing for ' a civilised European way of resolving the conflict through international arbitration,' he added. All sides cautioned, however, that the Slovak side has not yet agreed to arbitration.</p>

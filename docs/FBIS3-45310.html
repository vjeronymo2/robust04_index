The contract was signed in Tokyo today by the Bank of China  (BOC) and the Import and Export Bank of Japan.    According to BOC officials, this is the second Japanese  Government loan to China made specially to make up for the trade  imbalance between the two countries.    The first, made in 1987, totaled 30 billion Japanese yen.    BOC officials said that the loan would be used to accelerate  the construction of industrial projects in south China's Hainan  Province and in Qingdao of east China's Shandong Province.    Japan has been at the top of the list of China's trade  partners. In 1993, its trade surplus over China was close to 7.5  billion U.S. dollars.</p>

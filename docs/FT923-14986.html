			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Rate cut rumoured THE UK money markets were awash with rumours of a base rate cut after the Bank of England shaved its long term money market rates in morning operations. A feeling of uncertainty already prevailed after the US Federal Reserve cut its discount rate on Thursday. So when the Bank of England cut  1/32 of a point off its band-3 and band-4 rates to 9 5/8 per cent and 9 9/16 per cent respectively, speculation of a base rate cut swept the market. Three month money fell from around 10 per cent before the early operations to 9 27/32 per cent afterwards. The other, more likely, interpretation of the Bank's move was that it was trimming its dealing rates to keep them in line with market rates which had edged lower on Thursday following the US discount rate cut. One trader said: 'The Bank has been saying for quite a while that from time to time it will change the rates at which it intervenes in bills to more closely reflect the market rates.' Among optimistic traders the first interpretation took precedence, but opinion was divided. 'We are not sure about it here,' said one trader yesterday afternoon. 'We still think that UK rates are dependent on German rates and I think the sterling market exchange rate is still not firm enough for another cut.' Activity in sterling futures was extremely bullish. The September contract traded in a 16 basis point range, touching a high of 90.41 before settling at around 90.35. The December contract moved up by around 11 basis points to around 90.59. The rumours of a base rate cut made it difficult for the Bank to meet its forecast liquidity shortage as dealers held on to their assets. An initial shortage of Pounds 2.1bn was revised to Pounds 2.3bn later on. In the early round, when the Bank cut its long rates, it purchased only Pounds 266m of bills. This included Pounds 2m of band-3 bills at 9 5/8 per cent and Pounds 4m of band-4 bills at 9 9/16 per cent. In further morning operations the Bank bought Pounds 94m of bills. In the afternoon the Bank bought Pounds 938m of bills and provided late assistance of Pounds 585m. With the shortage unmet, the overnight rate rose sharply to around 16 per cent.</p>

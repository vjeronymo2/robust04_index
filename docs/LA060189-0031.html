			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TAKING THE PLUNGE;  </P> <P> SWIM SCHOOLS CAN TURN YOUR KID INTO A FISH  </P> <P> Have you noticed your 2-year-old begging you to extend the bath time?  </P> <P> Perhaps it's time for swimming lessons.  </P> <P> Swim schools flourish in the San Fernando Valley, where summertime temperatures  often are 25 degrees higher than in other parts of Los Angeles. Many schools  have parent-child programs that will introduce an infant or small child to the  joys of water with the parent's help.  </P> <P> "Avoid swim schools that use scare tactics," advises Rebecca McCain, aquatic  and youth specialist for the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Red Cross. She  emphasizes that children should never be pressured when learning to swim.  </P> <P> McCain cautions parents to avoid schools that guarantee to "waterproof" a child  within a definite time period. "If you find your child is not enjoying it, take  them out, they're not ready," McCain said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Red Cross-Certified  </P> <P> Swim schools are not required to hire certified instructors, but McCain  recommends choosing those with Red Cross-certified instructors on board.  </P> <P> Following is a list of area swim schools. Parents who are shopping around for  the right school may observe lessons at all locations.  </P> <P> Lucile Cowle's Swim School in Burbank specializes in teaching children who fear  water, and thus have facilities geared to that group. One of the school's two  heated indoor pools is just 3 1/2 feet deep.  </P> <P> Three instructors are certified to teach disabled children.  </P> <P> "When kids fall into a pool, they see a far wall and think that's the wall they  have to swim to," said Stephanie Nelson, school co-owner. "We teach young  children to turn around and swim back to the nearest wall."  </P> <P> For children aged 6 months to 5 years, 10 quarter-hour private lessons are  offered for $82. For youngsters 6 and over and adults, 10 half-hour lessons  cost $142. Lessons, which begin June 23, are offered in a series on Mondays,  Wednesdays and Fridays, or on Tuesdays and Thursdays or on Saturdays only.  </P> <P> Parents may join their children in the pool on Tuesdays, Thursdays and  Saturdays for a free, supervised practice session from 2 to 3:30 p.m. The  school is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and from 9 a.m. to  12:30 p.m. on Saturdays. 1619 Peyton Ave., Burbank, 91504. (818) 848-7206.  </P> <P> Jim Herrick's Swim School specializes in instructing beginning swimmers in the  dog paddle before other strokes are taught. All nine instructors are  CPR-certified, and many have Red Cross certification.  </P> <P> Ten 20-minute private lessons cost from $100 to $140, depending on the  instructor.

Advanced techniques, such as diving and racing  starts, are taught in the school's two heated outdoor pools. Children as young  as 18 months are accepted at the school, which opened in 1969.  </P> <P> Home instruction is available.

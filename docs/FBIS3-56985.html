He explained that other ways of safe storage were under study.    The admiral did not know if the tanker that the Japanese had  offered would do for the purpose. The ship must have a double  bottom, a double hull made of good steel, a good system for LRW  pumping in and out and equipment for turning liquid wastes into  solids.    This is a matter for the state to handle, the Navy  Commander-in- Chief said. The problem had become so acute, he  explained, because every agency used to set up its own system  for disposal of dangerous wastes; as a result no system for  their permanent storage was available. This matter is now being  dealt with by the Russian Atomic Industry Ministry.    Gromov said that these events (dumping the wastes in the sea  - IF) should not be dramatized. He said that there were no  traces of radioactive wastes as early as after 20 hours, their  concentration was so low and the Sea of Japan so pure.    Gromov did not confirm that Russia had sold a submarine to  North Korea. "If the navy sold anything to it, it was scrap  metal," he said.    He wanted Russia to keep the disputed Kuril Isles. "Russians  have been living there for a long time and Russia needs the  fish, land and deposits there."    The Navy Commander-in-Chief emphasized that, despite its  reduction and financial shortages, the Pacific Fleet was capable  of maintaining stability and safe shipping from the Chukotsk  Peninsula to the south of the Maritime Territory.    "The fleet will continue renovation albeit at a slower rate  in line with the new military doctrine," the admiral said.    He emphasized that Russia would not build aircraft carrying  ships for the Pacific Fleet and was surprised that the Japanese  were building one.    Speaking on navy reform in line with the new doctrine the  admiral said that the emphasis was placed on confidence  building, peace keeping missions and partnership with NATO and  other coalitions, in particular in the Pacific area.</p>

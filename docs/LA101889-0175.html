			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JERRY BUSS SHOPPING, HAS EYES ON S.D. PADRES  </P> <P> Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss says he's "in the market for a baseball  team" and will see about buying the San Diego Padres following owner Joan  Kroc's announcement that she is selling the club.  </P> <P> "I probably will make a call (today) and throw my hat in the ring," Buss said  after Kroc's statement on Tuesday that the franchise is on the block because  she wants to spend more time with her family. (Story, Section C).  </P> <P> "There comes a time in everyone's life when you have to look at your  priorities, and my first priority is my family," Kroc said. "So I intend to  semi-retire from public life to maximize the quality time I have with them, to  travel and to enjoy my own personal time."  </P> <P> Jerry Kapstein, a longtime player agent who is married to Kroc's daughter,  Linda, has been authorized to handle sale discussions with prospective buyers.  </P> <P> Sources have told The Times that the selling price could exceed $100 million,  which would be the largest amount ever paid for a team.  </P> <P> Buss, who has a house in Encinitas in northern San Diego County, said he is "in  the market for a baseball team."  </P> <P> "One hundred million for the Padres sounds a little high, offhand, but you  really don't know until you see the P-and-Ls (profit and loss statements) and  take a closer look at it," Buss said.  </P> <P> Buss noted that he wrote a letter to Kroc this summer asking about the  franchise's availability, but received a reply from her representatives saying  the club was not for sale.  </P> <P> The franchise is tied to the city by a lease agreement for use of San Diego  Jack Murphy Stadium that runs through March, 2000.  </P> <P> Kroc put the team up for sale in November, 1986, and a tentative agreement was  announced in March, 1987, to sell it to George Argyros, then the owner of the  Seattle Mariners. But the sale fell through and was aborted in May, 1987, with  Kroc deciding she would hold onto the club for the time being.  </P></p>

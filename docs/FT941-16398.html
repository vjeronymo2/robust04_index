			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Franc zone 'on verge of devaluing' The 14 west and central African members of the 'franc zone' were yesterday reported to be on the verge of devaluing their joint currency against the French franc, in a move urged by the International Monetary Fund to boost their exports. French press say possible devaluation of the so-called CFA franc, set at 50 to one French franc since 1948, topped the agenda at yesterday's meeting in Dakar, attended by 10 African presidents, three prime ministers and one finance minister, plus the French aid minister and Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director. A devaluation has been made inevitable by the fact that the Balladur government last year made future budgetary aid to French-speaking African countries dependent on their agreement to structural adjustments with the IMF, and that the IMF, like the World Bank, regards the lack of change in the CFA parity over the past 45 years as a brake on that adjustment. The Dakar summit is due to agree a FFr360m (Pounds 41.3m) recapitalisation of Air Afrique, jointly owned by 11 French-speaking African countries. France is ready to contribute almost two-thirds of this in special advances, provided the 11 shareholder governments put in some new money and renominate Mr Yves Roland-Billecart, who became airline president in 1989 and kept it out of the red until last year.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SOUL OF 'WRITERS ROW' SHINES THROUGH  </P> <P> I really liked your article about homeless writers on Skid Row.  </P> <P> I'm 14, and usually I only look at the paper long enough to read Dear Abby, the  comics and the horoscopes. But the article caught my eye. I think it showed  that not all homeless people have given up on themselves, and lots of people  out there, such as Dino and Jackie, who are trying to improve life not only for  themselves, but for others as well. It made me grateful for everything I've  got.  </P> <P> MARTA MONTORO  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: KOP falls into the red and passes payout BAD loan provisions pushed Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), Finland's largest commercial bank, into the red last year and forced the bank to pass its dividend. KOP made a loss after financial items of FM1.64bn (Dollars 377m), against a 1990 profit of FM1.09bn. KOP's new chief executive, Mr Pertti Voutilainen, said loan write-offs jumped by 144 per cent to FM1.343bn. Although denying the bank was in a crisis, Mr Voutilainen, who took over the day-to-day running of the bank last month, admitted it would 'be difficult to return to profits this year'. He said the bank was likely to suffer comparably large loan write-offs this year but he added that KOP was 'a strong institution' and that 'its foundations would not be shaken by losses incurred in one or even two years. 'These can be absorbed by reserves accumulated in the past,' he said. Mr Voutilainen admitted the setback stemmed from a number of mistaken decisions taken by KOP in recent years and were not just due to the severe recession at present hitting Finland. KOP's mistakes led to a FM270m loss due to the so-called Kouri affair, a series of complex share deals carried out under the bank's authorisation by Mr Pentti Kouri, a New York-based Finnish financier. A further loss of FM122m was incurred from exposure to the failed London merchant bank, Wallace Smith. On top of this, KOP also suffered FM489m of credit losses to small and medium-sized Finnish companies and a further FM65m was written-off from household lending. KOP said its portfolio of non-performing loans (on which interest had not been paid to the bank for at least three months) stood at FM5.1bn at the end of last year, while its exposure to companies and banks in Russia amounted to FM1.1bn, with FM12m as a specific provision set against those debts.</p>

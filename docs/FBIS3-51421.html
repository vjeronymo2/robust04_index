The report will be presented to the Permanent  Commission of Congress and to Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner  for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas.    Last week, Camacho Solis said he would go to Congress to  learn the opinions of the two senators and 11 deputies from the  six parliamentary benches who recently visited Chiapas to  analyze the situation there. According to the agenda, the  Permanent Commission of Congress will meet at 1000. Camacho  Solis will then be presented with ideas and suggestions on how  to resolve the Chiapas conflict.    Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] Deputy Alejandro  Encinas, member of the group that traveled to Chiapas, has said  that the group will propose measures in addition to the amnesty.    [Begin Encinas recording] I think the issue, regardless of  the interests of the private sector, the government, and the  political parties, is to outline the essentials -- namely, the  new relationship the state must have with Indian groups, a  relationship that respects their autonomy and their traditions  while acknowledging the Indian authorities as formal  authorities, as well as the way in which the federation is  integrated. [end recording]    At the conclusion of the Permanent Commission's meeting, the  Chamber of Deputies and Senate will simultaneously convene for a  special session at 1200 [1800 GMT]. Later, at 1400, lawmakers  from both chambers will join in a General Congress session to be  informed of the presidential amnesty initiative for Chiapas.</p>

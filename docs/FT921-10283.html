			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Eximbank chief clarifies policies in east Europe MR John Macomber, chairman of the US Export-Import Bank, yesterday said export financing to Poland could reach Dollars 800m (Pounds 442m) this year or next, but US government support for sales to the Commonwealth of Independent States must wait until crucial decisions are made about who is in charge. 'The republics of the former Soviet Union have enormous assets in terms of people and natural resources, but are in an economic freefall,' said Mr Macomber. 'We need to know who has the authority to contract? Who controls the foreign currency? Who decides if foreigners can invest in their oil and gas business?' Once the answers are clear, Eximbank will 'most likely' begin disbursements for short- and medium-term transactions. 'I also hope we can channel support into hard currency-generating projects,' said Mr Macomber. 'This would include oil and gas development, with production payments used as collateral for commercial bank guarantees, as well as other projects having the prospect of earnings in other than roubles.' The bank has approved six US sales to Russia, ranging from glass and battery manufacturing equipment to building construction panels and safety control systems for nuclear power plants. These will not go forward until Eximbank has 'clear guarantees' from the Russian government, Mr Macomber said. In Poland, by contrast, the bank has doubled and plans to redouble its support since opening its doors two years ago. Its lending to Mexico is the highest of any country in its history, having reached Dollars 7bn, one-fourth of the Eximbank's total portfolio.</p>

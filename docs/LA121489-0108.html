			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CARSON GOES AFTER EIGHTH CITY TITLE  </P> <P> In all of Carson High's glorious football history, the Colts have won  back-to-back L.A. City Section championships only once, in 1971 and '72, when  Wesley Walker was a star receiver.  </P> <P> The Colts will get another chance at 7:30 Friday night when they meet Dorsey in  the 4-A Division final at El Camino College. A win would also give the school  its eighth City title.  </P> <P> But Carson must overcome an inspired Dorsey, and history. Since 1982, Carson  has won the City Section championship in every even year, including last year's  55-7 rout of Banning, and has been runner-up in the odd years. The Colts' only  odd-year championship was in 1971.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Carson could have ended their odd-even history by beating  Granada Hills, but the Highlanders upset the Colts, 27-14.  </P> <P> "We give the other teams a chance every other year," Coach Gene Vollnogle said.  </P> <P> This year Carson seems to have the best chance. The Colts (10-1) have not lost  since their opening game, a 24-23 setback at Bishop Amat. In the following 10  games, Carson has outscored its opponents, 383-49, including a 28-9 defeat of  Dorsey in the seventh game.  </P> <P> Quarterback Armin Youngblood has completed 117 of 229 passes for 2,306 yards  and 30 touchdowns. Wide receiver Michael Ross has caught 46 passes for 862  yards and 15 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Most of the attention has been focused on Youngblood and Ross, which is fine  with Vollnogle. "I hope they forget about Tydus Winans," he said.  </P> <P> Winans has caught 22 passes for 545 yards and five touchdowns.  </P> <P> Center Raul Nieto has set the example for an outstanding offensive line that  has protected Youngblood. "The offensive line has really improved," Vollnogle  said. "They're not standing around killing grass any more, they're hitting  people."  </P> <P> Linebacker Nkosi Littleton leads the Colt defense, which has scored eight  touchdowns, a school record.  </P> <P> But the real heroes on defense are on the line, according to Vollnogle,  finishing his 27th year at the school. "I can't believe how much they've  improved," he said.  </P> <P> Defensive ends Marcus Long and Bob Tuitau, both juniors, and defensive tackles  Isiah Hall and Jason Savaaetase have anchored a defense that has allowed only  three rushing touchdowns and 292 total yards.  </P> <P> Dorsey (9-3) enters the final with several motivational edges. "They've got a  lot of things going for them," Vollnogle said. "It's their first 4-A  championship (appearance), and we beat them once this year. They've got nothing  to lose; they can open it up. They can try different things. And if it doesn't  work, it doesn't matter, because nobody expects them to win."  </P> <P> Dorsey has never beaten Carson in nine meetings dating to 1971, including an  emotional 14-13 loss in last year's playoffs, which was also a rematch. A  Carson win would give the Colts four victories over Dorsey in two years.  </P> <P> The Dorsey players are also fighting for the memory of senior receiver Kevin  Copeland, who collapsed during the Dons' game with San Pedro on Oct. 6 and died  of heart failure.  </P> <P> Dorsey is led by junior running back Lamont Warren, who has rushed for 770  yards and 20 touchdowns. Quarterback Chris Cook has thrown for 805 yards and  nine touchdowns.  </P> <P> Sophomore offensive tackle Cedric White (6-4, 250) and senior Demetrick Watts  (6-0, 260) are formidable blockers.  </P> <P> Dorsey linebacker Tamecus Peoples has 11 sacks, a single-season school record.  </P> <P> Friday's game marks Carson's 13th appearance in the City championship and its  ninth straight. Yet, it never gets old for the man who has been coaching at  Carson since the school opened in 1963.  </P> <P> "It's no problem for me to get excited," Vollnogle said. "If I didn't get  enthusiastic about it, then I would retire."  </P></p>

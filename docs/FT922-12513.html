			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Price war talk hits Vodafone TALK of a price war in the cellular communications market, combined with a large placing of stock, hit Vodafone yesterday, the shares slipping 2 to 356p in record turnover of 22m. The placing of two lots of 5m shares at 350p, believed to have been done by James Capel, added fuel to the rumour that rival cellular operator Cellnet was planning to cut its prices - and that Vodafone had promised to match any reductions to protect its market share. However, analysts played down the link between the two events, arguing that the placing had been hanging over the market for some time. Cellnet contacted some analysts yesterday to deny the price war story. However, some price restructuring is seen as necessary before the launch next year of PCN, a cheaper but more specialised version of cellular, with some in the market seeing yesterday's rumour - centred around Cellnet's secretive 'Project Liberty' - as the start of a phoney war. Difficulties placing 60m Midland shares were said to have ensured that the stock was depressed and closed a penny off at 364p with only 2.8m shares traded in a particularly strong market. Securities house Hoare Govett was believed to be offering the bulk of the Kuwait Investment Office's 10.5 per cent stake in Midland Bank at 362p per share. This followed its attempt to place the shares on Tuesday at the same price. Market commentators have said that Hoare had only managed to pre-place about a third of the shares. One trader said the apparent difficulty in placing the stake suggested that there was unlikely to be a rival offer to Hongkong Bank's 378p per share all-paper bid for Midland. Hoare Govett said it was unable to comment but hoped to say something soon. Guinness fell 12 to 576p, on turnover of 4.6m shares, but several analysts questioned the reasoning behind the move. Dealers were concerned by reports of lower cognac sales in Japan by Guinness's associate LVMH and by fears that the company will change a convertible debenture and loan stock into 42m ordinary shares in June. Rumours of a downgrading were denied by Lehman Bothers, with the US investment bank and Nomura remaining bullish on the stock. Dividend worries over Tarmac proved justified as the building group slashed its payout from 11.25p to 5.5p. The continuing poor outlook for the UK construction market, allied to what many consider an overvalued land bank, led to a generally gloomy short-term prognosis from many analysts. Mr Howard Seymour at BZW said: 'If the new management strategy starts to have any effect over the next year, we may re-consider our stance. But in the meantime, we remain a hold.' The shares fell 6 to 139p in the heaviest turnover for five years of 19m. Large scale switching by overseas investors out of the Electricity Package, down Pounds 25 at Pounds 3038, and into Scot Hydro, up 5 at 105 1/2 p, was the main feature in a generally strong utilities sector. Turnover in Scot Hydro was a very high 14m shares. Renewed demand was seen for the water companies, with Mr Stephen Doe, at Smith New Court, describing the water stocks as 'screamingly cheap.' Wessex rose 12 to 463p and Thames 10 to 426p. Hanson saw heavy turnover as, according to one specialist, investors continued to speculate that it 'might not be a million miles away from doing its next deal'. The shares closed steady at 235 1/2 p with 16.6m dealt. ICI, in which Hanson holds a 20m share stake, gained 32 to 1347p. Hanson paid 1194 1/2 p for its stake just under a year ago. Forte's well-signalled results caused few surprises, although a higher-than-expected interest rate charge and gloomy UK occupancy figures prompted downgrades from most analysts to the range of Pounds 125m-140m for this year. The shares rose 4 to 254p. British Gas gained 6 1/2 to 273p as a number of houses pointed out the relative underperformance in the shares. Lasmo gained 11 to 211p after announcing that it had completed the sale of three tankers, which together with a previously announced sale would bring in an estimated Dollars 125m (Pounds 72.6m). There was also talk that the company was about to announce the disposal of its Wilmington refinery and petrol retailing business but other analysts were sceptical. Among foods, Unilever gained 24 to 920p, boosted by a recommendation from Nomura. Smiths Industries were wanted, the shares adding 14 to 309p, after a positive analysts results meeting. The market was cheered by a 5 per cent dividend increase. Mr Clive Forestier-Walker at Charterhouse Tilney said this is an 'excellent result' and added: 'The company has good prospects based on the outstanding order book.' Vickers rose 8 to 167p, as vague talk about the sale of its Rolls-Royce Motors subsidiary returned. A squeeze coupled with vague bid talk saw Glynwed International jump 21 to 263p. Turnover in Roll-Royce rose to 7.3m in two way business, with a leading US house reported to have done most of the day's trade. The shares closed 1 1/2 firmer at 169p. US buying, after a positive industry outlook from the company's chief executive in Canada, lifted British Airways 11 to 279p. The prospect of a new cash call from Eurotunnel when it reports figures next week continued to overhang the shares and they fell another 9 to 370p, a 1992 low. BICC surged 15 to 340p as Hoare Govett reiterated its buy recommendation. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (275).

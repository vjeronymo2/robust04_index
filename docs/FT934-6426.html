			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / DTI tries to end fears on deregulation Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday attempted to reassure the Commons that the government's new deregulation measures would not ride rough-shod over parliament's traditional authority. His comments were made against a backdrop of ministerial concern that the bill could run into difficulties in the House of Lords. The Department of Trade and Industry seeks sweeping powers to enable government departments to repeal hundreds of regulatory measures without primary legislation. Mr Heseltine said the bill would have specific deregulation measures as well as the means to deregulate in the future. In an attempt to defuse a potential row over the powers to enable him to scrap rules, he said the process would still be subject to parliamentary procedure. The government's concern about getting the measures though the Lords has been highlighted by a leaked government document showing that it is already looking at options in case the bill runs into difficulties. One involves replacing a general power to scrap regulations with a power to delegate functions specified in the bill. Another involves establishing a parliamentary scrutiny procedure. The DTI said it was examining all options before introducing the bill. It said there were no plans to 'avoid public scrutiny' through the use of orders in crown procedures. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, asked why the government wanted to give itself special powers to axe regulations in what he described as a 'pathetic and mean-spirited' bill. 'Deregulation is offered to this session of parliament as a sort of grotesque parody of an industrial strategy,' he said. The government was backed by Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, who told Mr Heseltine at his group's annual dinner on Tuesday that he wanted the DTI to gain powers to get rid of regulations that were a burden on business. The bill's details will be unknown until next month. Mr Neil Hamilton, minister of corporate affairs, who heads the deregulation initiative, has said that the DTI wants powers to repeal by order many statutory instruments, allowing ministers to make regulations without the specific order of parliament. Mr Hamilton yesterday denied that the bill would compromise safety standards. He said that the government's purpose was to update and improve regulation though 'careful pruning'. A Labour amendment attacking the government's industrial record was defeated by 319 to 276 votes.</p>

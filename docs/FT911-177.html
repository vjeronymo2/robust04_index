			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: IMI warns of profit fall in 1991 first half IMI, the international engineering group, yesterday warned shareholders that pre-tax profits for the first half would be lower than in 1990, and that full year results were unlikely to match those of last year. The shares closed 3p lower at 233p, following a 6p fall on Friday Sir Eric Pountain, the chairman, told the annual meeting in Birmingham that it was difficult to predict the results with any degree of precision. Much would depend on the timing of an upturn in the US and UK economies. 'Personally I do not expect to see any recovery in IMI's trading before the final quarter at the very earliest,' he said. His gloomy view of the immediate trading prospects echoed those made last week by Mr David Lees, chairman of GKN, who noted the falling away of demand in the first quarter of 1991, continuing the trend of the latter months of 1990. Since then, Mr Lees said, there had been few signs of improvement, and first half results would be down on the second half of 1990. These two views emphasised the gulf between engineering industry leaders and the UK Government on the state of the economy. Government predictions of an upturn in the middle of the year were not seen as having a strong foundation basis by those active in the marketplace. Both GKN and IMI had been engaged in cost reduction exercises. Mr Gary Allen, chief executive at IMI, said this year the group would spend Pounds 50m on new equipment to increase productivity. Both, too, have cut the size of their payrolls. Mr Lees announced that in the first four months of this year GKN had cut 1,100 jobs. This reduced the number employees worldwide to 31,200 from the end-1990 total, and followed a reduction of 3,600 jobs in 1990. Of the 1,100 jobs, 850 were in the UK. IMI, with a total payroll of nearly 20,000, had announced or was planning job losses of 1,000 this year. In 1990, IMI made pre-tax profits of Pounds 115.1m and GKN produced Pounds 172m.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Currency union 'dead' says minister MR JOHN REDWOOD, Welsh secretary, last night staked his claim as standard-bearer of the Tory right on Europe, with a declaration that the Maastricht plan for a single currency appeared to be dead. Speaking just a day after Mr Michael Portillo, his cabinet colleague who is chief secretary to the Treasury, had set out his detailed agenda for the European Community, Mr Redwood urged European politicians to 'get down to tackling the problems that matter to people' such as jobs and prosperity. The widening of exchange rate mechanism bands meant policy-makers could 'concentrate their energies' on recovery rather than the D-Mark. He was addressing an audience of business executives in the Thames Valley. Mr Redwood called for renewed efforts to improve the supply side of European economies so that higher growth could be sustained in the longer term. Delivering a strong warning about the folly of dashing towards a single currency irrespective of whether convergence criteria had been met, he said Europe was 'far from ready'. He continued: 'So is the Maastricht plan for a single currency dead? It appears to be so, on the basis of the timetable set out in the treaty. 'It now looks impossible for enough countries to meet the targets for budget deficits and currency stability that the plan required.' Recent events were not 'a green light for easier, faster monetary union' but 'an amber light for the whole process', he argued. 'If the countries of Europe are not close enough together to be able to keep their currencies in narrow bands against each other, they are certainly not close enough together to share the same currency,' he said.</p>

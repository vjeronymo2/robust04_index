			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuliya Shum: "Borrow From Others--Pay With Your </F> Own: Crime Is on the Rise in the Credit-Financial Sphere of the  St. Petersburg Economy"]    [Text] On 25 May the directorate for suppression of  economic crime of the city internal affairs administration  initiated criminal proceedings against a TOO [limited liability  partnership] director (the person and the company's name have  not been made public) and his deputy, who took out a R25 million  loan at the Promstroybank. It was established during the  preliminary investigation that the crooks used as loan  collateral property that was allegedly theirs--a private home.  At first the documents on the house did not raise any suspicions  among the bank employees. However, finally the loan repayment  dates passed, and it came out that the collateral existed only  on paper and the house itself had long been razed, which the  swindlers, who had by then skipped town, of course did not tell  the bankers.    Another entrepreneur, the founder and director of four  AOZT's  [privately held joint-stock company], has managed to get large  loans three times, using as collateral one and the same timber  purchasing contract. The bank, which did not figure out the  trick until it was too late, lost R420 million. The millionaire  is wanted by the militia.    Several more St. Petersburg banks have sustained losses from  a similar scheme. They reported their claims against the AO  [joint-stock company] Kronverk to the Regional Directorate for  the Suppression of Organized Crime [RUOP]. The RUOP has not yet  determined, however, whether there is criminal content in the  actions of the company's founders V.Ye. Nevyakin, O.B. Nelyubin,  and O.B. Philippov.    In August 1993 the Kronverk company took out a short-term  loan from the Sberbank [Savings Bank]--R400 million for three  months at 180 percent annual interest rate, to buy industrial  casein. As a guarantee of timely and complete repayment of loan,  the borrower transferred its property to the Sberbank as  collateral. The AO Kronverk's woodworking, ventilation, and  electrical equipment at its production facility, several  hangars, a casein line, vehicles, and office equipment were  appraised at R712 million.    When the loan term expired, the Sberbank attempted to find  its client. In vain--there was no answer at either Kronverk's  telephone or fax numbers: the company had moved from the  facility it previously occupied at 56 Bolshaya Morskaya to an  unknown address, while its general director V.Ye. Nevyakin had  left Russia...    The bank staff turned to the Vitabank, which had recommended  Kronverk as a borrower and handled the company's operating  account, asking whether the client ever showed up at the bank at  all. Vitabank never replied to the inquiry. And, as the Sberbank  staff infer, apparently not just out of considerations of  confidentiality. According to Sberbank's security service,  Vitabank is the first in line among creditors to recover the  debt from Kronverk. And it is unlikely that everybody's claim  will be satisfied, since Kronverk also received in the same  manner hundreds of millions rubles from the St. Petersburg bank,  the Murmansk Bank, and even the American corporation Met  International.    The Americans were the first to determine that they were a  "victim of an international financial machination" and turned to  the commercial arbitration court under the Russian Federation  Trade and Industry Chamber. Our compatriots are in no hurry to  run to court, and for quite understandable reasons.    In order to get out of Kronverk the loan, interest, fines,  and penalties totalling R1.5 billion, Sberbank alone will have  to pay court costs of R150 million. Most likely it will win the  case. As will the other creditors. But how to actually get the  money?    "We have information from the law enforcement organs that  Mr.  Nevyakin is currently in Poland," we were told by the Sberbank  security service. "He is apparently close to government circles  and Lech Walesa. He allegedly is putting together a fund for  aiding Russian entrepreneurs. There is rumor that he has a  personal security detail that consists of four former officers  of Polish state security... The Kronverk incident is not unique.  The bank suffers not only when someone literally walks away with  a loan, but also when loans are not repaid 'peacefully.' Nobody  will probably doubt the soundness of such enterprises,  well-known in the city, as the Vityaz restaurant chain, the  UniRem company, or the Goryachev concern. Meanwhile, we have  been trying for many months to get them to repay in full our  loans, and it is not easy.    Quite understandably, a businessmen does not always become a  hardened delinquent by criminal intent. Some are let down by  business partners; some are victims of crooks; some simply lack  entrepreneurial acumen. But this does not make it easier for the  bankers--their interests are far from fully protected by the  current legislation in the credit-financial sphere.    Knowing this, the boldest ones do not refuse their good  friends (of course, on terms mutually profitable for both  parties in the deal) large loans, which also are not always  repaid. The law enforcement organs often encounter such abuse on  the part of bankers and financiers, who later themselves became  victims if not of a crime then at least of unlawful actions.  Such incidents have happened in our city, too.    For fairness' sake it should be noted that the State Duma  has  already adopted amendments to the Criminal Code which will make  entrepreneurs share the culpability of officials under such  articles as, for instance, bribery, negligence, and abuse of  official position. As to insolvent clients, so far the law does  not envisage jail as a punishment measure for them. And they  take advantage of this.  <H5>  Commentary by the Legal Department of the St. Petersburg </H5> Bank of the Sberbank of Russia    Current legislation has a number of gaps which allow the  borrower to "effectively" use credit resources received from a  bank he does not "plan" to repay.    For instance, according to the existing statute on  joint-stock companies, the minimum charter capital is set at  R10,000 and has not been revised. Thus, a Russian limited  liability partnership puts at risk a negligible amount of  charter capital. For comparison: The minimum charter capital of  a limited liability partnership (GmbH) in Germany is DM50,000.    Another pitfall. Any company may participate as a founder in  setting up another company. A mandatory point included in the  charter documents is that the founder cannot be held liable for  the debts of the enterprise being set up, and vice versa.  Liability also is limited by the size of the charter capital, or  the amount of capital contributed by the founder company in the  new enterprise. Thus, in this situation, too, the risk to the  "borrower" and his guarantor is minimal.    Next. St. Petersburg's rayon administrations still register  enterprises at "convenience" legal addresses, most often using  as such the rayon administration's own address. Or similar  services are offered by companies set up either with direct  participation or with the "blessing" of these administrations.  This problem surfaced for the first time when the search was on  for the notorious Amaris, Business-Navigators, and other  enterprises registered precisely in this way. For instance, one  can still find dozens, or even hundreds, of firms registered at  the same address--such as 176 Nevskiy Ave., 4 Boytsov Lane,  26/28 Kamennoostrovskiy Ave., or 50 Mayakovskiy St. The city  procuracy has already issued a separate opinion on this issue,  which it has submitted to St. Petersburg mayoralty; however, as  they say, the cart has not moved an inch.    Another problem. The "Law on Collateral," which was adopted  and in keeping with which various types of property--land, real  estate, goods, and so on--may be used as collateral to secure  the repayability of a loan, in real terms does not work. State  organs whose job is to register collateral (for instance, GAI  [State Motor Vehicle Inspection] regarding using a car as a  collateral, the Property Fund for real estate collaterals, and  so on) do not carry out this function. The "Rules for  Registration of Tractors, Tractor Hitches, Self-Propelled Road  Construction and Other Vehicles Subject to Registration by the  State Technical Oversight [STO] Organs of the Russian Ministry  of Agriculture," approved by the Russian Federation Ministry of  Agriculture and coordinated with the Russian Federation Ministry  of Finance, for all practical purposes are not in effect in St.  Petersburg. St. Petersburg currently has an STO regional branch,  which does not conduct any registration work.    Apparently the time has come to also bring up to the  legislative authority the question of entrepreneurs' personal  responsibility for their loan obligations, and not just to the  limit of the charter capital of his enterprise but personally,  since it is the entrepreneur who is the owner and master of his  enterprise.</p>

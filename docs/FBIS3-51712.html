			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Julio Ottoboni, from Sao Jose dos Campos] </F>   [Text] After more than eight years of its being dormant the  Aeronautics Ministry has reactivated the controversial Piranha  teleguided missile project, which had been suspended twice.    The new contract was signed with Mectron Engenharia, a  company headquartered in Sao Jose dos Campos, which is basically  comprised of engineers trained at the Aeronautical Technology  Institute (ITA). The Aeronautics Ministry has cloaked this  project in secrecy. Despite this military sources told O ESTADO  DE SAO PAULO that the ministry intends to develop several  prototypes without delay, so that they can compete on the  international market within 30 months.    The federal government has acquiesced in appropriating $10  million for the project, as stipulated in the contract. Mectron  Engenharia, which will be in charge of the development and tests  of the prototype for the missiles, will work in cooperation with  the Aerospace Technical Center (CTA).    The Piranha (MAA-1) air-to-air missile will probably be  assembled at Engesa [Specialized Engineers, Inc.], which has  recently filed for bankruptcy. Engesa had enlarged its  facilities to mass produce the Piranha missile during the  eighties, and kept the necessary equipment. According to  reports, 80 percent of the missile has already been manufactured.    The Aeronautics Ministry intends to launch the Piranha  missile on the international weapons market as a sophisticated  and reasonably priced product compared to its competitors.  While the prices of foreign models range between $120,000 and  $250,000, the domestic missile will be sold at $100,000.    Argentina's Condor missile, technologically inferior to the  Piranha, is vying with the latter for that sales market.  According to the same sources, the urgency in the reactivation  of the missile project is due to the growing need for efficient  weapons in air surveillance demanded by the Amazon Protection  System (Sipam). The Armed Forces' supersonic fighter aircraft,  Xavante and AMX, manufactured by Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics  Company], will be fitted with two Piranha air-to-air missiles on  the wing tips. Furthermore, the Navy and the Army will have at  their disposal versions of Piranha air-to-surface and  surface-to-air missiles.</p>

Thus when the Seoul-Beijing route opens, which may take  place  as early as April, Europe-bound Korean Airlines cannot fly over  China and Chinese carriers are not permitted to use Korean  airspace for travel to the United States or Japan, the sources  said.    "We (Seoul and Beijing) did agree on having beyond-point  traffic rights in principle, but we decided to apply the rights  in the future when we find them necessary," a Seoul government  official said.    The two governments agreed not to initiate beyond-point  traffic rights at present because when they do, the  Seoul-Beijing route could become an international one as it may  be opened to other airlines and they fear a loss of passengers,  he said.    They reached tentative agreement on opening a direct air  route between the two capitals after a week of working-level  talks in Beijing that started Jan. 17.    The agreement is expected to be put into writing next month  in the fifth bilateral aviation talks.</p>

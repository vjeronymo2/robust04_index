			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> N.Y. BANS CIGARETTE MACHINES  </P> <P> New York City has moved to take cigarettes out of the hands of youngsters by  taking cigarette machines out of most public places.  </P> <P> A law banning cigarette vending machines in all public places but taverns and  hotel bars, where minors are not allowed anyway, was passed 33 to 1 by the City  Council on Tuesday and signed by Mayor David N. Dinkins. "Today we have  achieved an important pro-child, pro-health law that will save lives," said  Dinkins, who quit smoking 28 years ago.  </P> <P> "Each year in New York, 32,000 children begin a habit that will lead to the  death of 10,000 of them."  </P> <P> The law, which orders the machines removed by Jan. 31, 1992, is similar to  measures already in effect in Minneapolis and Salt Lake City.  </P></p>

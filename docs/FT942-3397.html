			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Siemens wins power deal National Power, the privatised electricity generator, has awarded to Siemens of Germany a fiercely contested contract to build a 1,350MW gas-fired power station at Didcot in Oxfordshire. The turnkey contract for the design, construction and commissioning of the plant is valued at less than Pounds 400m. Mr John Baker, National Power's chief executive, said yesterday that he believed it was the UK's most competitive power plant project. Announcement of the award comes a few days after PowerGen, the UK's other big electricity generator, said it was paying Pounds 441m in advance for its gas-fired power station at Connah's Quay, North Wales, which is being built by the Anglo-French GEC Alsthom engineering group. The Didcot B contract is the first for Siemens from National Power, whose other combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) stations have been ordered from Zurich-based Asea Brown Boveri and GEC Alsthom. But the German company has built two gas-fired stations for PowerGen, and Mr Juergen Gehrels, chief executive of Siemens in the UK, said yesterday: 'We believe that our successful track record in delivering total turnkey projects, on time and to budget, was a key factor in (National Power's) decision.' National Power is clearly delighted with the deal it has struck with Siemens  -two years ago, it was thought the station would cost about Pounds 450m. But the contract has been held up by a public inquiry and the UK government's review of the coal industry. Didcot B is scheduled to be the largest and most efficient of National Power's CCGT stations, and will be built in two separate modules alongside the existing 2,000MW coal-fired station at Didcot. Commercial operation is due to start in 1997. The new station is the next step in National Power's programme to upgrade its generating capacity with about 5,000MW of CCGT plant by the end of the decade, to meet tightening environmental standards.</p>

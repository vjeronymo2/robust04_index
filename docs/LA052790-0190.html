			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER SPLASH II: ORANGE COUNTY;  </P> <P> OUR HOTTEST PICKS FOR A JAM-PACKED SUMMER;  </P> <P> TELEVISION  </P> <P> Orange County wades into its second hundred years facing a summer that's filled  with a wider range of arts and entertainment activities than ever.  </P> <P> The Calendar staff of the Times Orange County Edition selects highlights among  the hundreds of choices offered at the county's theaters, art museums, outdoor  amphitheaters, concert halls, comedy clubs, movie theaters and elsewhere to  stave off any summer doldrums that might dare to take roost.  </P> <P> * On the local television front, summer plans are modest at Orange County's  only commercial station, KDOC-TV Channel 56. One new wrinkle is "90% certain,"  according to station spokeswoman Tricia Krause: That will be coverage of the  newest Team Tennis entry, the Newport Beach Dukes, who will play at -- you  guessed it -- the John Wayne Tennis Club.  </P> <P> In the meantime, more of those holiday rerun marathons are planned -- "Perry  Mason" on Memorial Day, "The Bob Newhart Show" on July 4 and "The Beverly  Hillbillies" on Labor Day.  </P> <P> Summer programming plans are also quiet at KOCE-TV Channel 50 in Huntington  Beach. However, the county's public television station is planning a couple of  fund-raising events, including a luncheon presentation by management guru Tom  Peters on June 15 and a July 12 lecture by John Bradshaw, host of the PBS  series "Bradshaw On: The Family" (the series will begin airing on KOCE June 11,  weekdays at 1:30 p.m.).  </P> <P> The station's next pledge drive, meanwhile, will take place Aug. 17-26.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A list of summer arts and entertainment activities for children will appear in  Wednesday's Calendar.  </P></p>

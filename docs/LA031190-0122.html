			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RIGHTS THAT SOLD FOR $10 -- THE STRANGE TALE OF 'SOUTH OF HEAVEN'  </P> <P> Everybody in Hollywood likes to boast about making a great deal. But one of the  enduring unsolved mysteries of Jim Thompson's Hollywood years is how in 1970  Tony Bill managed to buy the rights to Thompson's novel, "South of Heaven," for  the astonishing sum of $10.  </P> <P> The book, originally published in 1967, is now being made into a major motion  picture, with producer Mark Lipson and the "Rain Man" production team of Barry  Levinson and Mark Johnson at the helm.  </P> <P> According to both Bill and the Thompson family, the rights to "South of Heaven"  changed hands after Thompson met with Bill and Robert Redford and agreed to  write an original script on an American hobo. What's in dispute is whether  Thompson knowingly sold the rights or was bamboozled.  </P> <P> "My father said he never recalled signing anything giving them any rights to  that book," says his daughter, Sharon. "Maybe they got him drunk. He was not an  idiot. He would have never sold the rights to any of his books for $10."  </P> <P> Bill insists he has no recollection of purchasing the book. "I think Jim may  have made a side deal with Columbia when we were making a deal for his hobo  script," he says now. "But in tracing down the rights, 'South of Heaven'  producer Mark Lipson determined that I originally owned the rights to it. But I  have no recollection of that."  </P> <P> Lipson says it took several years to track down the rights to the film. "I  finally found a contract that said Thompson had sold 'South of Heaven' to Bill  in 1970 when he and his partner, Vernon Zimmerman, ran a company called  Bi-Plane Cinematograph," recalled Lipson, who was a producer of the acclaimed  documentary, "The Thin Blue Line."  </P> <P> "When I contacted Tony, he said, 'Why don't you just take the project -- the  rights are all yours."  </P> <P> Lipson subsequently discovered that Bill and Zimmerman had sold their rights to  the book in 1972 to Columbia Pictures, which still owned the project. After  several more years of negotiations, Lipson and director Ted Bafaloukos, with  Levinson and Johnson's help, convinced Columbia to make the film.  </P> <P> The Thompson family remains angry about the affair. "If my father thought he  was among friends, he could've signed anything," said Sharon Thompson Reed.  "But that doesn't mean he knew he was signing away the rights to his book. The  family is extremely bitter about that incident. It was really the beginning of  the end for my father."  </P> <P> Blaine Campbell, the agent who represents the Thompson estate, insists he will  take legal action if "South of Heaven" goes before the cameras this summer.  </P> <P> "The Thompson family is not going to go quietly," he said. "It's unconscionable  for Columbia to make a film without compensating the estate for the market  value of the film. What's in dispute isn't the contract, but the ethics behind  it."  </P> <P> Is it possible Thompson could have sold the rights to one of his books for a  paltry $10? "Jim once tried to sell me the rights to every book he wrote for  $500," said Bill. "I refused. I told him that wouldn't be fair. Too bad I  didn't."  </P> <P> Thompson's widow, Alberta, disputes this claim, saying: "That's not true. He  didn't do anything of the kind."  </P> <P> Lipson said he is not qualified to serve as a spokesman for the studio or his  production team. But he sounded a conciliatory note.  </P> <P> "As someone who has a great deal of affection for the material, I'd like to see  this worked out with the Thompson family," he said. "In my opinion, aside from  Columbia owning the rights, my sentiment is that if -- and when -- the movie  gets made, that fairness should be done." PATRICK GOLDSTEIN  </P></p>

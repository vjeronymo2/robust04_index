Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BUSH MEETS LATVIAN OFFICIALS  </P> <P> Latvian Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis and his foreign minister called on  President Bush today and said they received encouragement in their quest for a  gradual transition to independence from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Janis Jurkns said he and Godmanis told Bush that "some  countries in Europe have taken concrete steps" to recognize Latvian  independence.  </P> <P> "We asked the American government to do the same and we got supportive  answers," Jurkns said.  </P> <P> Godmanis added, however, that Latvia would seek its independence  "democratically, peacefully and gradually."  </P> <P> "We want to restore our independence 100%," he said. "There is no question."  But, he said, "independence will be gradual; it takes time."  </P></p>

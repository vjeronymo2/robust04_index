			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Slimmer TDG advances to Pounds 17m Transport Development Group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 17m for the six months to end-June, compared with Pounds 3.5m in 1993, but exceptional items masked sharply reduced profits from the core distribution division. Profit margins from UK distribution almost halved to 4.4 per cent because of increasing competition, the loss of some profitable contracts and the non-recurrence of strong profits from its French drinks distribution arm. Turnover fell 9 per cent from Pounds 277m to Pounds 251m, although the decline from continuing operations was only 5.4 per cent. Operating profit after interest was only marginally lower at Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 15.9m). The results were distorted by the impact of business disposals and closures during both years, as TDG restructured in the wake of an increasingly harsh operating environment. The company made a Pounds 1.31m exceptional profit at the interim stage, which came from the sale of businesses in the UK, Australia and France. This compared with a Pounds 12.3m exceptional loss in 1993. TDG has completed its disposal programme with Pounds 29m of this reported in the first half, which boosted profits by Pounds 350,000. It has reduced gearing to 0.5 per cent, and is now looking for acquisition opportunities. A further Pounds 12m of disposals will be recorded in the second half. The distribution division is putting emphasis on the 'saturated' industrial market, where it has won significant new business. The company plans to invest Pounds 17.5m this year to support this organic growth. The hire division has performed more profitably, being an earlier beneficiary of economic recovery. The group invested Pounds 8.5m in the first half and plans to invest a similar amount in the second. The transport division has been the focus of disposals of lossmaking operations, and it saw a resultant turnround. However, storage declined, because of the reduction of some of the European Commission's food mountains. Overall, the management said it was confident that its spread of businesses 'gives us a sound and broad base from which to move ahead steadily.' TDG is paying an unchanged interim dividend of 3p, payable from earnings per share of 7.62p (1.66p losses). COMMENT For what was considered a bellwether stock, TDG is having problems matching the economic recovery. Its hire division has benefited from increased industrial activity, but distribution remains bogged down by competition. The second half will remain tough, and profits of about Pounds 34m are expected, putting the shares on a p/e of 14.7. As gearing falls to zero, thoughts are turning towards acquisitions, and investors would be wise to see what management comes up with before backing a recovery, which still appears some way hence.</p>

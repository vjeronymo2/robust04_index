			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our correspondent Eva Hulkova brings topical  information about the proceedings at Prague Castle.    [Hulkova] Intensive working meetings are under way at Prague  Castle. At the moment President Vaclav Havel is in talks with  Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. President Havel has already had  talks with [Slovak President] Michal Kovac and [Polish  President] Lech Walesa. The foreign ministers' talks were being  held at the same time. Of course, the Partnership for Peace is  the center of attention.    Responding to the question by Czech Radio as to whether any  issues remain open, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said  that there are a number of open issues since the Partnership for  Peace is a program that, by its nature, is an open one. I hope  that this is the space that we will fill in by our activity and  that this activity -- not only ours but also the activity of the  16 NATO countries -- will result in our soon becoming a  component part of NATO that brings together countries with whom  we are close by our civilization, history, and values, said the  Czech foreign minister for Czech Radio.    [Polish Foreign Minister] Andrzej Olechowski said that the  Polish side considered the Partnership for Peace to be a very  important contribution to European security, and that he  perceived the project as innovative, constructive, and  optimistic.</p>

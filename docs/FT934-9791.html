			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Birth of the world's biggest paints group: Paul Abrahams and Christopher Brown-Humes report on a Pounds 1.38bn deal Yesterday's merger between Akzo of the Netherlands and Nobel of Sweden is the largest transaction in the European chemicals industry for a decade. The industrial and financial logic of the complex deal, effectively a takeover of Nobel by Akzo, is impeccable. Akzo assumes Nobel's crippling debts of SKr10.7bn (Pounds 880m) and refinances them at far lower cost. At the same time the Dutch group acquires Nobel's chemicals and coatings operations, creating the largest paints group in the world. The financial aspects of the deal are elegant. Securum, the state-owned Swedish investment vehicle, is paying Akzo SKr4.1bn for parts of Nobel, including the biotechnology division and Spectra-Physics, its electrical-optical instruments operation. Securum will also take on SKr1.2bn debt, reducing Akzo's difficulties in financing the acquisition's borrowings. The Dutch group also intends to redeem Nobel's high-yield preference shares which had proved burdensome. To pay for the preference shares and reduce debts further, Akzo is issuing stock to raise Fl 1.3bn. Mr Aarnout Loudon, Akzo's chairman, said he expected Akzo-Nobel, the new company, to have gearing of about 50 per cent. Mr Lars Thunell, Securum chief executive, said: 'Today's agreement means that industrial operations which had been damaged through connections with real estate and finance companies will now be financially sound and in the proper industrial environment.' As for industrial logic, Mr Loudon explained: 'The two businesses are really an excellent fit. We're wondering why we did not arrive at the conclusion earlier. When you take out the financial charges and financial hedging problems Nobel has been having, these are well run businesses. Some are better run than divisions at Akzo.' Nobel made operating profits after depreciation last year of SKr1.28bn, but after financial expenses, profit only amounted to SKr237m. The driving force behind the deal is the benefit to be derived from combining the companies' coatings operations. On 1992 figures, the new group would have annual coatings sales of about Fl 6.3bn (Pounds 2.2bn), making it the world's largest coatings concern, bigger than Imperial Chemical Industries' operations which last year had sales of Pounds 1.58bn. Akzo-Nobel will be one of the strongest forces in the European decorative paints market with annual sales of Fl 2.5bn. The chemicals operations should also benefit from the merger, according to Mr Loudon. Nobel is the world leader in pulp bleaching and second in paper chemicals. By combining the two businesses, Akzo-Nobel will also have a good position in the manufacture of monochloro acetic acid. Some rationalisation of the combined detergent surfactants operations, particularly fatty amines production, would be required, he said. 'There are plenty of opportunities for the chemicals operations to prove that the sum of one plus one is more than two.' Akzo-Nobel will continue to rationalise businesses from both companies, he said. However, as neither company had significant operations in the other's home country, there should be few job losses in either the Netherlands of Sweden. Apart from fatty amine production no plants would be closed, he added. The merger still has hurdles to overcome. The deal requires 90 per cent acceptance from Nobel shareholders, as well as the approval of Akzo shareholders. Potentially the biggest obstacle is the EC's competition directorate. The combined paints operations in Belgium and the UK could cause some concern. However, Akzo said yesterday that even if the EC decided to investigate the merger, it would not halt the integration of the non-affected businesses. Mr Loudon said he did not underestimate the difficulties of merging the two cultures, although he added there were likely to be fewer difficulties between the Swedes and Dutch than, say, the Swedes and French. The Dutch company has been at pains to take into account the feelings of the Swedes who are clearly junior partners. Two members of the 11-strong supervisory board will be Swedish, Mr Ove Mattsson, Nobel chief executive, will join the new company's board of management and run the European coatings oper-ations. The group has also undertaken to continue R&amp;D in Sweden and to maintain a number of units, including the paper chemicals and interior coatings. Meanwhile, Securum will continue to exert influence on the new group through a 20 per cent stake. Mr Loudon expected Securum to dispose of some of its stake in a year's time when a stand-still agreement ends. Akzo-Nobel's next challenge is to generate the synergies it has promised. Mr Loudon pointed out that Akzo's last quarter indicated that the European economy may have bottomed out. If so, he added, the merger could have been perfectly timed. Lex, Page 20</p>

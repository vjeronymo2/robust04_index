			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (13): Why another US miracle' is unlikely - Ice hockey / Norman de Mesquita takes a look at the background to the Olympics event, and suggests which teams might earn a medal in this year's tournament I happened to be in New York on Friday February 22, 1980: that famous Friday on which the United States, represented by a bunch of college kids, beat the might of the Soviet Union at Lake Placid to come within one win of Olympic gold. The atmosphere in New York that Friday evening was very reminiscent of London in 1966 when England had won football's World Cup. People who had no regular interest in sport of any kind and who could not tell a hockey puck from a red line, were caught up in the emotion of the event. For the Americans, of course, it was very much a case of 'us against them' and the win was seen as a triumph of democracy over what were seen as the evils of communism. Americans are very insular and generally care very little about international sport. That is why the play-off between their two leading baseball teams is known as the World Series' and why the team which wins the National Basketball Association finals will be referred to as World Champions'. But success breeds interest and anything perceived as the best will arouse interest as well. So the World Cup will give football a high profile in the US, albeit temporarily. In Winter Olympic terms, ice hockey is one of the very few events to arouse the Americans' interest. The expansion of the National Hockey League (NHL) to sunnier climes and the establishment of franchises in such unlikely locations as Miami, Dallas and Anaheim means that the sport has a higher profile than in the past and it is certainly followed more keenly than such events as the luge or Nordic cross-country, which remain a closed book to most Americans. The non-availability of the best US players makes any chance of a repeat of the Lake Placid 'miracle' unlikely. The same applies in Canada and, to a lesser extent, in Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia. Many of the leading players now play for NHL teams and the league is reluctant to close down for something like three weeks and make them available. While basketball, a winter sport but part of the summer Olympics, can send a 'dream team' to represent the US, it is only for the occasional Canada Cup that their ice hockey team can be at full strength. Upsets are few and far between in Olympic ice hockey. Canada dominated the event in its early days, with only Britain's controversial success at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in 1936 interrupting their sequence of titles, from 1920 until 1952. Then the Soviet Union came on the scene and brought a new dimension to the sport in 1956 with the emphasis on the aesthetic qualities of ice hockey rather than its physical excesses. The US sprang a surprise at Squaw Valley in 1960, but Soviet domination returned from 1964 until Lake Placid in 1980. Canada, in the meantime, withdrew from Olympic competition, objecting to what they saw as the professionalism of the Soviet Union's 'amateurs.' But they returned in 1980 and have taken part ever since. Their chances of success this year are remote. For the World Championships, which are held in the middle of April, a number of NHL players are available, their teams having been eliminated from the play-offs. But this is not the case at the end of February. Those players who have spent the season with the Canadian national team are somewhat resentful of the arrival of the top professionals in April and it is not conducive to team spirit. There will be no such problems in Lillehammer, but it seems likely that Canada together with the US, will field supporting players, rather than the top stars. For the first time, Russia will compete as an independent nation, which means that, strictly speaking, there are no defending champions because the 1992 gold medal went to the Unified Team. Any Ukrainians or Latvians who appeared in Meribel will not be in Lillehammer. And, for the first time in Olympic competition, the Czech Republic could face Slovakia. For Peter Stastny, a 13-year veteran of the NHL, it will be a dream come true. When Slovakia beat Latvia in an Olympic qualifying tournament in Sheffield last August, he described it as, 'the most exciting moment in my life. It is far more exciting than playing for Quebec Nordiques in the Stanley Cup play-offs or for Czechoslovakia in the world championships. This time I am playing for my own country; a new country.' Just as most of the best players in the Soviet and Unified teams were from Russia, so most of the best Czechoslovakian players were Czech rather than Slovakian. But Slovakia showed themselves to be some way ahead of Latvia in the Sheffield tournament and this could be ominous news for the other competing nations in Lillehammer. Sweden, runners-up in 1992, will probably be a force once again, but it is hard to look beyond Russia as the likely winners with the Czech Republic and Slovakia as the probable dark horses.

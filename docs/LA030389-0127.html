			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> Against the limitless black of the night sky British artist John Murphy sets  out on a lyric search for the essence of life. It's a romantic venture, rich in  metaphor and philosophic contradiction where titles like "At Evening an Odour  of Violets and Clay (Sagitta)" reach for the sensation that forms the thrill  and chill of mortality itself.  </P> <P> If the ideas are complex, the paintings in the "Constellations" series can so  simple they seem too easy. Murphy covers huge canvasses with thick, blue-black  impasto and sparsely flecked dots that appear like tiny warm stars shining in  cold infinity. In one small portion of this whipped blackness, dots are joined  with white lines to form a fragment of a star map. The constellation's name is  written in.  </P> <P> The uncomplicated nature of the imagery forms something of a demanding, visual  keyhole onto Murphy's distilled ideas. The longer you look at the rectangular  patch of deep space, the more meaning seeps through. Once comforting, the night  sky becomes overwhelming. The ancient assignment of astrological names and  zodiac shapes to the vastness of the universe is reduced to an arbitrary and  somehow futile gesture of relative order. It's a faintly nostalgic realization  brought on by an art that licks at the bittersweet essence of self-awareness  and then tries to describe the flavor. (Asher/Faure, 612 N. Almont Drive, to  March 18.)SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

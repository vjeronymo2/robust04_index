			<p>BFN     [Text] According to statistics provided by the provincial  Statistical Bureau, our province's economic operation has been  stable as a whole, and the results of strengthening and  improving macroscopic regulation and control have been further  demonstrated. During the first four months this year, the value  of industrial sales reached 115.9 billion yuan, an increase of  19.2 percent over the same period last year. The accumulated  total volume of retail sales of consumer goods was 51.9 billion  yuan, up 32.5 percent over the corresponding period last year.    Under the stable situation of production and circulation,  some problems that had arisen in economic operation have been  mitigated. First, the margin of increase in investment in fixed  assets has continued to be narrowed. Second, the bottleneck  constraint has been lessened, as the rail freight volume and  generated energy of the whole province have exceeded industrial  growth in the corresponding period last year. Third, the  financial situation has been basically normal. Fourth, the  momentum of commodity price increases has been curtailed.</p>

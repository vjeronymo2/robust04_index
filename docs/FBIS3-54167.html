According to the spokesman of the Hezb-e Eslami led by  Golboddin Hekmatyar, the prime minister of Afghanistan, the  conditions for ending the conflict are the resignation of  Borhanoddin Rabbani from the post of president, the setting up  of an interim government, the establishment of a national camp,  and the calling of elections in six months.    The spokesman of the Jami'at-e Eslami, led by Borhanoddin  Rabbani, also stressed that Rabbani should remain in his  position as president and he set forth as the Government's  condition that the opposition should remove their heavy weapons  from around Kabul. Only then will the government agree to a  cease-fire.    It appears from looking at these conditions that it is not  going to be easy to find common ground for negotiations between  the two sides. In fact, what has further exacerbated the  situation is that the involved sides refuse to compromise on  their conditions because of their sensitivity and the importance  they attach to their own political status. It seems that unless  there is some sort of flexibility and tolerance among the Afghan  factions, there is a very slight chance of reaching any  agreements on the basis of goodwill.    In any case, in the opinion of the observers of Afghan  affairs, the change in the political situation in Kabul cannot  help in restoring peace or promote any progress toward peaceful  objectives, including elections. This is because as long as  political goals are pursued through military force and weapons,  an end to the war in the circumstances currently prevailing in  Afghanistan is unimaginable.    In any case, experience proves that under such difficult  conditions, Afghanistan's friendly neighbors have been able to  motivate the warring sides to negotiate regardless of their  irreconcilable conditions. It seems clear that the present  clash in Kabul is bound to have the same outcome.    Meanwhile, according to the emissary of the Iranian Foreign  Minister to Kabul, all the sides involved in the conflict have  welcomed the mediatory actions of the friendly neighboring  countries. Taherian, who met the leaders of the sides involved  during visits to Kabul and Islamabad on Wednesday [12 January]  said in an interview that it is difficult to convince the two  sides to begin negotiations and stressed that the Iranian  Foreign Ministry is seeking to establish common ground for  mediation among all the Afghan warring factions by means of  negotiations with Pakistani Foreign Ministry officials and those  of all other Islamic countries.</p>

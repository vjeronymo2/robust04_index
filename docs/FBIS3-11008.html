			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The Senate election left a large part of the  country's poor and neglected portions with no voice at all:  Putumayo, Caqueta, Guaviare, Choco, Vaupes, Amazonas, Guainia,  Vichada, Casanare, Arauca, Meta, and Quindio. Meta has Senator  Jorge Ariel Infante, and Quindio has Samuel Grisales.    At the Chamber of Representatives, the dark spots are  Amazonas, which lost Milquesedec Lopez and Jairo Jose Ruiz  Medina, Guainia, which lost the seat of Guillermo Britto, and  Vaupes, which had Alfonso Gonzalez Vargas. These last three  departments are in a serious situation, if one considers the  fact they were completely erased from the parliamentary map;  this shows how the struggle among the traditional politicians to  get votes from all over the country-- thanks to the nationwide  electoral conscription--does not always work out, silencing  regions that have always been forgotten by the state.</p>

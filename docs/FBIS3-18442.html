The election party congress at the end of  February is supposed to proceed with as few ideological  skirmishes as possible. Commissions have therefore worked out  broad program proposals that present disputed alternatives to a  vote in only a few points. A failure, however, was the project  "Unity" project in the foreign policy area.    After the end of the "Cold War" and the collapse of the  Warsaw Pact, the time has come for a "new foreign policy,"  states the guiding proposal of the federal board for the  election party congress. Instead of the "traditional foreign  policy that pursues international policy in the national  interest," the Alliance Greens want "a German policy in the  international interest." They therefore favor a "concept of  radical disarmament and self-integration in reformed  international institutions" such as the United Nations and the  CSCE.    The realpolitik camp of the party has no difficulties with  such general formulas that arose under the guidance of Helmut  Lippelt, member of the federal board. Differences show up where  it is specifically a matter of the future of the Bundeswehr,  NATO, and blue helmet missions. This is seen this week in  extensive motions for amendments presented by the realpolitik  camp for the party congress in Mannheim at the end of February.  So far they have been signed, among others, by Achim Schmillen,  a scientific associate of the Alliance Green group in the  Bundestag, Hamburg realo Krista Sager, Reinhard Weisshuhn from  Berlin, and Reinhard Buetikofer from Baden-Wuerttemberg.    The signers favor a long-term continuance of NATO. They want  to proceed with the disarmament of the Bundeswehr in a less  radical manner. In their view, Central and East European states  should be offered access to a system for collective security.  The "primary objective" of Greens foreign policy ought to be  "the improvement of the protection of human rights." From this  demand, the authors derive a duty to "intervene in the human  rights conditions of other societies and states."    Spokesman of the federal board Ludger Volmer, who belongs to  the left wing of the party, is counting on a tough fight in  Mannheim: "If the motions for amendments are accepted, this  ultimately means a reversal of our peace policy." As a result,  he fears the expansion of NATO to the east and attempts to have  human rights ultimately guaranteed through military  intervention. Last year, after vigorous debate, a special party  congress of the Greens had spoken out against military  intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Achim Schmillen considers  the board's motion to me completely inadequate. If the Greens  persist in this, the Union and FDP [Free Democratic Party] would  present them as a "security risk" in the election campaign for  the Bundestag.    The guiding proposal of the federal board rejects an  expansion of NATO to the east, for this would increase the  "danger of a military confrontation." What it calls for is a  "political initiative to dissolve NATO." In its place, it  proposes the restructuring of the CSCE into a nonmilitary  security organization. The Bundeswehr, states the proposal,  cannot "be dissolved overnight."    Schmillen's motions for amendments, for which he expects the  support of the realpolitik land associations in Hesse,  Baden-Wuerttemberg, and Saxony, is likewise counting on a  "strengthening of the CSCE process" as the basis for a  collective security system. The CSCE is "already showing much  promise of being able to meet an expanded notion of security  that encompasses not only military strength but also the  guarantee of human rights, democracy, development, and  transparency." The way to a common European perspective on  security policy cannot "exlude NATO." In the long term, it is to  be brought into the CSCE process as its "security-policy arm."</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Delta Air Line pilots pull out of wage talks THE UNION representing pilots at Delta Air Lines, one of the big three US carriers, is pulling out of wage concession talks with management, according to reports out of New York yesterday. The pilots' move followed the airline's announcement it planned to lay-off up to 600 pilots. 'We made a promise that if they announced a furlough we would step away from the table. We are pulling away from negotiations and trying to deal with the furlough,' said Mr Steve Johnson, a Delta pilot and spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association. There was no immediate confirmation of this stance from Alpa's Washington office. Delta Air Lines announced the planned lay-offs, the first the carrier has implemented in 36 years, on Monday afternoon. Mr Ron Allen, Delta chairman, sought to place the lay-offs in the context of a 'fleet simplification' plan, although the move was widely interpreted as a shot across the pilots union's bows. The fleet simplification plan, Delta said, would involve the retirement of 21 A310 aircraft which the company took over when it acquired assets  - including major transatlantic routes - from the now-defunct Pan Am in 1991. However, Delta will accept nine new A310s which it has on order, and the net loss of 12 A310s will help to accommodate a reduction in the carrier's transatlantic schedules next autumn. The carrier is also planning to retire 16 Boeing 727 aircraft, most of which are employed on the east coast 'shuttle' routes. They will be replaced on these routes by newer 727s from elsewhere in the domestic network. The aircraft retirements represent a 3 per cent reduction in transatlantic capacity, and a 1 per cent reduction for the group overall. Mr Ron Allen, Delta chairman, denied the staff cutbacks were related to the carrier's long-running dispute with the union. Pilots are the only employees at Delta who are unionised, and the one group which has stood out against the request for wage cuts.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Spain's private banks uneasy over Banesto rescue Opposition is growing among Spain's private banks to making a large contribution to the rescue of Banco Espanol de Credito, despite efforts by Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the Bank of Spain's governor, to gain their support. Mr Rojo met the chairmen of the top five private banks yesterday to present them with proposals drawn up by Banesto's management on relaunching the bank after intervention by the central bank a month ago. The Spanish Banking Association said the latest estimate of the overvaluation of Banesto's assets was Pta605bn (Dollars 4.23bn). That compares with an estimate of Pta 675bn by a Banesto official last week. Bankers said the private banks could be asked to contribute up to Pta200bn to Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund. That would underwrite a capital increase, although the equity might be floated. Madrid bankers say the troubled bank will contribute to its own rescue by allocating all its Pta245bn reserves into provisions and reducing the nominal value of its shares from Pta700 to Pta500 to raise an extra Pta35bn. Under the draft plan disclosed by the bank last week, Banesto's capital increase would have been Pta120bn-Pta150bn and the acquisition of bad debts, to be shared with the Bank of Spain, would have represented at most Pta200bn. The Bank of Spain report triggering its intervention put Banesto's gross financing needs at Pta503bn. The latest Pta605bn figure is only an estimate. The private banks believe that too much money is being set aside to refloat Banesto, and that they are being required to carry an excessive burden of the proposed outlay. While the banks are prepared to help Banesto's restructuring, they are unwilling to participate in a plan that might turn Banesto into a powerful rival. Mr Rojo is due to meet the heads of Spanish savings banks today to discuss Banesto. US regulators are to investigate the investment rules guiding credit unions after US Central Credit Union, a Kansas-based institution acting as a sort of central bank to other credit unions, placed Dollars 255m in an uninsured Banesto certificate of deposit, writes George Graham in Washington. Federal regulators said the first Dollars 10m was repaid to US Central last week, with interest, and were confident there would be no loss on the remainder.</p>

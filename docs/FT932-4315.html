			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Issing says stop aid to dying industries GOVERNMENTS should encourage economic growth by cutting subsidies to dying industries and farming, and by squeezing social spending, Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the Bundesbank's directorate, proposed last night. A recent wave of suggestions for increased public expenditure to boost weak economies reflected obsolete ideas which had been proven not to yield permanent benefits. 'One should dispense once and for all with the illusion that public spending programmes can produce more than a flash in a pan,' he told a meeting in London. All that usually remained after the 'flash' was debt which had to be serviced, he warned. Policy-makers should instead revert to removing impediments to growth, he demanded. European labour markets were especially inflexible because the differential between earned income and unemployment pay was too narrow. 'Efforts to implement high social standards throughout the Community are particularly counter-productive in periods of high unemployment,' he added. 'At a national level unnecessary regulation must be lifted and subsidies for preserving non-viable structures must be reduced.' He noted that problems with 'obsolete and rigid structures, such as agriculture, steel and shipbuilding' were particularly acute in lean times. At the international level, wide-ranging liberalisation of trade would also improve conditions for growth. Breaking the current deadlock in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks would in the long run result in considerable additional growth. Central and eastern European countries had to be given access as soon as possible to all market sectors, 'including the sensitive ones,' Mr Issing said. That was the only way to make real and lasting progress with reform in the region: a process which was in other countries' interests, 'not least those in western Europe'.</p>

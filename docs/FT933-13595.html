			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The undoing of EFIM: Rome plots survival course for defence industry - Finmeccanica is the key rescue vehicle ITALY'S defence industry is being slimmed down and reorganised as a result of Efim's liquidation, leaving the state with a strong centrally-controlled stake in the business. Closure or sale to foreign buyers of Efim's seven defence companies would mean a drastic cut in Italy's indigenous armaments and aerospace production capacity. Efim's Oto Melara, Breda Meccanica, Officina Galileo and SMA, together with the three companies in the Agusta group, produce items ranging from missiles, naval artillery, light armaments and armoured vehicles to helicopters, jet trainers and radar appliances. The combined annual turnover of L2,100bn (Pounds 889m) is equivalent to almost half the nation's current annual defence procurement budget. Equally, with Efim's defence companies accounting for a third of the holding's workforce and nearly 20 per cent of accumulated losses, the hiving off of this activity has been an essential step in the liquidation process. From the outset the previous government of Prof Giuliano Amato decided to ensure the survival of Efim's defence interests. The current administration of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has not altered this policy. The path chosen has been to merge these defence interests with Finmeccanica, the high-technology and main industrial arm of IRI, the principal state holding company. Synergy exists, as Finmeccanica has extensive defence interests centred on aerospace through its Alenia subsidiary, whose programmes include the new European fighter aircraft. But against a background of declining defence procurement at home and abroad - plus the need to balance its own books and prepare for an approach to the stock market to raise capital - Finmeccanica remains a wary partner. The group stipulated it could only assume Efim's defence portfolio if there was no financial charge, jobs were shed and plants rationalised, and the government announced a defence procurement programme which guaranteed orders that in turn provided insurance for production lines to survive. In January a temporary solution was agreed: to lease the companies to Finmeccanica for six months, giving management but not financial responsibility. Last Wednesday, two weeks behind schedule, the government forced Finmeccanica's hand, in effect decreeing the takeover. Government and Finmeccanica must now bargain over the company's demand that a minimum of L10,100bn is available over the next decade in procurement orders for these companies, and that 1,900 jobs are cut from the workforce of 11,729. On this basis the Efim companies could begin to show a profit by 1995. However, big job losses, especially where accompanied by plant closures, will be contested by the unions, which have already won considerable concessions in the case of the restructuring of Finmeccanica's Alenia. The key will be the future of Agusta, which has good helicopter technology in the EH101 venture with Westland of the UK but which lacks orders. It has also been poorly managed and its financial position is extremely weak, having lost L1,674bn between 1987 and 1991 and recorded a further L858bn loss last year - almost one lira for every lira received in sales. Agusta has made the mistake of accumulating excessive stocks that totalled L1,600bn at the time of Efim's liquidation. It will get about L400bn of the L1,068bn earmarked by the liquidators for the defence side of Efim. But this will be insufficient, and the company cannot afford to be in a weak financial position at a time of fierce international competition in the helicopter sector. Hanging on the fate of Efim's defence interests are also a mass of private contractors who are the most vulnerable creditors.</p>

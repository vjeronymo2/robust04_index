			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Boris Reznik, IZVESTIYA staff: "Sakhalin, Too, </F> Is Beginning a `Gas' War"]    [Text] Khabarovsk Kray--Gas stoves are not working in the  homes of residents of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, and primus and  kerosene stoves have been taken out of storage. The city central  heat and power station has shifted from burning natural gas to  burning residual fuel oil. Once again, the Sakhalinmorneftegaz  Association has grabbed the Komsomolsk-on-Amur residents "by the  throat" and cut off the supply of the blue fuel.    This time the reason for such harsh measures was not a delay  in mutual settlements but the petroleum that, along with the  gas, is discharged from Sakhalin wells in the form of  condensate. The islanders were sending it, like the gas, to the  "city of youth" through the pipelines whose construction was  hailed in the well-known novel Daleko ot Moskvy  [Far From Moscow]. The price for it was cranked up immensely --  to 140,000 rubles per tonne. If the Komsomolsk Petroleum  Refinery had continued to take raw material at that price, it  would have long since gone bankrupt. The petroleum refinery  found suppliers with a better-quality and less expensive  product--the Tyumen oil fields, which are delivering petroleum  to Khabarovsk Kray at R110,000 a tonne. The Sakhalin people did  not rack their brains trying to figure out how to lower the  price of their oil, but decided to act from a position of  strength--they delivered an ultimatum to the  Komsomolsk-on-Amur's residents: either take our oil at our  prices, or we will close the valve on the gas pipeline.    They closed it, forgetting that Khabarovsk Kray could take  countermeasures. After all, Sakhalin receives up to 70 percent  of its economic cargo by way of the Vanino-Kholmsk ferry  crossing. However, to the credit of the kray's leaders, this  time, as during the first such incident last year, they have  been showing restraint and reasonableness. Residual fuel oil,  jet fuel and all other goods addressed to the island oblast are  being punctually dispatched to it. The kray's administration has  sent an emergency telegram informing the Russian president and  head of government of the existing situation. The law, not  arbitrary rule, should act.</p>

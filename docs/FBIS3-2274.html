This was stated by Mines and Energy  Minister I.G. Sujana during his meeting in Beijing with Shi  Dazhen, China's electric power industry minister.    According to Minister Sujana, the two countries have the  identical problem of limited funds to meet the demand for  electricity by the people and the industrial sector. As such,  Minister Sujana stressed the need to seek cheap alternative  sources of electricity -- such as the establishment of hydro,  air, and solar electricity plants -- that could be carried out  with limited funds.    The objective of Mines and Energy Minister Sujana's four-day  visit to Beijing, scheduled to conclude on 10 March, is to study  China's achievements in the field of electrical energy.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sales at BMW advance 2.7% BMW car and motorcycle sales increased 2.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year, and orders are clearly higher than 12 months ago, Mr Volker Doppelfeld, finance director, said yesterday. However, the company only hoped these improvements would translate into better profits, he added. The 1993 annual report, published yesterday, predicted a satisfactory result. Rover, the new UK subsidiary, was likely to produce improved pre-tax earnings, although taxes and BMW's conservative accounting methods would turn this into a loss if the group decided to consolidate the results this year, Mr Doppelfeld added. According to Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman, Rover's prospects were even more interesting than believed at the time of the recent Pounds 800m (Dollars 1.2bn) takeover. He refused to elaborate, but maintained that the fact that Rover would remain an independent business spoke for itself. Mr Pischetsrieder appeared optimistic on the outcome of negotiations to maintain technological links between Rover and Honda. Expectations were high on both sides, he said. Confirming that technical co-operation deals on Rover's mid-range models were to be continued into the next model generation, he said he wanted to forge a long-term relationship with Honda. Group turnover rose to DM7.5bn (Dollars 4.4bn) in the first quarter, although car deliveries to customers were unchanged at 137,000 units. Production fell 7 per cent mainly because of disruption caused by tooling up for two new models. The company, which plans a rights issue to raise about DM800m, is expected to continue to outperform its domestic rivals.</p>

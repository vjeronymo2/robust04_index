This personality,  who wished to remain anonymous for security reasons, emphasized  the Cite Soleil slaughter that caused the deaths of about 50  persons on 27 December, and the murder of about 15 youths on the  night of 2 February. Of these 15, 12 bodies were discovered in  Sarthe, on the northern road out of the capital. About 10 more  youths were shot down in Cite Soleil or its surrounding areas  because of their presumed affiliation with the lavalas movement  during the same period by armed civilians or men in military  uniforms. The human rights activist also cited the cases of  several persons killed under questionable circumstances, whose  bodies were later discovered at the general hospital's morgue in  Port-au-Prince.    According to this human rights spokesman, political  assassinations are considered casual facts in Haiti. He holds  the international community responsible for the impunity with  which crimes are committed daily in Haiti. He also pointed an  accusing finger at a huge segment of the business community,  which denounces the ravages of the embargo caused by the  military coup d'etat, but considers the violent killings normal.  Citing the murder of Manette Jean-Louis, a young girl in the  Mahotiere area, who was shot down on 31 December by  Nationalistic and Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti  Deputy Saurel Jacinthe, the human rights defender also denounces  the blocs within parliament whose members are accomplices in  crimes against life.</p>

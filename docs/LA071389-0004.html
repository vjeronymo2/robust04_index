			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: THE MAN STOLE TWO HENS  </P> <P> If Thomas Jefferson had written "when, in the course of human events, it  becomes necessary to amend existing section 12.24 B and 19.00 to establish  criteria based on public health, safety and welfare, including consideration of  negative impact reports CF 84-1021-S3 . . .," we would still be saluting the  Union Jack.  </P> <P> Instead, he laid out in simple terms those elements of history and human need  that are the keystones of American freedom, and the document known as the  Declaration of Independence led to creation of the United States of America.  </P> <P> Granted, life was simpler then. All the colonists had to do was break ties with  England, establish a new nation, fight a war and create a basis for human  dignity that would light the world. Nothing to get excited about.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council, on the other hand, must deal with zoning changes,  driveway improvements, retirement picnics and the partial funding of an  analyst/writer for the alcohol abuse program.  </P> <P> Which brings me, however circuitously, to Gloria Molina's brave efforts to make  the language of government so clear than even the government can understand it.  </P> <P> Molina, who joined the council a scant two years ago, has been at war with  bureaucratic gibberish since the day she took office.  </P> <P> Just last month she demanded once more that official documents, including the  council agenda, be reduced to simple declarative sentences whenever possible.  </P> <P> What really got to her was a toxic waste issue brought before the council by  the City Planning Department.  </P> <P> It called for "amending Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 12.24B1 (u) and (v)  and existing ordinance (No. 163620) to waive time limits to process conditional  use permits, to include the authority for an ad hoc committee per Section  25199.7 . . ." and so on. You get the idea.  </P> <P> Molina, bless her innocent heart, challenged her colleagues to explain what  they were about to vote on. None of them could.  </P> <P> Encouraged by this inability to understand an issue of environmental importance  in a city drowning in pollution, Molina announced that she was considering an  ordinance that would require all city departments to put their requests in  simple language.  </P> <P> Ah, the irony. Such an ordinance, she was told, already existed, but was  generally ignored because no one understood it in the first place.  </P> <P> "It's crazy," she said to me the other day. "If I can't understand departmental  reports I'm supposed to vote on, how can I tell my constituents what they  mean?"  </P> <P> I sympathize with Molina.  </P> <P> Bureaucrats complicate simple messages to justify their own existence and to  confuse the meaning of the measures they propose, thereby making it easier to  zing them past our bewildered legislators.  </P> <P> Molina makes the point that those who simplify best are journalists. That's  because, to begin with, we are simple people grasping to understand our world,  and because we train to some degree to hone an ability to communicate.  </P> <P> We are not expected to make poetry, but we are expected to be able to write  "The man stole two hens" in terms that would make a copy editor feel good  inside.  </P> <P> Molina believes that what the city needs is the governmental equivalent of a  copy editor to ride herd on those who submit reports to the council. If the  report isn't clear, the copy editor, or monitor in this case, would kick it  back for a rewrite.  </P> <P> Not a bad idea. To begin with, there are no intellectual requirements to  becoming a member of a city council in America. A simple ability to read and  write will do.  </P> <P> As a result, many are elected who can barely understand the fundamentals of a  complete sentence, much less follow the convoluted syntax of an environmental  engineering report.  </P> <P> It's like trying to explain the concept of infinity to a monkey.  </P> <P> Clarifying the language for our City Council might ultimately work to  everyone's benefit, although one barrier to civic improvement remains. Once  they understand the issues they are about to vote on, will they really care  enough to think about them?  </P> <P> Tom Jefferson did, and his concepts altered human history. No one expects our  City Council to change much of anything, but I'd be happy if they knew the man  stole two hens and wondered, however vaguely, what they ought to do about it.  </P></p>

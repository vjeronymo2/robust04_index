			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Management: Fuelling a new popularity - Drivers are turning increasingly to diesel cars Fleet managers must have been struck by last month's UK car registration figures, which showed a 79.4 per cent leap in diesel sales. More than one in every five new cars sold is now a diesel and Citroen, one of the market leaders, believes the figure could rise to one in three by the end of this year. Some companies are switching all or part of their fleets to diesels to take advantage of their better fuel consumption. On the whole they are 25 per cent more economical than petrol-driven vehicles. A flurry of surveys has indicated that the UK may be witnessing one of the most significant shifts in business fleet acquisition policies since the company car sector first sprang into life in the 1970s. What emerges from them are changing driver attitudes towards the car, with greater concern about costs and the environment increasingly replacing performance-oriented obsessions of the 1980s. The sector's growth is also being facilitated by the reduction and, in some cases, disappearance of the price premium demanded by manufacturers. Diesels can be expected to receive a further substantial boost from company car taxation changes which come into effect next April, under which tax payable will be based on car prices rather than engine size. The larger engine capacity required by a diesel to provide performance comparable with a petrol unit currently remains a considerable tax disincentive to company car drivers choosing a diesel model. The disadvantage may be further offset as early as the Budget in November. Diesel economy will become relatively more attractive if, as some industry analysts believe, the government imposes a sharp increase in overall motor fuel duties to compensate for its Pounds 1.6bn revenue loss from abolishing Special Car Tax. Two recent surveys illustrate the upsurge in diesel popularity: One, undertaken among 190 fleet managers by Fleet Management magazine and the leasing subsidiary of BRS, the fleet management company, found that 61 per cent expected diesel cars to outnumber petrol models on their fleets, which on average numbered 390 vehicles. Eighty-five per cent intended to increase the number of diesels on their fleet over the next 12 months and 98 per cent believed fleet operators generally would increase the number of diesels on fleets. The survey also indicated that nine out of 10 fleet operators now believe diesels are more environmentally 'friendly' than petrol-engined equivalents. Harris Research Centre, in a poll of 1,072 drivers in the UK, France, Germany and Italy, also showed that around half will consider making their next car a diesel. In the UK, 11 per cent said they had already decided to do so, with the figure rising to 22 per cent in France. In a similar poll in 1989 only 3 per cent of drivers in the UK said they would definitely buy diesel. Drivers in the Harris survey were both business and private motorists. According to statistics from Automotive Industry Data, the motor industry monitoring organisation, diesels took a 19.6 per cent share of total west European sales in the first quarter of this year, compared with 17.3 per cent the year previously. According to Jack Fryer, managing director of Lucas Industries' automotive division which commissioned the Harris research, it is unlikely that the price premium for diesels will be eliminated entirely. But he says that advances in technology have already solved or are solving other current perceived negatives such as noise and a slight delay in starting while glow plugs warm up. 'The diesel will never take over the GTI market but it probably has a natural market level of 30-35 per cent,' he maintains.</p>

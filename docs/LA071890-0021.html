			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INFLATION WATCH: NIXON'S HOME TODAY  </P> <P> A passing thought about former President Richard Nixon's little birthplace home  next-door to the sleek new Nixon library in Yorba Linda:  </P> <P> If Nixon's birthplace were on the market in Orange County today, a classified  ad might read: "Restored 1BR bungalow w/loft; pantry/canning; bonus rm; large  lot w/ citrus trees; fireplace; loads of country charm; yours for just  $400,000."  </P> <P> Talk about sticker shock: The house, thought to be a Sears prefabricated model,  was built in Yorba Linda by Nixon's father for $800 in 1912, and cost about  $400,000 to restore today.  </P> <P> Hey, it could have been worse; imagine the rehab costs if it had been in  Newport Beach!  </P> <P> And it would be hard to find a house like it in the current housing market: If  a young couple like Frank and Hannah Nixon were starting off in search of 900  square feet of living space, they would have to shell out $160,000 to $180,000  for a similarly sized condominium (yes, a condo, of course) in Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> And it is likely that any other older house located on 1.1 acres of prime land  would have been razed long ago for high-priced, custom housing.  </P> <P> Nixon, in an audiotape to be played in the home that will open this week as  part of the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace, waxes nostalgic about the  angel food cakes his mother used to bake in the wood-burning stove.  </P> <P> But if the aroma of home cooking is absent, gone too is an era when a young  family of meager means could afford modest housing -- through Sears or  otherwise.  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Sterling up on Budget Sterling gained around  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark in late European trading yesterday after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, announced unexpected reductions in the government's spending plans for the next financial year, writes James Blitz. Strong fiscal rectitude was the key theme of Mr Clarke's first Budget. He announced that public spending would be lower in each of the next three years than the ceilings set by the cabinet in June. He also announced progressive reductions in the public sector borrowing requirement, phasing out borrowing to finance current spending by 1997-98. These broad goals were well received by traders in sterling and UK government bonds. At the start of the chancellor's speech, the pound was trading at DM2.5450. It rose to DM2.5500 before closing a net  1/2 pfennig up at DM2.5475. Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International in London, expected the Budget to give sterling good support over the next few days. In particular, he was impressed by the political skill of the chancellor's speech. He pointed out that there had been a generous package to compensate pensioners for VAT on fuel. The squeeze on invalidity benefit, though one of the more politically sensitive measures, had also been skilfully presented. However, Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, warned that the PSBR projections were too reliant on high expectations of growth to be realistic. He said that 3 per cent growth would push the economy too close to a balance of payments constraint. If sterling failed to make more headway, it may have been because of the general strength of the D-Mark against all European currencies. In part, this was due to the Bundesbank's decision to set an unchanged two-week fixed rate repo at 6.25 per cent. The decision to introduce a fixed rate repo was unsurprising, considering the recent volatility in German money market interest rates. The Bundesbank has been trying to suppress the end-of-month scramble for funds by issuing Paragraph 17 funds and short term liquidity through a variety of instruments. Against this background, a variable rate repo - which allows banks to state the rate at which they will buy funds - could not have been expected. This trend was offset by comments towards the end of the day from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the new Bundesbank president, which helped to depress the D-Mark. He said the Bundesbank would explore the potential for lower interest rates in the future in agreement with its policy of monetary stability. Mr Tietmeyer's comments helped to depress the D-Mark at the end of a day when it had been a good deal firmer against European currencies. The French franc closed unchanged at FFr3.458 to the D-Mark, in spite of news that French unemployment had hit a record 12 per cent in October. In recent days, the French currency has performed strongly amid signs that the Bank of France has managed to recoup most of the reserves that it lost during the futile defence of the franc in July and August. However, the dollar rose by nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark, following the release of very strong US economic indicators. The Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index for November rose to 65.3 per cent from a previous 57.0 per cent and the Conference Board Confidence Index climbed to 71.2 per cent from a previous 60.5 per cent. Both these figures strengthened the impression that the US economic recovery is gaining momentum. The employment component of the Purchasing Managers' Index underlined speculation that Friday's non-farm payroll figure for November will come in higher than expected. The dollar ended at DM1.7165, compared with DM1.7085 previously. It finished New York trading at DM1.7150. The yen came under strong pressure against the dollar in European trading, following another spate of bad economic news in Japan. Industrial production in Japan fell by 5.1 per cent in October, and there is growing speculation that the official discount rate could be cut again - perhaps to 1 per cent from its current level of 1.75 per cent. When European trading opened, the yen dropped from an opening of Y108.75 against the US currency to a low of Y109.30. It closed in London at Y109.10 and in New York it ended at Y109.05. Citibank's economists in London believe that pressure on the yen will continue over the next 12 months. In the medium term, they expect the yen to sink as low as Y115 to the dollar. On the German money markets, call money still hovered at the comparatively high level of 6.68 per cent. Euromark futures were also depressed: the December contract was down 4 basis points to a close of 93.83; the March contract declined 5 basis points to 94.56. Sterling markets were little changed against this background, following a Budget speech which gave no hint of more policy easing. Three-month money closed unchanged at around 5 5/16 per cent. The December short sterling contract ended 3 basis points up at 94.64. French franc futures were badly affected by the unemployment news. The December Pibor contract dropped 8 basis points to close at 93.49.</p>

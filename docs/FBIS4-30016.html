			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chirawat Na Thalang and Nopphakhun Limsamanphun: </F> "Strong Yen Muscles Firms Out of Japan"]    [Text] Since the yen soared to nearly Y100 to US$1 last  August, the pace of Japanese relocation has gained momentum. In  the past few months, Japanese companies have announced plans to  move capacity out of their home base almost daily. China and  Vietnam are among the most popular destinations, followed by  Thailand and other ASEAN countries.    What's happening in corporate Japan? Is a restructuring of  the world's second largest economy in the making? The strong  yen coupled with rising costs at home have driven many  once-formidable Japanese firms into the red. Moving  increasingly-uncompetitive domestic manufacturing bases out to  places where the comparative edges are clearly superior is what  corporate Japan is doing relentlessly.    Wages, level of technological development in host countries,  and the emergence of sub-regional economic groupings are key  factors determining which Japanese industries go to which  countries. As for the European markets, Japanese firms have set  up factories in the European Union to ensure market access to  all 12 countries. Non-EU countries will enjoy tariff privileges  once their factories are in the community. Most of the  relocations are in high-technology areas.    The ASEAN Free Trade Area [Afta] still has a long way to go  due to the grouping's 15-year time span. Deputy premier  Suphachai Phanitchapak has called for a shorter timeframe of 10  years to avoid the grouping being left behind in the race of  regionalism.    At the moment, Afta has not yet fully kicked into gear but  the prospect of expanding membership will make the grouping more  attractive especially as the emerging Indochinese economies like  Vietnam become new members.    With the long time-span of complete implementation of Afta,  Japanese firms have plenty of time and room to manouevre to  fine-tune their position on the eventual outcome of this  regional effort. In the case of European Union, Japan and other  foreign investors do not have much time to spare so virtually  everything had to be fixed quickly.    Japanese investment in Korea or Taiwan, regarded as the  first  newly-industrialized economies (Nies) after Japan, is also  undergoing change. High-technology capacity is moving from Japan  to this first tier of Nies. Wages are not the determining factor  for projects in these countries.    Capacity down the technology ladder goes to countries like  Thailand, Malaysia or Indonesia where wages are rising because  of rapid economic prosperity over the past decades. Automobile  and electronics industries are among the key sectors of  relocation.    Industries which are very labour intensive then go to China  and Vietnam where the level of technological development is low.  This can be seen in the relocation of low-priced textile or  footwear manufacturing in Thailand to China and Vietnam because  of the wage factor.    With the wave of regionalism washing over the world, there  are now enough different sub-regional groupings to create  confusion among policy planners. Apec, Afta, Nafta, EAEC and  Sea-10. Nies like Korea see Apec as the most promising of all.  First, this grouping is the most comprehensive geographically,  with members covering both sides of the Pacific.    Secondly, Apec has what appears to be the best mechanism to  function -- senior official meeting, finance ministers meeting  and plan for an environment minister meeting plus the summit of  top national leaders hosted by U.S. president Bill Clinton last  November. Its membership is also expanding, with Chile due to  join Apec as the 18th member later this year.    The probability of Apec to work is high as evidenced by the  last senior official meeting in Jakarta at which there was  discussion on whether to turn Apec into an open free-trade  group. Malaysia appears to be the only country that explicitly  opposes this kind of trend.</p>

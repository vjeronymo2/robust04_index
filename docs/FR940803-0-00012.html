That law requires the Department to impose an administrative assessment on peanuts received or acquired for the account of handlers who are not signatory (non-signatory handlers) to Peanut Marketing Agreement No. 146 (Agreement). The assessment rate of $.60 per net ton of farmers stock peanuts for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year will be the same as the administrative assessment established by the Department and applied to handlers under the Agreement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The interim final rule is effective August 3, 1994.

The Department will establish a 1994&hyph;95 crop year assessment rate applicable to non-signatory handlers effective July 1, 1994&hyph;June 30, 1995. Segregation 1 farmers stock peanuts received or acquired by non-signatory handlers during that crop year will be subject to the assessment. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this interim final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 45 handlers of peanuts who have not signed the Agreement and, thus, will be subject to the regulations proposed herein. The Small Business Administration now defines small agricultural service firms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000 and small agricultural producers as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A majority of non-signatory handlers and peanut producers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since aflatoxin was found in peanuts in the mid-1960's, the domestic peanut industry has sought to minimize aflatoxin contamination in peanuts and peanut products. The Agreement was established in 1965 and plays a very important role in the industry's quality control efforts. The Peanut Administrative Committee (Committee) was established by the Agreement and works with the Department in administering the marketing agreement program. Approximately 95 percent of the area peanut crop is marketed by handlers who are signatory to the Agreement. Requirements established pursuant to the Agreement provide that farmers stock peanuts with visible  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aspergillus flavus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  mold (the principal source of aflatoxin) must be diverted to non-edible uses. Each lot of shelled peanuts destined for edible channels must be officially sampled and chemically tested for aflatoxin by the Department or in laboratories approved by the Committee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 101&hyph;220, enacted December 12, 1989, amended section 608b of the Act to require that all peanuts handled by persons who have not entered into the Agreement (non-signers) be subject to quality and inspection requirements to the same extent and manner as are required under the Agreement. Approximately 5 percent of the U.S. peanut crop is marketed by non-signer handlers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

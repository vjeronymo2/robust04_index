			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (12): The agony and the ecstasy - Bobsleigh / You have as much influence on your direction, speed or destiny as a stowaway on a space shuttle Riding a four-man bob as a helpless, ineffectual passenger clinging desperately to the half-ton (when fully laden) steel and fibreglass machine, you have as much influence on your direction, speed or destiny as a stowaway on a space shuttle. As the meat in the sandwich, you have no choice but to trust implicitly the man in front (the driver) and the man at the back (the brakeman). Until the 1920s you would have encountered women bobsleighers too, but rather like the Cresta Run, women are no longer officially allowed to compete professionally. There is also an age restriction for men: you cannot race in competitions if you are under 18. If this were the real thing, the man normally sitting in your seat would have a function: to 'Bob' backwards and forwards with the other two rear-crew members. Hence the name. By leaning backwards at an extreme angle and then snapping forward in unison, the Bobbers' action sharply accelerates the speed of the sleigh. The British invented bobsleighing, in St Moritz a century ago. After another good World Cup year they are still a force to be reckoned with. It was in 1890 that two Britons tied two toboggans together and slid down the high street, causing considerable commotion. To this day, St Moritz is one of the few resorts where ordinary members of the public can try the four-man bob. It is a nerve-racking experience. You and another apprehensive tourist squeeze yourselves between the two professionals and pretend not to be quaking with fear as the glistening but cumbersome contraption drifts - agonisingly slowly at first - towards the first bend. So far, not too bad; you tell yourself. Perhaps it will all be over so quickly you will not have time to panic. No such luck. Irrevocably, the monster gathers speed. Having survived the first bend, you brace yourself for the next. No turning back now] You peep through your tightly-clenched eyes just long enough to realise that the bends are coming thicker and faster at impossible, almost vertical, angles. You feel as though you are on a frozen wall of death. How can you possibly revert to the horizontal again after flirting so brazenly with the vertical? Surely you will hurtle helplessly into space at any moment] When it is all over you have to pretend it was a breeze. With a casual grin which belies your still pumping heart, you accept your certificate, signed by Gunther Sachs - there has always been more than a hint of a playboy element about the sport. The certificate comes complete with a photograph taken on the way down to prove you have survived a minute or so of agony and ecstasy. The ecstasy occurs when you stop. St Moritz is one of the most celebrated 'natural' bobsleigh tracks built each year out of snow. Cortina and Cervinia in Italy have other examples. These natural tracks - which vary each year in design and speed - are generally thought to be more intimidating and therefore a better test of a good bobsleigher than the kind of artificial tracks found in Olympic locations such as La Plagne, Igls, Lake Placid, Calgary and the track at Hunderfossen to be used for the Games at Lillehammer. Most courses average just over 1,300 metres. The track at St Moritz is considered to be the fastest in the world, rivalled only by the Mount Van Hoevenberg run in Lake Placid, New York, some of whose 26 turns are more than 30 feet high, with walls that are almost vertical. According to the BBA (British Bobsleigh Association): 'A mixture of strength, speed and driving ability is required' to be a successful bobsleigher. There is no mention of courage - perhaps that is unspoken, but without that quality the other three are a little academic if you are chasing glory at the highest level. Racing sleighs have been known to clock speeds of up to 118mph although between 60 and 70mph is more the norm. Traditionally, what was formerly East Germany dominated bobsleighing. The government there invested more than Pounds 10m in the sport over a period of 20 years and to this day, the most sought-after four-man sleighs come from a factory in Dresden. The standard model is almost 3.5m long, and runs on four steel runners which are polished by hand to a mirror finish each day by the crews. The sleigh's weight bearing down on the runners melts the ice at the point of contact, and the sleigh actually runs on a thin film of water. The sleigh costs more than Pounds 14,000 and even a set of runners can cost anything from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 8,000. According to the BBA 'There are no rich men left in the sport - only sponsors and governments]' The two-man version, at 3.1m long, is only a slightly less awesome mass of hurtling steel, flesh and bone: the maximum weight with crew is almost 0.4 tonnes. The British team - with Mark Tout performing exceptionally well and Sean Olsson also getting good results in both the four-man and two-man events last year - will be disappointed if they don't bring back a medal or two from Lillehammer. After my brief but terrifying encounter with the sport in St Moritz, I think they deserve a medal just for completing the course.</p>

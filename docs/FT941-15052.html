			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Exports may speed German recovery An increase in exports and further interest rate cuts could lift total investment in western Germany by 3 per cent in 1994, the Munich-based economic institute Ifo said in a report yesterday. More foreign orders, particularly from outside Europe, should stimulate a gradual recovery in investment this year, the institute said, after a dramatic 14.7 per cent plunge in 1993. 'Signs increasingly show that the bottom of the pit has been reached in terms of investment. If there are no new handicaps to exports, companies will increase their investment as they modernise and face replacement needs,' the report says. The main growth in investment will come in the energy and service sectors. But west German industry will continue to feel the after-effects of the 1993 recession. Industrial investment could still fall by 5 per cent, the institute noted. 'But, without this noticeable change in demand, investment would have fallen by a double-digit figure this year too.' However, the institute warned that investment in 1994 would remain subject to growth in the European Union and to Germany's monetary policies. It stressed that investment could fall by 1 per cent if interest rates were not lowered and a pick-up in economic activity was not seen in neighbouring EU countries. Ifo recently added its voice to a growing chorus calling on the Bundesbank to help push the economy out of the recession with lower interest rates. The call had followed earlier accusations from the DiW institute in Berlin that the Bundesbank's go-slow policy was prolonging the recession. Yesterday's warning was also in line with polls conducted by Ifo last autumn in which 40 per cent of west German companies said they did not plan to increase investment, against just 18 per cent reporting otherwise. In eastern Germany, the report noted that investment would continue to increase in 1994, following a 15 per cent rise last year. Investment would be particularly concentrated in the public transport, mining, energy and services sectors.</p>

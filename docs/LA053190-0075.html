			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HARVARD RIDES DOUBLES WINS TO TENNIS TITLE  </P> <P> Buoyed by consistent doubles play, Harvard High recovered from a slow start and  defeated Cate, 10-8, to win the Southern Section 2-A Division tennis  championship at Balboa Park in Encino.  </P> <P> Under Coach Harry Salamandra, Harvard (17-2) has won four consecutive Southern  Section titles, two in the 1-A Division and two in the 2-A. Cate (22-2), which  is located in Carpinteria, was the Condor League champion and the top-seeded  team in the playoffs.  </P> <P> "They knew that they had the potential to outplay this team," Salamandra said  of his players. "But they'd have to work awful hard to do it."  </P> <P> As was the case in the quarterfinals and semifinals, the Saracens fell behind  in the first of three rounds. Cate held a 4-2 advantage after the first round  and quickly recorded a singles victory to begin the second round.  </P> <P> Harvard battled back and forged a 6-6 tie to close the second round.  </P> <P> "They're fighters," Salamandra said. "They seem to play better when they're  down. They are slow starting but I don't know if it is nerves or what."  </P> <P> Harvard's Pat List, who plays No. 1 doubles with Chris Pisano, has a different  theory.  </P> <P> "We get out of the warmup and we're just not thinking tennis," said List, who  lost the first set before winning the final two.  </P> <P> Some Harvard players, however, were thinking tennis. The No. 2 doubles team of  sophomore Steve Jang and freshman Josh Litter, swept its opponents, defeating  Matt Schwartz and John Crew, 7-5; Fritz Hummelt and Nick Meyer, 6-3; and Seth  Mallen and William Pan, 6-3.  </P> <P> "They are going to be tough," Cate Coach Robert Bonning said of Jang and  Litter. "Both have nice crisp volleys, they keep the ball down and they're  tough on points."  </P> <P> Despite that, they don't exactly inspire fear in their opponents when they take  the court: Litter is 5 feet tall, and Jang stands 5-3.  </P> <P> "I hear people say, 'Hey, hit it to the small guy,' " said Litter, who has been  playing in tournaments for four years. "I just try to stay consistent.  </P> <P> "They want to intimidate me. I have to keep my head together and try to pull  the points out."  </P> <P> Raj Vaswani also contributed to the win. Harvard's top singles player, Vaswani  was the only Saracen to win two sets in singles, defeating Till Falke, 6-2, and  Dennis Phelps, 6-1. He lost to Jim Vincent, 6-4.  </P> <P> Harvard beat San Dimas, Montclair, Santa Maria and Keppel to reach the final.  The Saracens, who shared the San Fernando Valley League title with Notre Dame  then lost a coin flip, were seeded sixth in the tournament.  </P></p>

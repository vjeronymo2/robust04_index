			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Little rays of light IT IS TIME for Hawks &amp; Handsaws to toss its hat into the ring and launch one or two campaigns aimed at brightening our lives on this weary, wracked planet. I am not talking about big things - the ozone layer, fox hunting or pre-millennial tension. I am talking about small things, such as the barbaric decision by England's cricket selectors not to include David Gower, a foppish but inspired batsman, in the England team to tour India this winter. I have no interest in cricket. It strikes me as basically silly. But it gives pleasure to many, and that is good. Much to its credit, The Observer last weekend launched its RGC - Restore Gower Campaign. What caught my eye was the quote from a Gower supporter who said: 'Gower is the gifted non-conformist being rejected by the puritans out of a mixture of animosity and jealousy. They don't like his casual approach and especially the fact that he can appear casual and still perform at the highest level.' That won my vote at once. Indeed, so impressed was I by the RGC that I am keen to organise something of my own. All week I have been locked in policy talks with the advisers who shape and mould this column. Some of them you know: Miss Lee, my executive assistant; my agent, Harriet Halfshare; Juliet Fetherbrayne, who handles my PR; and Sheikh Walli Al-kaljabi, who advises me on asset management and what the rich are thinking. The first idea we pondered was also the most obvious, an NLHNLC - Numerous Long Holidays for Norman Lamont Campaign. Britain's chancellor of the exchequer would be a suitable candidate for our largesse, for Hawks &amp; Handsaws was the first column to suggest that his tenure might not be long-lived. We have since realised that Norman's grip on office is indissolubly linked to the prime minister's fate. They will hang together, or prosper and survive. In the meantime, numerous long holidays for Norman Lamont could cause as much rejoicing as the reinstatement of David Gower. The next idea we considered was the FSRNSWNASASETIPCUTC - Find Something Really Nice to Say When Nasa's Seti Programme Comes Up Trumps Campaign. On October 12, Columbus Day, at 3pm Atlantic Standard Time, Nasa astronomers will launch their 10-year Seti programme, or Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. The project has full Nasa mission status. Astronomers like Jill Tarter, Seti's top scientist, envisage a galactic community of intelligent civilisations that are too far apart to 'socialise, colonise or cannibalise one another,' as Life put it this month, but which communicate via radio messages. The key question is this: once we detect a message, what will we say in reply? We cannot let the rest of the galaxy know what pigs we are; I suppose we will have to lie. Another idea my advisors are toying with is a GNKIEC - Get Neil Kinnock Into Europe Campaign. We like Neil Kinnock, and support his proposed appointment as a European Commissioner. What lends weight to this idea is the remark of Sir Teddy Taylor MP, a leading Tory Euro-sceptic, that Kinnock 'could actually do a great deal more for the EC than some of the Euro-twits regularly seen in Brussels.' A fourth idea was the COJGCPPM - Campaign to Organise a Jolly Good Christmas Party for Princess Margaret - on the grounds that the old duck must be sick of being portrayed as a faded appendage of the House of Windsor; must be worried by the growing cross-party clamour for royal pay cuts, and anyway likes nothing so much as a knees-up. Other potential crusades we are contemplating include the NMJANMC - No More Jokes About Nigel Mansell Campaign; and the CEMBPBPAWPWLNH - Campaign to Ensure that More Big Premium Bond Prizes Are Won by People Who Live in Notting Hill. Once you get going, all manner of opportunities for casting little rays of light across the planet's doomed and pitted surface spring to mind. So here is a competition: readers have until Friday October 2 to send me two proposals, plus short explanations, for LRLAPDPS's - Little Rays of Light Across the Planet's Doomed and Pitted Surface. Send them to Hawks &amp; Handsaws, Weekend FT, Number One Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL. The judges will be gifted individuals, and a prize will be awarded.</p>

At the meeting  they discussed the changes in the political life of the region  and stressed the necessity of nurturing democratic processes in  the newly independent states as a factor facilitating the  consolidation of their independence. Mircea Snegur asserted  that after the multi-party elevations, which designated a  parliamentary majority, and the opinion poll "La Sfat Cu  Poporul" ["Consulting the People"], at which the population  voted for independence, the stability is growing more evident.  It was also mentioned that it is possible that a special  juridical status for the Gagauz regions will be adopted before  the parliamentary vacation. it is much more difficult to  eliminate the consequences of the Dniester conflict, but in this  case only political steps will be undertaken as well said Mircea  Snegur. President Demirel said that he hopes that the Treaty of  Friendship and Collaboration which will be signed during the  visit will lead to the achievement of the goals toward which  both sides aspire. In this context it is vitally important to  comply with the Declaration of Economic Cooperation of the Black  Sea basin states, which is committed to an expansion and  diversification of economic relations among the countries of  this region. Demirel also affirmed that the Gagauz population  "will have a good reputation" if it respects the laws and the  territorial integrity of Moldova. "We are willing to offer the  Gagauzians cultural and economic assistance in order to raise  their standards of life as devoted citizens of the Republic of  Moldova," concluded Demirel.</p>

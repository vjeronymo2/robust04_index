			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nynex to take charge NYNEX, the regional telephone company serving the north-eastern US, is taking a fourth-quarter after-tax charge of between Dollars 250m and Dollars 275m. The charge relates to the sale of most of its information products and services businesses. The company said yesterday it was withdrawing from the information services business to concentrate on communications opportunities around the world. It expected to generate some Dollars 300m in cash from the disposal programme. As part of the divestment strategy, it also announced the sale of the information services businesses of AGS computers for an undisclosed sum to Keane, a Boston, Massachusetts, company specialising in information systems. Earlier this year, Nynex sold the BIS group, a British-based information services company, to ACT Group. Meanwhile, this month Apertus Technologies of Minnesota said it planned to buy Systems Strategies, a Nynex company providing multi-vendor computer software. Nynex recently agreed to invest Dollars 1.2bn in Viacom, the cable television company, as part of its bid for entertainment group Paramount Communications.</p>

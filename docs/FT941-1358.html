			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / A fillip for its fortunes: The challenges facing Credit Lyonnais after yesterday's rescue Most chairmen would adopt a sombre tone when announcing their company's worst-ever results. Yet Mr Jean Peyrelevade yesterday seemed remarkably cheerful when he announced that Credit Lyonnais made a net loss of FFr6.9bn (Pounds 800m) in 1993, the biggest in its history. The reason for his cheer was that, immediately after seeing the results, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, signed a rescue package to recapitalise the bank and clean up its balance sheet. The critical question for Credit Lyonnais is whether the rescue, which includes a FFr4.9bn capital injection and the transfer for five years of FFr40bn of non-performing loans to a new company with the state guaranteeing FFr18.4bn, will be enough to stabilise the bank after years of uncertainty. The government is hoping that Mr Peyrelevade will bring the restructured Credit Lyonnais back into the black, with the aim of eventual privatisation. The crux of Credit Lyonnais' problems is the aggressive lending and international expansion strategy of Mr Peyrelevade's predecessor, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, who chaired the bank from 1988 until last autumn. The group acquired a network of European retail banks but was left heavily exposed to the economic recession. Credit Lyonnais has been forced to write off many of Mr Haberer's loans because of the steep increase in French business failures and the fall in property prices. Both these problems were aggravated by its exposure to a series of corporate setbacks: from Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property group that collapsed owing it Dollars 350m; to MGM, the ailing Hollywood film studio that it owns and into which it has ploughed about Dollars 1.5bn. When Mr Peyrelevade, previously chairman of the Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) insurance group, was brought in by the government last November, Credit Lyonnais had just reported a net loss of FFr1.05bn for the first half of 1993 and its capital ratio had slipped close to the internationally-agreed minimum of 8 per cent. He realised the bank was in danger of breaching its capital ratio requirements and asked the government for support. The government, afraid that Credit Lyonnais might collapse, agreed, even though it was already under fire from the European Commission over a FFr2.5bn aid package for Bull, the computer company. It pressed ahead with the rescue despite complaints from other French banks about state support for a competitor. Banking analysts appear satisfied that the details of yesterday's package - combined with the plan for another capital injection later this year and Mr Peyrelevade's decision to make hefty provisions of FFr21.7bn against the remaining bad debts in Credit Lyonnais' balance sheet - will stabilise the bank's finances in the short term. 'Peyrelevade has devoted his first few months to the financial rescue,' says Mr Stephane Arrouays, who follows the French banking sector at BZW Securities. 'Now he's got to tackle its strategic problems.' These include rationalising the group's FFr55bn portfolio of industrial investments to enable management to concentrate on the core banking business. Mr Peyrelevade has drafted in Mr Dominique Bazy, his number two at UAP, to handle the disposals. Mr Bazy intends to sell FFr20bn of assets over the next two years and will orchestrate the sale of MGM. Proceeds from these disposals will help repair Credit Lyonnais' balance sheet and protect it in case it has to make substantial provisions in the future. Further writedowns on its commercial banking business are expected this year as the French economy is still fragile and the rate of business failures is high. Observers are also concerned about the bank's exposure on old loans to Sasea, the collapsed Swiss holding company that is now the subject of an acrimonious court case, and to Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French politician embroiled in legal suits over fraud and bribery allegations. 'If you'd asked me last year whether Credit Lyonnais was going to take any more big hits, I'd have said 'no',' says Mr Sasha Serafimovski, banking analyst at Merrill Lynch, the securities house. 'But it's disappointed us so often that now I'm not so sure. All we can hope is that, if the economy picks up, the cracks won't show.' The timing of the recovery will also determine the progress of Mr Peyrelevade's efforts, in the wake of yesterday's financial rescue, to improve the performance of Credit Lyonnais' domestic banking network. A serious problem for France's banks during the recession has been the weakness of the credit market. The amount of credit advanced fell by 4.5 per cent last year, according to the French Banking Association. 'There's no prospect of a real recovery in credit demand or of provisions returning to normal levels until 1995,' says Ms Sheila Garrard, who monitors the banking sector at securities house Lehman Brothers. 'That means margins will remain under pressure - unless it cuts costs.' In theory Credit Lyonnais has sig-nificant scope for cost-cutting. Operating costs absorbed 75 per cent of its net banking income in the first half of 1993: significantly higher than Banque Nationale de Paris's 68 per cent or Societe Generale's 67 per cent. Mr Peyrelevade yesterday unveiled a cost cutting plan which will involve reducing Credit Lyonnais' 38,449-strong French workforce by 10 per cent over the next three years - although he may face opposition from the banking unions. Past attempts by French banks, including Credit Lyonnais, to make more modest cuts triggered a wave of strikes across the industry. Mr Peyrelevade faces an equally difficult task in restructuring the group's European interests. Mr Haberer bought banks in Spain, Italy, the Benelux and Germany with the aim of building the first pan-European retail banking network to offer a cross-border service to corporate customers and a continental payment system for private clients. The hitch is that, so far, Credit Lyonnais' management has been so distracted by its financial problems that it has had no time to fulfil Mr Haberer's original ambition of moulding the acquisitions into an integrated network. Moreover, as it is the first bank to have attempted to create such a network, no one really knows whether the grand design will work. Some observers argue that the European banking market is too fragmented for a cross-border network to operate efficiently and that Credit Lyonnais would be better off pouring its resources into France, the one area where it has enough critical mass to be a market leader. Others believe that banking, like other industries, will become more international. Mr Arrouays of BZW is convinced that, if Mr Peyrelevade can transform the European acquisitions into an homogenous network, it could become 'a real strength' over the long term as economic conditions improve. But in the short term, like others, he is resigned to the prospect of another, albeit smaller, loss for Credit Lyonnais in 1994, with a return to profit pencilled in for 1995. As soon as the group is in the black the French government is expected to activate its plans to sell it off to the private sector. 'Is Credit Lyonnais sellable? Of course it is,' says Merrill Lynch's Mr Serafimovski. 'It's a bigger bank than BNP (which was privatised last autumn) and it's riskier. But it's also more exciting. All Credit Lyonnais needs is to give us some hard facts to prove that it will return to profit. It might even stop being the bank we all love to hate.'</p>

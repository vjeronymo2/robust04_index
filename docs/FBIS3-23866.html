			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anna Smirnova: "Russia's Power System Will Be </F> Partially Denationalized"]    [Text] The RAO "YeES Rossii" [Russian Joint-Stock Company  for Power and Electrification] is unique in the world in terms  of the scale and unity of its energy complex, which encompasses  Russia's entire electrical power infrastructure. "YeES Rossii"  includes about 70 regional power systems and about 600 thermal  and 100 hydroelectric stations with a total capacity of 210  million kilowatts, as well as electrical transmission lines  approximately 2.5 million kilometers in length, and planning and  scientific research institutes. Moreover, RAO "YeEs Rossii" has  at its disposal large blocks of stock from the power  construction industry and power machine building. In 1992  electrical power output by enterprises that now belong to RAO  "YeES Rossii" comprised about 1 trillion kilowatts per hour, and  thermal energy -- about 790 million gigacalories. Approximately  2 percent of electrical power was earmarked for export.    The Russian Joint-Stock Company for Power and  Electrification  (RAO "YeES Rossii"), the stock of which will be offered at check  auction, will be the largest Russian enterprise. Already this  winter the shares of the joint-stock society with its 70 billion  in authorized capital will be offered at auction for vouchers.  The auction rules were explained yesterday to reporters at a  press conference organized by RAO "YeES Rossii."    RAO "YeES Rossii," organized approximately one year ago in  accordance with an edict by the president of Russia within a  complex of measures to denationalize the power system, is a  unique joint-stock society. RAO "YeES Rossii" fixed capital  includes the largest electric stations in the country as well as  the entire network of communications that secures the  transmission of electrical energy. RAO "YeES Rossii" claims  authorized capital of almost 70 billion rubles and at the  present time 87 percent has already been organized  (contributions from the government and from regional energy  systems). The par value of RAO "YeES Rossii" stock has been  established at 500 rubles.    At the press conference held yesterday by Anatoliy  Baranovskiy, vice president of RAO "YeES Rossii," the  presidential edict on creating this AO [joint-stock company]  with the controlling participation of the government was  assessed as a logical step directed at achieving the unity and  security of Russia's energy system. In accordance with the  general ideology of reforming Russia's energy system and within  the framework of creating a single technological and economic  space, RAO "YeES Rossii" intends to institute cooperation among  its daughter companies, which will be organized as regional  energy complexes. Regional and federal analytic commissions,  which will establish local rates for services by the power  network and for the transmission of electrical power, will be  created to regulate the operations of these daughter companies.    At the check auction for RAO "YeES Rossii" stock, which in  all likelihood will take place already this winter, 20 percent  of the total AO stock will be put on the market (at a value of  slightly less than 14 billion rubles). There are no plans for  the participation of foreign investors at this stage.  KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts believe that one of the most active  participants in the auction will be the labor collectives of  enterprises that make up RAO "YeES Rossii" (total number of  employees comprises about 1 million people). It should be noted  that even before the carrying out of the check auction, RAO  "YeES Rossii" decided to concern itself with the secondary  market infrastructure for its stock. Thus, at the present time  the AO administration is examining the question of concluding  depository contracts (Germes-Invest and Menatep are competing to  be "YeES Rossii" depositories). Moreover, as announced at  yesterday's press conference, an official dealer has already  been selected -- the Russian brokerage house, "C. A. and Co." It  will be involved in maintaining the liquidity of the secondary  market of RAO "YeES Rossii" stock.</p>

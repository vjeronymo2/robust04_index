			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency  Alija Izetbegovic received in Sarajevo today the delegation of  the Croatian Parliament headed by Parliament Chairman Stipe  Mesic. In the course of the meeting, Izetbegovic and Mesic  spent a long time discussing the most topical issues concerning  relations between the two countries.    The Croatian delegation -- currently visiting Sarajevo on  the  invitation of Assembly Chairman Miro Lazovic, and for the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session -- comprises representatives  of several parliamentary parties. In addition to Stipe Mesic,  Damir Zoric, deputy chairman of the Croatian Parliament's House  of Districts [Zupanijski dom], and deputies in the Croatian  Parliament's House of Representatives [Zastupnicki dom] Muhamed  Zulic, Pavao Tomislav Duka, and Josip Pankretic are present.    After the meeting and talks in the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency, Stipe Mesic, chairman of the Croatian Parliament,  and Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency, gave the following statements to the many domestic  and foreign correspondents.    [Begin Mesic recording] The Croatian delegation -- or to put  it more precisely -- the delegation of the Croatian Parliament  has come to attend the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session. We  come as friends. This is a historical moment which reflects the  survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the only guarantee of peace  in Europe and the world. The world is returning to its  principles -- the principles of the inviolability of borders --  and this moment and the events in the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Assembly are effective confirmation of these principles. If the  borders were to be changed by force, new aggressors would appear  tomorrow. Why should the Serbs alone have the privilege of  living in one state and in the name of this be allowed to take  other peoples' territories? There would be others who would  demand this privilege, and then the world would no longer stand  a chance. Therefore, the return to these principles is a  guarantee of peace, and I believe that we are now much closer to  peace than we were earlier because the world has realized that  this is no longer about Bosniak Muslims, Croats, or Serbs. This  is about European and world peace. That is why they are now  solving this as their problem and not our problem. [end  recording]    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] [Words indistinct] Mr. Mesic  who is well-known as a friend of Bosnia-Herzegovina, [words  indistinct]. I remember him from our meetings in Belgrade,  where he always came up with a constructive position regarding  Bosnia- Herzegovina. We, of course, discussed relations between  Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the essential thing I can  accentuate is [word indistinct] that the maintenance of a  unitary Bosnia- Herzegovina is not only in the interest of  Bosnia-Herzegovina but also in Croatia's interest. Mr. Mesic  (?wholeheartedly) confirmed this in the course of our  discussion. Of course, the talks will continue with the  delegation of the (?Croatian) Parliament. We were very glad to  see that the Croatian delegation is a multiparty delegation.  (?We have) the representatives of (?three) parties here.  [Words indistinct] and we talked about opening a Croatian  embassy here in Sarajevo. [end recording]</p>

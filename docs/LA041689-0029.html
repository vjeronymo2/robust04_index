			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: SERVICE -- UP CLOSE AND TOO PERSONAL  </P> <P> My husband and I went out for one of our rare "intimate" dinners the other  night. As he leaned over and said, "You look nice in that dr. . . ," our waiter  (Hal) interrupted with, "Could I get you something from the bar?"  </P> <P> We ordered, and as I said, "So, tell me about. . . ," our waiter returned with  the drinks and said, "Are you ready for menus?" We quickly made our decision  and started to make small talk when Hal said, "Allow me to tell you about our  specials." After he recited the litany, he said he would give us time to think  about it. As I opened my mouth to share a bit of family gossip, he returned and  asked if we were ready to order.  </P> <P> Throughout the meal, he appeared at our elbow, filling our water glasses,  taking away excess silverware, replacing bread and asking us how we were  enjoying our dinner. Once when I thought I was about to complete a sentence, he  said: "Pardon me for interrupting, but could I tell you about our desserts?"  </P> <P> Hal was clearly getting on our nerves. We had spent more time with him in one  evening than with our kids over the last year. After he served dessert, he  scraped crumbs off the tablecloth, served our coffee and said to let him know  when we were ready for the check.  </P> <P> It was the last we would ever see or hear Hal speak again.  </P> <P> I don't know where waiters go with the checks. I only know that the same person  who fawned over us like an anxious bridegroom on his wedding night suddenly  dropped us like a bad habit.  </P> <P> After 20 minutes of waiting for Hal to return with our check, I observed: "It's  a strange time for him to start his vacation."  </P> <P> "After all we've meant to one another, he could at least have said goodby," my  husband said.  </P> <P> "Maybe we should report him missing."  </P> <P> "You have to be gone for 48 hours. We have 46 to go."  </P> <P> Occasionally, we thought we saw Hal dart from the kitchen and serve a table  across the room, but we couldn't catch his eye. As we sat there waving our  credit card and setting a small fire in the ashtray, it occurred to us that we  had become invisible.  </P> <P> Another 20 minutes passed. "Do you realize," my husband said, "that this is the  first time all night we've been alone? I've been trying to tell you all night I  like your dr. . . ."  </P> <P> "Shut up and wave something," I said, "or we'll be here all night."  </P> <P> I'm really worried about Hal. It's not as if he is a stranger to us. If you see  him, give us a call. He's about 5-11, weighs about 155 pounds, has a mustache  and our check.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE OFFICER CONVICTED OF KILLING 2 MIAMI BLACKS  </P> <P> A jury found police officer William Lozano guilty of two counts of manslaughter  Thursday in the deaths of two black men last January. The verdict in the highly  charged trial sent shock waves of surprise and relief through Miami, a city  that for days had been braced for a riot if an acquittal were handed down.  </P> <P> "In the past, the system had never worked for the black community," said Willie  Sims, crisis coordinator of the Dade County Community Relations Board. "Today  it worked. It's my personal feeling that justice has been served."  </P> <P> That feeling was widespread throughout much of Miami's black community. "This  is an extraordinary, even historic, verdict," said Marvin Dunn, a sociology  professor at Florida International University who has studied Miami's bloody  record of civil unrest in this decade. "This kind of case almost always goes in  the favor of police officers."  </P> <P> The verdict was read to a packed courtroom and over live television to all of  South Florida at 12:50 p.m., two hours after the jury first signaled that a  decision had been reached. The reading was held up while security at the  courthouse was tightened and police units were readied for possible action.  </P> <P> Lozano, 31, was accused of deliberately firing at an oncoming motorcycle ridden  by Clement Lloyd, 23, and passenger Allan Blanchard, 24. Lloyd was killed  instantly by a bullet to the head; Blanchard died of injuries the next day.  Lozano contended that he had shot in self- defense. The deaths touched off  three days of rioting in the city's predominantly black Overtown section.  </P> <P> Lozano, a short, dark-haired man with a pudgy face, remained expressionless as  the clerk read out the verdict: guilty on one count of manslaughter with a  firearm, guilty on one count of manslaughter without a firearm.  </P> <P> Lozano's wife, Ana, broke into tears, and one of his three brothers looked  stricken. That brother and Lozano's wife also are Miami police officers.  </P> <P> Lozano's defense attorney, Roy Black, had his head down and his hands folded as  if in prayer.  </P> <P> In Black's office afterward, Lozano -- still very composed -- said, "I was not  given a fair trial from the beginning. There was a lot of evidence denied and  quashed."  </P> <P> Sentencing was set for Jan. 24, when Lozano could face a maximum of 30 years in  prison on the most serious charge. Conviction of a charge of manslaughter with  a gun carries a three-year minimum sentence in Florida. Meanwhile, he remains  free on $10,000 bond.  </P> <P> The trial began with jury selection on Oct. 23, but for weeks prior to that  expectations had been rising that, if Lozano were acquitted of the charges, the  black community would erupt in violent protest.  </P> <P> In 1980, the acquittal by an all-white jury of several police officers charged  with beating to death another black motorcyclist resulted in a vicious  three-day riot in which 18 persons died.  </P> <P> In 1982, violent street protests broke out after another black man was shot to  death in Overtown by a Latino police officer. And rioting erupted two years  later when that officer, Luis Alvarez, was found not guilty by an another  all-white jury, which had heard an impassioned defense by Roy Black.  </P> <P> The Lozano case -- although haunted by violence, and the threat of more  violence, from the start -- was different. Dade Circuit Judge Joseph Farina  seemed determined to see an ethnically balanced jury seated, and he did. There  were two blacks, one Latino and three Anglos -- two men and four women.  </P> <P> One of the blacks -- Ezra Simmons, a 61-year-old vice president of a mail  handlers' union who lives in Miami's Liberty City -- was elected foreman. He  was also the man Black tried hard to keep off the panel.  </P> <P> During jury selection, Black opted to excuse Simmons, using one of his  peremptory challenges. But Farina ruled that the move was racially motivated.  Black, contending that the man was biased against Latinos, appealed the judge's  order to a higher court. The judge's ruling was sustained.  </P> <P> "It's a bitter irony," Black said, "that the man we most feared ended up being  the foreman."  </P> <P> The rulings by Farina and the state appeals court are sure to form the basis of  the appeal Black said he would file.  </P> <P> Assistant State Atty. John Hogan, who prosecuted, said on the steps of the  courthouse after the trial: "I take no pleasure in convicting a police officer,  but I take a great deal of pleasure in realizing the system works."  </P> <P> Miami Police Chief Perry Anderson, who himself is black, said he understood  that "it's a difficult time for some of the individuals who have worked with  this particular officer to accept the verdict, but I think they are  professionals and will continue to be professionals . . . ."  </P> <P> But Richard Kinne, head of the police union that represents most of Miami's  1,093 officers, said that "most of my members are in shock. We all felt William  Lozano was justified" in using deadly force.  </P> <P> When asked about the average officer's reaction, Kinne added: "He's seriously  thinking what he's going to do in a life-threatening situation. He could become  concerned and hesitant out in the street."  </P> <P> The case began early on the night of Jan. 16, when Lozano and his partner were  stopped on a street in Overtown. While Lozano searched the trunk of his squad  car for a report form, a motorcycle being pursued by a police car because of a  traffic violation roared toward him. Lozano stepped into the street, pulled out  his 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol and fired a single shot, killing Lloyd.  </P> <P> Lozano contended that he had had no time to escape being hit by the motorcycle.  "I thought he was going to run me down," he said from the witness stand. "I  thought I was a dead person."  </P> <P> But the prosecution contended that Lozano, violating police training and common  sense, stepped into the path of the motorcycle, aimed, tracked the driver in  his sights and fired when the vehicle drew near.  </P> <P> "It's hard to believe a police officer could do something so stupid," said  Hogan in his closing arguments Tuesday. "But this man, on Jan. 16, pulled the  trigger of a gun and snuffed out two lives."  </P> <P> The 58 witnesses who testified gave often-conflicting accounts of what they had  seen and heard.  </P> <P> But the case apparently held no particular confusion for the jurors. They  deliberated for a little more than seven hours before reaching a verdict.  </P> <P> Throughout Miami Thursday morning, the air was electric with tension and  anticipation.  </P> <P> Many teachers allowed their students to watch the courtroom proceedings from  classroom television sets. Some radio stations urged people to drive with their  lights on in a collective plea to refrain from violence once the decision  became known.  </P> <P> The halls of the county courthouse were jammed with reporters, lights and  cameras, along with scores of curious people. Police officers, on alert and  working 12-hour shifts since Tuesday, seemed to be everywhere.  </P> <P> "I'm optimistic we're not going to have any problems," said Miami police  spokesman David Rivero a few minutes before the jury filed back into the  courtroom. "I think this community is going to act responsibly."  </P> <P> But, in fact, there were a few problems Wednesday night as rumors that Lozano  has been acquitted swept the community. Sporadic stone- and bottle-throwing was  reported at one Overtown intersection, and a few blocks away a car was set  afire.  </P> <P> After the verdict, police remained on alert. But, in the black communities of  Overtown and Liberty City, especially, tension had given way to a celebration  ignited by the feeling that justice had been served.  </P> <P> "This is a time for rejoicing," said Billy Hardamon, leader of a group called  People United for Justice.  </P> <P> In the Latino community, there was disappointment and anger but no sign of  street protests. Latinos in Miami are a majority and play a much bigger role in  the power structure than do blacks.  </P></p>

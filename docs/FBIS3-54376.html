			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Beware of Lack of Coordination with Damascus </F> and Amman]    [Text] All elements of the Arab negotiating side have  their significance, role, and centrality in the peace process.  The key to peace is not only in the hands of the Palestinian  element. This fact should not be absent from the minds of the  Palestinian leadership, which signed an agreement with Israel  before the others. This signing does not mean that we should  ignore the importance of coordination with the Arab side's other  elements, foremost of all Amman and Damascus.    Enhanced coordination with Jordan and Syria must continue  and  proceed on the highest levels. Any rift with this or that side  should be avoided and no issue or stance should outweigh the  importance of coordination with the Jordanian and Syrian sides.    True, the Palestinian side's decisionmaking is independent,  but this does not mean that the Palestinian leadership should  "turn its back" on fraternal Syria and Jordan. A rift with them  or sufficing with a fragile and pretentious coordination harms  the Palestinian cause and position and gives Israel an  additional opportunity to pursue positions rejected by the  Palestinian side. Moreover, rifts and lack of coordination  constitute an element of pressure in Israel's hands against the  Palestinian side. Beware of hostility with Damascus and beware  of lack of strong and serious coordination with Amman.</p>

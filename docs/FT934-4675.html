			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (3): Well placed to out-perform market - As the crisis in the property sector diminishes, Christine Moir finds the market in better shape All the main property markets have been in crisis to some degree over the past three years. Falling rents and demand, over-supply from the development boom of the late 1980s, recessionary squeezes throughout the broad economy and structural problems in some centres have persuaded many investors to become net disinvestors in property. But the corner may have been turned. According to Rick Lacaille of NatWest Investment Management's property team: 'The perception now is that there may be a risk in not being in property. Not that property assets will suddenly shoot ahead but the sector is now placed to out-perform steadily.' The price of that change in perception has been a savage correction in property values across the world. Over the past year that painful process has been reinforced by falling interest rates. In those centres where the dual effect has been to produce a positive yield gap between property and fixed interest, investors are returning. Evidence is still patchy. The UK Central Statistical Office (CSO) figures for the second quarter (the latest available) inspired a wave of invective from property market professionals for suggesting that institutions had lapsed back into net sellers of Pounds 177m of property in the UK in the second quarter this year, after a spring flurry of net buying amounting to Pounds 155m. Anecdotal evidence pointed to buying activity continuing to strengthen in the summer. But the two might not really be in dispute. The Pru is typical in concentrating on its home market for the present. 'We disinvested from Europe over the past few years and we are not planning to re-enter it. We don't feel we have sufficiently good information about the markets. In North America we are looking more actively, but we haven't done deals.' Nigel King, Salomon Brothers' head of European real estate, confirms that, for US institutions, cross-border activity has been a low priority recently. 'There has been concern over currencies, the economic slow down and lease structures. On top of that, US institutions have been busy turning private pools of assets into public pools.' This has mostly taken the form of repackaging property portfolios from failed savings and loans operations as quoted Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Where US investors do look abroad, Mr King says, their first port of call is London. Beyond that their preferences are - in order - Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid. US investors are not the only ones to turn their eyes first to London. As it becomes the first important market to complete the painful correction and offer positive rates of return compared with cash and fully priced equities, overseas investors remember the virtues of the UK's uniquely long leases and upwards-only rent reviews. In the past couple of months, says Malcolm Naish, a fund management partner at Jones Lang Wootton, competitive bidding has returned to the London market. Interest has resurfaced from German, middle eastern and far eastern investors - witness last month's sale of the headquarters of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), at No 1 Exchange Square, in the Broadgate development, to Deutsche Grundbesitz Investmentgesellschaft. David Seddon, Mr Naish's colleague, confirms that London's restructuring is the most advanced of European centres. Price corrections elsewhere have not yet been completed. Nevertheless some markets are already reviving. In Germany lettings remain weak, but the investment side is buoyant, with local open ended investment funds sucking in DM11bn in the first nine months of 1993, compared with DM6bn for the whole of 1992. Since they must invest at least 50 per cent of income, domestic markets are now sure to be supported. Munich, Hamburg and Dusseldorf are likely to benefit first. Rents there have stabilised, while in Frankfurt and Berlin rents are still falling back from the giddy peaks of post-union euphoria. Demand is also picking up in the Benelux countries, where rent stability has also returned. Brussels, which showed exceptional growth from 1987 until last year, is beginning to be attractive again, especially to Scandinavian investors. The four main cities of the Dutch randstadt have developed a positive yield gap over fixed rate mortgage money. Although they are dominated by Dutch institutions, these markets also attract cautious international funds happy with the long history of rents matching inflation. Opinion is most divided about Paris. No investment market to speak of has existed there for the past couple of years, yet many investors remain sceptical about whether the locals have got the message and reduced prices far enough. Others believe that the final correction cannot be far off, and that rents will bottom out by the end of this year. On this theory, France is the market for 1994, and a few institutions are already fishing at the bottom, hoping for early worms. Spain continues to present a less than attractive front. although prices have more than halved. Madrid is simply over-built outside its historic core, which is largely closed to commercial opportunities. Rents in Barcelona, despite having fallen from Pta4,500 to Pta2,500 per sq m per month, may still not have bottomed out. And prices still produce a yield of 7.5 per cent at a time when cash offers 8 per cent to 9 per cent. In short, Europe divides into two halves: the north already active and in some cases buoyant; inertia still ruling in France and Spain - though with France, perhaps, poised to hit bottom and bounce back. Everywhere, however, investors' appetite will only be maintained if interest rates remain below property yields.</p>

Statistics show that in the latter half of last year, five  sets of local regulations governing the operation of the Tianjin  Port Free Trade Zone were established and promulgated.    Officials said the new regulations are expected to give an  impetus to the growth of overseas investment.    Other local laws and regulations include the Tianjin  Commodity Market regulations, the Tianjin Technical Market  regulations, the social security regulations and the management  law governing religious sites in Tianjin City.    Legislative officials said it still remained a hard task for  them to make laws and regulations urgently needed by a growing  socialist market economy.    "They were so urgently needed that we cannot wait and must  redouble our efforts to do our job well," said an official with  the Standing Committee of the Tianjin Municipal People's  Congress.    With support from the municipal government, they have  investigated current conditions and consulted with many  departments concerned. They also listened to opinions of  different parties and experts before the laws and regulations  were passed.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Pressure intensifies for further realignment of ERM PRESSURE FOR a further realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism intensified last night after five of the system's remaining currencies dropped close to their ERM floors against the D-Mark. Four European central banks intervened heavily on the foreign exchange markets yesterday, buying their currencies for the D-Mark after an unexpectedly strong figure for Germany's monetary growth in August indicated that the Bundesbank would be unable to cut interest rates further. A spokesman for the French finance ministry denied rumours that the ERM would be suspended altogether and that the French franc would be devalued against the D-Mark. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, said in Washington that he did not see a D-Mark revaluation happening. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, who was in Washington for the World Bank/International Monetary Fund meetings, said last night he saw no need for 'further adjustment' after last week's turmoil on the currency markets. Speaking to journalists he also said there was no good reason for speculators to attack the French franc. Mr Waigel's comments came after he had abruptly cancelled his scheduled appointments and attended what German embassy officials there described only as a 'series of bilateral meetings'. It was not immediately clear with which countries he had conferred. But after a day in which a number of currencies were pushed close to their floor levels in the European exchange rate mechanism, the move raised speculation that a further ERM upheaval could be imminent. Further fuelling this suspicion were reports that several EC financial policymakers - including Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, and Mr Horst Kohler, Mr Waigel's top official - were flying back early from Washington. Community and national officials maintained their denial of rumours earlier in the day that a meeting of the European Community Monetary from Committee, which is composed of representatives of finance ministries and central banks, was about to be convened. Mr Waigel later reaffirmed Germany's commitment to the European Monetary System and said it would do 'everything possible' to allow currencies that have temporarily left the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS to return to it. On the foreign exchange markets, the falls in the value of the French franc, the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo, the Dan-ish krone and the Irish punt came within a week of the sus-pension of sterling and the Italian lira from the ERM. The Bank of France intervened for the fourth trading day running, buying francs for D-Marks, as its currency threatened to fall to its ERM floor against the D-Mark of FFr3.4305. Dealers said that the French central bank's intervention was substantial, but the franc closed in London at FFr3.4260. The Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo also came under intense selling pressure. The Bank of Spain intervened to defend the peseta for the first time since its currency was devalued by 5 per cent last week. But the peseta closed at Pta71.91 to the D-Mark, very near to its new ERM floor of Pta72.62. The Portuguese escudo slipped below Esc89 to the D-Mark, close to its floor of 92.33. The Dutch central bank bought the Irish punt and the Danish krone for the Dutch guilder, which was yesterday the second strongest ERM currency. In Frankfurt the Bundesbank said that M3, the broad monetary aggregate, had expanded at an annualised rate of 9 per cent from 8.5 per cent in July. This suggests inflationary pressures in Germany are still high and that German interest rates may not be reduced again for some time. The figure for August M3 money supply compares with the Bundesbank's target range of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent for the full year.

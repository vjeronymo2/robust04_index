The first deals  with the many safety improvements already proposed for the next  generation of reactors. In all leading nuclear power countries,  evolutionary plants are being developed for large scale  implementation around the turn of the century. They contain  numerous safety improvements based on the vast accumulated  operational experience and include new design features as well  as design simplifications. Already high safety levels continue  to increase. The increase in safety by any measure is  impressive. Estimates of severe core damage likelihood for the  evolutionary designs are below 1 in 10,000 per reactor per year  and are now comparable to natural disaster frequencies. The  future will call for a continued process of evolutionary safety  development along with designs with greater inherent safety and  more passive systems requiring less mechanical and human actions.    The many improvements already made are closely involved with  human performance. While operational incidents are often due to  design errors and mechanical failures, the real root causes can  lie in organizational and individual deficiencies due to  failings in what is termed Safety Culture. Safety  culture is a new concept which has only evolved over the past  several years. It is the aggregate qualities, both in  organizations and in individuals, which make safety an  overriding priority. It has two major components. One is  concerned with the individuals' attitudes and responses, and the  other is the organizational framework in which they work.  Attitudes can be influenced by education and training and  perhaps more so by psychological and environmental factors.  Organizational styles can also be influenced so as to promote  policies which encourage attitudes favorable to safety. Safety  culture is necessary not only at the operational level, that is  at the utility and the plant, but also at the governmental  level, in the regulatory body and as well in design,  construction and research organizations. An introduction to this  important subject, is the second theme of this talk.    The global nature of nuclear safety leads to the concluding  theme. This is a discussion of the preparatory efforts underway  for an International Nuclear Safety Convention, an agreement  which could be the cornerstone of improving nuclear safety  worldwide. Although contentious points remain, the preparatory  work has advanced to the point where an agreed text should soon  be ready with adoption by a Diplomatic Conference likely next  year. In general the difficulty in formulating an agreed text  has arisen from the difference in approach between those  countries desiring a very detailed and strict convention and  those wishing a less demanding one. The former wishes to see  binding internationally agreed upon safety codes, mandatory  safety reviews, detailed reporting, and emergency plans  involving neighboring countries. The latter desires a convention  based on more general safety fundamentals and on safety culture  principles. It has been agreed that the convention will be  limited to civil nuclear power plants, but there will likely be  a commitment to begin negotiations on an international  instrument on the safety of waste management.  <H5>  Safety Issues in Russia's Nuclear Power </H5>   [A. Abagyan, Director General, VNIIAES, Russian Federation]    The safety of Russia's operating NPPs is on the one hand  determined by today's status of its nuclear power industry and  on the other hand -- by the modern international safety  requirements.    The nuclear power is characterized by the existence of  different types of nuclear units (mainly VVER and RBMK type) of  different generations. Presently nine NPPs are in operation in  Russia which incorporate 29 units with the total capacity of  21,242 MW.    The operating units can be conditionally broken down into  two  generations:    -- First generation units (``older'' units). These were  designed prior to the development and enforcement of the basic  Safety Codes and Guides in the former USSR.    -- Second generation units. These were developed in  accordance with the Safety Codes developed with account for  operational experience with the units of the first generation.    In total there are 13 units of the first generation. These  include four VVER-440/230 units and four RBMK-1000 units  constructed before 1978. These ``older'' units from the  viewpoint of modern international safety requirements are the  most seriously criticized ones. The paper addresses the safety  issues of these units and conditions of their operation up to  expiration of the design lifetime -- up to 2000-2005.    Improvement of the safety level of the units of second  generation is to a great extent associated with improvement of  their instrumentation of diagnostic and information system.    Further expansion of nuclear program in Russia is related  with the use of VVER-1000 reactors of the third generation and  also of the new generation of light water reactors based on the  modern international criteria of inherent fault immunity and use  of passive safety systems.  <H5>  IAEA's Nuclear Power Plant Safety Programs in Eastern Europe </H5> and Countries of the Former Soviet Union    [L. Lederman, IAEA, Division of Nuclear Safety]    The safety on nuclear power plants in operation in Eastern  Europe and in countries of the former Soviet Union is a matter  of great international concern. However, the current energy  supply and demand in these countries allows little scope for  immediately closing down less safe plants. A realistic approach  must deal with urgent short term improvements to reduce safety  risks pending a feasible long term solution. This long term  solution could combine alternative energy supply, improvements  towards a more efficient use of energy and safety upgradings and  reconstruction of the nuclear power plants.    There are currently 57 NPP of the WWER and RBMK types in  operation and 16 under construction in these countries.    Efforts have been underway to deal with the problem. The  IAEA  has initiated in 1990 new and major activities to supplement its  ongoing safety services. Significant bilateral and multilateral  assistance activities have been initiated by the USA, Japan and  other OECD countries. There are projects funded by the  Commission of the European Communities. The European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development in London, the European  Investment Bank in Luxembourg, and the World Bank are also  considering financing safety improvements.    Implementing a mechanism for effective co-ordination of  current international efforts has not been an easy task. One  should however recognize that the difficulties encountered so  far in producing effective co-ordination are not very different  from those associated with past assistance efforts of such  magnitude and complexity. Since the beginning of 1992 a  mechanism for co-ordination, established through a G-24 Working  Group which meets in Brussels, has been in place. It has been  chaired by the CEC with IAEA participation in a technical  advisory capacity.    In December 1991 the Agency completed the first phase of the  extrabudgetary programme on the safety of WWER-440/230 plants  and issued a technical document (IAEA-TECDOC-640) containing --  inter alia -- the results of safety review missions to all  WWER-440/230 plants. The document evaluates the significance of  the identified safety issues and provides a basis for the short  and long-term activities required in order to improve plant  safety. Early in 1992 the IAEA published ``An overview and major  findings of the extrabudgetary programme on the safety of  WWER-440 model 230 nuclear power plants'' (STI/PUB/912).    The second phase of the programme, currently in progress,  focuses on assisting Member States to plan and evaluate  modifications (as regards both hardware and the conduct of  operations) and to verify that proposed modifications respond to  concerns identified during the programme's first phase.    There is an international consensus that, together with  WWER-440/230 plants, RBMK plants are the ones requiring most  urgent attention and safety improvements.    The Agency has started in 1992 an ``International Programme  on Safety Assessment of RBMK Reactors.''    The objective of the programme is to review the scope and  results of safety evaluations performed, the technical basis for  the safety improvements implemented or planned and to establish  international consensus on priority actions. The results of this  programme will contribute to establishing a basis for decisions  on technical and financial support for implementation of  measures to improve safety.    In December 1992, an Advisory Group with participants from  21  countries and five international organizations reviewed the  progress of the Agency's nuclear safety programmes for Eastern  Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union and advised on  future activities and necessary co-ordination.    In general it was agreed that the Agency's programmes had  been very useful and that the planned future activities  responded to the needs of countries constructing and/or  operating WWER and RBMK plants. The IAEA programme was then  extended to include other types of WWERs namely 440 model 213  and 1000 NPPs.    The full paper reports on the major results reached in the  frame of the IAEA programmes and future activities.  <H5>  Issues Related to the Safety of Nuclear Power Reactors in </H5> the Former Eastern-Bloc Countries -- A Western Viewpoint    [S. Chakraborty, Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate,  CH-5232 Villigen-HSK, Switzerland]    Abstract    Reviews performed by several international organizations,  including those of the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) countries, and several other countries have  identified many concerns related to design, siting (i.e., plant  sites near major tectonic faults), operation, maintenance,  management, safety culture, and regulatory mechanisms in the  nuclear power industries of the former Eastern bloc countries.  This situation is now compounded with the economic and political  problems that have ensued since the break-up of the former  Eastern bloc.    The objective of this paper is to discuss the safety  concerns  with the Eastern nuclear power plants and ways to address the  current debacle, based on the experience with the Western  nuclear power development programs and current safety and  regulatory standards and practices. Finally, the approach to  improving the safety of nuclear power reactors in the former  Eastern-bloc countries is proposed based on the lessons learned  from the Western nuclear power development, construction and  operation over the past 40 years.    A multi-pronged safety resolution approach consisting of the  following is needed:    1. A rehabilitation of safety culture within the Eastern  nuclear operations and regulatory process;    2. Development of a comprehensive nuclear regulatory process  and safety acceptability criteria;    3. Assessment of plant vulnerabilities and most  cost-effective ways of plant modifications;    4. Development of programs for operational training, testing  procedures, and maintenance; and    5. Development of revised design standards and licensing  procedures for modernization of the Eastern nuclear power  industries.    The safety improvements that are a prerequisite for the  faith  in nuclear power encompass not only reduction of risk from  severe accidents but also reduction of economic risk (which  could threaten the national economy of less developed countries)  and improvements in operational reliability.  <H5>  Japanese Assistance and Cooperation to the Former Soviet </H5> Union and Central and East European Countries To Improve Nuclear  Safety    [Toshio Okazaki, Deputy Director General, Atomic Energy  Bureau, Science and Technology Agency]    Background    At the July, 1992, summit meeting in Munich, nuclear safety  in the former Soviet Union and other Central and East European  countries was recognized to give cause for great concern  requiring urgent solutions, and the summit participants agreed  on a set of multilateral assistance measures, which were  included in the summit's economic declaration.    Accordingly, the Japanese government had already been  implementing bilateral assistance (coordinated with that of the  Western nations) and it now also takes part in multilateral  efforts, for example, through contributions to the Nuclear  Safety Account, which was established to supplement bilateral  measures by bilateral programs.    At the Tokyo Summit in July of this year, the same issue was  addressed again, and the importance of immediate action to  ensure safety was reiterated.    Nature of Japanese Assistance    Starting with measures requiring immediate implementation,  efforts to improve the safety of Soviet-designed NPP's are  focused on operational safety improvements, near-term technical  improvements to plants based on safety assessments, and  enhancing regulatory regimes. The following types of assistance  are being rendered:    (1) Multilateral Programs    The IAEA dispatches experts and conducts study meetings to  assess the safety of Soviet-designed nuclear NPP's. The Japanese  government participates in those safety-assessment meetings, and  cooperates with the IAEA, including with extra-budgetary  contributions to the program.    For near-term improvements in the technical aspects of  nuclear safety, the government makes financial contributions to  the Nuclear Safety Account. Contributions will also be made to  the OECD-NEA, specifically for their efforts to increase safety  from a long-term point of view.    (2) Bilateral Programs    The Japanese government conducts safety-related  international  training programs for experts including nuclear safety  regulators, operators and engineers of the nuclear power plants  in the former Soviet Union and Central and East European States.  In addition to this, the government has launched other  cooperative efforts, including installation of Leak Detection  System with High Temperature Resistant Microphones in Nuclear  Power Plant to detect leakage from the reactor pipelines;  training for those responsible for operational management, using  simulators installed at the Nuclear Power Plant Safety Operation  Training Center in Russia; and others.    Japan is also planning to send specialists to exchange  information on nuclear power safety with their counterparts in  the various countries.</p>

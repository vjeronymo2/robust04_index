			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Chuprin report under the "Details" rubric: </F> "Version 10 of the State Duma Deputy's Murder: Yuriy Korablin,  Khimki Administration Head, Puts His Own Questions to the  Competent Organs"]    [Text] The business relations between Andrey Ayzderdzis,  the deceased State Duma deputy, and Yuriy Korablin, head of the  administration of the city of Khimki, were highly strained.  That is what many of the mass media have been claiming since  Ayzderdzis' tragic murder 26 April.    Among other things, Ayzderdzis was Korablin's rival in the  State Duma elections, and the administration head could not  forgive the defeat inflicted on him by his opponent: He did not  allocate him official premises for receiving voters and tried to  install his own people at the MDK-Bank, which A. Ayzderdzis  directed prior to his election to parliament.    It has been alleged, either implicity or openly, that  Korablin had an interest in the death of the people's deputy.    Yesterday the head of the Khimki administration broke the  "vow of silence which he had given until the body of the  deceased is committed to the earth." He held a press  conference. He announced that "someone stands to gain from  fueling political passions in the region and from making  unfounded criminal accusations against totally innocent people."  He claimed that the uproar against him in the newspapers was  started six months ago -- while Andrey Ayzderdzis was still  alive.    "It is being claimed in the press that the MDK-Bank is a  financially impeccable firm and that I set up my own bank in the  city and did not want any rivals. However, I have not set up  any commercial structures, just as I did not run for the Federal  Assembly. In Moscow Oblast there are forces which want to  destabilize the situation in the region."    Yu. Korablin believes that the oblast regional  administration  to combat organized crime and its Chief Major General A.  Kartashev personally are forces of that kind.    "Everything that is being written about me in the newspapers  today coincides word for word with the content of a report  compiled by that department 24 January this year," he said.  "Since that time I and my deputies have been tailed and had our  telephones bugged. At that time three staffers of the  directorate had close contacts with Ayzderdzis and visited the  MDK-Bank almost all the time. Kartashev is deliberately  misleading the investigation."    Yu. Korablin calls this the 10th plausible version of the  killing -- the first nine, the head of the administration said,  were described in DAILY-KOMMERSANT [as published]. Nor does he  discount the possibility that the tragedy might have been the  result of personal "feuds" among people involved in commerce.  He stated that the MDK-Bank concealed 1.160 billion rubles from  taxation last year -- there is a report from the tax  inspectorate to that effect. In addition, Yu. Korablin said,  summing up, "a criminal group whose head was recently murdered  while in prison had become involved in the bank's affairs."    The mayor of Khimki stated that the city authorities are  organizing an independent investigation into the deputy's murder  and have already offered 15 million rubles as reward for  information of help to the investigation.</p>

			<p>940305 FT  05 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: From Matthews to Malaysia Sir, I have a customer in Malaysia to whom I have sent the following letter: 'Dear Mr Wong, Everyone in this country is sorry to hear that Malaysia is placing a ban on British products, in our view totally illogically because the English press is not controlled in any way by the British government. 'There seems only one way for the normal businessman to bring this home to your citizens and I am afraid that is by the simple decision not to buy anything else from your country. We will not, therefore, be buying any more bookcases and it is a pity because they are a good product and they are beginning to sell well.' I suggest that similar letters from other readers could only be beneficial] David Matthews, Matthews Office Furniture, 61-63 Dale St, Liverpool L69 2DN</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / The FT Interview: Generation game winner - Peter Wallenberg Peter Wallenberg, patriarch of the fourth generation of one of Europe's mightiest in-dustrial families, has the battered but exhilarated air of someone who has just been on a particularly bone-shaking fairground ride. With good reason. Not only has he steered his empire - a network of holdings that comprises almost every well-known name in Swedish industry, including Astra, Asea, Electrolux, Ericsson, Saab-Scania and Stora - through Sweden's worst recession since the 1930s. He has also, contrary to widespread expectations, emerged more dominant than ever in Swedish business. Mr Wallenberg, a gruff, rumpled figure with an impish sense of humour, can afford a little self-congratulation in talking about his recent ordeal: 'You can ask my colleagues and they will say: 'You smell trouble long before anybody else'.' Nevertheless, he remains acutely sensitive about the perception that the industrial edifice he has controlled for the past 12 years was almost brought down by recession. Frequently in the past 18 months commentators questioned whether a domain that stretches from forestry through engineering and motor manufacturing to telecommunications and pharmaceuticals could survive shrinking markets and piles of debt. Mr Wallenberg, now 68, does not deny that the recession 'put the whole organisation to a very tough test'. It was, he says, 'the sort of experience when, really, your heart goes down very far in your body at an early stage and you live with that until you work your way out of it'. An important turning point came with the flotation and heavy devaluation of the Swedish krona in November 1992. The steady slide in interest rates and the export lift that followed provided a vital lifeline - not least to Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's premier bank and the Wallenbergs' financial flagship that only a year ago was on the brink of a state takeover. Mr Wallenberg prefers to stress the toughness and ingenuity of his senior managers in pulling the companies he controls out of the mire. Investor, the family's chief investment vehicle which controls most of the Wallenberg blue-chips, managed to scale down a threatening level of debt through some deft divestments, while preserving control of its prize assets. 'The reserves in Investor proved more than adequate without selling off any single major holding,' he declares. Nor, he insists, is any such big sell-off contemplated now. The family still controls as much as 40 per cent of the Stockholm stock market through companies which boast total annual sales of SKr450bn (Pounds 38bn). More than that, the dynasty's dominance has been enhanced by recent developments at Volvo, a company that in the past provided a genuine counterweight to the Wallenberg empire. After the collapse of its plan to merge with France's Renault and the departure of chairman Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo is selling all its non-core interests to concentrate on making cars, trucks and buses. One large subsidiary has already been sold - to the Wallenbergs - and two top Wallenberg men have been appointed to the Volvo board. Needless to say, the kind of shareholder revolt that humbled Mr Gyllenhammar would be hard to imagine with the Wallenbergs. A system of weighted shares, where one class of share has much greater voting power than the second, is the cement that has bound the empire together and fended off the threat of foreign takeover. The structure, at its most extreme, allows Wallenberg companies to control 94.1 per cent of the votes in Electrolux, the world's leading white goods maker, with just 6.4 per cent of the capital. Mr Wallenberg is quite unrepentant about this system. Nor does he seem worried now that it faces any legislative threat, either within Sweden or from the European Union. 'All countries in Europe have their way of securing industries that are of a certain interest to the nation in one way or another.' But what about growing assertiveness among minority shareholders, in Sweden as elsewhere in Europe? Might it not eventually undermine the Wallenbergs' control? 'Look,' he says, 'the capacity and competence of the majority of small shareholders to really influence a company in a businesslike manner might be brought into doubt.' Equally, he bristles at the suggestion that such dominance as he exercises might be unhealthy for Sweden, either by limiting competition or by impeding the growth and capital-raising potential of his companies. The competitive spur, he insists, comes from the international market, and the companies positively benefit from the long-term stability of ownership and strength of reputation that his family brings. 'As long as we perform at least as well or better than other equivalent industries. . . we will do nothing that will be against the best interests of the country.' Questions about industrial logic, he implies, are beside the point against the overriding objective of maintaining the family inheritance. 'The alternative is to sell out, pocket the money and do something else. Go fishing or something.' Clearly, that is not an option he contemplates. Instead, the strategy now is to look abroad for expansion because, Mr Wallenberg says, Sweden is a small and saturated market. Beyond the present, his biggest preoccupation is passing on a healthy bequest to the next Wallenberg generation - his son Jacob and his nephew Marcus, both now in their late 30s and playing senior roles in Investor and SE-Banken. It is a subject that appears to weigh heavily on him, not least because of his own experience: in effect passed over for the top job by his legendary father Marcus Wallenberg, who publicly deprecated his talents, Peter took over in 1982 when his father died aged 83 - and then only after his brother Marc, the appointed heir, had committed suicide. The current patriarch vows not to subject Jacob and Marcus to such indignities. But he is not yet ready to hand over and he is setting tough terms. 'I would dearly love to see the next generation come on. That would make the fifth generation. But you know what I would hate to see is for any of them to come to the top positions and fail.' The word 'fail' comes out like an expletive. 'I am prepared to let these boys (take over) provided they come out right.'</p>

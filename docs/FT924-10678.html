			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Greeks in assembly link with Boeing HELLENIC Aerospace Industry (HAI), a state-owned Greek facility, has signed a Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.2m) contract with Boeing Corporation, the US aircraft manufacturer, for assembly work on the Boeing 757 passenger jet. It is the first big contract HAI has won since Lockheed Aircraft Services International, the service arm of Lockheed Corporation of the US, took over management of the Greek company 18 months ago. HAI will make part of the B757 airframe at its plant at Tanagra, central Greece, under an offset agreement made when Olympic Airways, the Greek carrier, ordered six new Boeing aircraft as part of its 1990s fleet renewal. HAI officials say that, with the Boeing contract secured, the company is well placed to win more civil aviation subcontracting work. Talks are under way with both Northrop and Vought, two major Boeing subcontractors. A smaller contract signed recently with Dornier, to make airframe parts worth DM1.4m (Pounds 560,000) for the UH-1D helicopter used by the German armed forces, is typical of HAI's scale of operation until now. The company, set up by the state in the late 1970s to carry out repairs for the Greek air force, does maintenance for several Middle East and Gulf air forces. But the production side has been slow to develop despite a number of opportunities for offset work linked with Greece's recent purchases, from France and the US respectively, of the Mirage 2000 and F-16 combat aircraft. Lockheed's task, under a two-year management contract, has been to restructure the company, develop a business plan and boost productivity. If HAI can make an operating profit over the next year, the Greek government plans to offer up to 49 per cent of the company for sale under its privatisation programme.</p>

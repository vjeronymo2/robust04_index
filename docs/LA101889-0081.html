			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ILLINOIS;  </P> <P> JUDGE HALTS TESTING ON JET-CRASH ENGINE  </P> <P> A judge barred the National Transportation Safety Board from further testing of  an engine on the United Airlines DC-10 that crashed July 19 in Sioux City,  Iowa. Associate Cook County Circuit Judge Joseph Casciato in Chicago said an  independent tester should be used to check the engine. Attorney William J.  Harte asked that the NTSB testing be stopped because General Electric, which  made the engine and is one of three defendants in three class-action lawsuits  stemming from the fatal crash, was involved in the testing. The NTSB vowed to  appeal.  </P></p>

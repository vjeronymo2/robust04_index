			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  have continued aerial espionage on the northern half of Korea in  April by bringing Pacific-based RC-135 strategic reconnaissance  planes, E-3 early warning planes and P-3 anti-submarine planes,  according to military sources.    On April 29 and 28, an overseas-based E-3 early warning  plane  made aerial espionage on the strategic in-depth areas of the  northern half of Korea in the skies above Yangpyong, Umsong and  Tanyang, South Korea.    On April 27 and 22, an Okinawa-based RC-135 strategic  reconnaissance plane flew to South Korea and carried out  photographing and electronic espionage on the whole area of the  northern half of Korea in the sky above the Military Demarcation  Line.    On April 29, a U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance  plane based in South Korea committed an aerial espionage on the  strategic depth and inland areas of the northern half of Korea  in the skies above Tokjok Islet, Yangpyong and Yangyang, South  Korea.    On April 22 and 21, over 30 spy planes including RV-1s,  RC-12s and RF-4Cs staged round the clock aerial espionage.    Aerial espionage of the U.S. imperialists have become more  frequent with the start of the hwarang war game of the South  Korean puppets.    The espionage committed by the U.S. imperialists in April  against the northern half of Korea numbered more than 250.    Facts fully prove how desperately the U.S. imperialists are  running about in their preparations for a war of aggression to  stifle the DPRK with arms.</p>

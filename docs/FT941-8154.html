			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Bond markets rattled by US and Germany Europe's bond markets took another tumble yesterday, rattled by strike threats from Germany's largest trade union and by the possibility of further US monetary tightening. Dealers said most of the selling came from professional traders in the futures markets, while investors were reported to have remained on the sidelines. Although US markets were closed for a national holiday, traders reported continued selling by US hedge funds, albeit at a less frantic pace than late last week. Hedge funds - private pools of highly leveraged funds - were big buyers of European bonds last year and have recently been reported to be liquidating their holdings. German government bonds dropped by almost a point after the country's powerful engineering union, IG Metall, said it had called a strike vote in Lower Saxony. Fears that a strike would be approved and spread to other parts of northern Germany were used as an excuse for further selling amid bearish sentiment. The sell-off of European bonds began earlier this month when the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates. Despite last week's round of European interest rate cuts, bond markets remain dogged by fears that the end of the global rally has come. 'It's a case of the end-of-cycle blues,' said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at market analysis firm IDEA. UK gilts fell by more than a point, dragged down by their European counterparts. The long gilt futures contract on Liffe dropped by 1 3/32 points to close at 114 1/2 , having recovered from an earlier low of 114. In the UK equity market, the FT-SE 100 index fell 32.3 to 3,350.3, with losses intensified in late trading after reports of the German strike talks. Although trading was subdued by the holiday closure in New York, the London market found difficulty in holding on to the important 3,350 benchmark, which was briefly lost just before the close of business. Hopes that domestic interest rates can still be cut remained solid at first but were bruised later when bond prices weakened afresh. Other European equity markets eased under the pressure of falling bond markets and fears of a further decline in Wall Street later today. In Germany, the Dax index of the 30 most widely traded stocks fell 1.5 per cent, while in France the CAC-40 index slipped 1.6 per cent. Today the markets will be listening out for the comments made by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, to Congress. Lex, Page 22 London SE, Page 42 World stock markets, Page 39</p>

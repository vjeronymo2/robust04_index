			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Cong Gong: "Draft Aims at Better Birth </F> and Health Care"]    [Text] The draft Law of Better Birth and Health Care for  Mother and Child is awaiting approval by the Standing Committee  of the National People's Congress, China's highest law-making  body, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health.    The law is aimed at reducing the number of seriously sick  and  disabled babies, safeguarding the health of mothers and children  and, finally fostering healthier generations in the future.    The draft law requires doctors to advise a couple to  terminate a pregnancy if a hereditary disease is liable to  result in the birth of seriously sick or disabled babies, or if  continuing the pregnancy would put the women's life at risk or  seriously jeopardize her health or that of the fetus.    The spokesman explained that abortions could ultimately be  carried out only with the agreement of the pregnant woman or her  guardian.    This provision indicates that the law respects the right of  individuals to make their own judgments, and reflects the  principle of combining government guidance with individual  choice, he said.    China is the most populous country on the globe, with  one-fourth of the world's people. Its birth policy focuses not  only on controlling the size of the population but also on  improving its quality.    The previous four decades have seen remarkable improvement  in  the health of Chinese people, with the maternal mortality rate  dropping from 1,500 per 100,000 before 1949 to 94.7 per 100,000  now.    Marriages between close relatives, endemic diseases and  congenital hereditary ailments, however, make it difficult to  control the births of seriously sick and retarded children in  some areas, especially remote and impoverished rural regions.    The situation therefore calls for a Law of Better Birth and  Health Care for Mother and Child to be enacted as soon as  possible, he said.    "Better birth" in this law is completely different from the  racist "eugenics" pursued by Adolf Hitler under the guise of  better birth.    The law entitles Chinese citizens to premarital health  check-ups; health care before, during and after delivery;  antenatal diagnosis; health care for the newborn; screening for  neonatal diseases; and better counselling for parents.    According to the draft law, certain couples will be required  to postpone marriage or take long-term contraceptive measures  after marriage.    This would apply to people diagnosed as having reproductive  diseases, hereditary diseases that lead to seriously sick or  disabled children, schizophrenia, manic-depressive psychoses and  other severe psychoses, or acute infectious diseases, including  venereal diseases.    Such a mandate is compatible with some provisions in the  nation's Marriage Laws. According to the spokesman, in drafting  the law of better birth and child care the Ministry of Public  Health conducted feasibility and necessity studies on a national  scale.    In the past 40 years, a relatively complete network of  medical care has been established throughout the country. Six  medical universities in Beijing and Shanghai offer courses on  maternity and child care.    Moreover, China has six national institutions on better  birth  and child care, and 346 maternity and child care hospitals.    There are 149,105 maternity and child care technicians in  the  nation, and 533 clinics have been set up for antenatal  diagnosis. In 1992, the premarital check-up rate reached 99  percent in Shanghai and 72 per cent in Liaoning Province.    According to the spokesman, there is still a long way to go  in improving the quality of the nation's population to the point  where the belief that a large family means good fortune can be  overcome.</p>

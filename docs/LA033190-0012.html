			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFORM THAT PARTLY BACKFIRED;  </P> <P> THE IMMIGRATION LAW NEEDS FIXING -- BUT NOT REPEALING  </P> <P> It's now clear that the immigration reform law Congress passed in 1986 is  causing discrimination against U.S. citizens who look or sound "foreign."  That's not reason enough to repeal it, but it's certainly cause for Congress to  head back to the drawing board on immigration.  </P> <P> Congress' General Accounting Office has issued a much-anticipated report on how  the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act is working, and concluded that the  new law is achieving its main purpose by discouraging business from hiring  illegal immigrants. But government investigators also found "widespread  discrimination" resulting from the law. The GAO report underscored the  conclusion of other agencies that many employers are not hiring anyone they  suspect of being foreign-born.  </P> <P> GAO did not try to determine why this pattern of discrimination exists --  whether because employers want to avoid hassle or because some employers  deliberately exclude foreign-born workers. But any discrimination is  unacceptable, especially if it's being encouraged by an official act of  Congress. That's why several members of Congress who voted for the 1986 law now  say they want to reconsider it.  </P> <P> Reconsidering the IRCA won't be easy. But there are enough knowledgeable people  in Congress and among the various interest groups involved in the immigration  issue to hammer out some revisions of the 1986 law without Capitol Hill  grinding to a halt.  </P> <P> For a start, how about spending more to better educate employers about the new  law? Some discrimination may result from simple ignorance. And Congress should  simply order the Justice Department to crack down on any deliberate  discrimination.  </P> <P> One thing Congress must not do is buy the idea promoted by some immigration  restrictionists: that all legal U.S. workers should be issued work permits. In  a time when the right to privacy is already invaded in so many subtle ways,  most Americans simply won't standfor a national identity card -- and shouldn't  have to.  </P> <P> Some groups that never wanted the 1986 law enacted in the first place will now  demand that it be repealed, but that's overreacting, too. IRCA was not all bad.  It allowed millions of illegal immigrants to begin legalizing their status and  kept some would-be illegals from being exploited. Illegal immigration is such a  complex historic phenomenon that no one law can control it, only regulate it  slightly. That's why IRCA shouldn't be tossed out, just fine-tuned.  </P></p>

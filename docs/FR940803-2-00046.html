This document supersedes the APLS Procedural Guide that was announced in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  of August 9, 1993 (58 FR 42340). FDA revised the guide to address received comments and also to address requirements for the submission of promotional materials for products reviewed under the regulations for accelerated approval (21 CFR part 601 subpart E).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The APLS Procedural Guidance document details the approach that manufacturers and distributors should follow in submitting advertising and promotional material for review by CBER, and APLS' approach in the review and evaluation of this material. The APLS Procedural Guidance document also provides guidance on CBER's current interpretation of the regulation requiring the reporting of important proposed changes in the labeling, specifically promotional labeling, of biological products for which a license is in effect or for which an application for license is pending (21 CFR 601.12).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In general, the changes to the original procedural guide respond to requests for additional clarification and guidance in several areas involving biologic advertising and promotion. The term ``significant amendment'' has been changed throughout the document to ``any supplement requiring a labeling change.'' A brief description of the types of supplements that would require a labeling change has also been added. The guide also contains information on advertising and promotional materials for products reviewed under the accelerated approval regulations (21 CFR part 601, subpart E). The revised procedural guide also addresses the submission for pre-review of ``Coming Soon'' advertising as part of the introductory campaign. FDA also clarifies when Part I versus Part II of the FDA form 2567 is used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  As with other procedural guidance documents, FDA does not intend this revised document to be all-inclusive. Alternative approaches may be warranted in specific situations, and certain aspects may not be applicable to all situations. If a manufacturer believes that a procedure described in this guidance document is inapplicable to a particular product and other procedures are appropriate for CBER's consideration, the manufacturer may wish to discuss the matter further with the agency to prevent expenditure of money and effort on activities that later may be determined to be unacceptable by FDA. CBER will continue to review advertising and promotional materials on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This document does not bind FDA and does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits on or for any person, but is intended merely for guidance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Interested persons may submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments on this guide. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments and information should be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The APLS Procedural Guidance and received comments are available for public examination in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA will consider any comments received in determining whether additional revisions to the guide are warranted.

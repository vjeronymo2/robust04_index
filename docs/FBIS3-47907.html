			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jan 20 (ANTARA) -- State-owned oil company  Pertamina is offering twelve new oil fields to domestic and  foreign investors wishing to invest in this upstream industry in  1994 on a production-sharing [contract] (PSC) basis, the  company's president director, Faisal Abda'u, said.    Accompanied by some members of the company's board of  directors, Abda'u told the press here Wednesday that aside from  the twelve new oil fields, eighteen other oil fields were still  open to exploration.    Two of the new oil fields, Abda'u said, were on-shore fields  in Bengara and Kisaran, East Kalimantan.    Two others, he went on, were off-shore/on-shore fields,  namely one in Muna, South-East Sulawesi and the other in  Pagatan, South Kalimantan.    The remaining eight oil fields, he added, were off-shore  fields, namely Java Sea I, off-shore Lampung and Pangkah in the  Java Sea, Asahan in North Sumatera, Sebawang in East Kalimantan,  Wowoni in South-East Sulawesi and Tamuloi as well as Sebakor,  both in Irian Jaya.    In the meantime, G.A.S. Nayoan, Pertamina's director of  exploration and production, said that as the new PSC exploration  fields were outside the areas included in 1993 oil/gas incentive  package scheme Pertamina had recently introduced, the split  effected would not change.    In addition, he said, Pertamina was also offering to  investors 28 old oil wells under the technical assistance  contract (TAC) scheme, whereby old oil wells already given up by  old contractors would be reactivated through a process known as  enhanced oil recovery (EOR) so that the remaining oil deposits  could be tapped.    He also disclosed that 1:9 oil companies, 50 of them  national  private companies, had been put on Pertamina's mailing list for  1994 oil exploration activities, under either a PSC or EOR basis.    On the occasion, Nayoan also said that the policy of opening  up new oil fields was, in fact, related to efforts to intensify  exploration and drilling activities because in 1993 only 111 out  of the targeted 207 oil wells had been drilled.    He said that the failure in reaching the drilling target was  attributable to stiffer competition to attract oil investors,  declining profits owing to a drop in the oil price and  preference on the part of oil/gas industry to invest in the  downstream industry rather than in the upstream industry because  of much-discussed environmental matters.    "As we are greatly concerned about this fact, our policy in  exploration and production in 1994 is focused on intensifying  drilling activities," He explained, adding that in this context  the government's recent incentive package to be applied to  Indonesia's eastern regions and other frontier areas in the  country's western regions was expected to spur exploration and  drilling activities.</p>

As an exception, the Commander U.S. Army Claims Service, Europe (USACSEUR), can take final action on any reconsideration request forwarded there by a subordinate office so long as it does not involve approving a waiver of a maximum allowance. The Commander, USACSEUR, will include a complete copy of the final action and will forward the file to the Commander, USARCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The approval or settlement authority should consider 60 days from the settlement date a reasonable time to either submit a written request for reconsideration or provide an intent to file a reconsideration request. The claimant will receive written notification of this time limit. Any reconsideration where denial is recommended because it was not timely filed will be forwarded according to paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division may grant relief on untimely requests for reconsideration on the basis of substantial new evidence, fraud, mistake of law, or mathematical miscalculation. In appropriate situations, he may deny relief if the filing delay precluded acquiring additional facts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.181  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Judge advocate procedures responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reductions for inaction.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The JA will ensure that, when a demand on a carrier or other third party (other than a private insurer (see paragraph (a)(2) of this section) is required (see recovery from third party) and the claimant's failure, absent good cause, to provide notice or perform other required actions materially prejudices effective recovery action with respect to all or part of the loss, the amount otherwise allowable under this chapter will be reduced by the amount of the anticipated recovery so affected on an item-by-item basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When a claimant fails to provide timely notice to perfect a claim against his or her private insurer, the amount allowed, absent good cause. the claim will be denied. In determining whether a claimant has good cause for failing to provide timely notice to a private insurer, the JA will, in addition to the considerations in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, determine whether the claimant (or agent) had knowledge of the requirement and willfully neglected to provide notice. See &sect;536.170(f) for cases where a claimant refuses to provide information concerning private insurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Good cause is determined as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) When a claimant fails to provide timely notice to a carrier, warehouse firm, or private insurer, settlement and approval authorities may waive reduction action for good cause only when one of the following circumstances directly contributed to the claimant's failure to give timely notice:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Officially recognized absence (for example TDY and off post training exercises) resulting in claimant's absence from official duty station for a significant portion of the notice period;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Hospitalization of claimant for a significant portion of the notice period; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Substantiated misinformation concerning notice requirements given to the claimant by government personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Requests for good cause waivers under circumstances other than those in paragraph (a) of this section may be granted only by the Commander, USARCS, or designee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Prior to taking reduction action, the JA will ensure the claimant is provided an opportunity to explain the circumstances of his or her failure to take appropriate action, and that the claim file is documented to show the claimant was afforded this opportunity and the result provided. The chronology sheet in the file will contain an explanation of the JA's decision regarding reduction or the lack thereof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Information and assistance to claimants <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Ford chief concerned at economic uncertainty THE US economy remains 'one of the most daunting concerns' for Ford, according to Mr Harold Poling, chairman of the US carmaker, writes our New York staff. Mr Poling told the annual meeting in Dearborn, Michigan, yesterday that although the economy had improved, the improvement had been slower and more modest than in previous recoveries. 'Consistent with that, we're forecasting industry sales in the US of about 13.7m units for 1993, up from 13.1m in 1992, or less than 5 per cent,' he said. The pace of the US recovery was being held back by uncertainty over likely tax increases and President Bill Clinton's healthcare reform package. Until that uncertainty was removed, consumer confidence would not be great enough to cause a strong increase in sales, Mr Poling said. 'We're grappling with difficult economies in the rest of the world as well  -particularly Europe  - along with intense competition and excess capacity, all of which make achieving satisfactory results a much more formidable task,' he said. Last month Ford reported first-quarter earnings more than doubled at Dollars 572m, reflecting improved results from its North American vehicle operations and a strong performance by its financial services business. These results, Mr Poling said, were reason for optimism.</p>

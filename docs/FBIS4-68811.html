			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Privalov and Andrey Chernakov: "Why </F> Yuriy Mikhaylovich Quarreled With Anatoliy Borisovich: Luzhkov  Against Chubays"]    [Text] Mayor of Moscow Yuriy Luzhkov's decree was  made public last week. In it, the head of the city laconically  announces the suspension of real estate privatization in Moscow  until the president issues a decree establishing special rules  for such privatization for the capital city--and until the  Moscow privatization program is approved. That the mayor  exceeded his authority, which is obvious from this action, is no  sensation. Neither is the intensification of the confrontation  between the mayor and the GKI [State Committee for the  Administration of State Property] surprising--this should have  been expected ever since the approval of a new state program of  privatization undermined the mayor's positions in this struggle  so greatly that he had no choice but to respond with a  counterstrike. The mayor's escapade, however, brings back into  focus the question: What is the whole brouhaha actually about?  For the sake of what does Yuriy Mikhaylovich so stubbornly  berate Mr. Chubays and try so hard to root out his influence on  capital city affairs? To solve this puzzle, KOMMERSANT experts  attempted to analyze one of the Moscow Government's latest steps  in the area of privatization. This step was marked by a special  statement issued by the mayoralty's press center at the end of  February.    Through the mouthpiece of its press center, the mayoralty  stated that the GKI "continues to dispose of real estate on the  territory of Moscow" without the consent of the city  administration. As an example of the glaring arbitrariness of  Chubays' agency, the statement cited the incident with the  EKSIKOM joint-stock company and facilities transferred to it for  the "laughable amount" of 56 million rubles [R]. On 23 February  MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA and VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA each published an  angry item on the basis of this statement, joined the next day  by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS needed an  extra day in order to work out an original way of presenting the  material: "There is only one reason why Aleksandr Alyoshin  (deputy prefect of Moscow's Eastern District--KOMMERSANT) was  killed--a GKI order signed by Chubays' deputy V. Sychkin. The  substance of the order: to form on the basis of the former state  association KHOZUS of the Russian Federation [RF] Ministry of  Industry AO [joint-stock company] EKSIKOM. Yes, this is exactly  what the item said. Had it been 1937, Valentin Sychkin would  have had it after such an accusation. (Although, on the other  hand, had it been England, the other side would have had it....)    KOMMERSANT experts felt that it was their duty to have a  closer look at such a wily joint-stock company, especially  considering that the incident in question is not over yet: Just  a few days ago the RF Supreme Arbitration Court considered the  appeals of the GKI and AO EKSIKOM regarding its previous ruling  and did not find any grounds to overturn it. This is what we  have found out.  <H5>  How the Owners Multiplied </H5>   The EKSIKOM AO was set up in December 1992 on the basis of  the KHOZUS state association of the RF Ministry of Industry,  which in turn was the legal successor of the economic  administration (KHOZU) of the RF Minoboronprom [Ministry of  Defense Industry]. The founder was the RF GKI. Charter capital:  R56.4 million. The AO's charter mission--to operate residential  and nonresidential facilities of Russia's former defense  agencies, as well as commercial activities, and construction.  The facilities coming under EKSIKOM's supervision were mainly  residential buildings built in the 1950's-1970's in the area  around Sokolnicheskaya and Samotechnaya Squares, Malaya Bronnaya  and 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Streets, and other prestigious places  in the capital--a total of 16 buildings. In order to ensure  loss-free maintenance and operation of this housing, the GKI  included in the EKSIKOM AO's charter capital so-called "built-in  and adjacent space" in these buildings (six or seven facilities  housing stores, cafes, and a fashion house), which is reflected  in the society's charter documents.    As Rafael Sukhorukov, EKSIKOM AO first deputy general  director, told a KOMMERSANT correspondent, at the stage of  developing the privatization plan everything had been  coordinated with the Moscow authorities--in particular, the  Moscow City Council commissions on privatization and the  consumer market and the Moscow Property Fund. A second option of  preferences was selected, which gave the labor collective  (plumbing services, maintenance personnel, guards, and  groundskeepers) 51 percent of the stock, and in November 1993  the EKSIKOM AO received certificate No. 304, signed by V.  Bushev, head of the Moscow Property Fund, giving it the  ownership of 51 percent of the charter capital--the  total charter capital, which means, including the  now-disputed facilities.    It appears that at the time Moscow authorities did not see  anything wrong in the EKSIKOM AO's charter document. Neither did  they see anything later, in January, when the Moscow Property  Fund held a voucher auction and sold 10 percent more of EKSIKOM  AO stock. Everything seemed to be going well; there were plans  to sell at voucher auctions the remaining 39 percent of the  stock--and then it suddenly turned out that the buildings and  facilities in question had too many owners...    It suddenly turned out that at that very time when  the EKSIKOM AO was being set up, and the GKI included in its  charter capital the built-in and adjacent space on  Sokolnicheskaya Square (which housed the Zenit store, the  Stromynka cafe and the Lena Makashova Fashion House), the city  of Moscow's privatization commission was disposing of these  facilities differently. It approved privatization plans which  envisaged the lessees' rights to buy out the facilities a year  after the lease agreements--signed in the past with the USSR  Minoboronprom's KHOZU--expired. And in the summer of last year  the Eastern Territorial Agency of the Moscow Property Committee  [MPC] approved renegotiation of the lease contracts for this  space and the property therein, declaring itself the lessor of  the federal property.    On top of that, so as not to make things easy at all, a  contract between Minoboronprom's store Zenit and also  Minoboronprom's advertising-commercial company Rassvet--of the  existence of which neither the EKSIKOM AO nor the GKI had been  aware--was produced, according to which the former leased from  the latter fixed assets for a period of five years. The  contract, along with carts and other equipment, also covers ("at  the store director's request," it was ingeniously explained to a  KOMMERSANT correspondent) the built-in and adjacent space  itself, which therefore now had three owners... (Fortunately,  Rassvet later had second thoughts and filed a claim with the  Moscow Arbitration Court to invalidate this point.)    The funniest part of the situation is that the store, the  cafe, and the fashion salon to this day dutifully pay rent to  EKSIKOM: According to Mr. Sukhorukov, last week they deposited  the current payment into the account of the not-quite-born AO.  Even a child knows that whoever the lessees pay is indeed the  lessor. For some reason, however, the Moscow authorities do not  wish to understand this--first they provoked the collectives of  the aforementioned enterprises into a conflict with EKSIKOM, and  then, upon insistent "recommendations," literally dragged the  latter to the arbitration court with the aim of having the court  hand them the federal property once and for all.  <H5>  `How Should I Judge You--By Law or By Conscience, as the </H5> Lord Will Tell Me?' (A.N. Ostrovskiy)    So, the Stromynka cafe, the Zenit store, and the Lena  Makashova Fashion House filed claims with the Moscow Arbitration  Court asking that GKI Order No. 893-r dated 25 November 1992 be  invalidated in the part regarding the inclusion in EKSIKOM's  charter capital of the corresponding built-in and adjacent  facilities. The Moscow Arbitration Court threw out the claim "on  grounds of lack of subject of the action"--it reasoned that  there is nothing to arbitrate, since the documents clearly  stated: federal property.    The Supreme Arbitration Court, however, did admit the  claims.  Moreover, it ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. The appeal filed  by EKSIKOM was overruled a few days ago. The arbitration court  was not impressed with the full set of documents proving both  the authority of the creation of EKSIKOM and the legality of  including former federal property in its charter capital.    "We no longer know what to think," Nikolay Shmelev,  EKSIKOM's  chairman of the board and general director, told a KOMMERSANT  correspondent. "One thing is probably clear: Too many interests  are intertwined in this matter. There is no other explanation  for what happened in the arbitration court a few days ago when  our appeal was heard on the subject of the Stromynka cafe and  the Lena Makashova Fashion House. It would seem that we  presented all the arguments that prove us to be within our  rights and that the GKI orders were justified. Frankly, we left  the courtroom fully confident that now that we had brought and  presented absolutely all the necessary papers, the old ruling  would be overturned and the Supreme Arbitration Court would find  the GKI orders to include into the charter capital of the state  association KHOZUS (EKSIKOM's predecessor) the objects of  federal property to be absolutely legitimate. But no! Again, the  ruling was not in our favor. Did we not bring enough papers? We  even brought a document in which the GKI (with Chubays'  signature) instructs the ministries of the former  ninth [directorate] to set up services such as ours  to operate buildings and structures that had been on the books  of these ministries. There is also a contract between the GKI  and KHOZUS, which says clearly that these entities are  transferred to our complete economic management for five years.  But the court simply ignored all this and made a ruling which  boils down to a contention that neither the GKI nor we ourselves  were able to prove that these built-in and adjacent facilities  are federal property. So I ask--what do they mean by "not able"  when we brought all the documents, from a presidential decree to  orders issued by Chubays and his deputies? What other documents  could be needed? On top of that we brought the most recent GKI  interpretation, written specifically for such disputes, dated 29  March and signed by First Deputy Chairman A. Ivanenko, which  clearly interprets the application of point 11 of Edict No.  1230, which stipulates that leased enterprises have a  first-option right to buy out space. The explanation says  clearly that this right "does not extend to enterprises to which  buildings, structures, and nonresidential space were given with  right of full economic management, since right of full economic  management is governed by property right rules." This is  precisely about us! We brought this document to the arbitration  court as well. Again, no reaction! It is literally a jinx--find  something, we cannot tell you what it is, and bring it as proof  of the legitimacy of your actions!.."    The EKSIKOM people intend to fight to the last. They have  two  more options open to them: sending an oversight complaint to the  first deputy chairman of the Supreme Arbitration Court, or  filing a complaint with Russia's Office of the General  Procurator. They decided to pursue the former option. (There is  no set time frame for consideration of appeals by the court's  first deputy chairman, however, and "while the court is  deliberating," GKI opponents can achieve a great deal.) After  that, the very last resort: an arbitration court plenum. In  short, there will be no time to work--they will be too busy  litigating.    Do you remember the pilot Sevryugov from Voronya Slobodka?  What saved him was worldwide publicity; otherwise he "would have  been sucked into the centrifugal force of litigation and for the  rest of his life would have called himself 'an injured party'  instead of 'the pilot Sevryugov' and derived particular pleasure  from uttering the words 'slap with a lawsuit.'" Unfortunately,  EKSIKOM has not gained worldwide publicity, and therefore is in  quite serious danger of this sad fate befalling it.    KOMMERSANT experts do not intend to get bogged down in legal  controversies and try to forecast the outcome of this  arbitration epic (although the arguments of GKI and EKSIKOM  appear much more substantiated to us than the reasoning of their  opponents). In our opinion, it is important to understand why  this epic began in the first place--and what precedent it is  intended to set, in the Moscow authorities' design, in the event  it succeeds.  <H5>  A Trend, However... </H5>   That the mayoralty hates giving up "built-in and adjacent"  areas in prestigious high-traffic places is quite  understandable. They are very attractive, after all. It is quite  possible, for instance, that precisely this space had been  promised to someone. And then they remembered that they do not  own it anymore and attempted to get it back. I. Kuraksina,  director of the MPC's Eastern Territorial Agency, sent a  claim to the EKSIKOM AO at the beginning of this year  in which she simply demanded "transfer of said object  voluntarily (!) to the MPC within a month." Quite logically, she  was advised to take up this issue with the GKI. When it became  clear that the impudence had not succeeded, a full-scale siege  began. The city talked the lessees into filing a court suit  (although they did not want to quarrel with the AO, which  charges them surprisingly reasonable rent)--and the campaign was  launched.    KOMMERSANT experts are inclined to associate this massive  attack on the part of the mayoralty on the property, which it  was fully aware did not belong to it (that is, property that  belonged to 700 Muscovites--EKSIKOM stockholders--not the  mayoralty, and not even "the city of Moscow"), with two recent  events that put in great doubt the Moscow Government's chances  to keep--if not for good then at least for a long time--all  Moscow real estate under its complete control.    The first such event is of course the presidential edict  approving a new state privatization program. It expands somewhat  the regions' privatization rights, but also establishes quite  unequivocally the primacy of the federal program over regional  ones. The state program per se would not have scared the Moscow  authorities too much--after all, they have successfully ignored  the previous one in many respects, so the new one would not have  particularly harmed them. But then the second event came about.  We mean GKI Decree No. 353-r dated 15 February 1994 on  privatization of nonresidential space.    When we published this decree (see KOMMERSANT No. 10), we  pointed out that this document makes it possible to privatize in  a matter of a few days at reasonable prices leased buildings,  structures, and land lots, and generally speaking a lessee  cannot be refused the right to privatize. Thus, a principal  opportunity emerged to pull a great deal of this nonresidential  space out of bureaucrats' grip and thereby make it an object of  buying and selling, a foundation on which to develop a truly  functional real estate market. It is this document--of a most  direct action--that could quite easily put an end to the Moscow  mayoralty's omnipotence.    Sensing the threat, the Moscow authorities decided to  immediately produce a counteroffensive, and an exemplary--and  therefore precedent-setting--one at that: prove that the capital  city nonresidential stock is theirs to such an extent  that they can not only refuse to give it up, but can actually  take it back after whatever Chubays-authorized privatization.    The incident we have described is indeed exemplary of  sorts--at least in highlighting the reasons why the mayoralty is  waging such an irreconcilable war on the GKI.    The mayoralty accuses privatization a la Chubays of  unfailingly leading to a change in enterprises' specialization  to something that does not meet Muscovites' needs. We cannot go  into a theoretical discussion on this subject here, but we  believe it would be proper to emphasize that neither the Zenit  store nor the Stromynka cafe nor the Lena Makashova Fashion  House have in mind any future other than remaining a store, a  cafe, and a fashion house.    The mayoralty accuses privatization a la Chubays of handing  out state property at bargain-basement prices, thus  shortchanging the city treasury. If you recall, the GKI was  faulted for a "laughable appraisal" of EKSIKOM's property. It is  true that the appraisal is not all that high. But, as Mr.  Sukhorukov told our KOMMERSANT correspondent, the MPC intends to  transfer the disputed facilities--albeit into different  hands--at exactly the same price.    Which means that the entire incident described above--as  well  as the mayoralty's entire war on the GKI--is needed for one  single purpose: to show this Chubays who is the master of the  house. Who can suspend any attempt to transfer  anything whatsoever in Moscow into private hands (truly  transfer, not like in the draft of the Moscow privatization  program, that is, without buildings and land--see KOMMERSANT  Nos. 6 and 10).    The Moscow Government's Bonapartism is getting stronger by  the day. Let us recall the recent "mayor's pro mille": The  mayoralty decided to deduct for the city budget 0.1 percent of  the value of every foreign currency operation conducted on the  capital city territory--and will be taking this money despite  the illegality of such deductions (see KOMMERSANT Nos. 5 and 7).  Now the mayoralty does not want to let go of nonresidential  space--so it announces the suspension of real estate  privatization. It is frightening even to think what else may be  suspended or introduced tomorrow--"until a decree is issued  setting special rules for the capital city."    In light of such events one can only sincerely wonder how so  much attention can be devoted for many days to some "version" of  a state coup. For goodness sake, what coups? And most  importantly, who needs them? Who would want to  overthrow the state system under which anyone can  become a local Bonaparte, that is, to put it plainly, tell the  federal authorities where they can stick it and carry out their  laws and edicts only to the extent it suits?    Going back to the ill-fated EKSIKOM, let us emphasize that  it  is willing to cooperate on a mutually profitable basis with all  interested parties. Mr. Sukhorukov told a KOMMERSANT  correspondent that the AO would gladly agree to create in  Sokolniki a holding company that would include EKSIKOM (with its  legitimately obtained space), its current lessee enterprises  (with their equipment, know-how, and trade ties), and the  Eastern District prefecture (with the set of rights associated  with the use of infrastructure needed to resolve social and  cultural household issues). And everyone would be happy. By the  way, according to Mr. Sukhorukov, the late Aleksandr Alyoshin  already was leaning toward such a solution: He wanted to create  something like a business center on the basis of these  facilities...</p>

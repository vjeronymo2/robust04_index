			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / University to offer course in corruption: A new study in perversity, Argentina-style CORRUPTION is part of doing business in Argentina, a fact now recognised by the University of Buenos Aires, which will include a new course on 'perverse systems' in its MBA syllabus. The course - the first of its kind in Argentina - is to begin next week. It will focus on the causes and nature of corruption, and discuss ways to combat it. Prof Jorge Etkin, who will lead the course, says it will be based on case studies of 100 episodes of corruption. Lecturers will include businessmen, judges and government officials, including the mayor of Buenos Aires. His predecessor was charged last week with fraudulent administration. Opinion polls report corruption as a main concern of Argentines, a large majority of whom see the government of President Carlos Menem as corrupt. Mr Menem's free market policies have reduced corruption, through substantial deregulation packages and privatisations, but businessmen still complain that politicians and bureaucrats exploit every opportunity to demand bribes. The administration has been rocked by 19 big corruption scandals since it took office in July 1989, and 20 senior aides and ministers have been sacked on suspicion of corruption. For all that, no investigation has ended in a trial. Mr Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former federal prosecutor, says Argentine laws make convictions in corruption cases impossible. Prof Etkin, author of a book on corruption, says: 'When the justice system does not work independently or efficiently, there is always a greater predisposition to corruption in democracies. Weak justice systems lead to impunity.' Yet he stresses that one can do business in Argentina without becoming involved in corruption. He says, 'business is not just about profit, but (ensuring) the survival of a company - this depends directly on a company obeying the law.'</p>

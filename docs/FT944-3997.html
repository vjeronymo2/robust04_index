			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Margin warning on mortgages The margin for lenders in the mortgage market is likely to halve from about 2 per cent to 1 per cent in the next five years, partly because of the entry of aggressive competitors, according to brokers Merrill Lynch. It says that the arrival of Direct Line, the telephone-based insurance company, in selling mortgages to its customers is intensifying competition. Its standard mortgage rate of 7.4 per cent is already undercutting that of Royal Bank of Scotland, its parent, when the cost loading is higher than it would be in a mature mortgage business. Mr Ian McEwen, banking analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that current mortgage margins were unusually high. It was this factor, rather than the particular efficiency achieved by organisations, which made the greater contribution to the current cost/income ratios of building societies, which are generally lower than those of banks, he said. The research says UK mortgage margins are high in terms of international comparisons, and elsewhere in Europe margins are about 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent. This should be profitable enough for the bigger mortgage lenders in the UK. While the trend will be towards narrower margins, lenders are likely to be able to take advantage of movements in interest rates. These often give them an opportunity to widen margins on the savings side even if not in lending. The research says the attraction of smaller societies - those below the five or six biggest - as merger partners or targets for takeover is often exaggerated and their longer-term viability is in doubt. House prices in southern England will rise by 55 per cent to 60 per cent in the next five years, well above the 30 per cent increases in the north and the 50 per cent average for the UK as a whole, according to stockbrokers UBS.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- China has launched a  drive to root out the spreading phenomenon of paid news coverage  among the press community.    The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the  Communist Party of China (CPC) issued a circular recently urging  unremitting efforts by party organizations to educate  journalists on press ethics.    The circular says that the recent case of illegal nationwide  fund raising by the Beijing Great Wall Machinery and Electronics  Industry Corporation, fanned by false reports by some bribed  journalists, revealed the extent of the problem.    Some correspondents had seriously disrupted the economic  order and harmed the interests of the state and people by faking  news stories in favor of the sponsoring parties, according to  the circular.    The circular calls for strengthening the "development of  ethics of the press community".    Over the past decade, more Chinese journalists have from  time  to time wandered astray from their professional ethics to write  advertising in the guise of news after receiving various  benefits.    A standard package of benefits in covering promotional  events  include a "small gift", a "red paper bag" with cash and a  banquet after the press conference.    The practice reached its climax in 1992. A few reporters  could not be attracted to a press conference if they were unable  to receive similar benefits. Some crew members from television  stations went even further.    It is in such situations that some reporters have succumbed  to corrupt practices.    But the circular gives credit to the overall quality of the  press circle, saying that journalists have made outstanding  contributions to the country's reforms and opening up.    The unhealthy tendency was halted after the Propaganda  Department released a circular last year, banning all "paid news  coverage" and "sales of book numbers", codes that represent  official permission to publish, according to the latest circular.    The circular says it is imperative to use the "Great Wall"  case to educate reporters and editors nationwide.    It also demands that party committees in various localities  conduct an inspection into how the circular's guidelines against  paid journalism are being implemented.    Press units should formulate rules and regulations to  prevent  future occurrences of this practice and should be subject to the  supervision of the public, says the circular.</p>

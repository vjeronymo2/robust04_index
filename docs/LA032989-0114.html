			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> BAIL SET FOR 2ND SUSPECT IN WAYNE-LUBY ASSAULT  </P> <P> A judge set bail at $1 million Tuesday for Jeffrey Kendall Bouey, the second  suspect arrested and charged with attacking the late John Wayne's daughter,  Aissa Wayne, and her companion, Roger W. Luby, last October.  </P> <P> Harbor Municipal Court Judge Russell A. Bostrom denied a request by Bouey's  attorney for a lower bail amount, pending a joint arraignment hearing set for  April 7 with a second suspect, Jerrel L. Hintergardt, who is also being held  with bond set at $1 million.  </P> <P> Hintergardt, 37, of Burbank, was arrested by Newport Beach police March 17.  Bouey, 35, of Simi Valley, was arrested Friday evening outside his home. Both  are being held in the Orange County Jail on charges of conspiracy and assault  with a deadly weapon in the Oct. 3 attack on Wayne and Luby at Luby's gated  estate in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Police say that Bouey is a friend of Hintergardt, who is a former employee of  private investigator O. Daniel Gal of Los Angeles, for whom an arrest warrant  was issued 2 weeks ago in connection with the attack. Gal had been questioned  about the attack and is reported to be in Europe.  </P> <P> Gal's agency had been hired by Aissa Wayne's former husband, Thomas A. Gionis,  an orthopedic surgeon from Pomona, as part of a bitter custody fight over the  couple's 2-year-old daughter, Anastasia. Gionis won custody in January.  </P></p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (12): Living with the fees squeeze - The lawyers, 'no hay, no pay' Management buy-out lawyers have had a tough time recently. The recession has changed the market-place. Clients now exert greater influence on the legal services they purchase and on what those services cost. Lawyers are unhappy. Stiff competition among law firms for the MBO work that was around in the recession gave both management teams and financial institutions the whip hand in negotiating fee levels. Many deals are now done on a contingent basis. If the deal aborts, the lawyers don't get paid - or, as John Kitching, of Lovell White Durrant, puts it: 'No hay, no pay.' 'It's very difficult', says Tony Keal, of Allen &amp; Overy. 'If a deal collapses, no one wants to bear the cost, because no one is making a return. The management team can't bear the costs, venture capitalists don't want to, and the banks don't see why they should. The result is the lawyers end up carrying the cost.' Perhaps this is a reaction to perceived overcharging in the past, he says. But he warns that there is a danger of it going too far. Fees have been pushed down to such an extent that it is starting to affect the quantity of due-diligence work that professional advisers can afford to do. Whether that will have some impact on recoveries or failure rates in future is a big question, says Mr Keal. There is also a danger that the pressure on all parties to ensure the deal gets done, so that the principals make a return and the advisers get paid, is such that it could lead to too much completion for completion's sake. You could reach the stage where no one is asking whether this deal should really be done, or done in this way, he says. Matthew Layton, of Clifford Chance, doesn't believe competition among law firms for MBO work has increased that much; especially for the larger buy-outs above Pounds 10m where, he says, there tend to be only a few firms that have the expertise to handle that size of transaction. But he does accept that clients have become much more conscious of the fees issue. This has meant that law firms have had to work very hard at controlling costs, striving to come up with straightforward documentation which will simplify the negotiation process, and also trying to ensure that there is no duplication of effort among the advisers to the deal. There is an obvious overlap with the due-diligence work that accountants and lawyers do, for example, which has to be avoided, says Mr Layton. The recession has also clearly had an effect on the way deals are likely to be structured in the foreseeable future. John Kitching, of Lovells, says that, faced with restructuring a number of the more complex deals put together during the boom period at the end of the 1980s, lawyers learnt the hard way whether their original documentation was any good or not. Unscrambling and restructuring deals where the agreement of large syndicates of 20 to 30 banks is required has proved particularly stressful. But the positive side, says Mr Kitching, is that those who have slogged it out during the recession will have a better knowledge of what the market will and will not back, which they can use in the future. Adam Greaves, of Gouldens, who has just advised on the restructuring of Maritime Transport Services, a Pounds 155m MBO which he worked on in 1989, confirms that the experience of unscrambling some of the more optimistically structured deals of the late 1980s will result in much simpler deals in future. The days of ratchets are gone, he says. The trend is towards simple equity share structures, so that if it works it works, but if it doesn't you can at least start again without the complexities of past deals. All the lawyers are agreed, however, that the level of MBO activity has picked up over the past six to nine months. There have been a lot of flotations at the exit end and a lot of small MBOs, many financed without institutional money by so-called 'business angels', says Adam Greaves. Matthew Layton says there may have been a slight downturn in the actual number of new MBOs, but there is still plenty of activity because, although debt is harder to obtain than it was in the late 1980s, there is still a lot of equity money in the market looking for a suitable home. Lawyers have become more proactive and creative in looking at new structures in recent years, partly because the lack of available debt forced them to find alternatives to standard senior debt financing, but also because vendors have become increasingly interested in retaining stakes in the buy-out vehicle. Some deals these days are structured more like joint ventures, he says. Lower interest rates have been good for buy-outs, but they also mean there is less pressure on vendors to sell; and, as they don't want to sell at a low point in the market, they prefer to keep an equity stake in the joint venture. These deals are much more complex from a legal point of view, Mr Layton adds. Tony Keal says he thinks the supply of senior debt has actually expanded again, particularly compared with six months ago. The evidence of that is the Gardner Merchant deal, he says. But he agrees that the structure of deals has changed. 'They are now much more conservatively structured. In the heyday of the late 1980s, deals were being structured with debt-to-equity ratios of 6:1; now 1  -1.3:1 is the norm.' The unspoken hope of the MBO lawyers is that the Gardner Merchant deal represents the first of a second wave of bigger buy-outs. If that turns out to be the case, perhaps it will at last enable them to return to what they regard as more realistic rates for the job.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           LEADING SOLICITORS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Acting for      Manager      Total                              equity/debt                                   leader  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Clifford Chance                       87           29        116 Ashurst Morris Crisp                  46           13         59 Allen &amp; Overy                         39           11         50 3i Legal                              41            0         41 Lovell White Durrant                  27            7         34  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Macfarlanes                           23            8         31 Herbert Smith                         20            9         29 S J Berwin                            13           14         27 Alsop Wilkinson                       10           16         26 Dickson Minto                         12           13         25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Eversheds                              6           19         25 Slaughter &amp; May                       10           14         24 Freshfields                           19            3         22 Wilde Sapte                           20            1         21 Turner Kenneth Brown                   8           11         19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Norton Rose                           11            7         18 Cameron Markby Hewitt                 13            5         18 Nabarro Nathanson                      8            8         16 Travers Smith Braithwaite              8            5         13 Wragge &amp; Co                            3           10         13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dibb Lupton Broomhead                  2            9         11 Simpson Curtis                         2            9         11 Linklater &amp; Paines                     7            3         10 McGrigor Donald                        4            5          9 McKenna                                3            6          9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Osborne Clark                          1            7          8 Pinsent                                3            3          6 Simmons &amp; Simmons                      1            5          6 Taylor Joynson Garrett                 1            4          5 Kimbell &amp; Co                           0            5          5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Addleshaw                              1            4          5 Halliwell Landau                       0            5          5 Dundas &amp; Wilson                        3            1          4 Berwin Leighton                        2            2          4 Theodore Goddard                       0            4          4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Walker Morris                          1            3          4 Edge &amp; Ellinson                        1            3          4 Bird Semple                            3            1          4 Maclay Murray Spens                    1            3          4 Other/None/Duplication               (35)         140        105  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                                425          425        850  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Qualification: Pounds 10 million plus deals, acted in four or more Source: KPMG Corporate Finance  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

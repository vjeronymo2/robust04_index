			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "News at One"] </F>   [Text] China's Finance Minister Liu Zhongli has welcomed  signs that the United States might compromise in its dispute  with China over human rights and said Beijing was willing to  discuss the issue so long as it was not linked to trade. Trevor  Wyatt reports:    [Begin recording] Mr Liu said the Chinese Government had  made it very clear that it was willing to discuss human rights  with other countries, but it did not like one country imposing  its values and positions on this issue on the other party. The  United States is pressing Beijing to redress alleged human  rights abuses and has threatened to withdraw China's  most-favored-nation trading status if does not comply.  Washington's threat not to renew MFN when it comes up in June  has raised the specter of a rupture in economic relations that  would not only hurt the two countries involved, but the rest of  the Asia-Pacific region as well. Faced with that possibility,  the American Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said last week  that Washington needed to rethink its strategy for dealing with  China in order to avoid a damaging breakdown in relations. Mr  Liu agreed and said that he had heard the remarks by Mr Bentsen  and appreciated them. He said if human rights and trade were  linked together, then both countries would suffer. Saying that  trade was mutually beneficial for both nations, Mr Liu urged the  United States to renew MFN for China without any conditions. He  said Beijing had the support of a number of other countries for  its stance. [end recording]</p>

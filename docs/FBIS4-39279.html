			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 6 TASS -- All diplomatic instruments of  the United Nations should be put to use to settle the situation  in the Korean peninsula by political means and to keep from a  rash resort to sanctions. This view was stated to ITAR-TASS on  Monday by Professor Anatoliy Torkunov, one of leading Russian  experts on Korea who heads the Moscow State Institute of  International Relations.    Torkunov said demands of the international community to  North  Korea are fair. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  does not require of North Korea anything beyond what it expects  from other countries. Russia fully shares this attitude to the  nuclear problem which is the root-cause of the present Korean  crisis. Russian approach was set out in detail during the  negotiations Russian President Boris Yeltsin held with President  of the Republic of Korea Kim Young-sam in Moscow the other day.    The Russian scientist warned against a rash recource to  sanctions. Pyongyang got accustomed to relying on its own  resources. Sanctions can only lead to the further spiral of  ideological confrontation which, in the long run, will affect  the position of ordinary Koreans. The further heightening of  tension is fraught with unpredictable consequences as the Korean  peninsula is inundated with arms in its both parts.    An international conference in the Korean peninsula  suggested  by Russia could be an effective way of easing the situation,  Professor Torkunov believes. An ever greater interest is now  shown in this idea as it essentially meets the interest of all  the parties, including North Korea. The conference could put an  end to the isolation of North Korea which has been increasing of  late. South Korea has succeeded in establishing diplomatic  relations with Russia, China and East european countries in the  recent years. Meanwhile North Korea does not have diplomatic  relations with the United States and others leading Western  countries. If an international conference is held, Pyongyang  could get real diplomatic levers to protect its own interests.  North Korea should realise that the factor of menace to South  Korea is no longer as important as it used to be. South Korea  has a strong army, and Seoul interacts in defence matters with  the United States on a basis on a treaty.    All the parties concerned should use every method of  persuasion. China has levers of influence too. Beijing has  traditional ramified ties with Pyongyang. Tokyo has levers of  influence as trade with Japan is important for North Korea as an  outlet to the Western world.    Russia must be flexible on this matter, Torkunov said.  Russia has a certain stretch of common border with North Korea,  and power politics in relations with neighbours can hardly be  expedient. This is why the Russian line is to coordinate  diplomatic efforts with other countries. Possibilities of a  political settlement have not been exhausted, Torkunov said.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A hefty premium in the new Footsie futures contract was cut back significantly yesterday after a large deal went through the market shortly after the start of official trading, writes Peter John. Dealers said that some Pounds 230m was shifted from gilts into equities via the futures market towards the close of trading late on Monday. The trade was attributed to either SG Warburg or Goldman Sachs. It was partly responsible for topping up the futures contract for March expiry and keeping it strong in after-hours' dealing. Yesterday morning, the 'i's and 't's of the deal were still being dotted and crossed, and finalisation was responsible for lifting the underlying market initially. However, the successful shift of cash coincided with some disappointing trade statistics which provided an opportunity for investors to take profits after the second 300-point rally within six months. The first rally was followed by a 100-point fall and chart analysts obsessed with the idea that history always repeats itself are looking for a similar consolidation. March opened at 3,400 and hit a high of 3,408 before beginning to drift back to 3,367 by the official close. The premium above the cash market narrowed from around 30 points to 22 by the close, not far off its fair value premium, which is calculated at about 18. Footsie options saw buying of the March series, which pushed implied volatility to around 13.5 per cent, compared with 12.5 per cent in the January's. Total turnover of 37,336 lots was up from Monday's 31,594. Hanson was the most heavily traded stock option with 1,827 lots dealt.</p>

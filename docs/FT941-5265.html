			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Bophuthatswana spurns election The cabinet of Bophuthatswana, the nominally independent black homeland which forms part of South Africa's right-wing Freedom Alliance, said yesterday it would not register for April's all-race elections, joining the white right wing in boycotting the poll, Patti Waldmeir reports from Johannesburg. Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, whose Inkatha Freedom party has registered for the poll, said yesterday his participation was far from guaranteed, as it depended on the result of international mediation of the country's constitutional dispute. He said the poll should be delayed, a demand which the African National Congress adamantly rejects. Bophuthatswana's cabinet decided against registration yesterday, and though it said a final decision would be made by the homeland parliament, the assembly is unlikely to go against the cabinet's wishes.</p>

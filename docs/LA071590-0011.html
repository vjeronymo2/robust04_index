			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: **** SONIC YOUTH "GOO" DGC: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE  STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Sonic Youth is the Rolling Stones of noise music, a band imitated as often as  Aerosmith and a source of strength to alienated college students all over the  globe. A lot of smart people think it's the best band in the world.  </P> <P> But as the avatar of '80s indie underground rock, finally making its  major-label debut, Sonic Youth faces a conundrum: How does an aggressively  confrontational band make (a) a commercial record without (b) selling out?  </P> <P> The answer, of course, is to make the record an elaborate joke on the idea of  making a commercial record, a hermetic, album-length parody that's the  equivalent of putting those waggling-finger quotation marks around the whole  thing.  </P> <P> The songs revolve around catchy, nonsensical choruses -- things like "My friend  Goo / Just says, 'P.U.' " or "I don't wanna / I don't think so" -- that stick  with you as insistently as anything ABBA ever came up with. Great swaths of  dissonant guitar noise move the way radio hooks are supposed to, and they  become radio hooks themselves. There's always a beat to grab on to, sometimes  tribal, sometimes poppy, but always danceable, and "Goo" rocks as hard as  Mudhoney, while working on about half a dozen more levels. Call "Goo" the  "Exile on Main Street" of the snide generation. JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

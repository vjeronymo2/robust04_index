			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Atkins cuts losses Atkins Group, the Leicestershire hosiery manufacturer, cut losses from Pounds 96,000 to Pounds 49,000 in the six months to October 1, on reduced turnover of Pounds 8.23m, against Pounds 8.81m. Last year's result, however, included a Pounds 168,000 deficit on the closure of the fabric dyeing operation. Basic losses per share were 1.11p (2.1p) and the interim dividend has been held at 3.85p. Mr Charles Lenox-Conyngham, chairman, said the hosiery division performed creditably in an increasingly volatile market.</p>

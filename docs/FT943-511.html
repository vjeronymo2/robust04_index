			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Yeltsin pledges 'lasting peace': Summit fails to resolve rift on Bosnia President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday promised a lasting peace between his country and the US as he approached the end of his two-day summit with US President Bill Clinton. 'There are people in my country, though few, who say that our relationship with the US is transient and that an era of confrontation will return. But I would like to tell you that we have never fought the US and I believe, and I can say as president of Russia, that we will never fight the US,' he said. At the Library of Congress, where the two presidents opened an exhibition on the Russian Orthodox Church and the indigenous peoples of Alaska, Mr Yeltsin continued the bonhomie and back-slapping that has marked this summit. 'There are some extremist radicals from my country - people of poor education, I think, and of very low origins - who demand Alaska back for Russia. But I don't think this is serious stuff,' Mr Yeltsin said, referring to the call sometimes made by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian nationalist leader, for the return of Alaska, which the US bought from Russia in 1867 for Dollars 7.2m. Some differences between the two countries remain unresolved, although one of the sharpest disagreements, over whether to lift the embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia, has at least been put on ice by the Bosnian government's request for a delay. Mr Yeltsin yesterday repeated his opposition to lifting the embargo. 'Now the Bosnian Moslems think they have to wait six months. Let's wait for six months and then perhaps we can decide once and for all that this should not be done.' US officials said some agreement was expected on another issue that has caused friction between the two countries: Russian sales of military equipment, especially submarines, to Iran.</p>

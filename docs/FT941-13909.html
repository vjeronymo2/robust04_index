			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Cookery: Easy on the appetite and the purse - Simple and succulent squid After the meat feast of Christmas I favour simpler meals that major on fresh fruit and fish. Fruit is easy to come by with apples, pears and citrus in plentiful supply. The last tartly scarlet cranberries can still be found and the first thin, sharp and juicy pink stalks of forced rhubarb are just coming in. Spankingly fresh fish presents more of a problem. Fishermen need holidays like the rest of us and supplies are always erratic at the turn of the year. Recent stormy weather has made matters worse. Such fish as is to be found on fishmongers' slabs can look as hungover as some of the customers and it may smell fishier than it should. Frozen offerings imported from farther flung seas may prove a better bet. Last week I bought a solid block of small, white squid and hacked my way gratefully through them. Very delicious they were and modestly priced, a double reassurance when faced, as one is at this time of year, by a maelstrom of buff-enveloped bills that bring home the cost of Christmas. A menu we particularly enjoyed - easy on the appetite, easy on the purse and no hard labour for the cook - began with a salad of watercress and juicy slices of pear scattered with shavings of Parmesan. Squid with saffron rice formed the main course, and syllabub glasses filled with Bramley snow brought dinner to an agreeable close. SQUID WITH SPECKLED SAFFRON RICE (serves 6) One of the attractive features of this dish is the fact that the rice can be cooked ahead, packed into a mould and reheated when needed. This leaves only the squid to cook just before serving - 5 minutes work at most. 1 1/2 lb squid;  1/2 lb cherry tomatoes;  3/4 lb basmati rice; 1 large onion; 2 oz black olives; 1 oz sun-dried tomatoes soaked in olive oil; 1 1/2 pt fish stock; a generous pinch of saffron threads; a pinch of ground fennel seed; a bay leaf; a few sprigs of thyme; a garlic clove; a little olive oil; wedges of lemon or lime for serving. Chop the onion finely and soften it in a little oil over very low heat. Meanwhile, thoroughly wash the rice under a cold running tap and leave to soak for 5 minutes. Pound the saffron strands with mortar and pestle and soak them in a little of the hot stock. Tip the drained rice into the onion pan and stir to coat every grain with fat. Pour on the boiling stock, add some salt, the saffron liquid, ground fennel, bay leaf and a sprig of thyme and bring to the boil. Cover tightly and simmer for 5 minutes. Cut the sun-dried tomatoes into snippets. Scatter them over the rice, cover again and continue cooking for 5 minutes more or until the grain is tender. Halve and stone the olives. Stir them into the cooked rice. Remove the bay leaf and thyme. Check seasoning and spread the savoury mixture in a large shallow dish to speed cooling. When cold, pack the rice firmly into an oiled ring mould. Clean the squid if this has not already been done, first pulling the heads and innards out of the body sacs. Cut off the tentacles by slicing through the web of flesh that bunches them together and remove the hard beaks from the centres. Wash and dry the body sacs inside and out and slice across into thin rings. Skin the tomatoes and lay them in an oiled gratin dish. Sprinkle them with leaves stripped from a sprig or two of thyme, add a grinding of pepper and cover with a dome of foil. Shortly before serving reheat the rice and bake the tomatoes. The rice, loosely covered with oiled foil, will need about 20 minutes at 400`F (200`C) gas mark 6. Slip the dish of tomatoes into the oven for the last 5-10 minutes only, at which point the squid can be cooked. Dust the pieces of squid very lightly with seasoned flour and fry them in a little very hot oil flavoured with a garlic clove cut in half. (Unless a wok or other really large pan is used, it may be best to cook the squid in two batches.) Fry over high heat, stirring frequently, until the flesh loses its pearly translucence and becomes tender. A minute or two is plenty if the squid are small; too long and they will turn from firm and tender to albino rubber bands. Discard the garlic and mix the cooked squid gently with the tomatoes. Unmould the rice onto a hot serving dish, pile the squid and tomatoes into the centre of the ring and garnish with wedges of lemon or lime.</p>

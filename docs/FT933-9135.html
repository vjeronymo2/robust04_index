			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Sudan objects to IMF suspension of voting rights SUDAN has criticised a decision by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to suspend its voting rights, saying the move was politically motivated, Reuter reports from Khartoum. Mr Sapana Jambo, minister for international co-operation, quoted by the al-Ingaz al-Watani newspaper yesterday, said there was no reason for the suspension. The IMF on Friday suspended Sudan's voting rights saying the decision was taken because of the country's persistent failure to meet its obligations. Sudan's arrears which began to pile up since 1984 amounted to Dollars 1.6bn.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / MPs demand closure of loophole on business rates The law should be changed to prevent businesses escaping council rates by going into voluntary liquidation, the Commons environment committee said yesterday. A report from the committee highlights difficulties in collecting business rates since 1988 when the government removed local authorities' status as preferred creditors. Mr Paul Britton, director of the Department of the Environment's local government finance policy directorate, was unable to estimate how much revenue had been lost. He said the Department of Trade and Industry - 'the experts on company law and receivership' - had been asked what could be done about the problem. Mr Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, Conservative MP for Cirencester and Tewkesbury, said: 'It does seem a bizarre regulation that you can put yourself into voluntary receivership and thereby evade non-domestic rates.' The committee urged the government to find an answer before the Budget in November. Mr Britton said another factor in the fall in the yield from non-domestic rates was the increase in empty-property relief caused by the recession. The total is estimated to have risen from about Pounds 700m in 1990-91 to Pounds 1.22bn in 1994-95. A further recommendation from the committee underlines anxiety among MPs about the Local Government Commission headed by Sir John Banham, which is reviewing the structure of local government in England and is expected to spend Pounds 8.3m this year. The committee concludes that if ministers decided to override a large number of the commission's proposals it would be tantamount to a declaration that the commission had failed. In what amounts to a warning shot across the bows of the commission and the government, the committee says: 'In those circumstances, it will be clear that the commission has not provided value for money.' The report adds that the committee is likely to be among those asking why. Referring to the time taken on appeals against council tax, the committee says 250,000 cases were still likely to be outstanding by the end of this year. The committee says it will look for significant improvement next year. DoE Estimates 1994-95 and Annual Report. HMSO. Pounds 17.</p>

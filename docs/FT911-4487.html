			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / The Property Market: Stanhope has designs on business in the west Stanhope is widely considered to be one of the most talented property development groups in Europe. Nevertheless, like most overstretched players in the overbuilt London market, it is facing a period of consolidation. Last week it sharply wrote down the value of some sites - the bedraggled South Bank Centre, a section of London Wall in the City, a part of Brunswick Wharf to the north-east of the Isle of Dogs and some office blocks in Euston Square - after postponing their development for the next three years. Likewise, the 134-acre King's Cross site, potentially the most promising in London, is unlikely to be started for several years, although Stanhope and its partners are continuing to negotiate planning permission. But Stanhope's wings have not been clipped entirely. After winning planning permission at the start of the year, it is now converting an old bus maintenance depot at Chiswick into an architecturally distinguished office park set in 33 acres of parkland. This suburban (or as the developer prefers, 'mid-urban') park will feature the work of six leading UK architects - Eric Parry Associates, Richard Rogers Partnership, Peter Foggo Associates, ABK, Terry Farrell and Co, and Foster Associates. Among the buildings architects in this group have to their credit are those for Lloyd's of London and the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank and the exuberant TV-am headquarters. Asking a clutch of high-flying architects to produce harmonising designs within a tight budget for an office campus is unusual - and laudably ambitious. But the architects, headed by the master-planner Terry Farrell and Hanna/Olin, the US landscape architect, appear to have come up with the goods. 'The master plan and the details of the landscaping . . . suggests a scheme of unusual interest and quality that will set the standard for developments of this sort,' said the Department of the Environment's report. Stanhope, which is building the business campus with Trafalgar House, says the scheme is innovative in other ways. It is a cross between a conventional business park, in landscaping, car parking and amenities, and an urban office complex in its location and accessibility. The developers (perhaps optimistically) reckon it takes just 31 minutes to get to Cannon Street and 20 minutes to reach Heathrow. The park is a few minutes' walk from three Underground stations and two British Rail stations, which will eventually be connected by an interchange. According to Stanhope, 3m people are within a 15-minute journey of the projected site. 'The whole idea is: Why drag people into the town centre? Why not provide jobs where they want to live?' says Mr Fergus Low, the development director. In addition, the park will have a sports club, a brasserie and childcare facilities. Stanhope says the scheme, which will be ready in 1992, has sparked an encouraging amount of interest from the media and from pharmaceutical companies. If so, there seems to be a good chance that it will be a financial success. Kleinwort Benson Securities estimates that the project's break-even costs are Pounds 27 per sq ft, while it aims to charge rents of between Pounds 30 and Pounds 35 per sq ft. Stanhope, which already has a Pounds 100m facility, says it is confident that it can raise another Pounds 150m-Pounds 200m for the project. Elsewhere Stanhope's finances may be under strain. There are doubts about the profitability of its Ludgate scheme in Holborn (in spite of the record-breaking size of the letting agreed by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte) and there is concern about the value of Broadgate, the office development in the City. Broadgate held its value well in the initial phase of the property slump, but is likely to see a drop in value this year. Because Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments (the joint venture responsible for Ludgate and Broadgate) is highly geared, this could wipe out a significant part of the company's asset value. At the same time, there has been a realisation that the reduction of RSD's large income deficit may be a long haul because of high (although shrinking) interest costs and the worsening prospects for rental growth. The conclusion - that RSD needs to sell part of Broadgate - is hardly new. The decision to sell was taken last summer, although it was delayed by disagreements between Rosehaugh and Stanhope. But the asking price was ambitious (not least because of the extravagant sums that had been paid for other prestigious buildings such as Lansdowne House) and the crisis in the Gulf deterred potential buyers. A sale that was tentatively agreed with the Prudential Insurance Company of America's Global Fund fell through when the Gulf war broke out. As investors start to return to the UK market, a sale should not be too far away. The price is likely to be very different from that hoped for last summer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         CAPITAL GROWTH (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    Retail     Office    Industrial    All Properties  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Year to Feb 91     -11.6      -15.6       -11.2         -13.3 Quarter to Feb 91   -2.6       -5.0        -2.9          -3.7 Month of Feb 91     -0.7       -1.4        -0.9          -1.1 Equivalent yield     8.9        9.3        11.2           9.6 at end of Feb 91  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Investment Property Databank  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Inflation slide sends equities forward OFFICIAL news that UK inflation fell to its lowest level for 25 years in the year to the end of January produced a sharp turnaround in share prices. Equities rallied from initial big falls to close with good gains as the two-week trading account ended. The inflation news, described by one seasoned market dealer as 'stunningly good', transformed the gilts market where initial falls of around a quarter in long-dated stocks were replaced by gains of up to 1 1/2 points. Index-linked stocks, on the other hand, saw early gains erased and replaced by falls extending to  1/4 . Taking advantage of the sharp gains in conventional gilts, the authorities issued Pounds 800m in new stock, where dealings will commence on Monday. The stock comprises Pounds 200m of 9 per cent Conversion, maturing in 2000, Pounds 300m of 8 per cent Treasury stock maturing in 2003, Pounds 50m of 3.5 per cent Funding, due 1999-2004 and Pounds 250m of 9 per cent Treasury, redeemable in 2012. Earlier, there was considerable unease in both the gilts and equity markets after the speech in Frankfurt on Thursday evening by Mr Eddie George, governor-designate of the Bank of England. He warned against further cuts in UK interest rates. Markets have been increasingly focusing on the likelihood of a further reduction in UK interest rates to coincide with Budget day. Share prices began the day on a steady note but began to lose ground quickly as sterling weakened. Just over a point firmer at the opening, the FT-SE 100 index was over 20 points lower within an hour of the opening, led down by sterling and a flurry of weakness in the Footsie future. A modest rally ensued and the Footsie was around seven points lower ahead of the inflation numbers. After absorbing the economic data, dealers hoisted share prices and the 100 index accelerated to reach a day's high of 2,854.8, up more than 20 points, just ahead of Wall Street's opening. However, the US market proved a disappointment after the release of economic data, and took some of the shine off the UK market where profit-taking saw the Footsie close a net 8.7 firmer at 2,843.0, although it fell 19.9 over the week. The Mid-250 index lagged behind the 100-index yesterday, settling 0.2 off at 3,006.3. Equity turnover rose sharply after the inflation news, totalling 830m shares, just below Thursday's 889m, but well ahead of activity during the first three days of the week. Marketmakers adopted a bullish view of equities but cautioned that the coming week would see another spate of rights issues.</p>

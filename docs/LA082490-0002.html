			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARION BARRY'S TRIAL AND BLACK LEADERSHIP  </P> <P> The Times, after self-righteously proclaiming that "all Americans must be held  equally accountable," and noting "this nation's sad history of disparate legal  treatment of blacks and whites," nonetheless calls for "maximum sentence -- a  $100,000 fine and a year in jail," notwithstanding that "first offenders rarely  do jail time on misdemeanor convictions."  </P> <P> When The Times states that many "black Americans openly doubt the government  would have gone to such great lengths to pursue a powerful white man," thus  precluding the notion that any non-black Americans might share this notion, the  inevitable conclusion is that "his (Mayor Barry's) remaining admirers," to whom  "the maximum penalty would send a strong warning," are also black.  </P> <P> Apparently some Americans are more equally accountable than others.  </P> <P> ALAN M. SCHWARTZ  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

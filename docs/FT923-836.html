			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / British aid linked to debt payment BRITAIN will press Russia to begin repaying bad debts to unlock British aid of up to Pounds 280m (Dollars 478m), when Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, visits Moscow next week. 'It is a very important part of the confidence-building process to raise the concerns of creditors before we incur new debts,' Mr Heseltine said. Debts to UK exporters are understood to amount to about Pounds 100m. Mr Heseltine said he was not expecting immediate repayment in full, but insisted the Russian leadership 'must have regard' for this issue. 'A key aim is to encourage Russia to eliminate the various obstacles currently standing in the way of much-needed western private sector trade and investment,' he added. The British minister will be accompanied by executives from leading British exporters to eastern Europe, many of whom are impatient with the government for delaying disbursement of aid funds, and for its refusal to provide export credit insurance for contracts to Russia. During the visit, Mr Heseltine will co-chair the first session of a new steering committee on Trade and Investment, a 'business-oriented body'. He wants Russia to clarify its priorities for use of the Pounds 280m export credit, which was announced by Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, early this year. Resort to the funds has been blocked by delays in Russia agreeing with the IMF a structural adjustment programme, by confusion over Russia's investment priorities, by difficulties in pinpointing a Russian financial guarantor, and by the debts issue.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 17 Apr (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid met today with a Kuwaiti delegation led  by Ahmad al-Nassar, a member of the Human Rights Committee in  the Kuwaiti National Assembly. The delegation includes Qattam  al-Jumhur, a member of the assembly's Missing Persons Committee  [Lajnat al-Murtahanin]; Du'ayj al-'Anzi, chairman of the  National Committee for POW's; and Muhammad al-Haddad, a member  of the National Committee for POW's.    Following the meeting, al-Nassar said he discussed with  'Abd-al-Majid the latest developments on the POW's in Iraq,  praising the Arab League stance on this issue.    Al-Nassar reacted to Iraqi Information Minister Hamid Yusuf  Hammadi's announcement in Sanaa yesterday that Iraq has revoked  its decision to annex Kuwait and make it the 19th governorate.  The Kuwaiti official affirmed that his country has received no  official Iraqi offer to revoke the decision on annexing Kuwait  or to invite a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation to visit Baghdad  to discuss the POW problem.    He said Kuwait refuses to engage in a "political game" with  Iraq away from the UN and Arab League resolutions.    He added that Kuwait cannot give an opinion about the Iraqi  initiative until it is authenticated, particularly since Iraq  has made it a habit of raising "untrue issues," as he put it.    Touching on the Kuwaiti POW's in Iraq, al-Nassar said that  the case is now in the hands of the international community and  that worldwide efforts are under way to release them. He  remarked, however, that Iraq is not cooperating.    Du'ayj al-'Anzi, for his part, noted that Iraq denied  holding  any Iranian prisoners and then released thousands of Iranian  POW's. He affirmed that Kuwait has presented documents to the  Arab League, the United Nations, the International Committee of  the Red Cross, and the Nonaligned Movement confirming that a  large number of Kuwaiti POW's are being held in Iraq. He hoped  the League's efforts will succeed in solving this ongoing  problem.</p>

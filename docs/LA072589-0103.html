			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> EXPLORING SCHEME OF THINGS  </P> <P> Imaginary Landscape: Making Worlds of Myth and Science by William Irwin  Thompson (St. Martin's Press: $19.95; 191 pages)  </P> <P> Radical thought is fundamentally different from liberal thought. The two do not  lie on the same continuum. You don't get more and more and more liberal until  suddenly you are radical. Radicalism is discontinuous with other viewpoints. It  requires a sharp break with them, and it lives on the other side of that  divide.  </P> <P> By this definition, "Imaginary Landscape" by William Irwin Thompson is a  radical book. Not in a political sense, but as a way of thought. As Thompson  tells us at several points, he sees the world differently than almost everybody  else. That is both the strength and the weakness of his book.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Unique View  </P> <P> It is the strength because Thompson is operating from a unique world view,  which in itself is very attractive. He is his own person. It is the weakness of  the book because try as I might I can't understand what he's talking about.  </P> <P> This much I get: Thompson, a cultural historian who has taught at various  universities in this country, opposes the standard impersonal, scientific view  of the world, which he decries as "scientific materialism." He writes:  </P> <P> "An art gallery in which all the paintings were mirrors would be boring, and so  would a world with only one reflection of existence. There is not simply one  objective world, one fixed ground with adequate representations of it in mind;  there are multiple worlds in an ecology of multiple biomes (sic) and organisms,  each constituting cognitive domains of fascinating richness. Those who can live  with ambiguity, complexity, and infinite variety can rejoice that there are  windows to different worlds in the cognition of an antibody, a bee, a dolphin,  a bird, a human, an elemental or an angel."  </P> <P> I'm willing to grant that bees, dolphins, birds and humans have different  cognitive experiences. But antibodies? And angels? (I pass over elementals as  I'm not sure what they are.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Science and Myth  </P> <P> Thompson goes on to tell us that myth-making is what culture is all about, and  science is as much a part of the myth as Grimm's Fairy Tales. "Before we can  ever be open to the scientific imagination of the future," he says, "we have to  be open to the imagination in the mythologies and arts of the past. If we look  on myth as gibberish and art as illusion, our science will be brutal and will  brutalize others in the inappropriate organization of our social institutions."  </P> <P> I'm serious when I say I like his way of thinking. The world could do with more  intellectual anarchists. They liven things up. So what if you wind up  scratching your head in puzzlement? Better than reading the same old things,  the same perspective, the same givens, the same accepted wisdom that together  makes up a culture. Doesn't everybody on MacNeil/Lehrer sound the same,  regardless of his political point of view?  </P> <P> Thompson would never be mistaken for one of them. He is on the other side of  the chasm that separates liberalism thought from radicalism. This guy may be on  to something. I wish I knew what.  </P> <P> "In the rise of secular modernism," he writes, "we moved away from  traditionally religious modes of thought to see matter as dead and mind as  divorced from nature. Now in the shift from European modernism to a planetary  culture, we see that that ideology was too simplistic, that there are  intriguing relationships between myth and science and that animism contains  some intuitive insights that are worth exploring in the differing ways of art,  science, and philosophy."  </P> <P> All of this leads to what Thompson calls "a cultural history of consciousness"  in which he traces the development of group thought through five historical  stages from culture to "planetization," which is where we are now.  </P> <P> I would summarize some of his arguments but I fear that I would misrepresent  them. In general I don't have much patience for books I don't understand. But  there's something about this book that leads me to think that this time the  fault is mine and not the author's. Perhaps I'm getting soft (or soft-headed)  with age.  </P> <P> Thompson concludes:  </P> <P> "Between the angelic heights of the macrocosm of the Gaian atmosphere and the  elemental depths of the microcosm of the bacterial earth lies the middle way of  the Mind, and it is in this imaginary landscape of the middle way, whether we  call it the Madhyamika of Buddhism or the Christ of Steiner or the Da at of the  Kabbalah, that we humans take our life and come to know our world as the dark  horizon that illuminates our hidden center."  </P> <P> Huh?  </P></p>

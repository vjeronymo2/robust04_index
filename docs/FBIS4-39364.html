			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] The World Bank is to extend Kyrgyzstan a loan of  $1.5 billion for implementing a three-year program for economic  restructuring. In 1994-95 it will also receive $550 million to  cover the balance of payment deficit and back up social programs.    The agreement on the loan was signed during the consultative  conference of the World Bank and Kyrgyz representatives in Paris  on 2 and 3 June, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev told a press  conference in Bishkek.    The program for economic restructuring envisages measures to  lower the inflation rate to 3 percent (it stood at 7.5 percent  last May) and to 2.5 percent by the middle of 1995. By the end  of 1997, the annual rate of inflation is to stand at 4 percent.    Akayev said that, to date, Europe did not offer any  significant assistance either to Kyrgyzstan or to Central Asia.    The U.S. and Japan are playing the biggest role in promoting  the economic reform in Kyrgyzstan.    Akayev said he was disappointed with the results of  cooperation with the European Commission and said that the  credits extended last year were "the plunder of the poor." To  quote the president, in Brussels he expressed disappointment  with the program for technical assistance, proposed by the  European Commission.    He said that this program was absolutely useless, because it  benefitted only the European Commission's bureaucrats, so  Kyrgyzstan no longer needed proposed consultations.</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / The Markets: Salaries, yes, but what about service? - Serious Money The easiest and quickest job offer I ever got was from a company called something like FARDA Financial Services. The man in charge wore a black and white dogtooth suit, a chunky gold name bracelet, and rings. It was not a demanding interview. He did most of the talking, all the while standing energetically over me, but little of what he conveyed was about the work itself. 'See that woman over there,' he said, as a figure brushed past. 'She's been with us just four months and she owns a Porsche already. And that man there has paid off his mortgage this month.' The 'staff' were glued to their telephones and the open plan office buzzed with all the industry of bees in a hive. Advising people on financial products did not seem an unskilled task but the man reassured me that, in fact, it was very easy and the company would give all of a week's training. What about the wonderful salaries? 'We don't pay a salary; everyone here is self-employed - it's much better for tax reasons.' It was my introduction to the world of financial services and commission-selling. I did not enter it. Admittedly, this company was at one end of the commission-driven sales scale but there are many, particularly tied agents - authorised to sell the products of only one company - who earn a living by pushing to sell and whose work has little to do with providing a financial 'service' or even 'advice'. That is why the recent move towards salaries in place of commission is worth a cautious welcome. This week, Sun Life joined the small but growing band of companies, including Norwich Union and Barclays Life, switching to salaries. The shift is, in part, a reaction to commission disclosure - which comes into force in January - but also in response to growing criticism of selling by commission. The July edition of Money Management, an FT publication, quoted Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, as saying: 'Disclosure should alert consumers to the salesman's incentive to complete a sale and to the potential bias which might result from the variations in commissions available.' He went on to cite how the sale of a unitised with-profit bond would earn the salesman 5 per cent commission and a unit trust 3 per cent - but a Tessa (tax-exempt special savings account) would result in none. Small wonder that many commission-based advisers prefer to sell with-profit bonds rather than Tessas. Given the degree to which the financial services industry is wedded to commission, however, it will not be easy to divorce them. So, it is difficult not to be sceptical about the introduction of salaries while the commission incentive remains, or when bonuses are linked to sales performance. The Prudential offers a basic salary of only Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 4,000 - scarcely a whole-hearted embrace of the salary structure. Norwich Union says it is paying its agents selling life and pension policies a more realistic basic annual salary of Pounds 12,000 as well as commission. At Knight Williams, an independent financial adviser, staff could be forgiven for feeling bemused. They have been through virtually all the remunerative permutations available. At one time, they received greater commission for selling Knight Williams' products than those from outside; this differential was removed last year after unfavourable press comment. In March, KW said it had moved the staff to minimum annual salaries of Pounds 15,000 in conjunction with annual bonuses. This month, though, it cut salaries by 10 per cent pending the outcome of a public argument with a band of disgruntled KW investors. The same scepticism about changes in remuneration also applies to those independent advisers contemplating a move to fees instead of commission. IFAs are independent only to the degree that they are not limited to selling the products of a single company. The cultural divide between fees and commission is great, and the risk is that some IFAs may under-estimate its span to the detriment of consumers' interests. Instead of selling products, they need to think in terms of selling advice, even if that means charging some clients money for advising them to do nothing. 'It is not enough just to think of switching from commission to fees,' said David Norton, chairman of the Institute of Financial Planning, who identifies impartiality as the key to the fee-based culture. 'In order to charge fees, you have to get the advice right and add value. People will not be prepared to pay a fee for what is simply prescribing a product.' David Harris, of fee-based adviser Chantrey Financial Services, says that he is concerned that some commission-based advisers will simply calculate what they would have earned in commission and send the client a bill for the amount as a fee. Instead, he adds, 'we should be striving to be seen in the same light as professional advisers such as solicitors and accountants' by using a computerised time management system and giving a worthwhile service. When that makes getting a job at companies like FARDA Financial Services much harder in the future, then the new system will look as if it is beginning to work.</p>

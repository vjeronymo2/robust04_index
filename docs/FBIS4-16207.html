			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 13 Apr -- Today, the State Duma adopted in  their first reading a series of laws that should facilitate a  more effective struggle against crime. These were federal laws  "On the state protection of judges and employees of the law  enforcing and monitoring bodies," "On the state protection of  victims, witnesses, and other individuals assisting in criminal  proceedings," and also "on the tabling of amendments and  additions to the RSFSR criminal and criminal procedure code."    According to Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the Duma Committee  for Security, who was presenting the draft laws to the deputies,  the need for a speedy adoption of these laws was brought about  by the acute situation with regard to crime in the country and  the fact that the existing laws dealing with the battle against  crime were insufficient and consequently ineffective.    In particular, Viktor Ilyukhin noted, the adoption of the  law  "On the state protection of judges and employees of the law  enforcing and monitoring bodies" will allow the lives, health,  and property of this category of citizens and their families and  friends to be protected. The Duma committee chairman also  stressed that the adoption of the law "On the state protection  of victims, witnesses, and other individuals assisting in  criminal proceedings" will permit the safety and social  protection of these citizens to be guaranteed, so that the  necessary conditions for the battle against crime might be  created, and justice might be appropriately done in criminal  cases.    The laws were adopted in their first reading without  discussion since, in the parliamentarians' opinion, society had  an acute need for their speedy adoption. All remarks and  additions to the above laws which Duma deputies table in the  immediate future will be taken into account during consideration  of the laws in their second reading.</p>

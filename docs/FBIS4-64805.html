			<p>BFN     [Text] The Greek Cypriot side is expecting the UN  Secretary General's report to record the facts objectively and  as they stand and to put the blame where it belongs--that is,  entirely on the Turkish side. This was said by Government  spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis during his speech at the special  district congress of the DISI [Democratic Rally] Youth  Organization [NEDISI] in Larnaca.    Mr. Kasoulidhis added that the Greek Cypriot side has  accepted the contents of the suggestion in the 21 March UN  document on the condition that it also be accepted by the other  side. He also said that our side could also make many demands  for improvements to its own benefit, but it has not done so in  order to facilitate reaching an agreement. Mr. Kasoulidhis  continued: This acceptance has brought us to the end of the  road and constitutes our maximum as far as constructive  intentions and noble gestures. The spokesman added: As  President Glavkos Kliridhis has also stressed clearly, our  position is crystal clear: We will accept neither a new  document nor changes in the current one. Mr. Kasoulidhis  accused the Turkish side of lacking the political will to accept  not only the confidence-building measures but also a Cyprus  solution.    A message of greetings from the Greek New Democracy party  chairman was read and North Epirotes [Greeks from southern  Albania] also addressed the NEDISI congress, which was devoted  to the enslaved homelands of Hellenism.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries (10): For the customers - Profile: PFA Pension MR Andre Lublin, managing director of PFA Pension, Denmark's largest private pension and life assurance group for corporate pensions, shoots out questions about his rivals, which are not entirely rhetorical, with the speed of a machine gun. 'Who are they serving? Their shareholders? Their staff? Their customers?'. As to his own company, he has not a moment's doubt. The first thing he points out is that his group's share capital is precisely DKr1m and the articles of association prevent it from paying more than DKr50,000 in dividends. The implication is clear: anyone who has a policy with a company paying hundreds of millions in dividends to shareholders should think again. 'We exist for our customers,' says Mr Lublin, 'We have the highest yield, lowest cost, and lowest prices for insurance cover. And we give the best service.' PFA Pension was founded in 1917 jointly by a group of employers' associations and salaried staff associations, which explains its special structure with a minimal share capital and its complete dedication to its customers. Modesty is not Mr Lublin's style - at least, not when he is talking about PFA Pension. But he has something to boast about. It is arguably the most successful Danish financial institution of the past decade. Under Mr Lublin's stewardship, it has grown fast, and growth has come by winning a rising market share, not by acquisitions. PFA has shunned diversification into other types of business. Its market share has increased from 20.1 per cent in 1988 to 24.5 per cent in 1991. Premium income increased by DKr700m to DKr4.06bn in 1991, while income for its chief rival, Danica increased by DKr250m to DKr4.37bn. Owned by Baltica, Danica is the result of a merger of Baltica's life and pension business with the former Statsanstalten, which until privatisation in 1990 was a state fund. Mr Lublin is confident that in 1992 PFA Pension will pass Danica. PFA tops the yield league for life and pension savings companies, with a 1990 yield of 13.60 per cent, reduced to 8.50 per cent by a special Danish tax on pension and life assurance savings. The group's costs are only 6 per cent of premium income, a low figure by any standards. One reason for the low costs is that PFA deals with corporate and group pension and group insurance for relatively low-risk people. Companies which cater for the individual market think Mr Lublin is a little unfair when he points out that their costs are much higher than his. PFA's position as one of the largest money silos in Denmark, with total assets of about DKr55bn and an investment budget of more than DKr5bn in 1992, makes it an interesting target for international investment managers. The Danish life and pension funds only began to invest in foreign securities in 1989. The sums invested abroad are now quite substantial. In 1992, PFA will place about DKr300m in foreign equities out of a total budget for equities investment of DKr700m. About DKr500m will go into foreign bonds. The aim is to increase the share of the investment budget going into non-Danish securities from 15 per cent at present to 20-25 per cent within a few years.</p>

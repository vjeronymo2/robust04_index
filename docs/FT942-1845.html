			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Templeton Emerging net assets up 40% Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust, the largest in its sector, announced growth in net asset value per share of 40 per cent to 346.2p over the year to end-April. Investment income and interest increased from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 9.9m, but expenses rose from Pounds 2.49m to Pounds 5.98m. Earnings declined from 2.75p to 2.73p per share, while the proposed dividend of 2.1p marks an increase of 23.5 per cent on the previous year. But Templeton warned that its primary focus was capital growth, and it could not indicate future dividend levels. Higher dividends tend to result from large temporary cash and bond holdings after raising new funds, as yields on emerging markets are low. This year's dividend was also boosted by new rules on tax treatment of foreign income dividends. At end-April, the geographic split of the trust's investments was central and south America (25.6 per cent), Asia (35.9 per cent), Europe (19.8 per cent), Africa (0.3 per cent), and 18.4 per cent in cash.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: Watson &amp; Philip Pounds 36m buy and rights WATSON &amp; Philip, the Dundee-based food and stores services group, is to expand its wholesaling and retailing interests through the acquisition of Amalgamated Foods, a privately-owned business, for Pounds 35.5m in shares. The company is also making a cash-call of Pounds 11.2m which shareholders can subscribe for on a three-for-five basis at 262p per share. W&amp;P's shares rose 8p to 285p yesterday. The acquisition will double the size of W&amp;P's business and extend its coverage into the English wholesale and convenience stores market. Both W&amp;P and AF are suppliers to stores in the Spar and VG symbol groups. W&amp;P services some 180 independent retailers and owns 37 convenience stores in Scotland while AF deals with over 1,000 independent food outlets in England and runs 32 wholly-owned convenience stores trading in the Alldays format. Mr Ian Macpherson, chairman of W&amp;P, said yesterday: 'We have been walking out for a long time together. In March we decided it was time to go to church and at 5.15 this morning we tied the knot.' The acquisition will be financed through the issue of shares worth Pounds 21.8m to the vendors and a placing of a further Pounds 13.7m of shares on the vendors' behalf. Robert Fleming has underwritten both the vendor placing and the cash-call although gauging from W&amp;P's steady share price yesterday it looked as though the issues had been well-received. Mr Ron Jacques, chairman of AF, and his family holding account for 80 per cent of the company's shares. Following the acquisition, AF's vendors will end up with 24.7 per cent stake in the enlarged W&amp;P although they will be bound by a standstill agreement. Mr Macpherson said the food distribution industry was in a process of rationalisation as had been demonstrated by Booker's Pounds 300m acquisition of Fitch Lovell last September. 'We will now be in the top three or four in the industry,' he said 'We wanted to make sure that we were the rationalisers rather than the rationalised.' The enlarged company will be combined on a merger-accounting basis. This would have given the company combined sales of Pounds 427.9m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.4m in the year to October 26 1990. W&amp;P's earnings per share would have shown an 11 per cent improvement.</p>

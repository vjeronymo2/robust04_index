Vavin, A.V. Baklanskiy, Kemerovo Scientific </F> Research Institute of Agriculture; UDC 632:631:95]    [Abstract] The ongoing intensification of agricultural  production led to an increase in the scale and range of  agricultural chemicals, yet both the composition and  capabilities of the existing assortment of chemicals do not  fully meet today's environmental and sanitary-hygienic  requirements. This increases the urgency of monitoring and  studying the traces of pesticides in the environment. Thus, the  degradation dynamics of pesticides with a varying phytosanitary  actions in the soil and cereal plants in Kemerovo oblast's  forest-plain zone are examined against the natural backdrop of  soil fertility and against the optimum background of the plants'  mineral nutrition. To this end, a cereal crop rotation study was  carried out at the pilot test field of the Niva Kuzbassa  scientific production association whereby the detoxication  dynamics of three classes of pesticides--a fungicide, an  insecticide, and a herbicide--were studied jointly and  individually against the natural fertility background and  against the backdrop of mineral fertilizers (N:P:K=60:60:60  kg/ha). Toxicology analysis samples were taken on the treatment  day and one, two, four, and six weeks later. The study reveals  that the use of natural zeolites which have a pronounced  adsorbing and prolonging property for a number of pesticides is  a promising trend toward lowering their persistence in the soil  without changing their biological activity. The use of  pesticides with natural zeolites lowers the metaphos  accumulation in the plants by 20%, speeds up its  detoxication  by two weeks, and reduces its penetration into the subsoil. The  findings confirm the need to establish an efficient combination  of chemical agents for various purposes and the possibility of  controlling the process of pesticide degradation in order to  enhance the chemicals' environmental safety.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview via phone with Marcos Castellon from Miami by </F> Radio Rebelde reporters Maria Elena Alonso and Zenaida Costales  on the "Doing Radio" program -- live]    [Text] [Alonso] Good morning Marcos. There are indications  that there has been a change in the U.S. immigration policy  toward Cubans. We would like to hear details on this issue.    [Castellon] Yes, good morning. This week, for the first  time,  U.S. authorities intercepted and returned a group of Cubans who  were found at sea who were on their way to Florida from the  Bahamas.    Up until now, the policy of impeding groups of illegal  aliens  from arriving on U.S. territory had only been applied to  Haitians and other foreign nationals but not to Cubans, who as  everyone knows benefit from the 1966 law.    This legislation permits any Cuban citizen to be admitted  immediately once they reach U.S. territory despite the  originating point of their voyage or the reasons for that trip.  At the moment, this exclusive privilege is being challenged in  Congress with a bill that seeks annulment of the privilege  considering it discriminatory to other foreign citizens who are  required to present evidence of their allegations of political  persecution in their native land.    The interception and return of these 19 Cuban immigrants to  Bahamas by the U.S. Coast Guard is described by the MIAMI  HERALD's 14 April editorial as a good attempt to make the U.S.  immigration policy more consistent.    According to the same editorial, under the new policy,  Cubans  will be returned if they come from a third country where they  were established according to declarations from an official of  the U.S. Administration who was not identified.    With the pretext that there is already an immigration crisis  with the Haitians in the Bahamas, the government of those  islands criticized Washington's decision of returning the Cubans  to the Bahamas and has refused to accept any other deportees.  The editorial goes on to say that Cubans, Haitians, and other  possible illegal aliens should be warned, through radio  broadcasts and family members living in the United States, of  the risks in traveling to U.S. coasts on fragile boats and rafts.    The editorial also suggests that Washington be firm in  breaking up immigrant smuggling networks, that it ask other  governments to discourage illegal emigration, and not to expect  other nations to give up their sovereign rights, as in the case  of the Bahamian Government which rejected the return of Cubans  to its territory.    [Alonso] Yes, Marcos. But this is something strange  especially when it regards Cuban citizens. I would like to hear  your opinion on this change in policy by the U.S. Government.    [Castellon] This is a complex issue because the U.S.  immigration policy is something that is very difficult to  understand -- it is very inconsistent. Many point out that it is  full of inequalities and gives privileges to the Cubans.    Coinciding with the request by a U.S. Congressmen that the  United States invade Haiti and get rid of the military council  that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 16 players of  the Haitian soccer team asked for asylum at the U.S. Embassy in  Trinidad and Tobago and were rejected. These players say that if  they return to Haiti they will be the object of political  persecution. Nevertheless, the U.S. Government did not accept  their request for asylum.    This brings to mind the situation of Ponce, Puerto Rico,  where deserters of the Cuban sports delegations to the Central  American games, encouraged by anti-Castro groups, decided to  stay. Those that decided to stay had the immediate protection of  the U.S. Government without having to prove that they qualified  for the condition of political refugee.    On many occasions it has been pointed out that this  difference in treatment between Cubans and Haitians, in addition  to having political overtones, has aspects of racial  discrimination. This is not surprising if one considers the  results of a recent survey, which was published today, that says  the U.S. black population is becoming more radical and  pessimistic every day. This study was conducted by the  University of Chicago. Half of those interviewed even support  the formation of a national political party consisting only of  blacks. Seventy-three percent doubt they will ever be able to  see racial equality in their lifetime. A similar number believe  that the legal and economic systems, and society in general in  the United States, are not fair with black citizens. That is  partly reflected in the U.S. immigration policy.    [Alonso] Yes, that is very interesting. I believe Zenaida  Costales has a question for you.    [Costales] Good morning. I thank you for the help you give  to  the "Doing Radio" program. I was wondering if you could tell us  about the treatment given to those who leave Cuba illegally and  reach the United States. How are these people received?    [Castellon] They are automatically admitted. When Cubans are  seen in the Straits of Florida they are immediately helped. They  are taken to Coast Guard bases and are quickly processed and are  turned over to groups who give them support. They immediately  become an object of press coverage and later become part of the  general social current.    At the beginning, depending on the position they held in  Cuba, or if the circumstances of their arrival are dramatic,  their arrival is used as an element of propaganda. One must  examine their condition months later. Undeniably, many of them  have relatives here and they adapt and progress in this society.  But there is also an enormous quantity, who are not given as  much press coverage, who months after arriving are still waiting  for promises of work and are still having problems with housing.  There are some who are even begging for money on the streets.    There also many, many of whom I have met and whom have not  been given enough coverage, who regret coming to the United  States and they miss their relatives and their homeland. This is  a reality that is very shocking.    [Alonso] Marcos, we thank you for your opinion and your  cooperation.</p>

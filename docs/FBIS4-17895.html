			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Golubov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr -- The visit to Moscow and the talks  held here with heads of various Russian ministries and  departments, as well as with entrepreneurs, have borne an  exclusively constructive character, Panamanian Foreign Affairs  Minister Jose Raul Mulino told the ITAR-TASS correspondent  before flying off to St. Petersburg. "Although the visit to  Russia -- the first since diplomatic relations were set up  between the countries in March 1991 -- was most of all one of  fact-finding, our delegation leaves Moscow with a full portfolio  of specific ideas that we intend to implement in the very near  future," the head of Panama's Foreign Ministry emphasized.    The most important result of the trip was the signing, after  talks, by J.R. Mulino and his Russian colleague Andrey Kozyrev  of a declaration on principles for mutual activities and  cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Republic of  Panama. The foreign ministers agreed to reorganize the  consulates general and embassies of the two countries. In the  opinion of J.R. Mulino and A. Kozyrev, this step raises the  level of bilateral relations to that of full diplomacy, thereby  opening new possibilities for unhampered, mutually advantageous  links.    Besides his meeting with the head of the Russian Foreign  Ministry, J.R. Mulino during his three-day visit to Moscow, held  talks with the heads of the State Committee for the Management  of State Property, the Russian Federal Assembly's Committee on  International Affairs, and other Russian ministries and  departments. The Panamanian minister also had a meeting at  Kredo-Bank with representatives of the capital's financial  circles. The cultural program for the Panamanian delegation's  stay in Moscow included visiting the Bolshoy Theater and the  Moscow Kremlin.    In the opinion of the head of the Panamanian Foreign  Ministry  there is enormous potential for the development of bilateral  trade and economic relations. J.R. Mulino is certain that  Panama, which possesses one of the biggest free trade zones in  the Western hemisphere and a powerful international banking  center, could be of inestimable service to Russia in the sphere  of mastering financial know-how. In addition, the Panamanian  side could assist Russia in setting up (?free trade) zones and  insuring their normal functioning, [words indistinct], and also  pass on some useful experience regarding the creation of  legislation (?to insure the normal) development of the economy.  On the other hand, if Russia fulfills its trade and investment  potential on the Panamanian market, J.R. Mulino considers, this  could make it possible for Russian businessmen to do without the  services of European middlemen when buying many goods and  products that, in turn, will in the end make the prices finally  charged to the consumer for these goods and products more  acceptable.    The head of the Latin American country's foreign policy  department confirmed the intention that he expressed the  previous day about organizing a visit to Moscow by a large group  of Panamanian bankers and businessmen within the next three  months; they would concern themselves with drawing up and  implementing concrete trade and economic projects. The  Panamanian side expects a similar step by Russia.    "Having seen with my own eyes the difficulties that your  country is facing in its attempts to overcome the economic  crisis, I am still confident that the next few years are very  promising for Russia in terms of economic development," the  Panamanian minister noted. I sincerely wish Russia success, he  stressed at the end of the conversation.    It is expected that during his one-day stay in St.  Petersburg  J.R. Mulino will meet the leadership of the mayor's office in  the city on the Neva, as well as representatives of local  business circles. After this he will return home.</p>

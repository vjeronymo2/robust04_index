			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The next subject in our Panorama slot may  possibly come as a surprise. After all, two whole months remain  before the so-called zero hour -- two whole months before the  period for using our privatization vouchers ends. Some people  may have forgotten, or some people may not fully remember the  mechanism for using our vouchers and the legal mechanism for the  privatization process. It was these matters that our  correspondent Nikolay Filippov put to Anatoliy Chubays, the  Russian deputy prime minister.    [Begin recording] [Filippov] Anatoliy Borisovich, what do we  need to do in the remaining two months?    [Chubays] It is a short period of time and many people have  not yet managed to properly ponder their next moves. [passage  omitted]    At present we estimate that there are at least 10 million,  people who have not yet taken their final decision. [passage  omitted] On 1 July the period of validity of the privatization  vouchers expires. They need to be used before then. [passage  omitted] Our figures show that the involvement of foreigners in  the voucher privatization process has been very insignificant.  In fewer than 10 percent of cases has foreign capital been  involved in the voucher privatization process itself. There is  no sense therefore in saying that our homeland is being sold off  for a song. [passage omitted]    We now see, especially over the past few months, a sharp  increase in the involvement of foreign capital at the  post-voucher stage. [passage omitted] When I see that at the  post-voucher stage many major firms such as Siemens, Proctor and  Gamble, and Philip Morris are investing tens of billions of  dollars in Russian enterprises, it signifies for me an upsurge  in Russian enterprises and the start of a growth in dividends.  [passage omitted] Dividends grow and at the same time the  Russian economy gains, because it means increased production,  new jobs, and the start of an emergence from the crisis that we  are now in. Indeed, we are starting to emerge through the  inflow of investments that have been forthcoming only because  private enterprises and joint-stock companies are concerned.  This is a guarantee of a real start to an upsurge of the  Russian economy as a whole. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> HANDMADE;  </P> <P> NEW LIVES FOR OLD CUPBOARDS  </P> <P> IF OLD MOTHER HUBBARD were to go to Bobbi Robins' cupboards, she'd find them  anything but bare. Her decorative custom-designed cabinets are painted with  floral, folk-art and trompe l'oeil designs -- or just about anything else her  clients ask for.  </P> <P> Although the idea of decorating such utilitarian items as furniture has a long  history, Robins' cabinets are often put to distinctively 20th-Century uses:  housing for TVs, VCRs and CD players.  </P> <P> "The challenge is to take something from a secondhand-furniture shop and create  a fabulous piece," Robins says. To provide a textured background on a new or  stripped piece of furniture, she uses ragging, sponging, marbleizing and  "parchmenting." She then paints on her design, using acrylic water-based  paints.  </P> <P> The one-of-a-kind finished product may feature whimsical trompe l'oeil  bookshelves, stylized floral designs, or hearts and flowers reminiscent of  Pennsylvania Dutch patterns. She also paints kitchen cabinets, walls and other  pieces. Prices range from $150 for a small piece to $3,000 for a large cabinet.  </P> <P>  Bobbi Robins, by appointment only; (818) 989-0262.  </P> <P> Nancy D. Roberts  </P></p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Real Time more than doubled Shares in Real Time Control, which develops and supplies epos systems, rose 16p to close at 179p yesterday, as the company reported interim pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 424,000 to Pounds 1.05m. Turnover for the six months to September 30 showed a similar increase, rising from Pounds 3.58m to Pounds 8.49m. Earnings per share came out at 12p (4.1p). Mr Byron Carrell, chairman, said the company was well positioned to take advantage of the improving business climate in the UK. He added that, while performance in the second half was unlikely to duplicate that of the first, he was confident the full-year results would show good progress.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: Marvels in Maastricht ONE PARISIAN lady at the Maastricht arts fair this week sniffed that in her opinion the event was 'moins spectaculaire' than the Biennale antique show in Paris. Madame was wrong: less theatrical it may be, but once you forget the hideous warehouse they stage it in and examine the marvels on the stands, the Maastricht European Fine Art Fair, which closes tomorrow after 10 days, has to be the most 'spectaculaire' accumulation of antique excellence anywhere. Maastricht attracted 160 art dealers this year compared with 147 in 1992 and has been doing better business this year than last. Curators from the US and Europe were on the prowl and mediaeval and Renaissance art specialist Edward Lubin, from New York, was understandably upbeat after selling two south German polychrome statues of captive Turks, made to commemorate the Battle of Vienna in 1683, to the Zeughaus Museum in Berlin on the first night. In the textile section Eskenazi, from Milan, sold an historic piece, a unique early 13th century animal carpet from eastern Anotolia to a German buyer within minutes of opening. For the second year, Harry Winston, Cartier, Garrard and Buccellati are manning a jewellery section to waylay the rich. Winston boasted the Garuda brooch, set with the largest green diamond (8.19 carats) in the world for just over Dollars 3m. There is a new antiquities section with ancient Chinese art specialist, Gisele Croes, from Brussels, among others. Her stand includes two miraculously-preserved terracotta Han ducks and seven extremely rare Dian bronzes (475-109BC), which she rapidly sold. One of them was a belt-buckle in the form of a buffalo attacked by a tiger and a leopard, watched by a puzzled rabbit, all in marvellous detail. Next door, HA Cahn, from Basle, is exhibiting an array of Greek and Roman antiquities, including a rare 6th century BC Corinthian bronze helmet and a ceremonial gold pomegranate from Lebanon, second millennium BC, wondrously intact, for 75,000 Swiss francs. There is an abundance of silver this year: Koopman and Son, from Chancery Lane, wanted Pounds 1,250,000 for two George II three-light candelabra, a marvel of foliage and nude bodies made by Charles Frederick Candler in 1738. Philips - which on the first day alone did three-quarters of the business it managed in 1992 - wanted slightly more for an enamelled gold and glass tankard made in Zurich in 1608, signed by Hans Jacob Sprungli, from the Kremlin treasury. Maastricht began making up for its weakness in furniture this year. Adriano Ribolzi, from Monte Carlo, boasts a secretaire by 18th century French Royal cabinet- maker, Riesener, in rosewood, sycamore, burr elm, stained wood veneer and marquetry. Partridge, over from London for the first time, have a pair of console desserts with Sevres plaques, made for the dairy at Fontainebleau in which Marie-Antoinette played (Pounds 750,000) and, from Upton House, in Oxfordshire, a Louis XVI tulipwood bureau stamped J Stockel, for Pounds 220,000. Waddington Galleries made the trip from Cork Street and bucked up the dire quality of the 20th century painting section, always a weak spot at Maastricht, with a wide range of good contemporary works. Within 24 hours of opening, it had sold some Pounds 250,000 worth including a Leger gouache of 1949, a Jean Arp bronze and two Henry Moore drawings. Some great Old Masters shine through the acres of 17th century tulips, oceans of Dutch seascapes and innumerable Flemish tavern scenes, which dealers always bring to charm local buyers. Bob Haboldt, of Paris, has a major 17th century Italian still life by Michelangelo di Campidoglio, while Bruno Meissner, of Zurich, has four, vigorously-executed scenes from the life of Moses, by Jacopo Palma. Bernheimer has a vibrant Canaletto view of the Grand Canal priced at Pounds 2.6m and Emmanuel Moatti, from Paris, showing both drawings and paintings, quickly sold a Rubens portrait of Prince Francesco Gonzaga, of 1605, a fragment of an altarpiece. 'Trading at Masstricht is not just a sign the art market is moving. I think it is a means to get it moving, too,' one dealer said.</p>

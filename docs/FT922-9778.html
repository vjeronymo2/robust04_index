			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Financial gains lift Roche to SFr2.04bn CONSOLIDATED sales of Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, rose 26 per cent in the first quarter, to SFr3.3bn (Dollars 2.17bn), Mr Fritz Gerber, chairman, said yesterday. However he warned that the growth rate was inflated by a sharp decline in the Swiss franc against the dollar, and by the abnormally weak performance during the comparative period because of the Gulf war. In local currencies, the sales growth rate was 17 per cent. Roche revealed detailed accounts for 1991 showing that financial gains contributed almost all of the 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to SFr2.04bn. Mr Gerber said growth in operating profits was so strong that the group decided to spend heavily on pre-marketing of new drugs. Marketing and selling expenses jumped 20 per cent to SFr2.5bn. The group's research and development costs also rose 20 per cent, partly reflecting the higher level of research spending of Genentech, the US biotechnology group in which Roche bought a 60 per cent stake in 1990. Roche also charged to expenses SFr200m for intangible assets acquired last year, and SFr62m for the merger costs of its two fragrance subsidiaries, Givaudan and Roure. Mr Henri Meier, finance director, said Roche would be in no hurry to change its capital structure following changes in Swiss law in July making it illegal to raise capital through dividend right certificates. Roche has issued 7m such certificates. Mr Meier said he foresaw no need to raise more capital. Swissair, Switzerland's national airline, said first-quarter revenues rose 5.3 per cent, while costs increased 4.9 per cent. The load factor dropped visibly because of the deployment of new aircraft, and budget targets were not met. Mr Otto Loepfe, chief executive, said the group was prepared to cut costs further.</p>

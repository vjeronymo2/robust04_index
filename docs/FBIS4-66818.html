			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, April 11 (PTI)--Mr Ebrahim Sulaiman Sait,  the ousted president of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML),  today announced that he would launch a new party here on April  23.    Mr Sait told a press conference that it was finally resolved  to launch a new party, after extensive consultations with  various Muslim organisations, both political and non-political,  including past and present leaders of the IUML and even the  Jamait-i-Islami.    Mr Sait said he had convened an all-India political  convention to be attended by over 500 delegates here on April 23  to decide on the name, structure and flag of the new party which  would be "well-knit, coordinated, broadbased and secular."    Mr Sait's faction had split from the IUML after he was  ousted  as president of the party he led for 21 years and was replaced  by Mr G.M. Banatwala. Mr Said today reiterated his charges that  the elections of the president were "sudden, not on the agenda  and manipulated."    Mr Sait said he was "pained and anguished" to announce this  departure from the IUML, but it was inevitable because the  Kerala unit of the IUML refused to quit the Congress-led  government.    The Sait faction had been pressing its Kerala unit to quit  the Karunakaran government after the demolition of the Babri  Masjid, saying there should be no truck with the Congress.    All Muslims rejected the Central government's package  following the demolition of the Babri Masjid, namely acquisition  of the disputed land, reference to the supreme court by the  President and the formation of two trusts to build a temple and  mosque each, Mr Sait said.    The Kerala unit of the IUML was supporting this package and  toeing the government line and their "action is sheer political  dishonesty and hypocricy" which has led to the party's complete  "alienation, especially among the youth," Mr Sait claimed.    Before launching the new party, a 25-member high powered  committee would hold two days of meetings to deliberate over the  name, modalities and structure of the new party and make its  recommendations for the approval of the session.    The convention has been sponsored by 75 leading  personalities  of the Muslim community from different states who will decide  about the theme and conduct of the convention, he said.    Mr Mohammad Sulaiman, former president of the Uttar Pradesh  state Muslim League, Dr Bashir Khan Ahmed, former office-bearer  of the Delhi unit, and Mr Mansoor Ahmed Khan of the Delhi unit,  also attended the press conference along with Mr Sait.    Mr Sait said he held two consultative meets with Muslim  leaders of the northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya  Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan on March 6 in Delhi and another one  in Madras with representatives and leaders of Muslim  organisations of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and  Lakhswadeep Islands.    In a statement read out at the press conference, Mr Sait  said, "Such a step (of forming a new party) became inevitable  because of sheer power-mongering, regardless of the interests of  the community."    "A coterie which was controlling the Kerala unit of the IUML  was sacrificing all principles of truth and justice and was  blindly following Congress culture and the Congress line," he  said.    It was a tragedy that even the national leadership of the  IUML had fallen prey to the "misguided and detrimental policy of  toeing totally the line of the Kerala state Muslim League," he  added.    Mr Sait said that he had given the Kerala unit two months  time to withdraw from the United Democratic Front (UDF)  government and as that time had expired, he was announcing the  launch of a new party.    He, however, ruled out resigning from the IUML or his Lok  Sabha seat forthwith. He said mass resignations from the party  would come by and by, and said he would not quit his Lok Sabha  seat "because my constituents do not want me to."</p>

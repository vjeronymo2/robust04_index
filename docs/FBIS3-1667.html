			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA Hong </F> Kong Branch: "The Prospects for Hong Kong Are Full of  Brightness--Speech Delivered at a Forum on `The Prospects for  Hong Kong'"; place and date not given]    [Text] Respected Chairman Hung Chingyuan, ladies and  gentlemen:    On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of  the Hong Kong Eastern District Association for People From All  Walks of Life, on behalf of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA  News Agency, I hereby extend my heartfelt congratulations! And  I would like to take this opportunity to express my Lunar New  Year greetings to people from all walks of life in Eastern  District present here. I wish you all a happy Lunar New Year,  good health, and smoothness in everything!    In the past year, with the common efforts of Hong Kong  compatriots and citizens and under the direct influence of the  mainland's prosperous economic development and a fine social  situation, Hong Kong has maintained its economic development  vitality after overcoming all kinds of negative factors. In the  political field, the past year has not been tranquil. In  October the year before last, Mr. Chris Patten unilaterally  dished out a so-called constitutional reform package regardless  of the Chinese side's advice and objection, thus causing an open  dispute. Last year, China and Britain held 17 rounds of talks  on Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral arrangements. In the process  of the talks, despite the greatest efforts, much flexibility,  and accommodations on many issues on our part, the British side  still obstinately insisted on its "three violations" program  regardless of the Chinese side's and Hong Kong citizens' strong  opposition and the severe criticism by farsighted personalities  within and outside the British Government. It constantly  obstructed and undermined the talks and announced the suspension  of the talks when there was no agreement between the two sides.  It unilaterally submitted part of the constitutional reform  package to the Legislative Council, thus causing the talks to  break down. Everyone is aware of these facts. But to deceive  the public and mislead public opinion, a British Cabinet meeting  held not long ago and a recent speech by Mr. Chris Patten still  indicated their wish to reopen the talks. This method of  deception is unwise and will only enable people to see through  their hypocrisy.    The British side's unilateral publication of the details of  the talks, which have been sorted out by itself, is aimed at  deceiving the citizens, misleading public opinion, and covering  up and shifting its responsibility for undermining the talks and  Sino-British cooperation. But all this has come to naught. The  Chinese side has never objected to publishing the details of the  talks. We said long ago that the publication of the details of  the talks and the British side's act of undermining the talks  will not bring any glory to Mr. Chris Patten; it will only  enable citizens to understand clearly how they obstinately  persist in the stand of "three violations" and how they  obstructed and undermined the talks. But the Chinese Government  has always acted in good faith in diplomacy. The Chinese and  British Governments sent representatives to the talks, there  were agreements between China and Britain, and the details of  the talks remained secret; if the details of the talks were to  be published, the two governments should reach an agreement.  Now the Hong Kong governor, who was sent by the British  Government to exercise colonial rule in Hong Kong, has commanded  the British Foreign Office to unilaterally take action which  involves diplomatic affairs between the two countries. This is  something we cannot make head or tail of. After being ridiculed  by public opinion, the British side said that the details of the  talks would be jointly published by the British and Hong Kong  Governments, to redeem their face a little. We will certainly  respond to the British side's move.    To maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability during its  transitional period and ensure a smooth transition in 1997, the  Chinese side hopes for good cooperation between the two sides.  This is explicitly set down in the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, and the Chinese side has made positive efforts  toward this end. But cooperation is not unilateral. Now the  British side wants to be antagonistic in addition to not being  cooperative. This is nothing terrifying. Because the  constitutional structure cannot converge, the British side's  three-tier councils will terminate on 30 June 1997, and at that  time the Chinese side will reorganize the structure of the  three-tier councils according to the provisions of the Basic Law.    Officials from the British side have repeatedly said that  this will not happen. That is only their wishful thinking. The  future Hong Kong Special Administrative Regional Government will  be a special administrative regional government directly under  the jurisdiction of the central people's government after China  recovers Hong Kong and resumes the exercise of sovereignty over  it; this government will not be a continuation of the British  Hong Kong Government. It is legitimate and rational to dissolve  and reorganize the political structure of a government currently  under British colonial rule. Now Hong Kong's return to the  motherland in 1997 is less than three and a half years away.  There is a great deal of preparatory work to do for the  transfer of power. Hong Kong citizens are generally concerned  about whether or not Hong Kong's steady transition can be  ensured at a time when the Sino-British talks have broken down  and the British side is not being cooperative. The Chinese  Government has stated time and again that under any  circumstances, China has full confidence and the ability to  ensure Hong Kong's steady transition together with the Hong Kong  citizens and to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong  Kong as scheduled. This judgment is based on a coolheaded  analysis of various objective factors.       First, China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty  over  Hong Kong is a just cause which corresponds with the trend and  popular feeling, is rational and legitimate, and enjoys  wide-ranging support from the descendants of Emperor Huangdi,  including Hong Kong compatriots. For more than 100 years after  the opium war, the Chinese nation experienced plunder and  disasters and was subjected to humiliation. The founding of New  China enabled the Chinese nation to stand tall among the nations  of the world; reform and opening up have all the more brought  about a new look in China; and its politics have remained  stable, its society is harmonious, its comprehensive national  strength keeps increasing, its people's lives are improving  markedly, and its international position is being enhanced.  Against this major historical background, China's resumption of  the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong will help  rehabilitate the nation after more than 100 years of  humiliation; and this is an event affording general  satisfaction. No force can obstruct the Chinese nation's wish  for reunification and prosperity.    Second, the series of principles and policies for Hong Kong  announced by the Chinese Government are entirely correct and  have won enthusiastic support from the Chinese people, including  the citizens of Hong Kong, and have received extensive  recognition from around the world. The basic point of these  policies is to achieve Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong and a  high degree of autonomy in accordance with the principle of "one  country, two systems," after sovereignty over Hong Kong is  recovered in 1997. These basic principles and policies were  laid down in legal form by way of the formulation and  promulgation of the Basic Law. Over the past 10 years or so,  the Chinese Government has consistently and steadfastly abided  by these policies, without being shaken by all the domestic and  external factors or making any change because of the British  side's breach of faith, which has greatly boosted the confidence  of Hong Kong's general public in staying in the territory to  assist in the territory's future development. It is because of  the Chinese Government's consistency in adhering to this policy  that Hong Kong has basically maintained social stability and  economic growth up to now in the transitional period, as a  result of which the public feel reassured and large numbers of  emigrants are returning to the territory. The overwhelming  majority of the people in Hong Kong and investors in the  territory from elsewhere are full of confidence in Hong Kong's  sustained prosperity and stability.    Third, Hong Kong is an economic center. Its advantage lies  in its economy and steady economic growth is the basis of Hong  Kong's smooth transition. As the reform and opening up in the  mainland are continuously deepening and expanding, the mainland  and Hong Kong are coming closer and closer together in their  economic ties and Hong Kong's role as a bridge and link between  the mainland and the international market is also being ever  more fully brought into play. As of April 1993, the Chinese  mainland replaced the United States as Hong Kong's biggest  source of transit goods and biggest destination of exports. The  number of Chinese-funded and mainland enterprises which have  their shares listed on Hong Kong's stock market has  significantly increased, constituting a conspicuous force among  all listed companies in Hong Kong. Facts indicate that the  economy of Hong Kong and that of the mainland have fused and are  inseparable. Since last year, a series of record highs has been  observed on the Hong Kong stock market and large amounts of  foreign investment have poured in. This is not only a result of  people seeing positive trends in Hong Kong's economy, but also a  sign of their optimism about the prospects for the mainland  economy. As long as the mainland economy maintains a sustained,  speedy, and healthy [chi xu jian kang kuai su 2170 4958 1816  6643 0256 1660] growth, Hong Kong will continue to benefit from  it.    Fourth, after going through the stormy past few years in  this  transitional period, the Hong Kong people's sense of belonging  and sense of identity in connection with their motherland has  been gradually enhanced. They are feeling more profoundly than  ever before the connection of their vital interests with their  motherland's future and interests and have come to realize that  Hong Kong's stability and prosperity hinge on the steady  development of the mainland and the harmony between the two  places. Assuming the posture of masters of their own affairs,  the people of Hong Kong are, in a manner never seen before,  showing concern for and taking part in social affairs,  supporting smooth transition, and opposing any act to impede the  return of Hong Kong's sovereignty and to sabotage smooth  transition. The voice of patriotism and love for Hong Kong is  getting progressively stronger, the influence of patriotic  forces in Hong Kong's political life and social affairs is  gradually expanding, and the stabilizing factors are  strengthening by the day. The Preliminary Work Committee [PWC],  as a working organ authorized by the National People's Congress  [NPC] to make preliminary preparations for the setting up of the  Special Administrative Regional Government, has since its  founding done a great deal of work for the smooth transition and  transfer of government in Hong Kong. This signals the beginning  of a new phase in the preparations for the transfer of  government in Hong Kong. It has been made possible to a large  extent by the Hong Kong people's enthusiastic support and active  participation. Mr. Chris Patten has time and again belittled  and attacked the PWC and even insulted PWC members. It shows  that the founding of the PWC is very necessary and all the work  it does is a powerful check on the British side's attempt to  sabotage the smooth transition. One may say that if some people  have the audacity to risk universal condemnation and try to  create great chaos in Hong Kong, the people of Hong Kong will  definitely not allow them to do so.       Fifth, the British side's change of policy toward Hong Kong  has greatly damaged the mutual trust and cooperative  relationship between China and Britain, which has in turn harmed  Hong Kong's and Britain's own interests. This will naturally  cause discontent and opposition among more and more people of  insight in Hong Kong and in Britain. Even if the British side  maintains an antagonistic stance in the coming three years or  so, it will only have limited power and influence. Any  decisions that involve issues beyond 1997 made by the British  side in the transitional period without seeking consensus  through consultations between China and Hong Kong will  definitely be terminated on 1 July 1997. This also applies to  the three-tier councils that will have to be reorganized. The  British side has repeatedly claimed that if the Chinese  Government reorganizes the three-tier councils in accordance  with the Basic Law and the relevant provisions of China's NPC on  1 July 1997, it will meet with the objections of world opinion.  But the opposite will be the truth. The side that should  receive condemnation by world opinion is the British side. In  short, justice is on the Chinese side, popular feeling is for  the Chinese side, and the time advantage is also with the  Chinese side. All kinds of positive factors contributing to the  smooth transition in Hong Kong are gradually expanding and the  ultimate initiative is in our hands. Hong Kong's future is full  of brightness.    As early as in 1984, Deng Xiaoping said: "One should believe  that the Chinese in Hong Kong can run Hong Kong well. Refusing  to believe that the Chinese in Hong Kong can run Hong Kong well  is a mentality left behind by the old colonialism." After Hong  Kong returns to China in 1997, Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong  and a high degree of autonomy will be instituted according to  the principle of "one country, two systems" and in pursuance of  the provisions of the Basic Law. "Hong Kong people ruling Hong  Kong" must be exercised mainly by patriots. This is not only an  important expression of China's resumption of sovereignty over  the territory, but also an objective requirement for  safeguarding national unity, correctly handling the relationship  between the "two systems" operating in the mainland and in Hong  Kong respectively, and maintaining permanent prosperity and  stability in Hong Kong. The criteria for a patriot are:  Respect for his nationality, sincere support for his motherland  in resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong, and refraining from  harming Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Therefore, love  for the country and love for Hong Kong should be entirely  aligned.    In the same speech, Deng Xiaoping also said: "The people of  Hong Kong are capable of running Hong Kong well. They should  have such self-confidence. The existing prosperity of Hong Kong  is largely a result of the efforts made by the Chinese. Chinese  are not any less intelligent than foreigners. Chinese are not  imbecile. Do not always think that only foreigners can do a  good job. One should believe we Chinese can also do a good job  ourselves."    This is a full affirmation of the important contributions  that Hong Kong compatriots have made to the territory's  prosperity and also an expression of the greatest trust in Hong  Kong compatriots.    The overwhelming majority of the Chinese in Hong Kong are  patriotic. The general public are deeply conscious of the  righteousness of the cause, have a strong national pride and  confidence, support their motherland's peaceful reunification,  support their motherland in resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong,  and do not wish to see anything happen that undermines Hong  Kong's prosperity and stability. Hong Kong compatriots have had  a glorious patriotic tradition in history. During the talks  between China and Britain on Hong Kong's future, after Hong Kong  entered the transitional period, Hong Kong compatriots did a  great deal of work with utter patriotic enthusiasm. In recent  years, by supporting their motherland in its construction drive,  by participating in the formulation of and propaganda on the  Basic Law, by providing relief for East China when it was  stricken by disastrous floods in 1991, by supporting their  motherland in the 2000 Olympics bid, by providing aid for the  "Hope Project," and by doing many other things, Hong Kong  compatriots have shown fervent patriotism. To prepare for the  territory's return to the motherland, the compatriots in various  circles in Hong Kong have been taking an active part in various  social affairs and doing their best to help maintain Hong Kong's  stability and prosperity. The Eastern District Association for  People From All Walks of Life, as a patriotic mass organization  that loves Hong Kong, has done a great deal of work in the past  four years in connecting extensively with the compatriots from  all walks of life in Eastern District and in helping promote  Hong Kong's prosperity, stability, and smooth transition. It  has won praise from personalities of various circles. After  Hong Kong is returned to the motherland in 1997, the patriotic  enthusiasm of Hong Kong compatriots is bound to be able to find  full expression in running Hong Kong and accomplish new feats.    I believe our Hong Kong compatriots are now all asking  themselves this question: In this important historical period  when Hong Kong is about to return to the motherland, what have I  done for it and what have I contributed to it? And I have even  more reason to believe that everybody will give the best answer  with their actions.    Thank you.</p>

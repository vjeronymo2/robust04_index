			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, June 28 (CTK) --- [passage omitted]    Coupon privatization in Slovakia is not jeopardized, says  deputy premier in charge of the economy Brigita Schmognerova in  an interview with today's issue of SME.    In her opinion, emphasis must be laid on the transformation  of state-owned enterprises into joint-stock companies.    Schmognerova sees differences between the ministries which  are preparing privatization in that the Privatization Ministry  stresses the overall volume of property to be privatized in  coupon privatization, whilst the Economy Ministry considers its  impact on individual enterprises. Schmognerova agrees that this  impact must be taken into consideration.    However, she rejects the opinion that the application of  this  method will cause the present enterprises' managements to lose  their power position.    She also disagrees with the view that the SDL [Party of the  Democratic Left] regards managements as its sphere of influence.  "At least 80 managements were formed under the previous  governments in which the SDL had no seats," Schmognerova says.    On the other hand, it would be a sin not to motivate capable  managements by giving them a share in privatization.    "But if managements are not capable it would be better to  replace them," she says.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Directors at Kirin to resign over payments KIRIN Brewery, Japan's largest brewer, said its chairman and two other executives would step down after last week's arrests of four company employees, suspected of paying up to Y33m (Dollars 308,411) to sokaiya, or racketeers. Mr Hideyo Motoyama, chairman, Mr Teruchika Ishii, vice-president, and another executive will resign at the end of this month. The payments are believed to have started after a shareholders' meeting in 1983, which lasted five hours due to questions from the racketeers. The company said it would cut bonus payments for Mr Keisaku Manabe, company president, by 30 per cent, and by 15 per cent for Mr Yasushi Yamamoto, vice-president. Other board members face a 15 per cent cut. Kirin suspended all beer advertisements last week 'for the time being', saying it was wrong to publicise its products at the same time as apologising for the scandal.</p>

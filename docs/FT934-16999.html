			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Malaysia advances to record high INDEX-linked buying of large capital issues prompted short covering, and the Nikkei average advanced in active trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei rose 177.42 to 20,283.13 in volume up from 276m shares to 350m; it fell to the day's low of 20,056.31 in the morning, but gained in tandem with the futures market, hitting a high of 20,328.13 in the afternoon. The market was barely moved on the week. Advances led declines by 689 to 303 with 181 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 7.84 to 1,634.09 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.19 to 1,261.48. Traders said that buying by investment trusts took investors by surprise; they had been expecting the Nikkei to fall below 20,000. Buying by public funds was noted, while the dollar's rise against the yen also supported exporters. Large-capital issues, weak last month on profit-taking ahead of the interim closing of investment books, advanced with NKK up Y3 to Y269 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Y9 to Y653. Investors bought Nippon Telegraph and Telephone which rose Y49,000 to Y880,000. The issue had been previously sold on margin calls and reports of rate cuts. Some issues were bought on the restructuring theme. Isuzu Motors rose Y27 to Y400 and Mazda Motor up Y9 to Y492. High-technology exporters were higher, with Hitachi gaining Y1 to Y820 and NEC rising Y17 to Y969. Retailers lost ground on profit taking, with Ito-Yokado, a leading supermarket chain down Y80 to Y5,380, as did pharmaceuticals, with Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical losing Y40 to Y2,450. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 101.09 to 22,287.86 in volume of 18m shares. The index rose as individuals sought small-capital issues, but lost its impetus towards the close. Roundup SELECTED Pacific Rim markets continued to demonstrate strength, while Hong Kong and Seoul were closed. KUALA LUMPUR extended its recent rise and the composite index added 6.04 to a record high of 859.87, for a 2.6 per cent rise on the week, in volume that dipped to 639.7m from Thursday's 763.4m. Mr Michael Franklin of James Capel noted that the market was supported by expections of an expansionary 1994 budget to be tabled on October 29; forthcoming ruling party elections next month, ahead of the general election in the first half of next year; and the granting of large infrastructure projects, including a second airport, as part of the next five year development plan. He added that other contributory factors included the release by the government of some timber concessions in east Malaysia and the conclusion of business deals in China. The index was helped ahead by strong rises in some of its main components. Genting rose 80 cents or 3.3 per cent to MDollars 25. Renewed US interest was seen in the wake of a Credit Lyonnais roadshow in New York. Among the four featured companies, Ekran firmed MDollars 1.10 to MDollars 14.20, while Telekom Malaysia rose to a high of MDollars 17.60 before closing 10 cents ahead at MDollars 17.30. BANGKOK saw heavy institutional buying of leading stocks lift the SET index 20.90 or 2 per cent to 992.34. However, turnover was thin at Bt4.3bn, as retail investors remained absent on worries over new rules on margin requirements. The market gained 1.3 per cent on the week. AUSTRALIA recovered from early losses and the All Ordinaries index put on 8.3 to 1,972.7 in turnover of ADollars 261.8m, for an improvement of 1.3 per cent on the week. Foster's saw 6.7m shares change hands as the stock ended steady at ADollars 1.33, with strong institutional interest being seen in the brewer. SINGAPORE finished ahead, but off the day's highs, as investors took profits and trimmed positions ahead of the weekend. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 9.08 higher at 2,018.10, 1.7 per cent up on the week. MANILA weakened further as the peso continued to depreciate against the US dollar and foreign investors remained absent. The composite index fell 14.21 to 1,959.55, little changed over the week. Turnover fell back to 476.2m pesos from Thursday's 637.5m pesos. Analysts also noted that there had been some switching out of equities and into Treasury bills on expectations of a rise in interest rates. TAIWAN continued its downward consolidation after Thursday's holiday amid concern about corporate profits and the approach of local government elections at the end of November. The weighted index shed 26.29 to 3,806.40, 1.9 per cent lower over the week, in very slow trade of TDollars 10.44bn.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> A FEAST OF GREAT OYSTERS, TASTY SPEARFISH AND SALMON  </P> <P> Consider the oyster. Food writer M.F.K. Fisher did. And so, for that matter,  does McCormick and Schmick, a new Irvine eatery that serves the best oysters  this side of Puget Sound, plus a variety of other knockout seafood specialties.  Don't be surprised to discover that you are going to have to wait for a table.  </P> <P> The restaurant is the latest member of a chain that originated in the Pacific  Northwest, headed by Bill McCormick and Doug Schmick of Traditional Concepts  Inc. This company owns wholesale fisheries and other related concerns, and the  result is a broad variety of what the company boasts as "impeccably fresh  fish." It may be a silly motto, but the fish are tremendous.  </P> <P> As for those oysters, there they were, gleaming on their bed of crushed ice:  tiny Olympia and fat Kumamoto, salty Quilicene and sweet Skookum, even Golden  Mantle atop their op-art shells. I slurped them up one by one from the oyster  combination platter, unadulterated by lemon or cocktail sauce. I even ignored  the crusty sourdough bread the waiter dumped on our table. The oysters  themselves were so perfect that the meal could have ended then and there.  </P> <P> The meal went on, though, and so did my appetite. Something called rock shrimp  popcorn was wonderful. I smeared them with a tangy remoulade and finished off  the whole basket myself. The house chowder was creamy and overly salted,  brimming with chunks of sweet, deep-sea fish whose names I couldn't quite  place. A vinegary salad of marinated green beans with a red-pepper bacon  dressing had plenty of kick. And the main dishes, Hawaiian spearfish in a  chipotle pepper sauce, and Copper River salmon with bay scallops and cream  sauce, were terrific.  </P> <P> The side dishes that accompany all seafoods -- green asparagus in butter sauce,  and a tiny pasta called semi de mellone (it looks like tiny grains of rice) --  make an amazingly positive impression. Spearfish (a member of the swordfish  family) had the character of a meaty tuna with an oily aftertaste. And Copper  River salmon, pan-fried in sweet butter, was flat-out one of the best things I  have ever tasted: tender, juicy, and subtly perfumed with the rushing waters of  an icy Northwest river.  </P> <P> I tried to think of a better meal I might have had in a San Francisco seafood  emporium but couldn't. Foggy City fish houses are clearly what McCormick and  Schmick tries to emulate, and despite the absence of such classics as Hangtown  fry and oyster stew, they more than bring it off.  </P> <P> One look around the mahogany and beveled-glass dining room and you realize that  it has been designed by a sentimentalist. With its plush booths in little  alcoves, Deco-style, stained-glass lighting fixtures and a long, Hopper-esque  counter beside the grill, it has the charm of a men's club. The only thing  lacking is the patina that you find in a Sam's or a Tadich's.  </P> <P> Naturally, the local glitterati are turning out in force. Both times I dined  there I faced a long line at the podium. Lines will get longer, too. Blame that  on specialties like fine, flaky crab cakes with jalapeno mayonnaise. Or  firm-textured broiled sea bass with Jamaican spices. Or a sumptuously grilled  Ling cod with sauteed Dungeness crab legs, in beurre blanc. The menu changes  daily.  </P> <P> And because the menu is quite lengthy, you don't even have to love seafood to  be happy here. One contingent of white-toqued chefs behind the counter broil  New York steaks and filet mignons while another finishes off marinated chicken,  Cajun cheeseburgers or turkey sandwiches. I tasted several of the grill items.  No complaint.  </P> <P> Now that I've finished raving, there are some imperfections. I ordered crab,  which came elegantly served in a long cocktail glass. The only problem was that  the crab was totally flavorless. A dish called lemon-pepper prawn salad sported  a hefty price, beautiful greens (mache, arugula and butter lettuce) a fine  vinaigrette . . . and big, fat prawns that might as well have been Styrofoam.  And what began life as an intelligent combination of linguine with sweet, smoky  mussels and green asparagus ended it as a big bowl of tasty mush.  </P> <P> Service was spotty, too. The restaurant may be doing a brisk trade, but the  servers don't necessarily have their sea legs. One evening I asked a waitress  to differentiate the oysters on the combination platter for me, and she looked  at me as if I had asked her to recite the "Rime of the Ancient Mariner."  Another evening, my waiter, clearly under time pressure from an overloaded  station, seemed to bristle visibly every time I asked him about a dish. I  assume that the management will soon amend those faults.  </P> <P> The dessert list is nothing much, relying heavily on everyone's assumed  weakness for chocolate. There is chocolate mousse, a dry double-chocolate cake,  a drier chocolate-peanut butter slice, and the one saving grace, a chocolate  truffle torte good enough for seconds. If you don't like chocolate, I recommend  a dozen Olympias. Bring your own Sauternes.  </P> <P> McCormick and Schmick is moderately priced. Lunch and light entrees are $4.95  to $7.95. Appetizers are $2.75 to $8.25. Oysters are $7.50 to $11.90. Soups and  salads are $1.95 to $12.95. Seafood specialties are $9.90 to $18.50. There is a  Chardonnay-dominated wine list printed on the back of the menu card.  </P> <P> McCORMICK AND SCHMICK  </P> <P> 2000 Main St., Irvine  </P> <P> (714) 756-0505  </P> <P> Open Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Saturday, 5 to 11 p.m.; Sunday,  5 to 10 p.m.  </P> <P> All major credit cards accepted  </P></p>

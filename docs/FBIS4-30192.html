			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- The Workers' Party of  Korea publishing house recently brought out the fifth volume of  Part 1 -- Anti-Japanese Revolution of "With the Century",  reminiscences of the great leader President Kim Il-song.    The first four volumes of the reminiscences, already  published, have been widely read among the people at home and  abroad. Vol. 5 covers the historical period from May 1936 to  March 1937 when an epochal upturn was brought about in the  Korean people's glorious history of anti-Japanese revolutionary  struggle.    Printed in the front part of it is a famous handwriting of  President Kim Il-song saying it is the historical lesson from  the hard-fought anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle that the  destiny of the fatherland can be saved only by the united  efforts of the whole nation.    Also edited in it are photographs showing military and  political activities of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army  (KPRA) conducted briskly in the latter half of the 1930s with  the Mt. Paektu secret camp as a stronghold, pictures showing  activities of anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters including  Comrade Kim Chong-suk, an indomitable communist revolutionary  fighter, photos illustrating revolutionary art and publications  created in the flames of the anti-Japanese struggle, and other  valuable materials.    The fifth volume consists of three chapters.    In this volume President Kim Il-song recalls with deep  emotions that the KPRA created guerrilla bases of a new form in  the Mt. Paektu area and conducted brisk military and political  activities in reliance upon them and that the Korean communists  vigorously pushed ahead with the work of building party  organizations at home.    He also recounts his struggle to rally broad sections of  masses around the anti-Japanese national united front under the  banner of great national unity and to form a joint front of the  Korean and the Chinese peoples and deepen militant unity and  fraternity between them in the heat of the bloody struggle  against Japanese imperialism, the common enemy.    The book records significant stories about the revolutionary  traits of Army-civilian unity and unity between officers and men  which were highly displayed among the KPRA and people in those  days, and emotional recollection of the glorious traditions of  the revolutionary literature and art and publications created  then.    Particularly emotional are stories about the noble communist  virtues of President Kim Il-song who showed deep loving care for  and trust in anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters who remained  unfailingly loyal to the cause of national liberation and  brought them up as fine revolutionaries.</p>

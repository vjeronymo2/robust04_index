			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Cream for comfortable cats - Gillian O'Connor surveys the Budget and picks out the good news for top-end investors Kenneth Clarke was suitably modest in his presentation of this week's Budget. Left and right agreed that the chancellor had plenty to be modest about. All the changes that mattered - the big tax increases - had been flagged a year ago. This year's minor concessions are just a way of marking time as cheaply as possible until next year's give-away Budget. So far, so dull. But if you look at the detail of the measures affecting savers and investors (analysed in the next four pages), they are remarkably generous. Comfortable cats should get even plumper - provided they look hard before they guzzle down the cream. The only class of investors which actually suffers is the poor - notably, those canny enough to take advantage of the generous, tax-free, government save-as-you-earn schemes (see page 4). These offered the cognoscenti better rates than most savings accounts - but contributions were limited to Pounds 20 a month. Other blows at the impecunious are the abolition of the National Savings regular savings scheme and the increase in the cost of buying gilts at the post office. The popular, tax-free Tessa savings accounts get an extension; a big mercy for building societies. But the extension will only be welcomed by apathetic savers: Tessas looked attractive when launched, but that was at a time of high interest rates. They are far less attractive now. The most important Budget concessions concern personal equity plans, high-risk investment in very small companies, and pensions. All are interesting, but the concessions on high-risk investment could trap the unwary. And there is a very real danger that the new flexibility for personal pensions could prompt another wave of mis-selling. The proposal to allow Pep investors to put money into corporate bonds, convertibles and EU preference shares (see page 3) is as welcome as it is unexpected. It will be particularly useful to cautious investors interested mainly in a high income. Bonds work very much like gilts, with three significant and connected differences. They have higher yields than the equivalent gilt - that is, both your present income and your eventual total return will be usefully higher than if you invest in a gilt. But - as with an equity share - there is always the possibility that the company issuing the bond will run into trouble and default on either the interest or capital payments. The greater credit risk is why the market values corporate bonds cautiously, and why they yield more. But fans of corporate bonds are arguing already that a portfolio providing a broad spread of bonds can offer a higher yield than one made up of gilts with only a marginally inferior credit risk: if you have a dozen bonds in a fund, the risk of all of the borrowers defaulting is less than the individual risk that each one of them might. (An argument that should not be pushed to excess - as victims of the junk bond collapse in the US would testify). Intelligent use of bonds should make it possible to offer cautious investors a better alternative to building society deposits than products such as guaranteed equity bonds. High-income unit trust managers have already gone into overdrive working out ways to mix and match different bonds. It is always possible that some investors will manage to get into trouble with corporate bonds because they do not understand them or misuse them. It is virtually certain that many investors will get into trouble with the Budget's new concessions for high-risk investment (see page 2). The total tax shield - tax breaks of up to 60 per cent on investments of up to Pounds 200,000 - sounds alluring, but with good reason. Both enterprise investment schemes and venture capital trusts are intrinsically high-risk investments, and many investors will lose some or most of their money. The fact that an investment saves tax is never a good reason for making a bad investment. Many investors fail to understand this, and they are pained when they lose money in ventures that always looked unlikely to succeed - for example, the early business start-up schemes. And even schemes which look relatively solid - such as the residential business expansion schemes - have been known to turn sour. Anyone with Pounds 200,000 of capital gains to invest ought to be able to afford decent financial advice. More vulnerable are ordinary members of company pension schemes. The Budget proposal - to allow pensioners to choose their own moment to swap their pension fund for an annuity (see page 5) - applies only to personal pensions. Already, some hard-nosed salesmen are suggesting that this is another splendid opportunity to persuade members of company pension schemes to transfer to a personal pension. No way.</p>

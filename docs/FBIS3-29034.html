			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Based on the Financial System Reform Act, the trust  bank subsidiaries of Tokyo Bank and the four major securities  companies began operating on 1 October in the second phase of  mutual entry into trust banking by subsidiaries whose parent  companies are in other fields. Due to the prolonged recession  and the restrictions on their scope of activities, the  subsidiaries are entering a harsh environment, and their  prospects for profit are less than bright. However, each parent  company has adopted a long-term strategy and intends, by means  of distinctive management--providing new trust services,  etc.--to meet diversifying trust needs and expand the market.  <H5>  The First Group of Entrants Includes Five Companies </H5>   The trust bank subsidiaries of Tokyo Bank and the four major  securities companies began operating on 1 October.    The procedures that the parent companies followed in  establishing their subsidiaries included the following: On 11  August they obtained unofficial authorization from the Ministry  of Finance for establishing a trust bank. On 24 August they  obtained authorization for a special-case subsidiary  [tokurei kogaisha] in accordance with the Banking  Act, and authorization for a special-approval company  [tokunin kaisha] in accordance with the Antitrust  Act. On 3 September they obtained, from the banking industry, a  license as well as authorization to operate a trust bank as a  secondary business. With this, the legal procedures were  completed. One thing that should be noted is that, in connection  with authorizing the trust bank subsidiaries of the securities  companies to conduct foreign exchange activities, the Ministry  of Finance decided to authorize the full line of those  activities.    Let's look at the starting size of each subsidiary as  measured by its capital and number of employees. The smallest of  the subsidiaries is Tokyo Trust Bank, with capital of 10 billion  yen and 21 employees. According to the bank's president, Hiroshi  Hayashi, "With regard to banking activities, we are a step ahead  of the securities companies' trust banks as far as skill and  know-how go, and we are concentrating on the services that are  our strong suit." As small as this bank is, it is functioning  well.    The biggest of the trust bank subsidiaries is Nomura Trust  &amp;  Banking, with capital of 30 billion yen and 71 employees. As  mentioned below, this company claims that its strong suit is  foreign exchange activities, for which it has an appropriately  large number of employees.    The reason that each company has invested a liberal amount  of  capital is to balance the poor profit prospects with financial  services. Initially, the capital for the securities companies'  subsidiaries was planned at 1-2 billion yen. However, activities  such as tokkin [specified money trusts], which were  prospectively regarded as main sources of income, ended up not  being authorized, as a result of which the capital was increased.    On this point, the difference between trust bank  subsidiaries  and securities subsidiaries might be mentioned. In the latter  category, IBJ [Industrial Bank of Japan] Securities started with  capital of 25 billion yen and 138 employees. At this company, as  well as at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan [LTCB] Securities, the  proportion of capital to number of employees was only about 200  million/person, whereas it was more than double this, 400-500  million yen/person, at the trust bank subsidiaries. This clearly  shows the difference between business based on transaction  commissions and business based on managing assets.    The staffs at the trust bank subsidiaries are composed  mainly  of young people who have experience conducting trust activities  according to foreign laws and who have been sent to trust banks  for training. They also include some people who were lured away  from major trust banks. The opinion has been expressed that it  will be necessary to increase the number of personnel when the  regulations on the scope of activities are relaxed. At present,  however, any movement towards increase is extremely cautious.  What seems the prevailing attitude was expressed by Akira  Kiyokawa, president of Nomura Trust &amp; Banking, who said, "We  have no intention of increasing our staff to 200-300 people.  Rather, we will seek to increase the specialization of each of  our people so as to form an organization of specialists."    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Outline of the Five Trust Bank Subsidiaries at the Time of Their Establis-|  |hment                                                                     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Name          |Representative|Employees     |Capital (yen) |Main Activiti-|  |              |              |              |              |es            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tokyo Trust B-|Hiroshi Hayas-|21            |10 billion    |Fund trusts,  |  |ank           |hi            |              |              |monetary clai-|  |              |              |              |              |ms in trust   |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nomura Trust  |Akira Kiyokawa|71            |30 billion    |Foreign excha-|  |Bank          |              |              |              |nge activitie-|  |              |              |              |              |s, investment |  |              |              |              |              |trusts, fund  |  |              |              |              |              |trusts        |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Daiwa Interna-|Katsuhiko Fuj-|76            |20 billion    |Fund trusts,  |  |tional Trust  |imoto         |              |              |investment tr-|  |Bank          |              |              |              |usts          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nikko Trust B-|Tsutomu Yamas-|48            |20 billion    |Fund trusts,  |  |ank           |hita          |              |              |investment tr-|  |              |              |              |              |usts          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yamaichi Trus-|Yoshinobu Iso-|56            |20 billion    |Investment tr-|  |t Bank        |kawa          |              |              |usts          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Limiting Main Activities </H5>   The scope of the activities of the first trust banks since  the new law went into effect is extremely narrow. It includes  banking activities, of course, as well as securities investment  trusts, fund trusts, non-monetary trusts (except real estate  trusts whose purpose is the disposal of trust property), public  trusts, special donation trusts, etc.    According to Yoshinobu Isokawa, President of Yamaichi Trust  Bank, "The fact that some of the activities--tokkin, shiteitan  [the portion of postal savings and postal insurance funds  designated for stock investment], etc.--that we wanted to  include among our main activities were not even partially  authorized is extremely painful to us in terms of nurturing the  skills we need." Dissatisfaction on this point is strong.    Therefore, each of the companies has limited its main  activities to ones with earning power, and set up a small staff  of elite employees. In this way, each hopes to maintain profit  and bring its own distinctive brand of activities management to  the fore.    One of the activities common [to the new trust banks] is  fund  trusts. The four securities companies all mentioned securities  investment trust deposits. About fund trusts, President Hayashi  said they are "an interest-bearing item, an internationally  diversified investment, a foreign exchange hedge-type of  mid-risk, mid-return," whereas Tsutomu Yamashita, president of  Nikko Trust Bank, said, "We offer a custom-made type of  exclusive portfolio." Thus, everybody has a different emphasis.  As regards securities investment trust deposits, "Japan's  investment trust balance is one-fourth that of the United  States," said Katsuhiko Fujimoto, president of Daiwa  International Trust Bank; "future growth can certainly be  expected. This is a field that our know-how can invigorate."  This company aims to get investment trust deposits not only from  within the Daiwa group, but also from foreign companies.    Activities related to monetary claims in trust are naturally  one of the main activities of Tokyo Trust. What is drawing  attention, however, is that Yamaichi Trust is also looking into  them. In the case of Tokyo Trust, there are the claims of the  parent bank and of the group, so it is easy to imagine Tokyo  Trust undertaking these activities. As for Yamaichi Trust,  President Isokawa said, "We will offer a mechanism that raises  capital by converting installment sales claims ["kappu saiken"]  to trust beneficiary rights." As this indicates, the target of  these activities stretches from nonbanks to general  corporations. For Yamaichi Trust, the key seems to lie in  whether it can make use of the Yamaichi group's reported  strength among corporate customers.    Nomura Trust &amp; Banking is the only trust bank  subsidiary that  mentioned foreign exchange activities as a main activity. The  decision whether to conduct these activities hinges on whether  the company is able and willing to maintain the needed system  and number of employees. For the time being, Nomura Trust &amp;  Banking will mainly handle the foreign exchange that occurs  within the Nomura group. As to whether the companies in the  group choose Nomura Trust &amp; Banking or their current banks,  "It's fine with me if they make their decision on a commercial  basis; otherwise, we won't grow," President Kiyokawa said with  clarity and dignity.    One of the conditions stipulated by the Ministry of Finance  for authorizing companies to establish not only trust bank  subsidiaries but any subsidiary in a different field than that  of the parent company is that, by its third year, the subsidiary  must be operating in the black based on its current-term profit.  Therefore, the fact that each of the five parent companies is  claiming that its trust bank subsidiary "will be in the black  after three years" is only natural. They are also saying that it  will take an additional year or two to fully eliminate the  accumulated loss.  <H5>  Expectations From Relaxation of Regulations on Tokkin </H5>   Now then, what do the various companies expect from the  relaxation of the regulations governing the scope of their  activities--said to be two to three years off?    According to President Yamashita, "Not only will there be an  increase in the activities that we can conduct, but convenience  to the customer will also improve markedly. I definitely want  the relaxation of regulations to quickly become a reality." This  opinion is widely shared. The need for relaxed regulations is  particularly strong with regard to tokkin, which, due to  relations with the parent company, will immediately become one  of the activities of the trust bank subsidiaries.    On the other hand, loan trusts--one of the main activities  of  existing trust banks--are not popular among the trust bank  subsidiaries. As President Isokawa said, "We are not thinking of  entering retail activities, now or in the future." Nor is there  currently any thought of engaging in such activities as land  trusts, which require activities related to real estate, or  annuity trusts, which require that specialists in actuaries,  etc., be maintained. The activities strategies of the trust bank  subsidiaries are unexpectedly not predicated on a relationship  of competition with the existing trust banks. According to  President Hayashi, "Trust banks have functions that enable them  to offer even more services than now." And, according to  President Isokawa, "In the financial field, trust banks should  aim at activities other than those related to loans." Emphasis  is thus being put on answering the needs that the existing trust  banks are not adequately addressing.    A fair argument about financial system reform is that the  relaxation of regulations and what activities a company conducts  should be two different things. Ideally, the full line of  activities will be allowed, and companies will be able to  choose, according to their individual strategies, the ones at  which they are best. However, the shadow of the existing trust  banks is looming behind the Ministry of Finance, so there is no  guarantee that things will progress according to what's fair.  This is cause for concern among the new trust bank subsidiaries.    At the present stage, it is difficult to predict how the  relaxation of regulations will be decided. However, it can  probably be said that at least the vector along which the  activities of the trust bank subsidiaries are developing is  conforming to the spirit of financial system reform. There would  be nothing strange if the newcomers tried to hold the existing  trust banks in check by saying, "If the market weren't growing,  it would be a different story; but given how the market is, the  existing trust banks are guarding it too closely."    Each of the trust bank subsidiaries has expressed the  intention of joining the Trust Companies Association. However,  there is a problem: "the rent is too high."    The "rent" is several tens of millions of yen a year for  members (seven companies exclusively engaged in trust banking  and Daiwa Bank) and about 5 million yen a year for semi-members  (nine foreign trust banks). The trust bank subsidiaries, who are  resigned to being in the red for the first year or two,  undoubtedly have considerable resistance to paying such a large  sum. If they are unable to make it into the black after three  years because of the "rent," it will be too ironic for tears.    A contention of the trust bank subsidiaries is that "since  the scope of our activities is restricted, the amount of our  `rent' should be proportionately reduced." At present,  discussions between the association and the individual trust  bank subsidiaries are continuing. When this magazine went to  press, it seemed that the problem would be resolved. It would  only be natural if some special measures or some time-limited  measures were taken for the trust bank subsidiaries.    The five companies in this first group of new entrants into  trust banking field have waited long to enter the field. They  have thus had plenty of time to clarify their strategies, and so  are expected to develop their activities in a way that makes the  most of their individual characteristics.    As for other financial institutions that intend to establish  trust bank subsidiaries, the National Society of Credit  Associations is in the midst of preparing an application aimed  at establishing one by next April, and the Japan Credit Bank is  carrying out studies preliminary to establishing one.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GWYNN TO GET MORE TESTS ON FINGER  </P> <P> Padre outfielder Tony Gwynn didn't want to speculate on the severity of the  injury to his right index finger Sunday after returning to San Diego.  </P> <P> Gwynn fractured the tip of the finger during a 5-3 Padre victory in Atlanta  Saturday night.  </P> <P> "I might be able to play, I might miss the rest of the season, I might need an  operation," Gwynn said in local television interview. "We really don't know,  because the X-rays I brought back from Atlanta don't tell the whole story."  </P> <P> Gwynn will undergo further tests today at Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, after  X-rays there Sunday confirmed the fracture. A Padre spokesman said a CAT scan  will be performed to reveal whether Gwynn sustained any damage to the first  joint of the finger.  </P> <P> The outcome of that examination is likely to determine his status for the rest  of the season. The spokesman said Gwynn will either rejoin the Padres when they  open a series in Los Angeles Wednesday or be lost for the season.  </P> <P> The injury occured in the third inning Saturday when Gwynn tried to catch Jeff  Treadway's fly ball against the right-field wall at Atlanta-Fulton County  Stadium. Gwynn said the tip of the finger cracked when he slammed his right  hand into the wall. He left the game immediately and was taken to a hospital  for X-rays.  </P></p>

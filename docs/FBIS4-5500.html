			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Barring a "big stumble,"  Japan's struggling economy is set to improve as bright signs  emerge, economic planning chief Manae Kubota said Tuesday [12  April].    Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency  (EPA), also told a regular news conference that Bank of Japan  Governor Yasushi Mieno informed a morning meeting of economic  ministers the economy is in a "delicate" phase, with recovery  prospects still vulnerable. Noting that her agency's new  monthly report cited some areas of "brightness" in the still  "broadly sluggish" economy, Kubota cited such factors as  improving corporate sentiment and consumption, with strong  housing investment and higher purchases of durable goods and  small cars. "If there is not a big stumble, the economy is  headed in a good direction," she said. She cited such possible  pitfalls as slack public works implementation due to the current  political turmoil.    She quoted Mieno, who has also recently spoken of increasing  bright signs in the economy, as citing such causes of  uncertainty as domestic long- and short-term money market rates,  as well as big changes in the U.S. stock and bond markets.  Mieno said Japan's money supply growth remains weak as slack  corporate demand for funding discourages banks from lending,  according to Kubota.    She said the central bank chief also noted recent movements  in various market rates, saying that the yield on 10-year  government bonds briefly rose above 4.2 percent on worries over  the high yen and a drop in stock prices. But he noted the  unsecured overnight call-money rate remains "extremely low," she  said. He cited recent moves by the Japanese currency up to 102  to the dollar, back to around 105 and again to the 103 level,  but the EPA chief said Mieno offered no comment on the moves.    Reflecting these uncertainties, long-term market rates have  been showing "unstable" movements, trying to settle at levels  that reflect economic conditions, Kubota quoted Mieno as saying.  For her own economic outlook, Kubota cited an improving global  trend, with U.S. and European economies brightening this year  and most of Asia remaining strong. She also said that if this  year's Japanese tax cuts are implemented as smoothly as planned,  they could give an extra boost to an economy struggling to  rebound. But she expressed concern about continued worsening  trends in employment, citing a record high 3.18 percent  unemployment rate for women in Japan.</p>

Since January 1994, the committee has been meeting bi-monthly rather than quarterly. Because the committee will review all RTF decisions rather than only a few, new drug application (NDA) applicants will not need to submit requests for review.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Janet M. Jones, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD&hyph;2), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;594&hyph;6740. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  FDA regulations on filing applications, including grounds and procedures for refusals to file, are found in 21 CFR 314.101. In the past, some review divisions in CDER have refused to file applications only where the deficiencies were extreme, e.g., the total omission of a section required by 21 CFR 314.50, or the absence of any study even arguably adequate and well controlled, while others have applied this regulation more broadly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 18, 1993 (58 FR 28983), FDA announced the establishment and first regular meeting of a standing committee in CDER to conduct periodic review of CDER's RTF procedure. CDER established the RTF review committee to periodically review RTF decisions to assess their scientific and procedural quality. The RTF review committee consists of senior CDER officials, a senior official from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and FDA's Chief Mediator and Ombudsman. The committee reviews, among other things, the consistency of RTF practices across new drug evaluation offices and divisions, the need for additional guidance on NDA content and format, and the need to modify FDA's RTF policy. The committee was established on a 1-year trial basis and scheduled to meet quarterly for that year. The committee has held two pilot meetings and several regular meetings since the publication of that notice. For each of the pilot meetings and for the first two of the regular meetings, FDA invited NDA applicants to use the committee's confidential mechanism to request review of any RTF decision during the preceding 12 months. RTF decisions reviewed by the committee were chosen for review by the Office of the FDA Chief Mediator and Ombudsman through a combination of random selection and selection from among those submitted by NDA applicants for review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RTF review committee has decided to change its procedures from those presented in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 18, 1993 (58 FR 28983). Since January 1994, the committee has been meeting every other month (six times a year) and reviews all the RTF decisions that CDER makes, rather than only some of them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are two primary reasons for this change. One reason is that the number of applications with RTF decisions each month has decreased over the past year, so that it is feasible for the committee to review all such applications rather than only selected applications. The second reason is that RTF decisions have additional effects related to user fees. Under section 736(a)(1)(D) of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (21 U.S.C. &sect;379h(a)(1)(D)), FDA is authorized to retain 25 percent of the total user fee assessed for each NDA that is refused for filing. If the agency incorrectly refuses to file an application, the error needs to be promptly identified and corrected, so that the application may be filed and a review initiated, and the retained fees may be returned to the applicant. The review of all RTF decisions on a bimonthly basis will allow the agency to identify incorrect RTF decisions and take corrective measures in a timely manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this new procedure, NDA applicants will no longer need to submit requests for committee review to the Office of the Chief Mediator and Ombudsman. Applicants may continue to contact that office, however, to discuss concerns regarding refusal to file and other issues, as needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The committee believes that this change in its approach to reviewing RTF decisions will facilitate the agency's efforts to promote the timely, efficient, and consistent review of NDA's. After 1 year, the value of the bimonthly committee review of all RTF applications will be assessed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the committee's deliberations will deal with confidential commercial information, the RTF review meetings are closed to the public. Summaries of the committee's deliberations, excluding all such confidential commercial information, will be available from the FDA Chief Mediator and Ombudsman. If, following the committee's review, an RTF decision changes, the reviewing division will notify the applicant of the change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William K.

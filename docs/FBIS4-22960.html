			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the ``Current Problems'' rubric: </F> ``At Board Meeting of Russian Federation Fuel and Energy  Ministry'']    [Text] The results of the work of the sectors of the fuel  and energy complex in the first half of this year and the tasks  for the second half of the year were examined. It was noted that  the situation in these sectors is critical and is continuing to  get more acute.    The amounts of fuel and energy resources recovered and  produced have been decreasing for a long time. According to the  Russian State Committee on Statistics [Goskomstat], the total  volume of industrial production at enterprises of the fuel and  energy complex in the first half of the year has decreased (in  prices comparable with the very same period last year) by 13.8  percent. In 1992, the decrease amounted to 11.3 percent. The  greatest decreases were in recovery of oil and gas condensate  (13.9 percent), production of gasolines for motor vehicles (14.4  percent), and production of diesel fuel (15.4 percent).    The operation of individual enterprises in the complex and  in  its sectors as a whole has been paralyzed by the acute financial  crisis. Market offerings of fuel and energy resources often  surpass the demand of customers capable of paying for them. As a  result, oil refineries have become overstocked with petroleum  products, especially mazut, and have stopped accepting oil for  refining. This has forced a cutback in oil recovery and the  shutdown of operational wells. The provision of petroleum  products for harvest operations in a number of regions and the  creation of winter fuel reserves and fuel shipments to rayons in  the Far North are danger of being interrupted.    Because of big flaws in price and tax policy, the complex's  enterprises cannot form their own financial sources to develop  production under the conditions of a market economy. Clear-cut  proposals regarding changing the ratio of prices for energy  resources and processing sector's products, reducing the tax  component in fuel and energy prices, and taking measures to  provide tax incentives for priority directions of the activity  of fuel and energy complex enterprises have yet to be formulated.    Industry's investment complex is under the threat of  collapse. In January through June of this year, very important  construction jobs were financed at only 12.5 percent of the  approved annual limit of budgetary allocations. The anticipated  start-up of production facilities and facilities in the social  sphere has been estimated to be 10-30 percent below the last  year's level and will not exceed 50 percent of their 1988 level.  Because of their high interest rate, government-issued loans are  unacceptable for financing new construction or reconstruction  and modernization of very important facilities.    The board approved a plan of action that included a broad  set  of measures: development and consideration by the Russian  Federation government of a draft decision regarding a mechanism  for giving priority to development of the sectors of fuel and  energy complex and its state support partly by budgetary  financing, investments in very important construction projects,  and retention of unappropriated regulation funds for 1994-1995  (obtained by deductions from product production costs).    Also very important are steps such as developing the  conceptual principles of a pricing policy for the fuel and  energy complex's products and accelerating the Russian  Government's consideration of the drafts of the laws  ``Concerning Oil and Gas,'' ``Concerning the Foundations of a  Federal Energy Policy,'' and ``Concerning Energy Conservation''  and the special federal program Fuel and Energy.    According to the approved plan, special emphasis is to be  placed on the need for quick consideration in the Russian  Federation Council of Ministers of proposals to reduce the tax  rate on the sale of fuel and lubricant materials to 10 percent.    In accordance with the board's decision, a rush report  regarding the critical financial situation of the complex's  enterprises will be sent to V.S. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the  Russian Council of Ministers. The report will include an urgent  request for his personal intervention in speeding up resolution  of the fundamental questions regarding stabilizing the situation  in the complex's sector.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong Political tensions between Hong Kong and China may have been enough to unnerve the stock market earlier this year, but they are having little impact now. Indeed, negotiations over elections are not much further on than when shares were only two-thirds their current value. In part that may be because investors suspect Governor Patten may back down and because economic conditions are still favourable. The brakes may have been applied to the overheating Chinese economy, but only 4 per cent of the colony's pre-tax profits come directly from there. Hong Kong, meanwhile, is still growing strongly. Liquidity is also powering the rally, as this week's intervention to hold the Hong Kong dollar down to its US dollar peg suggests. Other markets in the region are also hitting highs and the interest of US funds is well documented. Japanese investors have also moved overseas as the perception grows that the yen has peaked. Almost Dollars 4bn worth of overseas assets were bought by the Japanese in the first eight months of the year - more than in the whole of 1992 and including some Dollars 1.9bn in August alone. Such liquidity can underpin markets for many months. Hong Kong equities are trading at around 13 times projected 1994 earnings - about the top of a normal trading range, but still reasonable by international standards. On the cash-flow measure popular with US investors, however, valuations look more stretched.</p>

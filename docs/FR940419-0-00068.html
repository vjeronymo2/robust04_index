			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To respond to these concerns, we have made significant reductions in the proposed rule's certification requirements. Under the final rule, all Superfund contractors are required to submit certifications, but they are no longer required to submit both annual and work assignment certifications. In addition, the requirement for work plan certifications has been eliminated, and the number of work assignment certifications has been reduced. Under the final rule, a work assignment certification is required within 20 days from the time the contractor receives a work assignment. If a subsequent work assignment is issued to the contractor under the same contract for additional work at the same site(s) covered by the initial work assignment, an additional certification for the new work assignment is not required. This is not intended to relieve the contractor from reporting any future conflicts of interest relating to the site(s). The contractor will still be expected to search and report any conflicts of interest based upon new information which has been identified. These certification changes will significantly reduce the burden on contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 38. Multiple Sites Under Work Assignments, Addition of Sites to a Work Assignment and the Allocation of Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter expressed concern that since sites and PRPs may be added to the work assignments during performance, contractors cannot certify at the work assignment acceptance phase that all conflicts have been disclosed. This concern also applies to a multi-site work assignment where sites are identified as the work arises. The commenter also expressed concern about the recovery of costs incurred for records retention pertaining to sites under multi-site contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The work assignment clause requires that the contractor certify to the best of its knowledge and belief that all conflicts of interest have been reported or that no conflicts of interest exist. We recognize that all site and PRP information may not be available at the time of the certification, which under the final rule is 20 days after the contractor receives the work assignment. If a site is added to the work assignment after the certification is submitted, a subsequent certification is not required for the additional site. The certification includes a statement that the contractor recognizes its continuing obligation to identify and report any conflicts arising during performance of the work assignment pertaining to all sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allowable costs associated with work performed under the contract, including records retention pertaining to sites, shall be allocated consistent with the contractor's cost accounting system. Since work assignments are so diverse, questions concerning the proper allocability of costs on a specific work assignment should be directed to the Contracting Officer. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

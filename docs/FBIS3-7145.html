			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of  Korea in a statement today bitterly denounced the Kim Yong-sam  group's dangerous criminal acts to provoke a nuclear war in  conspiracy with outside forces as a heinous treachery to plunge  the Korean nation into a nuclear scourge.    The statement says:    "The South Korean authorities are heading for reckless  confrontation with fellow countrymen, totally denying  North-South dialogue. This is an extension of the anti-DPRK,  anti-socialist campaign they have consistently waged with the  imperialist reactionaries.    "No sooner had they brought the working-level contact for  the  exchange of presidential envoys to a rupture than they kicked up  a big fuss as a servant of foreign forces in the anti-DPRK,  anti-socialist campaign, by issuing a `special alert order'  throughout South Korea, calling their master on the phone,  sending a letter to him and making mendicant trips to do harm to  fellow countrymen.    "The reality shows that with the flunkeyist traitor left  within the nation, our fellow countrymen cannot live in peace  nor can they think of the peace and peaceful reunification of  the country and the nation will inevitably suffer a scourge of  war.    "We regard it humiliating to have the traitor within the  nation. We will never tolerate his treacheries.    "The traitor Kim Yong-sam must clearly know that he will  never be able to escape the blame for the consequences of his  dependence on outside forces and flunkeyism against fellow  countrymen."</p>

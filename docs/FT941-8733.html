			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Electricity price curbs announced Two more regional electricity companies have responded to last week's price-capping agreement by the power generators. Yorkshire Electricity said it would freeze prices for domestic and smaller business customers from April. It also said it was passing on the benefits of lower prices to big electricity users. London Electricity said its cuts would average 1 per cent to 2 per cent for business customers using more than 100kWh a year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Winsbury Company (Winsbury), located in Columbus, Ohio, serves as the general manager, administrator, and principal underwriter of HighMark. For these administrative services, Winsbury receives fees computed daily at .20% of the average net assets of each portfolio of HighMark. Winsbury also receives fees from HighMark for serving as the distributor of shares in HighMark. Pursuant to a plan of distribution implemented only with respect to the Class A shares for the Money Market Portfolios, HighMark pays out of the assets attributable to such shares monthly fees to Winsbury in accordance with Rule 12b&hyph;1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 12b&hyph;1 Fees) equal to .25% of the average daily net assets attributable to such shares. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An affiliate of Winsbury, the Winsbury Service Corporation (Winsbury Service), is the transfer agent, accountant, and shareholder servicing agent of HighMark.

The Department notes that proposed relief is limited to the transactions described herein, and no relief has been provided in connection with the payment of distribution expenses, pursuant to Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Investment Company Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Because the Bank recognizes that (1) in-kind transfers to Funds that the Bank services or advises of all or a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> portion of Plan assets in the CIFs or all or a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> portion of Plan assets that the Bank otherwise manages, and (2) the approval process for additional services for which a fee is charged and fee increases by the Bank for these services may be outside the scope of PTCE 77&hyph;4, the Bank has requested relief for the transactions described in section I and II. Each of these transactions is discussed more fully in paragraphs 6, 7, 8, and 9 below. The exemption for each of the transactions involving HighMark is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain requirements and compliance with various general conditions which are also discussed below. It is the Bank's expressed intention that the description of these transactions and the conditions of the requested exemption with respect to such transactions were and will be applicable uniformly to HighMark and to any of the other Funds for which the Bank serves as the investment advisor and in which the Plans invest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> In-Kind Transfers to Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

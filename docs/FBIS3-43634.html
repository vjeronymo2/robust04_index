Speaking at  the closing session of yet another course for commandos of the  Angolan Armed Forces, the defense minister accused the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] of wanting to  Balkanize the country.    [Begin Pedale recording] In view of its thirst for power and  ambition, UNITA has launched a number of military operations  greatly affecting our people as a whole. With its warmongering  actions, UNITA has killed thousands of Angolans. Such actions  prevent the free movement of people and goods, leading to  famine, misery, and malnutrition of Angolans. UNITA's dream is  to Balkanize Angola. Likewise, UNITA's actions prevent the  government from implementing its program to raise the standard  of living of Angolans and to establish democratic institutions.  [end recording]    The defense minister said UNITA is opposed to democracy. All  it wants is to subjugate the people by the force of arms.    [Begin Pedale recording] Another aspect of UNITA's  activities  is its irresponsible handling of the peace talks with the  government. As we all know, UNITA is not interested in true  peace for Angola. UNITA only wants to seize power by force of  arms and then establish a dictatorship, because UNITA is aware  that Angolans have rejected its rule at the ballot box. [end  recording]    Meanwhile, Lieutenant General Marcos Garcia Mbanza,  commander  of the Moxico Military Region, yesterday said UNITA is moving  troops and military equipment to attack positions of the  government armed forces and the residents. Lt. Gen. Mbanza  reminded Jonas Savimbi's warmongering movement that Luena is and  will always be a UNITA graveyard should the Black Cockerel's  forces dare to attack that city. Right now UNITA's activities  consist of abducting civilians, mining main roads, and stealing  civilian property.</p>

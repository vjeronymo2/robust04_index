			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Brazilians turn blind eye to budget: Presidential candidates ignore fiscal forecast Brazil has never been renowned for sticking to budgets, which partly explains the country's inflation problems. So, when President Itamar Franco announced recently that all the candidates for October's presidential elections would be called to a special preview of next year's budget, economists began to wonder if the years of fiscal indiscipline were over. The idea, according to Mr Franco, was to show candidates the government's cash shortage and stress that the incoming president must keep control of spending to add credibility to the country's new currency, the Real. Unfortunately, when the meeting went ahead yesterday, none of the candidates turned up. Instead they sent lowly campaign officials who mumbled apologies about their bosses being 'very busy' electioneering. After all, elections in Brazil involve spending money to win votes, not worrying about where it comes from. The episode does not mean candidates do not care about the economy. The Real, launched in July, has brought monthly inflation down from 50 per cent to less than 5 per cent and has a good chance of keeping it there. This has helped poorer voters, who have switched support to Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former economy minister, who oversaw the Real's introduction. What it does show, however, is Brazil's traditional disregard for budgets or spending promises. Brazilians are amazed by the pomp, and credibility, which surrounds budgets in other countries. This is partly for historical reasons; under the military governments of 1964-85, budgets were often works of fiction which concealed investments in secret or strategic projects. Since the return to democracy, budgets need approval in Congress, where they are changed beyond recognition as politicians seek to divert money to pet, and sometimes corrupt, projects. Brazil is currently without a budget. This year's one was drawn up 13 months ago but has still not been approved by Congress, the longest delay this century. Without a budget the government is only allowed to spend a fraction of its commitments each month. This may appear a strange way to run a country. But it allows the government to hinder Congress adding spending amendments to the budget. The government claims its unapproved budget will balance, although no one knows whether this is true. But if congressmen were allowed to add amendments, especially ahead of elections, the budget would certainly go into deficit, undermining the Real and adding to inflation.</p>

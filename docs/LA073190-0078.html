			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR: WIN COULD HURT EASTERN STRIKERS  </P> <P> Embattled strikers at Eastern Airlines won a nice little psychological victory  last week, but it could end up doing them more harm than good.  </P> <P> The victory came when a federal grand jury indicted the airline and 10 former  and current Eastern managers on criminal conspiracy charges, alleging that they  put the lives of passengers at risk by keeping fraudulent maintenance and  safety records.  </P> <P> The indictments mirrored long-ignored charges by the employees' unions, the  International Assn. of Machinists and the Air Line Pilots Assn.  </P> <P> And government officials are stressing that the Eastern investigation, headed  by Andrew Maloney, the U.S. Attorney in New York, is not over.  </P> <P> That means that it may finally involve the man the union workers hate most:  Frank Lorenzo, head of Eastern's parent, Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.  Neither Lorenzo nor other top Eastern executives were indicted.  </P> <P> Government agencies responsible for airline safety had generally dismissed the  unions' charges as labor propaganda.  </P> <P> Even more reprehensible was former Transportation Secretary James Burnley, a  Reagan appointee who repeatedly accused Eastern's unions of playing politics  with their charges. Finally, his department gave Eastern a clean bill of health  on safety just four months before he resigned his post to join a law firm  representing Lorenzo.  </P> <P> But the grand jury vindication of the unions' allegations won't end the long,  bitter strike against Eastern, which is still owned mostly by Lorenzo, one of  the nation's most ruthless anti-union executives.  </P> <P> Instead, the grand jury's action might make it more difficult for Northwest  Airlines Chairman Alfred Checchi or someone like him to rescue the strikers by  buying part or all of Eastern.  </P> <P> Checchi is in discussions with Eastern and its creditors' advisers about  Northwest taking over some of Eastern's assets and then helping sell other  parts of the company.  </P> <P> It could be a good buy because Eastern still has valuable assets, especially  its gates and routes in the Southeast.  </P> <P> But if Eastern is maintained as a separate airline, a buyer will have to  overcome the damaging publicity that goes along with those criminal  indictments, in addition to the problems caused by continuing labor turmoil at  Eastern.  </P> <P> And waiting in the wings are the Eastern pilots, who claim that they have  evidence for the grand jury showing that there was a cover-up of past unsafe  practices in the actual flying of the planes.  </P> <P> So far, the grand jury investigation has dealt only with alleged unsafe  maintenance of planes while they were on the ground.  </P> <P> However, if the pilots succeed in proving their allegation, it might make  Eastern even less attractive to Checchi or some other buyer.  </P> <P> The last union victory came a few months ago when a bankruptcy judge kicked  Lorenzo out as Eastern's chief executive. It was a move the unions had demanded  because Lorenzo provoked the machinists' strike by demanding drastic wage and  benefit cuts after the workers had already accepted substantial reductions.  </P> <P> Then Lorenzo "permanently replaced" most of the strikers and the pilots and  flight attendants who honored the machinists' picket lines.  </P> <P> Soon after the machinists went on strike in March, 1989, Lorenzo put Eastern  into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy to stave off creditors, keep the airline flying  and break the unions.  </P> <P> The ouster of Lorenzo was the first labor victory in the long dispute, and  things looked even better for the strikers when the court appointed Martin  Shugrue as trustee to run the company.  </P> <P> Known as an executive who worked well with unionized workers, Shugrue promised  to make compromises with the unions to end the strike and bring labor peace to  the troubled airline.  </P> <P> But negotiations stalled quickly because no way has been found to end the  dispute since Shugrue so far has refused to get rid of the strikebreakers and  rehire the strikers that Lorenzo still insists have been "permanently  replaced."  </P> <P> At present, only the machinists are officially on strike; they struck March 4,  1989. But now the pilots are threatening to call their own strike because  contract negotiations are deadlocked over the issue of the strikebreakers.  </P> <P> The best way out of Eastern's current mess would be for the unions and Shugrue  to agree on new contracts, which would be possible if Shugrue rehires Eastern's  experienced employees who have fought and sacrificed so long in their battle  against Lorenzo's unrelenting union-busting tactics.  </P> <P> Ending the labor war would make it easier to sell the company and possibly  merge it with another airline, such as Northwest.  </P> <P> One tangible gain for the unions did come out of the grand jury indictments  against Eastern and some of its officers.  </P> <P> Although their allegations of dangerous safety practices had been ignored by  the Department of Transportation and most other government agencies, Lorenzo  took them seriously.  </P> <P> He filed a $1.5-billion suit against the unions, complaining that their  allegations were lies meant to smear the company's name and frighten passengers  away.  </P> <P> His lawsuit has been weakened badly if not destroyed by the grand jury  indictments, since they support the unions' charges.  </P> <P> Even before that suit and the unions' countersuits are dropped, though, Shugrue  and the unions must concentrate on getting contract agreements that would  settle the long labor dispute.  </P> <P> The removal of picket lines and the return of experienced Eastern workers to  their jobs in the air and on the ground could help make a success of the  company's costly advertising campaign to reassure the traveling public about  Eastern's safety.  </P> <P> And that, in turn, should make Eastern a good deal for any prospective buyer.  </P></p>

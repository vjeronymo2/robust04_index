			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / British Coal rounds on critics over lost sales BRITISH COAL yesterday rejected criticism that it had lost an opportunity to sell large quantities of coal to ScottishPower when it responded to the electricity generation and supply company's request for coal supply quotations. ScottishPower had asked coal producers to quote for the supply of 250,000 tonnes and indicated that it would consider buying further quantities if the price was right. Last week it agreed to buy 250,000 tonnes from British Coal and awarded contracts for 100,000 tonnes from private Scottish opencast mines, plus 840,000 tonnes from suppliers in Australia, Poland, the former Soviet Union and the US. When ScottishPower's orders were announced, British Coal said that if it had known the electricity company was interested in buying more than 250,000 tonnes it would have tendered accordingly. ScottishPower said the tender document stated that it was prepared to buy more than the basic tonnage and that it used the same wording as previous tenders. In a 1991 tender, British Coal's offer of more than ScottishPower had requested was accepted. Yesterday Mr Malcolm Edwards, who resigned as British Coal's marketing director earlier this year after a disagreement with Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of the company, said: 'This is a very important bit of business which is unlikely to recur.' British Coal was unable to confirm yesterday that it had several hundred thousand tonnes of opencast coal stockpiled on the surface in Scotland which could have been sold to ScottishPower. It will anyway supply ScottishPower with 2.5m tonnes of coal this year under contracts running to 1995. Pit of despair, Page 21</p>

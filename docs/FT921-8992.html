			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Investment study shows gap between US and UK A STUDY of how institutional investors in the UK and US invest in continental equities reveals marked differences between the two centres. The survey was carried out late last year by Makinson Cowell, the investor relations consultancy, and the Financial Times. It covered 96 internationally-minded fund management firms, with an average portfolio size of about Dollars 10bn. To judge a company, UK fund managers rely more heavily on personal meetings with its senior managers, research by brokerage firms, and contacts with brokers' analysts than do US ones. For US investors, personal meetings tie for first place with annual reports. Active investment management styles are much more popular in both centres than passive ones: in all, 14 per cent of UK and US-owned continental equities are passively managed or indexed, according to the survey. Among those institutions that use passive management for continental equities, US firms are far more committed to the technique. Investing in a company's shares was twice as popular among US fund managers as buying its American Depositary Receipts. Similarly, among UK fund managers, only 11 per cent said a London listing would make them more likely to buy the shares. A continuous on-line price quote (as provided by the London Stock Exchange's Seaq International system) would make 53 per cent of US investors more likely to buy but would have the same effect on only 28 per cent of UK investors. One common theme was concern about information on corporate activities and potential barriers to ownership. In Germany, for example, 72 per cent of US investors and 50 per cent of UK investors said availability of information was an obstacle.

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Student loans may be sold off to cut education spending The Government is considering privatising the Student Loans Company in response to the prospect of a further Treasury squeeze on higher education funding. Ministers are studying two options for the organisation responsible for administering loans to students in higher education: an outright privatisation, probably via a sale to a group of banks; or, more probably, securitising the company's debt. Both would be designed to cut dramatically the up-front cost of the loan operation, which on present plans will rise to Pounds 688m next year and Pounds 900m in 1996-97. The government plans to increase the proportion of students' living costs funded by repayable loans by 10 per cent for each of the next three years and to impose parallel cuts in student grant rates. But the rapid rise in the number of students going into higher education and the lengthy terms of repayment of the loans means that the finances of the Student Loans Company, at present a government agency, will remain in deficit for at least 10 years. Former students do not begin repaying the loans until they have reached an income threshold of 85 per cent of average earnings and the repayment rate is pegged solely to the retail price index. So far more than a million loans have been taken out. Treasury demands for a reduction in overall government spending limits have put the Education Department under pressure to reduce its higher education budget. One option is to repeat the decision taken in the 1993 Budget to cap tuition fees paid to the universities, removing the incentive for them to expand departments and take on extra students. But in political terms removing the cost of loans from the government's books would be a much more attractive route. In 1989 the main clearing banks rejected a government scheme under which they would have administered the loans. But ministers believe the absence of the feared political backlash against the loan system and the small proportion of loan defaults might persuade financial institutions to rethink their opposition. Outright privatisation, however, would require legislation, deferring any savings at least until 1996. Securitisation of the debt - its sale to financial institutions at a discount or with a Treasury guarantee - would also remove the cost from the Treasury's books and could be done without legislation. Such a move would be in line with the announcement last week by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that all public expenditure demands should in future be tested against the possibility of a privately financed alternative.

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE DERIVATIVES sector experienced a busy session as both the December Footsie futures and the index options of the same month expired, and economic recovery prospects led to good buying, writes Joel Kibazo. Rolling out of the December futures contract on the FT-SE and into March dominated the first half of the morning. At the expiry of the December contract at 10.30am, it stood at 2,757 and some 3,383 contracts had been traded ahead of its close. Economic recovery prospects led to healthy demand for the March contract and helped pull the underlying cash market higher. The contract traded at a premium throughout the session and at the day's peak it recorded a premium of around 35 points. March closed at 2,815, around 7 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 19. Turnover was good, reaching 8,324 lots. In the traded options, it was the expiry of the December index options which led to increased turnover, reaching 43,515 lots by the close.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCALED-DOWN AIRPORT COMPLEX APPROVED 4-3;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE SANTA MONICA CITY COUNCIL SPENT A CONTENTIOUS FIVE HOURS  DEBATING THE MERITS OF THE COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL OFFICE PROJECT BEFORE THE  MAYOR CAST THE DECIDING VOTE.  </P> <P> The Santa Monica City Council approved plans for a controversial office complex  at Santa Monica Airport early Wednesday, despite an hours-long effort by one  member to defeat the project with a point-by-point challenge of traffic and  revenue information. Tempers were flaring after midnight when the council voted  4 to 3 to approve a 822,000-square-foot version of the originally proposed  Santa Monica Common commercial and retail office complex.  </P> <P> The developer, Reliance Development Group, had agreed to accept the scaled-back  version of the project, and said the smaller version of the project would have  little or no impact on surrounding areas. Reliance was selected by the city in  1987 to develop the 37.56 acres of city-owned property at Bundy Drive and  Airport Avenue, at the southeast corner of the airport.  </P> <P> In reducing the original 1.3-million-square-foot proposal, the council hoped to  satisfy Reliance, which had threatened to back out if the city cut the project  to less than 822,000 square feet, and also soothe angry nearby residents, who  said the sprawling complex would wreak havoc on traffic in their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "In my judgment, this project will help this community in a dramatic fashion  with many of its major concerns," said Mayor Dennis Zane shortly before  providing the key vote.  </P> <P> Zane argued that money received from the project -- estimated as high as $27  million over the next 10 years from lease payments and taxes -- could be used  to bolster sagging social, education, and parks programs in the city.  </P> <P> Though several of the council members appeared to have made a decision on the  fate of Santa Monica Common early in the five-hour hearing, some members posed  a long series of highly detailed questions to city staff and the developer in  an effort to sway members against the project.  </P> <P> Councilman Ken Genser doggedly pursued supporters of the project with inquiries  into how traffic studies were made, whether the description of the smaller  project as having "no impact" on surrounding areas was accurate, and whether  projected revenues from the project were overly optimistic.  </P> <P> At one point, the council was nearly forced to adjourn when it was unable to  pass a motion to extend the meeting beyond 11 p.m. because Genser would not  agree to halt his questions. Councilman Herbert Katz, who with Mayor Pro  Tempore David Finkel sided with Genser against the project, objected to  Genser's persistent questions on minute details, and said he would not vote to  extend the meeting as required unless questions were halted. Several council  members accused Genser of conducting a filibuster but they finally were able to  vote to continue the meeting and end questions.  </P> <P> Though clearly annoyed, Genser stopped his questions after explaining why his  interrogation had been so exhaustive:  </P> <P> "I can't accept a (project) analysis that says the sky is red when I know it's  blue. I just think it is very unwise of us to dispose of open space like this  for a period probably longer than our lifetime," Genser said.  </P> <P> The decision brought to a formal end the fight over what to do with the  city-owned tract at the airport's southeast corner.  </P> <P> Opponents, many from Mar Vista and other neighborhoods of Los Angeles, had  swarmed a series of public hearings before the council and the Santa Monica  Planning Commission in recent weeks to loudly protest the project. Most  objections revolved around traffic that would be generated by the complex.  </P> <P> Los Angeles residents complained that because the development is blocked off  from the rest of Santa Monica by the airport, all of the traffic from Santa  Monica Common would pass through their neighborhoods, even though Los Angeles  would receive none of the financial benefits from the project. Santa Monica  residents protested that the project would produce traffic jams and  construction dust, and said the property would better serve the city as a park.  </P> <P> Though public comment on the project had been closed by the council after a  special hearing Oct. 3, about 30 vocal opponents awaited the council's decision  with cheers for the no votes and jeers for the ayes.  </P> <P> Los Angeles resident William Scheding, who jumped up and shouted "coward!" when  Zane cast the deciding vote, predicted that the decision would come back to  haunt Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "All the negative effects are in Los Angeles," Scheding said. "All the positive  effects are in Santa Monica. That's not a good-neighbor policy. . . . I think  the city of Santa Monica will get burnt by this project in the end." Scheding  said several lawsuits against the project are in the works.  </P> <P> Though an environmental impact report estimated that as many as 12,000 daily  car trips would flow onto Bundy Drive, both city staff and developer's  consultants argued that improvements by Santa Monica at a number of  intersections and the widening of Centinela Avenue south of the airport by the  city of Los Angeles would reduce the impacts of that traffic to zero.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP The City Council will formally authorize the project with ordinances  in the next month. Lawsuits to block construction are certain to follow. If  they are resolved, construction could begin in 1991.  </P></p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: The soft seller forced to make the hardest sell - The options facing WPP in its struggle to reduce borrowings IT IS fortunate that Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, appears to relish a challenge. He clearly has an enormous one on his hands. On top of yesterday's announcement that pre-tax profits had fallen by 38 per cent in 1991, leaving underlying trading profits of just Pounds 38.4m, it now seems that WPP is about to try to raise up to Dollars 200m (Pounds 113.6m) from disposals to reduce its heavy debt burden. With world advertising revenues unlikely to grow by more than 1 per cent this year, it is hardly the best time to be making fire-sales. Nevertheless, Mr Sorrell may have little real choice. He confirmed yesterday that he has plans to re-organise WPP, which has two of the world's best advertising brand names, J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather. The long-promised sale of the US agency Scali McCabe Sloves, which WPP acquired in May 1989, will steam ahead. In November 1990 Scali lost the Dollars 40m Volvo account when it was revealed that a Volvo commercial featuring the safety aspects of the brand had been rigged. Yesterday Mr Sorrell said he had a 'moral obligation' to sell the agency; in February this year Scali gained renewed confidence - and probably increased value - when it won Mercedes' Dollars 115m North American account. Disposal of all or part of WPP's market research subsidiaries - Millward Brown International, MRG Group and Research International - is another likely move. Flotation on the Tokyo stock exchange of a minority stake in its Far Eastern advertising interests is also on the cards. Mr Sorrell said that such moves would, on a 'conservative' estimate, result in proceeds of some Dollars 200m; he estimated that the group had a 'short-term cash need over the next year' of some Dollars 100m. The timetable for all three actions was 'the sooner the better', though certainly before the end of 1992. The imperative behind the decision to make disposals and attempt flotations clearly comes from WPP's banks rather than from Mr Sorrell, who described the relationship with the co-ordinating committee - formed by Bankers Trust, JP Morgan, Citibank and Barclays' - of his 25 bankers as 'constructive and productive'. The albatross round the neck of WPP is its heavy debt burden incurred through big acquisitions made in the 1980s. At the end of 1990, WPP became concerned that it was likely to breach covenants on its medium-term loans. It renegotiated its borrowings, putting in place a new medium-term facility of Dollars 400m, to be repaid or refinanced by June 1993. In addition, a Dollars 604.5m term loan is to be repaid in semi-annual instalments over four years from June 1993. It has not drawn fully on those facilities but its debt still averaged Pounds 472m last year against Pounds 432m in 1990. It ended 1991 at Pounds 334m against Pounds 297m at December 1990. According to one analyst, without the release of some Pounds 17.8m of exceptional items to boost 1991's pre-tax profits to Pounds 56.1m, WPP would have breached its banking covenants. Even if Mr Sorrell manages to raise as much as Dollars 200m from the re-organisations he has in mind, that will probably not be enough; 'even with disposals, no way are they going to meet their banking covenants' is the view of one analyst. Another analyst, Mr Richard Dale of Smith New Court, said that 1991's performance 'was worse than expected; in the current year we expect revenues to be at best flat, and pre-tax profits to be about around Pounds 40m, giving interest rate cover of 1.8 times, below that required by banks. It is therefore not surprising that they are now talking to the banks again.' Moreover, it is increasingly unlikely that WPP will be able to meet its debt repayment obligations for 1993. One solution - which Mr Sorrell continues to disparage  - might be the sale of one of his two world-leading international advertising agency networks. But even without Mr Sorrell's well-known opposition to such a notion, with the slump in advertising the price that could be obtained for either would hardly match the sort of figures Mr Sorrell paid for them - Dollars 566m for JWT in 1987 and Dollars 864m for O&amp;M in 1989. Mr Sorrell therefore needs to maintain a productive relationship with his bankers. The view of another analyst is that 'it is not in the banks' interest to put WPP into receivership', since the core value of the group's business is in people and property, neither of which can be easily valued, least of all given 1991's 3 per cent collapse (in real terms) in international advertising revenue and a property slump. Not for the first time, bankers may find themselves over a barrel with little choice but to come to the aid of an ailing company, in the hope that it will all come right.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NINTENDO CAN SUE OVER UNAUTHORIZED SALES  </P> <P> A court has ruled video giant Nintendo can sue retailers who buy  patent-protected video games from its competitors.  </P> <P> The decision by U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington nullified a  California court ruling that prohibited suits against retailers who sell  products that companies say infringe on their patents.  </P> <P> The California injunction stems from a lawsuit filed in December, 1988, by  arcade-game developer Atari Games-Tengen Inc., which charged Nintendo with  monopolistic practices through its licensing agreements. Atari Games also  claims that Nintendo has infringed on an Atari patent.  </P> <P> Nintendo has consistently maintained that the manufacture and sale of  unlicensed video game cartridges by Atari for use with Nintendo Entertainment  Systems violated a number of Nintendo's rights.  </P> <P> The court of Appeals said in its decision that Atari Games was unable to  present evidence to "prove that Nintendo was . . . expanding its patent rights  beyond their proper scope."  </P> <P> Dennis Wood, senior vice president of Atari Games, said in a statement that his  company had hoped not to involve third parties in the battle. He said the  company would pursue the matter further in District Court.  </P></p>

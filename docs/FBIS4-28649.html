			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- North Korea is unlikely to  change its hard-line stance with the resolution adopted by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to suspend technical  aid for its refusal to accept full nuclear inspections, Ministry  of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] sources said Saturday.    The IAEA action could affect the UN Security Council,  however, on its deliberations on possible economic sanctions on  North Korea, the sources said.    In an overwhelming vote of 28-1, the Vienna-based IAEA  adopted the resolution, setting in motion the first punitive  step by the UN nuclear watchdog agency against North Korea.    The Japanese Government welcomed the IAEA action as the  international community's expression of concern against the  North.    But Pyongyang could "not care less" about the suspension of  the IAEA's technical aid, which amounted to 270,000 dollars in  1993, the Foreign Ministry source said.    The government expects the action will have some influence  on  potential UN sanctions against North Korea, and Japan is  determined to persuade China not to exercise a veto if the  measure is put to a vote at the Security Council, the sources  said.    China, a key ally of North Korea, has a veto power on a  resolution as one of the five permanent security council members.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Friday night he thinks the  row over North Korea's suspected nuclear development program has  become increasingly tense, saying, "we cannot put off (taking  actions) forever."    Hata told reporters, however, that the IAEA measures are not  "a punishment" and that Japan still hopes the issues will be  resolved through dialogue among concerned nations.</p>

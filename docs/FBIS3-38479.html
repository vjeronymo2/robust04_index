			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "Haavisto Predicts Difficult </F> Negotiations"]    [Text] Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto (Center Party) has  said that the milk and sugar quotas which the EU [European  Union] Commission has offered Finland are a disappointment.  According to Haavisto, the quotas are much less than what  Finland has proposed. Minister Haavisto said on Saturday [29  January] that Finland is now on the verge of really difficult  negotiations. In practice only 20 working days are left for thm.    In Haavisto's view, the situation is very open in all  respects, since the Commission has still not reached a decision  on the issues which are most important to Finland -- that is,  the support for northern regions.    According to the EU Commission's proposal, Finland's milk  quota would be 2,340 million liters and sugar production would  be limited to 146,000 tonnes.    The Commission's proposal means that Finland ought to cut  its  present milk quota by around 8 percent. The sugar quota that  has been offered means that at least one sugar refinery will  have to be closed, Haavisto said. In his view the cut in milk  production is pretty hard, because Finland has been assuming  that it might succeed in this very area.    Finland's current quota-linked milk production is 2,515  million liters. In addition to this Finland has also been  seeking an opportunity for those farms which have ceased  producing milk to resume production in line with the system in  force within the EU. This means that the quota target increases  to 2,992 million liters.    In Haavisto's view the EU Commission has made a clear  mistake  in fixing the milk quota. It has failed to understand that all  farms have not fully exploited their right of production.    However, Haavisto pointed out that by far the most important  issue in the continued negotiations is support for northern  regions.    "Quotas such as these are also without importance if the  economic conditions for producing them do not exist," he said.    In Haavisto's view it is possible to see from the EU  Commission's offers that the understanding that has been voiced  at the general level for Finland's special problems is much less  when the issues are discussed at expert level.    Haavisto said that we must now hope that the understanding  that has been expressed at head of state level spreads to the  countries' negotiators and to the Commission -- that is, that  there will also be understanding in practice.    He added that he believes that the EU's machinery for  preparing decisions has not functioned satisfactorily on this  point. In his view there is still some goodwill in various  quarters. However, some flexibility is needed on the  Commission's part, he added. The Commission has prepared its  proposal for the member countries and it is with these that  Finland and the other applicant nations will negotiate the terms  of membership.</p>

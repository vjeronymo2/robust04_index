			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Management: The first 100 days So now you are the boss. The board rang last night and this morning the chief executive's office has your name on it. Everything is in a state of flux. There is much work to do, and you know that you have some breathing space in which to introduce change. But, as a report in the McKinsey Quarterly* points out: 'Within 100 days or so a new order usually gets established and things settle down again . . . periods of transition are painfully short.' The report's authors explore how best to use the 100 days of opportunity, what to focus on and how not to sow the seeds of your own destruction. 'Executives . . . often focus, from the very beginning, on the kind of legacy they want to leave behind,' the report says. The next step is to ask: 'What is the number one thing that could derail what I hope to achieve?' This approach keeps the new boss's mind focused on a strategy. Then managers are advised to explore power bases and communications channels. A new chief of a US railway wanted to limit status symbols. He replaced the ground-floor executive offices with a fitness centre. 'By the time he announced that one-third of corporate staff would be cut, the organisation had already gotten the message: change was real and more was coming.' The report advises focusing on a few outstanding themes. One rueful CEO says: 'If everything is a priority, then nothing is a priority. It may sound trite, but we do it to ourselves all the time. At times there seemed to be 200 'critical' things to do. Even when I pared the list down to 30 I still felt swamped.' Planning company successions is also crucial to long-term stability. In a survey by The Conference Board* of companies mostly based in the US and Europe, leadership continuity is the principal objective of succession planning, a process formally undertaken in 61 per cent of those surveyed. Succession programmes are used to cover a great number of posts in some organisations. The survey says, however, that the process of tracking is often behind the times, although many companies intend to develop more meaningful criteria for evaluating capability. *The McKinsey Quarterly, 1 Jermyn Street, London SW1Y 4UH. *The Conference Board, 845 Third Avenue, New York, NY</p>

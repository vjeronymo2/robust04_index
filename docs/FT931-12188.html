			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): Long-term investors prosper amid the rubble - Keynote / But many older ones, seeking to live off their investment income, are having to tighten their belts, as interest rates fall and the structure of returns changes THERE MAY not be another quarter like it for quite a while. Under the impetus of two separate one-point cuts in short-term interest rates, on October 16 and November 13, and of a further depreciation of sterling from Dollars 1.78 to Dollars 1.51, the UK stock market showed healthy gains, and in sterling terms the overseas stock and bond markets showed up very positively, too. Even government securities (or gilt-edged) weathered the conditions quite well, although there were misgivings about a worsened outlook for inflation and government borrowing. But while fixed-income gilts achieved only slight gains, in doing so they consolidated their significant advances earlier in the year. During the October-December period the FT-SE 100 Index climbed 11.5 per cent in capital value, and the FT-Actuaries World Index in sterling terms put on 17 per cent. In dollar terms, it is true, the World Index went down by about 1 per cent, but that was strictly a problem for the Americans. It may have been a fool's paradise, but long-term UK investors continued to prosper in 1992 amidst the rubble of Britain's economy, which appears to have shrunk by about 1 per cent during the 12 months. Fortunately, a certain amount of economic recovery began to be evident by the end of the year. Car sales jumped in December, taking annual registrations to just above the 1991 level, and although December retail sales overall were unexciting, business generally seemed to improve markedly over the Christmas and New Year period. Some of the business-confidence indicators began to pick up, too, though there have been false dawns in this respect before. In terms of total return (capital gains plus gross income), UK equities produced about 21 per cent and gilts 16 per cent during 1992. The best results of all were generated by foreign currency bonds, which in many cases returned 30 per cent or more to sterling investors, with Japanese and Dutch government bonds leading the pack. There was a harsh flipside to all this, however. Investors in short-term savings accounts were exposed to the drop in interest rates, so that by the end of the year the gross return on instant access building society accounts had slipped to about 5 per cent. Older investors seeking to live off their investment income found that they were having to tighten their belts, after several fat years. At the end of June long-dated gilts yielded almost 1 per cent less than the clearing bank base rate. By the end of September they yielded 0.4 per cent more. And by the end of December that positive differential had widened to 1.9 percentage points. It is an odds-on bet that the gap will grow further in 1993. These changes in the structure of investment returns (technically described as a steepening of the yield curve) are having dramatic effects on savers and on institutions. During the years of high interest rates from 1988 to 1991, the building societies were pulling in anywhere between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1,000m a month in net receipts over their counters. But in the final two quarters of 1992 that changed into a net outflow (although interest credited to accounts kept the overall savings total growing on a modest scale). New savings are, in effect, now going elsewhere. Sales of unit trusts are picking up, and the life assurance companies are doing a big business in lump-sum savings products such as with-profits bonds and guaranteed income bonds. National Savings will contribute Pounds 5bn or more to government funding this financial year, against a negative figure in 1989-90, although Norman Lamont withdrew the controversial First Option Bond (the particular target of building-society fury) in his Autumn Statement on November 12. The decline of the credit institutions has gone hand-in-hand with the weakness of credit-based investments, notably property. Whereas the sensitive and liquid equity market moved ahead in the fourth quarter of 1992, the sluggish and inefficient property markets carried on sinking. Both the residential and commercial markets continue to be dominated by the overhang of property for sale, and values typically fell by 8 to 10 per cent during the year as a whole, though with substantial regional variations. The average house price fell by anywhere between 2 and 5 per cent in October-December, depending on whether you believe Halifax or Nationwide's statistics. This failure of values to respond positively to the drop in mortgage rates shows how deep-rooted are the problems of the owner-occupied residential property market. For instance, unemployment was rising by about 30,000 a month during the final quarter. Headlines about redundancies everywhere from Barclays Bank and British Coal to British Aerospace scarcely served to boost the confidence of house-buyers. Perhaps the time has now come for bargain-hunting in houses, but prices are unlikely to recovery for some time yet. So why did the UK stock market take such a different view? Partly because it has an international dimension. UK-listed companies earn getting on for half of their profits overseas, and devaluation will consequently help their earnings as measured in pounds. But by December buyers were switching their emphasis to the smaller, domestically-oriented companies which had been left behind in the market's rally. These companies will need a revival in the British economy to justify their higher ratings. There were clearly also some purely financial reasons behind the strength of share prices in late 1992. A lull in the pace of government funding coincided with a virtual absence of issues by companies. As interest rates fell, liquidity was drained out of the money markets and attracted into the long-term markets. The balance was favourable for the stock market. This may only have been temporary, however. The Bank of England will be stepping up its sales of gilt-edged in 1993, seeking to hit a gross target of Pounds 50bn or more. Because foreigners have mostly stopped buying gilts, in view of the extra currency risks since the UK's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September, the buying power of domestic investors could be tested. British companies will also be tempted to launch rights issues into a buoyant stock market, especially if there is a glimmer of light visible in the economy. A crucial element will be the trend in dividend payments. Although October to December is not a major season for dividend declarations, there were many cuts, and by the end of the year aggregate payments were running slightly below the 1991 level. Last autumn, the stock market was busy celebrating the impending fruits of devaluation. But in 1993 investors may be waiting anxiously for the harvest to ripen.</p>

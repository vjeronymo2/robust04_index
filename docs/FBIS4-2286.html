			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of  the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met  with a Berlin delegation led by the city's mayor Eberhardt  Diepgen here this afternoon.    During the meeting Qiao congratulated Berlin and Beijing on  cementing friendly-city ties.    Berlin left him with a deep and beautiful impression, Qiao  said, when recalling his visit to Berlin in January.    Qiao noted that there will be more exchanges and cooperation  between Beijing and Berlin, given sustained development of Sino-  German relations of friendship.    He was glad that an agreement between Beijing and Berlin had  been signed for their sister-city relations and a memorandum  made on their exchanges from 1994 to 1995, Qiao said, hoping  that exchanges will be strengthened and cooperation implemented  in various fields.    Diepgen said that his current tour in Beijing has improved  mutual understanding.    With the German-Chinese relations going on the right track,  he said, new developments will be witnessed between Berlin and  Beijing, and the two cities can cooperate for mutual benefit in  infrastructure, telecommunications, environmental protection and  revamping China's small- and medium-sized enterprises.    Li Qiyan, Beijing's mayor, attended the meeting.</p>

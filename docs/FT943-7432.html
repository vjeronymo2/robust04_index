The figure includes a SKr48m contribution from the group's recently demerged lock operations. Sales grew 16 per cent to SKr3.86bn, reflecting the group's continuing acquisition programme. The most recent purchases were in Portugal and Spain. Securitas and Finland's Metra group agreed to merge their lock businesses to form ASSA Abloy in June. Full-year profits for the new entity are expected to be SKr390m.</p>

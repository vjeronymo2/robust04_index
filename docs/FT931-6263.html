			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Safren 18% lower in poor trading conditions SAFREN, the South African shipping, leisure and freight handling group, recorded an 18 per cent drop in attributable earnings for the six months to the end of December as deteriorating trading conditions affected all its divisions. Turnover rose marginally to R2.37bn (Dollars 764m) from R2.31bn during the same period in 1991, but operating profit was 1 per cent lower at R334.6m compared with R337.8m. A sharp rise, however, in net interest paid - to R24.2m from R1m - and a decline in the share of associated companies' profits, which fell to R36.7m from R63.4m, caused attributable earnings to fall to R109.4m from R133.3m. The interim dividend is being maintained at 65 cents per share despite earnings per share falling by 18.6 per cent to 202 cents from 248 cents. Increased competition and the recession, both in South Africa and abroad, caused Safmarine, the shipping and transport subsidiary, to experience declining cargo volumes and reduced freight rates in its liner and bulk trades. Increased depreciation and interest arising from large investments in new ships and containers also affected profit adversely. Safair, the freight carrier, suffered from the resurgence of hostilities in Angola, while Flitestar, the domestic airline, incurred substantial losses owing to overcapacity and predatory pricing on domestic routes. Profits at Kersaf, the leisure and entertainment arm, were lower due to difficult trading conditions, aggravated by construction work at its main resorts and competition from unregulated casinos. Rennies, the freight handling group, benefited from its participation in a drought relief scheme in the region and lifted profits. Safmarine, Rennies and Kersaf respectively contributed 22 per cent, 21 per cent and 56 per cent to Safren's attributable profit.</p>

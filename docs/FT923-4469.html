			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / The Farnborough Air Show: Bombardier unifies interests BOMBARDIER, the Canadian transport, defence and financial services conglomerate, has reorganised its aircraft building interests into a single division, David Boggis writes. Its new regional aircraft division, announced yesterday at Farnborough, will market and support the Canadair Regional Jet 50-60 passenger twin and the Dash 8 30-50 passenger twin-turbo prop. Bombardier also said it would deliver its first production regional jet in about six weeks to Lufthansa CityLine, commuter arm of the German airline. Lufthansa CityLine contracted in 1990 to buy up to 35 regional jets. The reorganisation enables Bombardier to deal with the regional jet and the Dash 8 as a single-product range. Mr Robert Wohl, division president, said there were about 470 orders and options for the regional jet and the Dash 8 from a total of 60 customers.</p>

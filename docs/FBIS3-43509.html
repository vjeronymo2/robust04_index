Speaking on national television, Education Minister Djibo Garba  also stated that 58 people were picked up for interrogation and  "about 30" injured without specifying whether they were students  or policemen. Eighteen vehicles were ransacked or burned down.  A previous report of the police said that about 50 students  were picked, including "some union leaders," and more than 40  slightly injured.    The incidents started yesterday, late in the afternoon, when  the police dispersed a demonstration of some 500 students in  downtown Niamey. The demonstrators, who were demanding the  payment of seven to nine months scholarship arrears and  improvement of their working conditions, withdrew early in the  evening to the campus, where they were surrounded by the  security forces. At 2200, local time, that is 2100 GMT, about  500 policemen, gendarmes, and republican guards, were still near  the university, according to an AFP correspondent.    The minister of education further stated that the government  was about to investigate the affair in order "to prosecute those  behind the demonstration."</p>

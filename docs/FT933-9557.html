			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Swedish builders agree merger TRE BYGGARE and BPA, the Swedish building groups, are combining to form Sweden's third-largest construction group in a significant rationalisation of the country's hard-hit building sector. Malmo-based Tre Byggare is buying a majority stake in BPA from a group of trade unions, and is paying for the holding by selling it's entire shareholding in real estate company Wihlborg &amp; Sons. The deal is worth between SKr500 (Dollars 61.7m) and SKr600m. The new company will have 20,000 employees and an annual turnover of SKr20bn, which puts it third in size to NCC and Skanska, Sweden's two largest construction groups. Mr Bengt Madsen, chairman of Tre Byggare, said the merger reflected the collapse of the Swedish building industry and the weakness of Tre Byggare and BPA. He said Tre Byggare's equity/assets ratio would double to 18 per cent, and it would get a SKr600m liquidity injection as a result of the deal. 'This is the first major merger in Sweden's current building industry crisis. Further rationalisation in the sector will be needed as the market is not going to increase for the next two years,' said Mr Madsen. Later this year Tre Byggare, which is to be renamed PEAB, plans to direct an issue of 2.5m shares to the unions, giving them a stake of around 19 per cent in the company.</p>

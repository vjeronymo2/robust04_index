			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Leading Article: En retraite To be forced to retreat on one front may be regarded as a misfortune; to retreat on several fronts in succession looks like carelessness. By abandoning his controversial youth wage law in the face of student protests, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has not merely reinforced the impression that he is a soft touch for domestic interest groups. He has also augmented a sense of drift in economic and social policy that threatens to make the task of governing France immeasurably more difficult in the months to come. This is a climbdown every bit as damaging as Mr Balladur's decision last autumn to scrap a much-needed restructuring of Air France after worker protests. It also stands in odd contrast to the firm support he has given to the hard franc policy of the newly independent Bank of France. The plan to pay young workers in training 80 per cent of the minimum wage may have seemed more like tinkering than a full-blown attack on youth unemployment. But it was an important symbol of the government's desire for supply side reforms. Jettisoning it demonstrates just how far France is from getting to grips with the structural rigidities - such as the inflated minimum wage itself - that underlie its sluggish economic performance. In mitigation it may be argued that, one year after his appointment, Mr Balladur is not master in his own house. His youth wage plan did not enjoy unanimous support in the governing coalition. Had he persisted, he might have put the stability of his government - and his own presidential ambitions - in serious jeopardy. It is not clear, however, that withdrawing the measure will smooth his path. On the contrary, by failing honestly to explain his intentions in introducing the measure and then shifting tack, he has undermined his most prized asset: an image of quiet competence. France needs greater clarity and firmness of purpose from its prime minister if it is to emerge strengthened from the current recession.</p>

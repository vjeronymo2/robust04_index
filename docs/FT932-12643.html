			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Focus is back on the dollar THE DOLLAR weakened to below the DM1.5700 level against the D-Mark in Europe yesterday as dealers again turned their attention towards the sluggish growth in the US economy, writes James Blitz. For most of the last few trading days, the market's attention has been fixed on the Spanish peseta, which fell through its central rate against the D-Mark on Friday. However, pressure on the Spanish currency towards the end of last week had been based on speculation that there could be a devaluation of the currency at the weekend and the pressures eased yesterday. According to Mr Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America in London, this allowed dealers to catch up with both the political and economic uncertainties that have been seen in the US in recent weeks. President Bill Clinton's inability to get his fiscal stimulus package ratified by the US senate has led to speculation in the markets that his presidency is in some disarray in its first few months of office. The economic indicators for March, which have been affected by bad weather, have also shown a more downbeat performance than had been anticipated. Yesterday's 2.9 per cent fall in March US home sales confirmed recent indications that US GDP in the first quarter of this year was significantly below the levels reached in the 1992 fourth quarter. According to Mr Mike Gallagher of IDEA, the market information group, dealers must wait until the April non-farm payroll data at the end of next week before the dollar can expect to receive any stimulus. The US currency yesterday bottomed at DM1.5645. It later closed in London at DM1.5675 from a previous DM1.5840. In New York the dollar finally stood at DM1.5705. In Europe, attention was focused on the Italian lira, which had a stunning rally on expectations that Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, would be chosen as the next prime minister of Italy. Mr Ciampi's nomination was received very favourably by both the currency and bond markets, with the Italian government bonds rising 1/2 point at one stage. The lira closed at L931.0 from a previous L941.1 per D-Mark. Sterling broke through the DM2.50 level against the D-Mark for the first time in three months, following a raft of positive economic indicators in the UK. Yesterday's figure for GDP in the first quarter, showing a 0.2 per cent rise from the previous three months, came as a slight disappointment. The pound later closed  1/4 pfennig down on the day at DM2.4925. The peseta performed slightly more strongly against the D-Mark yesterday as the Bank of Spain's 100 basis-point rise in its daily intervention rate, announced on Friday, came into effect. After bottoming out at Pta74.05 to the D-Mark on Friday, the Spanish currency yesterday finished in London at Pta73.88.</p>

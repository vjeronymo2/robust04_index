			<p>BFN     [Text] "Crimean Tatars will have to go a long way to be  formed as a people and as a state," Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk said at a solemn meeting dedicated to the fifty-year  anniversary of the deportation of the Crimean-Tatar people in  Kiev on Saturday [14 May].    He stressed that Ukraine had to face the problem of deported  peoples alone, although the Ukrainian leadership had addressed  the CIS states with a request to help it.    Kravchuk repeated that the CIS agreement on mutual  assistance  with settlement of problems concerning deported peoples signed  in 1992 had not been ratified by the CIS parliaments and had  never come into effect.    Kravchuk said that migration had become spontaneous.  Displaced persons often find themselves in Ukraine with no  means for living since they fail to sell their property for fair  prices. He urged the Ukrainian parliament to adopt a law which  will clearly define the status of deported peoples, including  Crimean Tatars.    Deputy Chairman of the Crimean-Tatar parliament, Refat  Chubarov, called on the Ukrainian leadership to address the UN  in order to solve the problems of Crimean Tatars. He suggested  the assistance on the part of the UN would also improve the  situation in Crimea in general.    Chubarov pointed out that the issue could be resolved only  through joint actions by the Ukrainian and Crimean authorities  and the Crimean-Tatar parliament.    Currently, there are about 250,000 Crimean Tatars living in  Crimea. In accordance with the quota given to them, Crimean  Tatars have fourteen seats in the new Crimean parliament.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / DTI may relax fund disclosure FUND managers would not be required to disclose stakes below 10 per cent in companies held by clients under rules proposed by the Department of Trade and Industry. The present ceiling is 3 per cent. The DTI has been under pressure from the Institutional Fund Managers Association, the industry trade association, to ease disclosure requirements that managers say are expensive and unnecessary. 'In no way would you say that these stakes are predatory,' said Mr Richard Weir, director-general of the IFMA. The DTI first consulted on its draft directive in February 1991 and its proposed rules have been prepared in the light of its consultation and other developments since then. The proposed rules are set out in a paper being circulated within the industry. They will apply to fund managers charged with buying, selling and voting shares held in segregated accounts in the names of individual clients. The proposals say stakes in companies in pooled funds managed by fund managers need be disclosed only when they reach 10 per cent. The directive is generally a relaxation of notification rules. However, while at present fund managers whose sole job it is to sell shares on behalf of clients need give notification only of stakes of 15 per cent or more, under the proposals that ceiling would be lowered to 10 per cent under the proposals. The rules would also be tightened in respect of unlisted companies. For the first time, stakes in such companies of 10 per cent or more would have to be disclosed as well. The fund management industry has argued for a relaxation of notification requirements, saying the present rules are cumbersome and expensive to administer. IFMA also argues that no European country has a requirement to disclose stakes below 10 per cent and a 1988 directive set 10 per cent as the minimum size of a notifiable position. Nevertheless, in what is likely to be a disappointment to the pension funds industry, the DTI does not propose lifting the ceiling on notifiable stakes held by pension fund trustees from the current 3 per cent.</p>

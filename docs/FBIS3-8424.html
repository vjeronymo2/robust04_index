			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Franz Neubaer, spokesman of the Sudeten </F> German Landsmanschaft, by Emilie Harantova; place and date not  given: "Compensation Should Be Made Collectively, Neubauer Says"]    [Text] Prague--The Sudeten German Landsmanschaft  appreciates that Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has not been silent  about compensation to Sudeten Germans; nevertheless it rejects  his concept. Landsmanschaft Spokesman Franz Neubauer said in an  interview for MLADA FRONTA DNES that Sudeten Germans must insist  on their idea of collective compensation. "It is not all right  for Prime Minister Klaus to try to provide compensation only on  an individual basis," Neubauer said.    "If we recognized the rights of individuals, the government  would have to decide whether to provide compensation to  Neubauer, for example. I do not believe that they would decide  in my favor. This is why we want collective solutions."    [Harantova] Klaus's concept is completely unacceptable to  you, then?    [Neubauer] We would be prepared to accept even this  alternative if Klaus would waive, in his new concept, the  condition for granting Czech citizenship being knowledge of the  Czech language and five years of residence. Even this would  always have to be connected with some administrative action on  the Czech side, which would make the right to return more  general. If this is not what Klaus meant, I do not understand  why he spoke about his new concept.    [Harantova] Let us suppose that, despite the individual  solutions, we found a certain way and some Sudeten Germans  wanted to settle here as Czech citizens and claim their property  rights. What would happen then?    [Neubauer] There are many fields without owners in your  country. Some of them lie fallow and the rest are  collectivized. My mother comes from a small village near Karlovy  Vary. Certain houses have disappeared, and, in the rest, I saw  some Gypsies. All of it belongs to a collective farm--that is,  the state.    [Harantova] The fields should be returned to their original  German owners?    [Neubauer] If they want them, yes. The remaining property,  whose original owners were Germans, could be used to establish a  fund. From this fund, compensation could be paid out to those  people whose houses have been demolished or sold to Czech  owners. Again, I am stressing, we do not want to expel anyone.  This would not be the correct way to begin a new coexistence.  It is impossible to reduce the entire problem only to property  issues. First, we have to eliminate distrust and speak again.  Why does your policy not have the courage to stand up to the  communists? Why is it impossible to abolish the law of May 1946  whereby crimes committed against Germans and Hungarians after  the war were amnestied? In fact, this would have little  impact--those are affairs of 50 years ago--but it would be a  nice gesture of goodwill.    [Harantova] Do you consider the restitution of Jewish  property to be a precedent?    [Neubauer] The problem of restitution shows that the  inflexible conditions given by your restitution laws are  unacceptable. This has become apparent in the problem of  church, Jewish, and Sudeten German property. From the legal  point of view, these three problems are equal. Is it possible  to consider only injustices that occurred during communist rule?  What about injustice before the communists? Is injustice done  by communists worse than other injustices?</p>

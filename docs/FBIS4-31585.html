			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 10 Jun (TANJUG) -- The FRY expects the  cease-fire signed in Geneva on Wednesday by representatives of  the Bosnia- Herzegovina warring sides to be an introduction to a  permanent peace, according to a statement issued today by the  Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    The statement welcomes the agreement on the cessation of  hostilities and says that "even though it would have been much  better for the successful continuation of negotiations and  attainment of a final political solution if the sides had  reached agreement on a permanent peace, or at least on a  long-term cease- fire, this agreement can serve as an impetus  for ending the Bosnia- Herzegovina crisis."    The statement goes on to say that full compliance with the  one- month cease-fire is important, because only then can this  short period of time be used to make progress in the  negotiations.    It is necessary that the international players attentively  and objectively follow further developments on the ground and  sanction each attempt to violate the cease-fire, irrespective of  the source. As for the Serb side in Bosnia-Herzegovina, it has  on a number of occasions expressed its orientation toward peace,  continuation of dialogue, and cessation of all hostilities.    The forthcoming one-month period must be used in the best  possible way for finding a final, just, and permanent solution  of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Regardless of the fact  that it is not one of the warring sides, the FRY is ready to  make a maximum contribution to realizing this goal, the  statement says.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / MGN shares to be sold in offering A MAJORITY stake in Mirror Group Newspapers, the newspaper group once owned by Mr Robert Maxwell, is to be disposed of by an international offering that could raise more than Pounds 350m. Mr John Talbot, the joint administrator of Robert Maxwell Holdings, the private Maxwell company said yesterday a formal bookbuilding process would begin on Monday, covering all the 219.7m shares, or 54.8 per cent of the total. Virtually all the shares were security for Maxwell loans and are effectively owned by banks such as National Westminster, Goldman Sachs, Midland and Lloyds. Under the bookbuilding operation bidders have a week to submit bids either at specific prices or at the price which becomes the offer price. Mr Talbot, who will determine the offer price and the allocations between individual investors by next Friday, decided an international offering was the best way to maximise the sum raised. The Arthur Andersen administrator refused to be drawn yesterday on the price he hoped to get or whether there was a price below which he would not sell. The sale could raise Pounds 50m-Pounds 70m for unsecured creditors including a contribution to the missing millions from Maxwell pension funds. The way was cleared for the offering by last week's interim results which showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 69.9m and yesterday's extraordinary general meeting which approved a settlement between MGN and other Maxwell companies. NM Rothschild and Cazenove are joint lead managers to the offering; NatWest Securities, SG Warburg Securities and James Capel are co-lead managers; Hoare Govett, Nomura International, Paribas Capital Markets and Swiss Bank are co-managers. At yesterday's egm, representatives of more than 10,000 pensioners, largely commercial printing staff, warned they were considering legal action because they had been excluded from the pension scheme. Sir Robert Clark, MGN chairman said only those who had actually worked on the production and distribution of Mirror newspapers could be covered by the MGN pension scheme. Lex, Page 20</p>

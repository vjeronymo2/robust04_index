			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> That's Hollywood . . . but not really.  </P> <P> Those who regret that they never saw the Pan Pacific Auditorium before it was  ravaged by fire last week still have an opportunity, of sorts.  </P> <P> The main entrance to the new Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park is a replica of the  Streamline Moderne exterior of the 54-year-old Los Angeles landmark.  </P> <P> The only problem is that it's in Orlando, Fla.  </P> <P> The Pan Pacific fire, by the way, has convinced Los Angeles City Council  President John Ferraro that what this city needs is an arson investigator  blessed with a more sensitive, if wetter, nose.  </P> <P> Ferraro noted that Mattie, a black Labrador retriever borrowed from the  Connecticut State Police, was instrumental in helping investigators determine  that the blaze was intentionally set because she was able to sniff out the  starting point of the fire.  </P> <P> The councilman proposed that the Los Angeles Fire Department find such a  creature of its own. But pooches like this aren't just sitting around in dog  pounds.  </P> <P> Mattie, who can detect the presence of 17 flammable liquids at extremely faint  levels, is one of just five such specially trained canines in the nation.  </P> <P> Hairy situation: The San Fernando Valley has never been fully tamed, but even  Animal Regulation Department workers were surprised to hear of a sighting by  one all-news radio station of a "wild yak racing on and off the 118 Freeway  near the Tampa (Avenue) off-ramp" in Northridge.  </P> <P> Turns out it was a somewhat less exotic white Charolais bull that had wandered  off a nearby ranch -- and survived the experience.  </P> <P> Yaks, which are burly, long-haired wild oxen, are usually found in Asian  precincts such as Tibet.  </P> <P> Singer Michael Jackson isn't known to own one. Asked if there were any yaks  romping on Valley prairies, Thomas Walsh, an Animal Regulation district  supervisor said: "I hope not."  </P> <P> The first contest involving the private Calabasas Polo Club may be staged in  Municipal Court rather than on its new field carved out of a canyon at the  western edge of the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> County officials said they will seek a criminal complaint against the Sherman  Oaks development company that allegedly built a regulation-size field, barn,  corrals and a small grandstand without building or grading permits.  </P> <P> "We're home builders," responded Rob Franciscan of Lycon Group. "We were told  that we didn't need a permit because we weren't building a habitable structure.  Originally we were told that for temporary equestrian facilities that a permit  was not necessary."  </P> <P> Lycon, which has been summoned to a district attorney's office conference today  at the Calabasas Municipal Courthouse, is accused, among other things, of  sumbitting grading plans to the county after 35,000 cubic yards of dirt were  moved.  </P> <P> Sort of a case of putting the bulldozer before the horse.  </P></p>

These  observers also agree unanimously that of all the international  initiatives to end this conflict that has been raging for more  than half a century, the U.S. initiative is the most serious.  Despite this, Israel has not met its responsibilities to the  peace issue. It has remained captive to its expansionist  ambitions, hostile ideology, and greed for occupying land. It  wasted two full years of the Washington talks in futile  arguments on its security fears, and escalated acts of  repression in the occupied Arab territories. It committed the  brutal aggression against southern Lebanon on the pretext of  these security claims, until it was exposed to the whole world  by the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, where the Zionist  settlers killed worshipers in God's house, and the Israeli Army  completed the brutal massacre by killing other Palestinians who  were leaving the mosque.    Inasmuch as the international community denounced the  heinous  massacre, it exerted efforts to save the peace process from an  inevitable collapse. UN Security Council Resolution No. 904,  although late, has come to contribute to the efforts aimed at  resuming the Washington talks and at emerging with tangible  results. Syria has responded to the various international  endeavors out of its belief that the peace cosponsors are now  aware of, more than at any time in the past, the seriousness of  the Israeli maneuvering, and of the need for the actual  implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions. Peace  prospects have narrowed as a result of the Israeli rulers'  procrastination and prevarications, and of giving predominance  to unimportant things over essential and substantive issues.  Although the UN Security Council has provided another  opportunity to resume the peace process, Israel's wasting of  this opportunity, just as past opportunities, could deal a fatal  blow to the U.S. initiative, after which its revival would be  difficult.    Undoubtedly, Israel's actions in southern Lebanon and the  occupied Arab territories, in addition to its procrastination  and prevarications, threaten the peace process. Israel's rulers  violate human rights, the Geneva conventions, and the UN  principles on a daily basis. Israel has been occupying the Arab  territories since 1967, confiscating the possessions of the Arab  citizens, establishing settlements, and dealing with the  Palestinian people very brutally. It does not hesitate to kill  children and women. It also confronts the Lebanese people's  struggle to liberate their land with raids, shelling, and  bombardment from land, air, and sea. Had Israel been concerned  about achieving peace, as its rulers claim, It would have  managed to render the Washington talks a success, and announced  its readiness to fully withdraw from the occupied Arab  territories, to implement the UN Security Council resolutions,  and achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.  What draws one attention is that the Israeli rulers have been  shedding tears on the threatened peace since the Hebron  massacre. They have not stop making calls to resume the talks.  Have they eventually been convinced that the policy of  maneuvering and intransigence, which they have been adopting  since the convening of the Madrid conference, will not be able  to affect the determination of Syria and the Arabs to restore  their occupied territories in full, and that peace cannot be  established through separate deals, but through the  implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions, as well  as through full abidance by the essence and bases of the U.S.  initiative; namely, the exchange of land for peace?    Only a few days ago, Yitzhaq Rabin admitted that there is  not  much time left, and that Israel must make decisions. However,  as usual, he did not explain the nature of these decisions. We  have no choice but to remind him that the decision awaited by  the whole world, without which there will be no solution or  peace in the Middle East, is the full Israeli withdrawal. The  Arabs have done everything possible to render the peace process  a success. Syria played a distinguished role in reactivating  the peace process, a role recognized by the international  community. Based on this, Israel alone will be responsible for  wasting the new opportunity provided by the UN Security Council  resolution, and by the international efforts that have been  persistent since the Hebron massacre, if it continues with the  policy of maneuvering and prevarication, and believes that it  can continue to disdain the power of the UN Security Council and  human mind.</p>

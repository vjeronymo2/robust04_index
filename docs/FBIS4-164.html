			<p>BFN     [Text] The Goldstone Commission says it has substantial  further information on some of the matters contained in its  interim report, which implicated top police generals in  so-called third force violence. Lieutenant General Basie Smit,  Major General Krappies Engelbrecht, and Lieutenant General Johan  le Roux were suspended last week after the Goldstone Commission  report implicated them in gun smuggling and violence.    Mr. Justice Goldstone said in a statement that this  information and any other information received would be handed  to the international team investigating the allegations.    The Johannesburg newspaper, THE STAR, reported earlier that  the commissioner of police, General Johan van der Merwe, said  that unless he received additional information on the so-called  third force from the Goldstone Commission, he would order the  suspended generals to resume duty tomorrow. Gen. van der Merwe  said the attorney general was assessing the prima facie value of  the evidence, and he expected to hear from him soon.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Join the dots: Viewed from afar, Clinton's foreign policy looks rather less chaotic A year ago, when I told a British friend I was going to Washington 'to find out whether Clinton has a foreign policy', the predictable response was: 'Well, I can save you the fare.' Since then, the US president's reputation in Europe has improved. His success in winning congressional approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement was generally appreciated, as was his contribution to the Uruguay Round. This year, he has been on three trips to Europe, and on the whole has made a good impression. Meanwhile, the US and Europe have learnt to work together on Bosnia, the single most divisive issue of 1993. The results fall well short of the miraculous, but the US can claim credit for providing the muscle which has enforced a kind of peace round Sarajevo, and for converting the bitter struggle between Croats and Moslems into a wary truce, if not a wholehearted alliance. Even Clinton's U-turn on relations with China, de-linking trade from human rights, has won more applause than brickbats in Europe, where it is generally regarded as part of the necessary learning process that every new US administration has to go through. It was therefore a slight shock to discover, on returning to Washington two weeks ago, that criticism of Clinton's foreign policy performance there is, if anything, more widespread and scathing than a year ago. The claim is not that it has got worse, but that it has failed to get better, and that after one and a half years in office this failure has become damaging to the president's domestic prestige. A series of personnel changes in the state department and National Security Council have indicated, but not cured, a foreign policy malaise within the administration, and it is now widely assumed that secretary of state Warren Christopher will himself be sacrificed after the mid-term elections in November. Actually I suspect the real failure is in domestic policy, which was Clinton's own chosen priority in the campaign that brought him to power. He gets little credit for an economic recovery which many seem to regard as statistical rather than real. Healthcare reform, the Clinton priority of priorities, has apparently backfired on him - or at least his sponsorship of it has become an embarrassment, so that Senate Democrats prefer to bring in their own version without the Clinton label. That reflects the erosion of public faith in his integrity caused by Whitewater, and in his competence caused by tales of chronic indecision seeping out of the White House, notably in The Agenda: Inside the Clinton White House, the recent book by Bob Woodward - and that in turn affects perceptions of his foreign policy performance. Indecisiveness was one of the main charges levelled against him at a Republican foreign policy forum two weeks ago. Perhaps the most trenchant was James Baker, secretary of state in the Bush administration, who says he will decide at year's end whether to run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996. After conceding that in some areas - Russia, the Middle East, trade - the Clinton administration had built on his own successes, Baker complained that there was 'no overall sense of dir-ection, . . . no sense of consistency, . . . fragmentation in authority, . . . a tendency to view foreign policy through the lens of domestic politics . . . and a seeming inability to understand the importance of American leadership.' Yet in a conversation with Baker last week, I found that he disagreed more with the manner than with the substance of the Clinton foreign policy - except, rather surprisingly, that he favours a rapid extension of Nato which could even include Russia. Not only east European countries such as Hungary, but also Ukraine and Russia would be less likely to go to war with each other if they were inside Nato, he explained. He felt the US should have been 'more resolute' in dealing with North Korea (but 'I don't mean sending troops or starting a war'), and that in Somalia it should have stuck to its original mission of famine relief, rather than changing it 'to one of nation-building'. In Bosnia, Baker said, the president's promise to send 25,000 US soldiers to implement the peace plan should 'be taken with a grain of salt - I'm not sure Congress will let him'. His main criticism was not so much that Clinton had failed to use force, as that 'on six or seven occasions' he had said he would and then not followed up, thereby damaging US credibility. Baker believes that US leadership in the post-cold-war world should be based on 'selective engagement': 'We have to look at each crisis and determine whether our national interests, principles and values require that we become involved.' In the Gulf war they did so require, but 'you can't make the same argument in Haiti'. The charge of vacillation is hard to rebut. It may be preferable to a knee-jerk response to each crisis, but undoubtedly public zigzags such as we have witnessed on both Bosnia and Haiti do make for a loss of credibility. More consistent presentation of foreign policy is one of the main objectives of David Gergen, the Republican spin merchant now seconded to the state department after a year struggling to put a gloss on Clinton's domestic policies. Good luck to him. But we outsiders should not let ourselves be bemused by the detail of presentation. We might do better to think of the Clinton foreign policy as a pointilliste painting. From close up, it looks a terrible mess. Stand far enough back and you get a more or less coherent picture, for which 'selective engagement' would be as good a title as any. What a pity Baker thought of it first.</p>

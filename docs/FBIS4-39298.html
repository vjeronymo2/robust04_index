			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Grigoriy Arslanov] </F>   [Text] Beidaihe June 6 TASS -- Qingquandao is China's  second largest port which is the world's number one in hauling  energy resources. It provides a convenient bridge linking  Russia's Far East with China's north-eastern and northern  regions.    "We are interested in the development of trade, economic,  scientific and technical ties with our Russian partners.  Prospects are particularly good in the sphere of shipping and  ship repairs," Qingquandao Mayor Cheng Lailee said in an  exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS. The mayor is taking part in  the work of the first Sino-Russian seminar-cum-fair in the  resort Beidaihe on the coast of the Yellow Sea, three hundred  kilometres from Beijing.    The seminar discusses everything that is of interest to  Russia and Chinese merchants, aviation and metallurgy,  car-building and mining, grain and vegetable oil, processing of  raw materials, the chemical, light and textile industries.    The seminar-cum-fair was organised by the Russian-Chinese  joint company Liangfa and the Russian LML Ltd.    The venue for the event was chosen to contribute to the  success of the gathering. In the past Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai  and other Chinese leaders used this retreat to hold conferences  on home and foreign policy and escape the heatwave in Beijing.  Patriarch of Chinese economic reforms Deng Xiaoping, chairman  Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng also favour the place.    Incidentally, it was here that the great helmsman said after  a regular swim in the sea that "one should never forget about  the class struggle," the phrase which provided the theoretical  basis for the subsequent cultural revolution.    Times have changed and there is nothing to remind people of  the class struggle or its proponent Mao Zedong apart from his  full- colour portraits displayed behind the windscreens of  trucks, just as Stalin's portraits used to be displayed in  Soviet Union. China now values those who can make money.    "Actual links between Qingquandao, which is pursuing a  favourable trade, economic and investment policy, with Russia  are just taking shape," Cheng Lailee said. The first  Chinese-Russian joint venture has already been set up in the  city. Qingquandao is a link between the outside world and  China's Bohai economic region, which has long since maintained a  favourable base for the development of mutually beneficial  business links between China and Russia, which were discussed  during the recent talks between the heads of the two governments  Viktor Chernomyrdin and Li Peng.    The main objective of the seminar-cum-fair is to combine the  efforts of businessmen from the two countries. The next such  meeting "Beijing-Moscow: New Horizons" will be held in Hotel  Cosmos in the Russian capital in August.    "The idea of regular practice-oriented seminars and fairs  for  representatives of the business communities of Russia and China  originated when everybody understood that the immense potential  of trade and economic relations of the Russian Federation and  China remains largely untapped," said general director of the  Lianfa Company Petr Gvaskov. "it could not be fully used for  lack of sufficient information about new forms of cooperation,  benefits available in China, forms of payment and their  organisation in yuan," Gvaskov said.    For the first time in bilateral trade and economic practice  the Chinese and Russian participants are provided with  information on taxation procedures in China and Russia, visas  and customs rules. In addition, Lianfa has published a  collection of relevant official regulatory enactments of the  Russian Federation.    The event has proved its commercial worth: on the first day  of its work a contract worth 29 million dollars was signed for  the lease of five Russian Tu-154M's for use by airlines in the  provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.    Beidaihe attracts Chinese and foreign tourists and business  people not only by its wonderful beaches, cottages, greenery and  Chinese cuisine but also by its medical facilities, including  the centre of Xiguno-therapy, whose specialists cure diseases  without medicines. The first villas were built here a hundred  years ago under the Qin dynasty. By 1949 twenty foreign  countries had built their summer houses in Beidaihe.    Beidaihe offers a wonderful chance of combining recreation  and business to residents of the Urals, Siberia and the Far  East, fishermen, gold miners and oilmen. The opening of a new  airline linking Russia to the city of Shanghaiguan, which is  located next to Beidaihe, will make such trips quite feasible  very soon.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Martins Virsis, parliamentary secretary of </F> the Latvian Foreign Affairs Ministry and chief negotiator on  Russian troop withdrawal, by Aivars Ozolins; place and date not  given: "We Have No Wish To Prolong It" --]    [Excerpts] [Ozolins]In this round of negotiations,  neither the final agreement nor any other documents were  initialed or signed, as was foreseen by both Russia and Latvia.  What were the reasons for this?    [Virsis] We could not manage to find a common language on  some principal positions. First, regarding payments, second --  the social security of Russian Army pensioners.    I would not say that the situation is tragic or dramatic. To  move forward on these issues, both sides must change their  instructions and positions.    [Ozolins]Is it a question of extending their  powers?    [Virsis] Either extending them or providing different  instructions. It does not concern us so much as it does the  Russians; still, the Russians might think quite the opposite.    [Ozolins]Does it mean that the Russian delegation is  not authorized to agree with the change in the amount of the  payment?    [Virsis] It is apparent that [Russian chief negotiator]  Zotov  does not have such power. Naturally the way in which he  explains it all -- why he can not, what is the balance of  payments, that there is $4.5 billion left over -- this is their  interpretation. Everybody has a right to express their opinion,  but in this concrete situation, this is not a correct proposal.  It is very difficult for us to permit the continued operation  of the Skrunda radar station for another four years, and what we  are talking about is not rent for the land, but direct usage of  this facility.    [Ozolins]In an interview with SM-SEGODNIA [as  published], Zotov maintains that this agreement is probably more  necessary for Latvia than for Russia, and that Russia is  actually not interested in signing it any more. Could you  comment on this?    [Virsis] He did not say this to me. One may say different  things when speaking to journalists, and something else when  speaking officially. If this is the official position of  Russia, then there would really be no point in continuing our  talks.    [Ozolins]In Zotov's view, much more important is the  problem of ensuring the social security of retired military  personnel.    [Virsis] I think there are no grounds for such a linking of  issues -- either Skrunda or military pensioners.    Such an attitude on the part of Russia has developed  historically. Since the beginning of the negotiations, Russia  has consistently maintained these demands for the two agreements  -- on social security of military personnel, and social security  of war pensioners. At first, they were part of the main  agreement. Later, to move forward with the main agreement, they  were separated.    From this point of view, they are connected with the process  of military withdrawal, however they can by no means be  connected with Skrunda.    [Ozolins]What kind of a compromise would Latvia be  inclined to accept concerning the military pensioners? What are  Latvia's demands?    [Virsis] Regarding military pensioners who have permanent  registration and who therefore are living as permanent  residents, it is a question of their choice -- whether they wish  to become Latvian citizens and, in this case, they will have to  go through the respective procedure foreseen by Latvian  legislation, or if they wish something else. In the latter case,  it will be a matter of Latvian laws concerning the stay of  foreigners or stateless persons. The problem of military  personnel who were retired later or arranged their stay during  the last two years, will be more complicated.    [Ozolins]Is the number of these people known?    [Virsis] Different numbers are given. The Northwestern Army  Group has the most precise information. We can speak about 420  people who have stayed here since 28 January 1992, when Russia  took the Soviet Army under its jurisdiction. During this  period, 2,800 were demobilized. At the same time, 2,500 officers  left Latvia -- but I do not know how many of them were those who  were demobilized. If these figures are true, than the above  mentioned figure of 420 might be correct. The only question is  -- whether the 2,500 people included those who were demobilized  after 28 January 1992, because there is a possibility that those  who were demobilized earlier could also leave.    [Ozolins]Can we say that Russian foreign policy towards  the Baltic states has undergone a change, taking into account,  for instance, the statements made by Zotov in the beginning of  February in IZVESTIYA, in which he expressed a much more  aggressive attitude towards the Baltic states, using the  opportunity of the incident between Rucs and the generals.    [Virsis] In my opinion, the general attitude, since  September  1991, though not expressed clearly, arises from the regret that  the Baltic states are gone. This attitude has always existed,  but it is being more and more stressed, defined, and specified  recently, the accents are emphasized more clearly and are  becoming more comprehensive for us, as well as for the Russian  people and the Western world.    [Ozolins]Do you think that these accents could become  stronger and turn into a definite policy?    [Virsis] It is difficult to predict it, but it is possible  that things will develop that way.    [Ozolins]Do you find the present interest in the  security of the Baltic region shown by the Western countries  short- lived? As soon as the agreement is concluded, the  interest will die and we shall be left again, eye-to-eye with  Russia.    [Virsis] It is provided by us in the agreement that  regarding  Skrunda, first of all, the CSCE will be the institution to  oversee its fulfillment. This means control, inspection,  sometimes extra inspections if necessary. We should not think  that we will be left alone. Of course, it was clear from the  beginning that in terms of security guarantees from Western  countries, we could expect such guarantees from none of them,  regardless of how powerful they are. Besides, the bigger the  distance from that country to the one that is seeking  guarantees, the more difficult the realization of the guarantees  would be. The best example would be Great Britain and Poland in  September 1939. There were guarantees, but they could not be  fulfilled. Therefore the question now does not concern direct  guarantees, but the political "texture" which is being "woven"  right now and in which elements of our security are also  designed. It is very delicate as yet, but it can be developed  further.    It may seem paradoxical, but if not for the complicated  situation with Skrunda...    [Ozolins]There would be less interest in us?    [Virsis] These were not my words exactly. Nevertheless, this  could be one of reasons why the global powers and NATO -- and  not only NATO -- should watch northeastern Europe more  intensively. I do not want to single out Latvia, because it  also applies to Estonia and Lithuania, as well as to our  Scandinavian friends. Therefore, I shall cite Mao, who taught  us that some value can be gained even from an unhappy situation.    [Ozolins]The supervision of CSCE is very important, but  most probably the attitude of the global powers will be crucial.  Do you think they will maintain their interest for all four  years and eighteen months?    [Virsis] I hope very much that their interest will not be  the  same as it is now. At present, we see them in a very "pressed"  situation. Many problems have yet to be resolved. In my  opinion, the United States and the EC are interested in our  settling the agreement with Russia, because it will allow us to  integrate more quickly in Europe. This is really the only  normal way to maintain their interest in security issues. One  has to remember that the EC is not entirely a political or  economic organization.    This is simply a very tense and painful period in our  relations with Russia. At the same time, the EC has already  worked out some conditions of our movement toward integration,  but surely they would be more definite and positive if our  relations with Russia were regulated by an agreement.    (Ozolins]Do foresee a possibility -- at least  theoretically -- that we could be accepted to NATO even with the  Skrunda radar station?    [Virsis] No. Of course this is only my personal view. It  may turn out another way.    [Ozolins]So at least six years must pass before we will  be able to speak seriously about joining this organization?    [Virsis] There are also other political institutions for  security. First of all, the Western European Union, to which  Latvia and other Baltic and East European states belong as  members of its consultative forum, but we can become associated  members. It is a small but very heavy "brick." It is not NATO,  but very near it. [passage omitted]    [Ozolins]When could the agreement with Russia be  signed?    [Virsis] [passage omitted] Speaking about Latvia's attitude,  we are not the ones that are in the mood to prolong it.    [Ozolins]But this is just what Zotov accuses -- that we  are dragging our feet.    [Virsis] The interpretations of Mr. Zotov are also  meaningful. He is a professional diplomat. I am a professional  historian. I am fixing dates and facts, he interprets them.</p>

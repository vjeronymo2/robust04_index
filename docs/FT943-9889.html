			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Japanese bank raises interest rate The Industrial Bank of Japan, a leading Japanese long-term credit bank, raised its long-term prime rate - the rate charged on loans to first-tier clients - yesterday for the first time in five months in response to a rise in yields on the government bond market. The bank's increase of its long-term prime rate, a benchmark for corporate lending rates, by 30 basis points to 4.7 per cent will be effective from tomorrow. Although corporate demand for funds have been low because of the prolonged recession, the rise in loan rates may squeeze demand even further. Heightened expectations of an economic recovery and a fall in the yen against the dollar has weighed upon the government bond market, and long-term yields rose to a 14 month high of 4.63 per cent last Friday. The rise has affected short-term rates, and could affect profitability at corporations and banks because of the rise in interest payments.</p>

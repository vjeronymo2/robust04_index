			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (16): Topics in the next issue SOFTWARE AT WORK: the FT review of business software Themes for the September issue of Software At Work will include: INTEGRATED ACCOUNTING: The history of commercial computing started with accounting, as a financial function, but in many companies has moved to centre-stage, dealing with marketing, manufacturing, and other core activities. Integrating these activities with accounting allows a company of any size to streamline its operations. MANUFACTURING: 'Just-in-time' and other manufacturing philosophies enable companies to become more efficient, but to operate successfully, the system often has to pervade every area of operation, forcing workers in the office and on the shop floor to take a new view of jobs and priorities. Request a questionnaire for users and suppliers from the secretary of Software at Work in London on 071-873 4090, or write to: Financial Times, Secretary, Software At Work, Number One, Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL</p>

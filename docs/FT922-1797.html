			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Letter: Some honours easier to see than others I am a trifle bemused by the Queen's birthday honours and list of working peers. I suppose I can understand Mr M T Thomasin-Foster, chairman, Consultation Panel on Badgers and Tuberculosis, CBE, but, please, what is meant by Mr J Arkell, consultant, British Invisibles, OBE? Does it have anything to do with H G Wells? Aaron M Fine, Attorneys at law, Fine, Kaplan and Black, 23rd Floor, 1845 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103</p>

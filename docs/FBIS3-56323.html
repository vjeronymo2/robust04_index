He  believes that the islands of Kunashir, Iturup, Shikotan and  Habomai, claimed by Japan, "belong to Russia and there is no  question of handing them over now."    Shumeyko was giving his first news conference as Speaker of  the Upper House of the Russian Federal Assembly.    Shumeyko said that the prime minister's view was shared by  the other Cabinet members.    At the same time Shumeyko admitted that this view was  different somewhat from the official one.</p>

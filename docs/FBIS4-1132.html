			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by S Denny] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 21 SAPA -- The Federal Party [FP]  stands for maximum devolution of power, direct democracy and  entrenched fundamental freedoms. Releasing its election  manifesto in Johannesburg on Thursday [21 April], the FP said  devolution forced local governments to compete for investment  and workers. "Devolution of power will reduce political  violence, which is caused by centralisation of the past and  centralisation entrenched in the interim constitution," the  party's leader Frances Kendall said. The FP believed central  government should have power only over matters of national  interest, including national defence, foreign affairs, foreign  trade, national trade and the protection of entrenched  fundamental rights.    Resolving the land issue was South Africa's toughest  challenge, Ms Kendall said, adding it was important not to abuse  property rights further. "A land court should address specific  claims and compensation. All government-owned land and housing  should be transferred to private ownership with freehold title.  Legislation which protects inefficient farmers and prevents  sub-division of land should be repealed," she said.    Calling for voucher systems for the poor and for education,  the FP manifesto said these would be used to subsidise rent or  to buy homes or for education.    A bill of rights should be entrenched without a "limitation"  clause and should protect people from an abusive government.  The current constitution allowed government to suspend the bill  of rights "when it is needed most -- under a state of emergency".    South Africa's new constitutional court was elitist and  should be abolished, the party said. "Ordinary courts should  interpret and apply the constitution and every person should  have the right to trial by jury."</p>

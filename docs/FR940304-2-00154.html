			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Keff calculations include uncertainties at a 95%/95% probability confidence level. Thus, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the nuclear criticality margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conservative methods and assumptions were used to calculate the maximum fuel temperature and the increase in SFP water temperature. The thermal-hydraulic evaluation employed methods previously used to evaluate existing spent fuel racks. The results demonstrate that the temperature margins of safety are maintained. The proposed modification, with the fuel inventory, will increase the heat load in the SFP. However, the decay time prior to refueling operations was increased from 100 to 168 hours to reduce the initial SFP cooling requirements. Evaluation results indicate that the existing SFP cooling system can maintain the bulk pool water temperature at or below 149 F under normal discharge scenarios. The maximum allowable temperature for bulk boiling is not exceeded for the calculated increase in pool heat load. Maximum local water temperatures, along the hottest fuel assembly, remain below the nucleate boiling condition. While no nucleate boiling is indicated for the standard storage condition, an assumption of 50% cell blockage results in a possible highly localized two-phase condition near the top of the fuel. Fuel clad thermal stresses remain less than 7000 psi, which is considerably lower than the endurance limit of the clad material. Thus, there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety for thermal-hydraulic or SFP cooling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maintaining the spent fuel assemblies in a safe configuration during normal and abnormal loadings is the primary safety function of the SFP and racks. Abnormal loading associated with an earthquake, a spent fuel assembly drop, or the drop of any other heavy object were considered. The mechanical, material, and structural design of the new spent fuel racks complies with applicable portions of the NRC OT Position Paper. Rack materials are compatible with the spent fuel pool environment and the spent fuel assemblies. The structural assessment of the new racks concluded that tilting and deflection or movement will not result in impact in the active fuel region during postulated seismic events. In addition, the spent fuel assemblies remain intact with no criticality concerns. Thus, there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety for mechanical, material and structural considerations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. Written comments may also be delivered to room P&hyph;223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

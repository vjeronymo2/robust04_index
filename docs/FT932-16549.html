			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Holset buys into eastern Germany HOLSET Engineering, the Huddersfield-based producer of turbochargers and other diesel engine parts owned by Cummins Engine of the US, has bought Dresden-based Kompressorenbau Bannewitz (KBB) from the Treuhand agency in eastern Germany. Mr Alec Wallace, director and general manager for Holset turbochargers, said the deal filled 'a huge hole' for the company, which had been looking for a manufacturing presence in Germany to add to its European facilities in the UK, France and Spain. Holset has agreed to maintain the workforce at the current level of 165 for five years, and also to invest a total of DM3.5m. KBB is currently making a loss, but Mr Wallace said it should be breaking even by the end of the year. 'Its product range is pretty good, quality standards are acceptable, but it has very little marketing skill.' One of the attractions for Holset was its complementary technology. Holset, which has 2,000 employees worldwide, is not disclosing the price it paid for KBB. But usually such purchases from the Treuhand are for nominal amounts.</p>

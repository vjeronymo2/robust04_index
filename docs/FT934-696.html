			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Legal means not best way to deal with late payers Sir, You are right to point out that, while a legal right to interest may help resolve the growing problem of late payment, suppliers will always be wary of using the legislation for fear of antagonising purchasers ('Flaws in the German model', December 21). In this respect, Financial Times readers might like to consider some ideas recently put forward by the Labour party in its consultative document Into the Growth Corridor - Helping Small Businesses to Succeed. This suggests several measures which could be considered before legislation. Public sector organisations could be required to pay within 30 days or pay interest on the outstanding amount; public companies could be required to identify and publish their payment practices in their annual report. In addition, the introduction of a code of practice on the payment of debts could be made a requirement for companies achieving quality standards such as BS 5750. The introduction of legislation would be considered only in the light of the results of these actions.

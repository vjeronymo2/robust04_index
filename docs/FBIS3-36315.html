But They Do Not Know it Yet in  Georgia"]    [Text] For all the variety of party movements in Georgia  and serious differences of views between loyalists of one party  or another, they all met Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's victory in the  Russian elections with unanimous silence. Only Zurab Gagnidze,  candidate of philosophic sciences and leader of the Georgian  National Ideology Party, has sent a congratulatory telegram to  Vladimir Volfovich on behalf of his supporters. "We are  confident that your victory will have a positive influence on  the attainment of genuine freedom in Georgia," the telegram  says. "Zhirinovskiy is a nationalist in the good sense of the  word," Gagnidze believes. We concluded from a conversation with  the leader of national ideologists that he is attracted by the  Liberal Democrats' economic program, Zhirinovskiy's desire to  cut down the bureaucracy, and his struggle against American  aggression. Zurab Gagnidze opposes the withdrawal of Russian  troops from Georgia, saying that there has been not a single  serious conflict in the decades while Russian soldiers were  present here.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BAe confident that Avro will break even by 1997 British Aerospace expects its lossmaking Avro regional jet operations to break even by 1997; earlier if the regional aircraft market recovers more quickly as a result of the extensive restructuring of the past three years. Avro is expected to lose about Pounds 50m this year on sales of between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m. Mr Michael Donovan, Avro's new chief executive, said yesterday that break-even would be achieved even without a joint venture with other regional jet manufacturers. The company has shed 6,000 jobs in the last three years and now employs only 2,000 at its assembly facility at Woodford, near Manchester. Mr Donovan was speaking at the hand-over of the first of three Avro RJ85 jets to Lufthansa's regional subsidiary, Cityline. The German airline is the first large international flag carrier to order the aircraft. 'The delivery to Lufthansa represents a milestone in the history of Avro, and indeed British Aerospace,' said Mr Donovan. Lufthansa has also taken options to acquire an additional three RJ aircraft. Talks are continuing between BAe and Fokker, the Dutch regional aircraft manufacturer owned by Deutsche Aerospace, on the establishment of a regional aircraft joint venture modelled on European Airbus, the large airliner consortium. These discussions are likely to take time, although both companies acknowledge that they share a vision of the need to regroup in the European regional jet market. BAe is also keeping its options open over possible collaboration with Asia-Pacific manufacturers, since it believes that Asia will become the biggest market for regional jets. BAe failed to negotiate a regional jet joint venture with Taiwan last year, but Taiwan is understood to be still interested. Mr Donovan stressed that any joint venture would be customer-driven. Although the industrial logic argued in favour of a European grouping of regional jet manufacturers to reduce excess capacity, European manufacturers had to be open to possible joint ventures with Asian partners - a prerequisite for large-scale aircraft sales in that region. This year Avro has won 18 orders for its jets (equivalent to one year's production) and has an order backlog of 29 aircraft. At its peak five years ago, BAe was producing about 40 regional jets from its two assembly lines at Woodford and Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Hatfield has since been closed. BAe is also continuing its search for joint venture partners for its lossmaking turbo-propeller activities regrouped around Prestwick, Scotland. This represents a more difficult challenge as the turbo-prop business is estimated to be losing some Pounds 150m a year. Unlike the regional jet operations, the future of the turbo-prop side hinges on a joint venture since the company believes it is highly unlikely that these activities can break even on their own. BAe has been talking to the Franco-Italian ATR consortium. The problem for the turbo-prop business is that regional airlines are tending to trade up their turbo-prop aircraft for jets. Overall, BAe is confident its commercial aircraft operations - which turned over Pounds 1.6bn last year - will be profitable by 1997, largely because of the contribution from its 20 per cent stake in the Airbus consortium. Airbus is already contributing profits.</p>

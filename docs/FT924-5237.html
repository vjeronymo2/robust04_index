			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Grupo Torras defaults on Dollars 400m loans GRUPO TORRAS, the Spanish investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), has defaulted this week on a Dollars 200m loan from Credit Suisse and another Dollars 200m credit from Bank of America. The KIO is obliged to repay the debt, further deepening the crisis surrounding its Spanish empire. The defaults come as the Torras board, chaired by Mr Ali Rashaid al-Bader, president of the KIO, met in London yesterday to consider placing the Torras group in receivership. Torras, which owns controlling stakes in some of Spain's biggest manufacturing companies, has debts of more than Dollars 3bn, its management says. It is understood that the KIO auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick, and its lawyers, Stephenson Harwood, have told the KIO that placing Torras under judicial management would be a viable way of extracting the Kuwaitis from Spanish commitments entered into by the KIO's former management and its Spanish partners. The problem with receivership is that it might reflect badly on the books of the KIO, which has loans outstanding to Torras. Also it is not certain that these loans would be given preferential treatment by the receivers as they could be regarded as equity. Some analysts believe talk of a possible receivership might be designed to frighten bank creditors into renegotiating loans through the entire Torras group. A senior adviser to the KIO in London denied reports that a firm decision had been made to begin legal action against Mr Javier de la Rosa, the KIO's former business partner in Spain, and the two former KIO leaders who directed the Spanish investments - Mr Fouad Jaffar, the KIO former general manager, and Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah, who retired as KIO chairman last February. Stephenson Harwood and Peat Marwick have completed a preliminary investigation into allegations by the new KIO management that the Dollars 3.4bn invested in Spain between 1986 and last May was misappropriated. The KIO says it has seen no return on those investments. A Spanish lawyer has been hired to study the report and to decide whether legal action is viable. KIO sources said this could take up to two months. Although the default notices this week from Credit Suisse and Bank of America on the Torras loans automatically trigger guarantees by the KIO, they also reflect the deepening concern in international banking circles about how the new KIO and Torras management is dealing with the crisis. Credit Suisse on Tuesday cited Torras' decision a month ago not to approve its 1991 accounts as a reason for calling in its loan, plus more than Dollars 2m in interest.</p>

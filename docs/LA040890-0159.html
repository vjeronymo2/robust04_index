			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 4TH BODY FOUND IN HOTEL FIRE; SEARCH FOR OTHERS CONTINUING  </P> <P> A fourth body was found Saturday as authorities continued a top-to-bottom  search of the wreckage of a hotel that was swept by fire as residents slept.  </P> <P> Fourteen tenants were still unaccounted for in the fire that hit the Fontana  Hotel before dawn Friday. However, the four bodies found have not been  identified, so they could be among the 14 missing tenants.  </P> <P> "We believe there are more victims inside," police Capt. Rocco DeLeo said.  "What we are doing is getting details from relatives of people who, we believe,  are missing and getting the physical characteristics of these persons."  </P> <P> All but one of the 102 rooms were rented out, but no one is sure exactly how  many people were in the hotel at the time of the fire, said Olimpia Mihai, one  of the Fontana's owner-managers. Estimates of the number of inhabitants have  ranged up to 150; the registration records were burned in the fire.  </P> <P> As federal, state and city teams launched a search, a crane was brought in to  help pick apart the ruins of the hotel.  </P> <P> With the cause of the fire still a mystery, U.S. Magistrate Linnea Johnson  issued a search warrant at the request of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco  and Firearms to preserve any evidence that might be needed later. The bureau  conducts arson investigations.  </P> <P> Mayor Alex Daoud said fire officials told him Friday that arson was strongly  suspected, but Fire Chief Branaird Dorris said tenants had mentioned a water  leak, which raised the possibility of an electrical short.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. Dexter Lehtinen, who donned a hard hat to inspect the three-story  hotel, said the purpose of the warrant was to legally preserve any possible  evidence.  </P> <P> Asked when the death toll would be known, Robert Creighton, ATF agent in charge  of the Florida office, said: "We may have that in two days. It all depends on  what we find."  </P></p>

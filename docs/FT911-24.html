			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Nordstrom boosts earnings NORDSTROM, the Seattle-based retailer managed by the founding Nordstrom family, yesterday turned in sharply higher first-quarter earnings and said it had settled federal and state securities class action lawsuits for Dollars 7.5m. Mr John Goesling, Nordstrom's senior vice-president, said the results 'compare favourably with what we regarded as a disappointing performance during the previous year's first quarter.' Net income leapt 95 per cent to Dollars 25.7m, or 31 cents a share, from Dollars 13.2m, or 16 cents, a year earlier. Net sales grew 10 per cent in the three months to Dollars 610.6m from Dollars 555m. Shares in Nordstrom jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 44 yesterday in active over-the-counter trading. The company attributed its improved performance to improving sales trends, better management of inventories and steps taken in the previous year to reduce operating expenses. During the quarter, Nordstrom reduced its selling, general and administrative expenses to 27.65 per cent of sales from 29.4 per cent a year earlier. Pre-tax earnings jumped 101 per cent to Dollars 41.4m, or 6.77 per cent of sales, from Dollars 20.6m, or 3.71 per cent of sales, a year earlier. Nordstrom also said yesterday that it had settled a number of lawsuits alleging that the company and six of its officers failed to disclose that Nordstrom might be liable for additional employee compensation arising from Nordstrom's past employee practices. In the last year, Nordstrom's reputation has been clouded by a union dispute and by revelations that the company's commission sales force is not properly compensated. Mr Goesling said: 'While we have not yet resolved with our insurance company their share of this settlement, we are confident that any payment made by the company will not have a material effect on the results of operations for the year.' The settlement, which is subject to court approval, provides for payment of Dollars 7.5m to shareholders who bought Nordstrom stock between February 1 1988 and March 8 1990.</p>

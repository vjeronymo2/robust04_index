			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Birmingham hits back in row over facilities Birmingham City Council, stung by the charge that it has spent too much on international facilities and not enough on education, yesterday counter-attacked by arguing that the facilities support 16,800 jobs in the West Midlands. The calculation is contained in the summary of a report, by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, on the local and regional economic impact of the National Exhibition Centre, the International Convention Centre and the National Indoor Arena. According to KPMG's survey the facilities attracted 4.5m visitors in the year to August, at least 66 per cent from outside the West Midlands. They spent Pounds 435m, of which Pounds 180m stayed in the region. This led to the creation or sustaining of 16,800 jobs, of which 5,800 were in Birmingham. Publication of the figures is an attempt to justify council spending priorities against local and national criticism. Mr Andrew Coulson, chairman of the council's NEC-ICC committee, said: 'No other investments could have generated 17,000 jobs into the West Midlands especially at a time of industrial reces-sion.' KPMG said investment in the facilities 'forms an integral part of Birmingham City Council's overall economic development strategy to create additional employment for Birmingham residents'. Advisers recruited by the council to form an education commission had called for a switch of priorities away from international facilities to a crash programme of educational improvement. They said education spending had been Pounds 236m less than the government thought appropriate over the last five years. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, has argued that the city council's stewardship of its schools is so bad that they should be handed over to central government control.</p>

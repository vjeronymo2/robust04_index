			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Purchase gives fillip to Wassall shares Supporters of Wassall, the conglomerate whose acquisitive ambitions have been thwarted in recent years, have waited a long time for yesterday's big deal. Expectations were extremely high and they were not disappointed. Wassall's shares rose 18p to a new high of 320p as the acquisition met with universal approval from the company's followers. Mr Paul Beaufrere, analyst at James Capel, the broker, summed up: 'If you had put down on paper everything that Wassall wanted from a deal you would come up with this.' Mr Chris Miller, chief executive, said it closely matches Wassall's six main acquisition criteria. Established markets. General Cable serves three main markets in electrical, telecommunications and consumer cables. It is among the market leaders in both the electrical and consumer sectors, which generate two thirds of its sales and are growing steadily. In telecommunications it makes the heavy duty copper cable that connects telephone exchanges - now almost entirely a replacement market following the introduction of fibre optic cable - and is a smaller player in the fast-growing data transmission market. Everyday products. General Cable makes mainly low-technology products which find their way into most American homes, cars and offices. Its products have a high copper content - it is thought to be the biggest purchaser of copper in the US - and relatively little labour content. This makes it relatively immune to import threats, since the transport costs are high and the savings to be had by using cheap non-US labour are modest. The group makes more than 10,000 different products and Mr Miller said it was 'inconceivable' that they were all profitable. 'But they do not have the information available to tell.' Introducing such systems will be one of Wassall's first tasks. Asset-backed. Wassall is paying Dollars 269.8m (Pounds 180m) for net assets valued at Dollars 331m at the end of 1993. The purchase price is less than General Cable's Dollars 320m of inventories and receivables. 'The copper inventory is simply far too high, with partly-worked copper lying about all over the place.' Potentially cash-generative. 'It is not cash generative at the moment, but it very shortly will be,' said Mr Miller, pointing to the company's high depreciation charge. Poor relative performance. General Cable made an operating profit of just Dollars 2.3m on sales of Dollars 763.5m last year, compared with a loss of Dollars 32.9m on sales of Dollars 800.8m the previous year. Although most of its markets have been hit by recession, Mr Miller says this is poor even by the standards of an industry which is 'not particularly well run'. Some of General Cable's competitors in the low added value markets are already making margins of over 5 per cent while General Cable's figures for the first quarter of this year show margins recovering to 2.7 per cent on sales up by more than 10 per cent to Dollars 191.8m. Mr Miller said he would be 'amazed' if it was ever a 10 per cent margin business but added: 'Even if we only get it up to industry standards then it will be a pretty good deal.' It has 22 factories 'not producing at anywhere near capacity, which are where they are for distant historical reasons'. History of under-investment. Until it was partially demerged in 1992 General Cable was wholly owned by American Premier Underwriters, a privately-held financial services group which ran it for cash. 'The managers were not allowed to spend any money with more than a two-year payback,' said Mr Miller, who stressed that the capital investment needs were 'tens of millions of dollars, rather than hundreds of millions'.</p>

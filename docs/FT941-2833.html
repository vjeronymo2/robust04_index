			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bugatti ownership revealed Mr Romano Artioli, an Italian entrepreneur, has emerged as the 100 per cent owner of Bugatti International, the Luxembourg-registered holding company, which last year acquired Group Lotus, the UK sports car maker and automotive engineering consultancy from General Motors. The ownership of Bugatti International has remained a mystery ever since the company was formed in the late 1980s, with ambitious plans to revive the prestigious Bugatti marque and develop a new range of 200mph supercars. Mr Mario Barbieri, vice-chairman of Bugatti Automobili, said that Artioli family interests now held 100 per cent of the equity in Bugatti International, following a move by Mr Artioli to exercise various options allowing him to take full control. Bugatti International is planning to seek outside finance to help fund ambitious new model programmes that are being developed by both Group Lotus and Bugatti Automobili. Bugatti refused to reveal the identity of the previous shareholders, but said that Mr Artioli had held a majority interest in Bugatti International from the outset. Bugatti has engaged CS First Boston as financial adviser, and Price Waterhouse as auditor.</p>

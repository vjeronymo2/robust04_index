			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE VANISHING SAND  </P> <P> Thank you for your article on the sand-mining operations on the San Luis Rey  River. The attitude at the county seems to be if one sand mine is good, then  five will be wonderful.  </P> <P> What is not mentioned in the article is the destruction of the once-beautiful  California 76. Ironically, the county considers it a No. 1 priority scenic  route. I really doubt that anyone from the county has looked at it lately. With  the removal of large trees, piles of large rocks right up to the highway and  huge sand piles, it looks more like a slum.  </P> <P> We at Rancho Monserate Country Club, a senior-citizen mobile home park, have  been inundated with sand. The prevailing winds from Oceanside send it  throughout the park. Aside from the continual work of dusting and sweeping,  there is the health problems it creates with residents suffering from chronic  lung disease.  </P> <P> Now we are faced with even more sand mining. A new major-use permit has been  applied for by Millie Vessels, whose land abuts this subdivision. She is asking  for sand mining on 560 acres. In addition, Hal Jensen is asking for a major-use  permit for a rock quarry, asphalt plant and cement factory on Rosemary's  Mountain, and it includes continual sand mining of the San Luis Rey for 20  years.  </P> <P> It does make you wonder where it will all end. We can only pray for extremely  heavy rainfall and large floods in order to move the sand to Oceanside and stop  this effort to ruin the river.  </P> <P> JEANNE RAY  </P> <P> Fallbrook  </P></p>

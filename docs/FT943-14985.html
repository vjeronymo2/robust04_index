			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Observer: Peanut index One of the things Deutsche Bank chairman Hilmar Kopper will not want to be remembered for is that he was the man who introduced 'peanuts' into the popular German banking vocabulary. He first coined the term several months ago to describe the DM50m owed to tradesmen working for the bankrupt Jurgen Schneider property group. Kopper's throwaway remark at a press conference was immediately picked up (and translated into German) by the domestic tabloid press, which seized on it to illustrate the big banks' arrogance at a time of recession. Despite a belated, and somewhat grudging, apology from Kopper, it is starting to take hold in Frankfurt business and banking circles as a convenient unit of account. As in: Deutsche Bank will have to make a 10 peanuts - alias DM500m  -provision against likely bad debts on its exposure to Schneider. But a backlash is already under way. 'Because we're speaking German here, I'm not going to use the word peanuts,' said Kajo Neukirchen, chairman of the Metallgesellschaft group last week, rebuffing a request to know how many peanuts the group hoped to raise from the sale of its mining activities. (The answer: about 10.)</p>

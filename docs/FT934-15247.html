			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Needham warns France that Gatt stance may harm EC FRENCH efforts to protect its subsidised farm exports, which are putting in jeopardy a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation, could inflict enormous damage on the European Community, Mr Richard Needham, UK trade minister, warned yesterday. On the eve of a high-profile trade-promotion visit to China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Mr Needham insisted Britain 'could not stand back and agree to fall in with a protectionist Europe'. 'If one country in the EC wrecks the Uruguay Round, they have to know it will do enormous damage to the Community,' he said. His comments come in the wake of drab trade figures showing UK exports in July to the depressed markets of Europe - which account for almost 60 per cent of all British exports - fell to Pounds 4.85bn, their lowest level for 18 months. In contrast, exports to non-EC countries are 2.5 per cent up on the year, with sales to China up by 90 per cent. 'These figures illustrate well the new British priority being given to Asia's markets,' Mr Needham said. This will be his fourth visit to China since assuming office last year. Complaining about the comparatively poor performance of UK exporters in Asia, Mr Needham said the government intended to exploit more effectively the Crown Agents, the Commonwealth Development Corporation, and multilateral agencies such as the World Bank in seeking contracts in Asia and other parts of the developing world. He noted that last year, France won 15 per cent of World Bank procurement contracts in the developing world, and Italy 12.8 per cent, while the UK won just 2.2 per cent. David Buchan adds from Paris: Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is today to spell out proposals for an interim world trade deal this year to break the current impasse in the Gatt negotiations. He called seven of his ministers together yesterday to discuss his idea of identifying a list of trade issues which could be settled by the December 15 deadline agreed between the EC, the US and other main Gatt participants, leaving the rest for later negotiation. But several officials conceded that they were 'in the dark' about much of the state of bargaining in several of the 15 Gatt areas of negotiations, because Sir Leon Brittan, EC chief negotiator, and his Brussels officials 'have not chosen to enlighten us'.</p>

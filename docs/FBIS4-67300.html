Potdar, designated judge  dealing with cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic  Substances Act, has acquitted a Nigerian national who was  accused of being in possession of over 16 kg of brown sugar on  the ground that there were discrepancies in the police version  and that the prosecution had not been able to prove its case.    Bernard Ugochukwa Acaribe was arrested at Bombay Central  railway station at about 3.30 p.m. on April 6, 1989. The police  said he was carrying a big suitcase in which were 18 Samsonite  rexin handbags containing brown sugar. Samples of the brown  powder were sent to the chemical analyser who confirmed that it  was a crude form of heroin.    The accused was arrested and was subsequently charge-sheeted  on January 27, 1994. He was brought to trial before Judge  Potdar. Before the trial commenced, however, the drug allegedly  seized from the Nigerian was destroyed in keeping with the  provisions of section 52 of the Act. The accused told the court  that he had been falsely implicated in the case.    He alleged that he had not been arrested at Bombay Central  station at all and that he had, in fact, been picked up at  Marine Drive area on April 6, 1989. He said that the drugs were  not found on him and that the suitcase and its contents were  planted on him. Judge Potdar recorded in his order that it was  difficult to believe that the Nigerian was guilty of the offence  alleged against him since there were material discrepancies  between the evidence given by police officers and a panch  witness.    The judge also found fault with the chemical analyser's  report since it did not mention the per cent of the drug in the  brown powder that was seized. While one police officer, Mr  Bagwan, told the court that he did not remember how the suitcase  was opened, another officer, Mr Birje, stated that it had a  combination lock. However, the panch witness testified that the  accused opened the bag with a key. All the three were part of  the raiding party that arrested the Nigerian.    While one of the police officers told the court that the  samples to be sent to the analyser were collected in polythene  bags, the panch witness said that they were collected in paper  envelopes. Judge Potdar mentioned that both the officers and the  panch witness were present at the time the accused was accosted.  The order also recorded that there were discrepancies in the  weight of the 18 packets as mentioned by the police in different  records.    The judge pointed out that the panch witness differed with  the police officers with regard to the colour of the powder  seized, the mode in which the samples were packed and the manner  in which the suitcase was opened. Judge Potdar agreed that a  person could be convicted merely on the testimony of police  officers if the panch witness turned hostile. But in such a  case, the evidence of the officers had to be unimpeachable.    Mr V.I. Panwani appeared for the state of Maharashtra. Mr  Ravi Gurnani, Mr P.S. Hingorani and Mr Ayas R. Khan represented  the accused.</p>

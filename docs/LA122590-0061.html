			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETING: MIDEAST CRISIS HAS SOME MILITARY AD PLANNERS REVISING THEIR  STRATEGIES  </P> <P> U.S. Armed Forces officials were not amused when they recently heard the joke  that their ad slogan, "Opportunity is Waiting for You," was being updated to a  more timely "Opportunity is Kuwaiting for You."  </P> <P> In light of the Persian Gulf crisis, however, the U.S. Armed Forces did react  relatively quickly this month and revamp its slogan to read: "Stand up, stand  out."  </P> <P> "When there's the possibility of a shooting war," said Robert Ravitz, executive  vice president at Grey Advertising in New York, which creates Armed Forces ads,  "you don't want to mislead someone into thinking that if they join, they still  get to travel and see the world."  </P> <P> But that kind of thinking is hardly unanimous among the various branches of the  military, which together spent more than $65 million on advertising last year.  Officials for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines generally say they have no  plans -- at least right now -- to change their individual advertising  strategies. Most of the current campaigns talk about the character-building and  job-training benefits of each military branch.  </P> <P> "Everyone is certainly aware of what is going on in the Middle East," said John  Glorieux, general manager of the New York agency Young &amp; Rubicam, which  creates ads for the Army. "They don't need advertising to remind them."  </P> <P> With the United Nations' Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to remove all of its troops  from Kuwait approaching, tensions in the Middle East continue to escalate. That  has put pressure on the various branches of the Armed Forces to attract new  recruits at a time when the numbers of those signing up are generally  dwindling.  </P> <P> The problem confounding them all: how to patriotically convince potential  recruits that war isn't really hell. Well, even Madison Avenue probably can't  accomplish that. So, most branches of the Armed Forces say they won't even try.  Instead, they will continue to market themselves as a gold mine of job training  and college funds.  </P> <P> But by doing that, several advertising and marketing experts say, the  individual branches of the military are probably conveying the wrong messages  and perhaps even misleading potential recruits.  </P> <P> "If they want to boost enrollment, advertising things like the opportunity to  see the world is not the way to get it," said Bernd Schmitt, a consumer  behavior specialist at Columbia University in New York. "The part of the world  you'd want to see is probably not where you'd be sent right now."  </P> <P> With the current Middle East tensions, "my gut tells me that recruits won't buy  in as quickly to those career-in-a-can claims," said Brent Bouchez, creative  director at the Los Angeles office of Ketchum Advertising. "If they want people  to sign up, they'll have to change the way they talk."  </P> <P> Right now, the Persian Gulf has such "top of the mind awareness," said Joel  Stekel, a marketing professor at New York University, that "you can't really  avoid it in recruitment advertising." What's more, he said, ads that right now  try to appeal to recruits who want to "camp, fly and swim" are probably  downright silly.  </P> <P> "We're trying to be sensitive to what's going on in the world," said Grey's  Ravitz, whose Armed Forces ads appeared in recent issues of People, Parade and  TV Guide. "It didn't seem appropriate to talk about other benefits in the  equation when, in all practicalities, you could end up in a bunker in the  Persian Gulf."  </P> <P> Besides replacing its old slogan, the visuals in its new ads have also been  drastically changed from pictures of soldiers in action to more patriotic  illustrations of the American eagle. The new ads say, "Protecting freedom takes  hard work. Dedication. And sometimes sacrifice."  </P> <P> The point of military advertising is to attract recruits. Although the number  of Navy recruits fell in October and November, the jingle, "You and the Navy .  . . full speed ahead," won't be changed, said Cmdr. Mel Sudin, public affairs  officer at the Navy Recruiting Command in Washington. "We're not at a point yet  where we have to consider any drastic changes," he said.  </P> <P> Nor will the message "The few. The proud. The Marines," be changed, said Maj.  Robert Wilson, head of marketing for the U.S. Marine Corps. "Even if war breaks  out, we won't change," Wilson said. "We've always sold ourselves as being the  first to fight."  </P> <P> But if war breaks out, the U.S. Army would reduce its advertising  significantly, said Col. John Myers, director of advertising for the U.S. Army  Recruiting Command in Ft. Sheridan, Ill. "It would be insensitive to run an  Army message about college funding that could be juxtaposed next to news  footage of combat casualties."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Reaction to Luxury Ads in Homeless Story  </P> <P> Sometimes ads can pop up in the most awkward places.  </P> <P> Take the Dec. 17 issue of Time magazine, which had a five-page spread on the  plight of the homeless. Among other things, the story was accompanied by a  half-page photo of a homeless person living in a cardboard box. But weaved  between the pages of the article, in about one-fourth of the magazine's 4  million issues, were full-page ads for some of America's priciest products.  </P> <P> One ad was for a Parker pen that sells for $300. Another was for Jaguar cars --  "Classic luxury that makes time stand still." Yet another, with French skier  Jean Claude Killy, was for Rolex watches. "In life as in skiing," the ad says,  "timing is everything."  </P> <P> And what about "timing" in advertising? Well, a Time spokesman said the  magazine received no complaints about the juxtaposition of the ads and the  editorial. "We don't feel it's a problem," said spokesman Robert Pondiscio.  "It's wrong to assume people who buy expensive things don't care about  homelessness."  </P> <P> </P> <P> L.A. Hires 4 Firms to Plan Recycling Ad Blitz  </P> <P> Get ready for an onslaught of recycling ads and promotions in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, the Los Angeles City Council voted to spend $3.2 million on  an advertising and public relations campaign to get the word out about the  city's new recycling program. The funds will be spread among four ad and PR  firms -- with about half of the money going to Westwood-based Laufer  Associates, which specializes in social and environmental issues.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles office of Foot, Cone &amp; Belding will be responsible for the  mainstream advertising and direct-mail part of the campaign. Coronado  Communications will oversee promotions in the Latino and Asian communities, and  Lois Hill Hale &amp; Associates will handle outreach to the city's  African-American community.  </P> <P> The goal of the recycling program: Reduce non-recycled trash by 50% by the year  2000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Milli Vanilli Almost Perfect for Dreyer's Ad  </P> <P> Just how silly is Milli Vanilli?  </P> <P> Several weeks ago, an agent representing Milli Vanilli telephoned the folks at  Oakland-based Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream about appearing in an ad. The group  Milli Vanilli was recently stripped of its 1989 Grammy for best new artist when  it was revealed that the duo didn't sing on their best-selling album.  </P> <P> For the past two years, Dreyer's has been running an ad campaign featuring  "unbelievable spokesmen." Past ads featured such "unbelievables" as former  White House Chief of Staff and convicted felon John Erlichman, and Melvin  Dumar, the man who claimed that Howard Hughes included him in his will.  </P> <P> So, what about Milli Vanilli? "It would have been a perfect fit," said Dreyer's  spokeswoman Jennifer Howard. Alas, the ice cream maker recently dumped that  campaign when it hired a new agency. Too bad. Milli Vanilli would have been a  dilly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little S.F. Newspaper on a Meatless Diet  </P> <P> It has become common for certain publications to turn down ads for cigarettes  and alcohol. But a tiny San Francisco newspaper -- which has relied heavily  upon local grocery store ads -- has decided to reject all ads for meat, poultry  and fish products.  </P> <P> Behind this is the publisher of the New Fillmore, a monthly neighborhood paper  in San Francisco's Pacific Heights district, who says he has become a  "radicalized" vegetarian.  </P> <P> "The realities about the damage an animal-based diet wreaks upon our health and  the environment have become too overwhelming for me to ignore," said David Ish,  publisher of the paper, which has a circulation of 17,500. As a result of this  policy, two of the paper's largest advertisers -- local grocery stores -- have  cut way back on their ads.  </P> <P> Ish said the paper will continue to accept ads for "meatless meats" -- made of  soy products.  </P></p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Brazil's finance minister in second setback Problems mounted yesterday for Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, when Congress delayed voting on a key part of his economic stabilisation plan. It was Mr Cardoso's second setback in less than a week and led to a swirl of rumours that he may be resigning. The minister later denied this. He announced last night he would go on TV on Monday to call again for support in Congress. Mr Cardoso sought congressional approval for an emergency fund to help balance the budget. But opposition from political opponents and state governors led Congress to delay the vote until next week. The delay yesterday could threaten the timeframe for Mr Cardoso's entire economic plan as the Carnival holiday is likely to prevent a quorum forming in Congress until the end of February. This in turn threatens a March 10 deadline for the IMF to approve Brazil's private bank debt restructuring deal. An IMF team was due to arrive in Brazil yesterday to review progress on balancing the budget. The setback follows a similar snub last week when Congress did not vote through his recommended tax increases. Members of Mr Cardoso's Social Democratic Movement party are thought to have urged him to resign to run in October's presidential elections. But foreign investors and businessmen are uneasy about this as he is seen as one of the few politicians able to retain cross-party support in tackling inflation.</p>

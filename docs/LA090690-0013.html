			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: HEY, BUDDY, CAN YOU SPARE AN S&amp;L?  </P> <P> An Arizona businessman received almost $2 billion in government subsidies,  through the lobbying efforts of a former aide to President Bush, to invest in a  savings and loan institution.  </P> <P> The same businessman was also able to buy a bank in Oklahoma, despite his  failure to meet federal standards. He did this with a personal investment of  $1,000.  </P> <P> I am sure the question you're asking is, how does anyone manage to get a deal  like that?  </P> <P> Strangely enough, a lot of it involves friendship -- or one man's love for  another. I'm not talking about homosexual love, but rather the love someone has  for a person who attended the same school, or who served in the same outfit in  the armed services, or who belongs to the same country club.  </P> <P> It is this bonding that's responsible for billions of dollars flying out the  window and ending up on the taxpayers' floor.  </P> <P> Let me give you an illustration: Winterbottom has always had his heart set on  buying an S&amp;L. So he calls up Duquesne, his old roommate from Dancy Tech,  who happens to be a consultant in Washington with reputed connections to the  Lincoln Room in the White House. Winterbottom says: "I'd like to strike it rich  by purchasing an S&amp;L, and I thought that for old times' sake, you could  help me out. I am willing to put up $14.50 of my own money so the government  regulators know I'm serious."  </P> <P> Duquesne replies: "I'd be happy to help you acquire an S&amp;L. You are a good  friend of mine, and the people I'll be talking to are also good friends of  mine. That's the beauty of the consulting business -- you only deal with  friends. Of course, if you get the bank, I hope that I can borrow a few bucks  when I need them."  </P> <P> Winterbottom asks: "How much?"  </P> <P> "Eight or $9 million. I'll put up my tennis racquet as collateral."  </P> <P> Winterbottom responds: "I don't see any problem with that kind of loan. How are  you going to arrange for me to get my bank?"  </P> <P> "First, I'll go to the FDIC and talk to Scooter. You remember Scooter. He  played halfback at Dancy the year we went there. I'll tell him that one of our  boys needs an S&amp;L in the worst way, and if he doesn't come up with a bank,  he has made a mockery of our friendship."  </P> <P> "Will that be persuasive enough?" Winterbottom wants to know.  </P> <P> Duquesne assures him it will. "Scooter owes me one. I treated him and his wife  to a trip to Paris on the Concorde. What's more, I'm taking him duck shooting  for Thanksgiving. When it comes to S&amp;Ls, Scooter is like my brother."  </P> <P> "When do you think Scooter will give me an S&amp;L?"  </P> <P> "He can't give you one. He can only recommend that you get one from Hogarth,  who also happens to be a good friend of mine. Hogarth and I are in the same  PTA, so he trusts me. He can't actually give you one, either, but he can make  sure that no one sits on your application."  </P> <P> Winterbottom declares: "I didn't know that acquiring one lousy S&amp;L involved  so much work."  </P> <P> Duquesne says: "It's not a lot of work, but you have to touch a lot of bases.  That's what consultants do. Washington hates dealing with people it doesn't  know."  </P></p>

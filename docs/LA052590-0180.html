			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> AF JET CRASH KILLS 2 IN GEORGIA  </P> <P> An Air Force fighter jet crashed into a residential area today, setting two  homes ablaze and killing the pilot and a housekeeper, authorities said.  </P> <P> The F-16A was on a training flight from Moody Air Force Base near Valdosta to  Lake George Weapons Range in Florida when it crashed in southern Georgia, Moody  officials said.  </P> <P> The pilot was the only one aboard, public affairs officer Dee Tait said. Names  of the dead were not immediately released.  </P> <P> Parts of the plane hit Mary Alice Corbitt's home. Corbitt "was in the middle  bedroom and heard a loud noise, a boom. The debris hit the house and debris  came in. There was fire inside the house," said her daughter-in-law, who said  Corbitt was too upset to speak on the telephone.  </P> <P> "It was very loud -- almost like a sonic boom," said David McDonald, assistant  principal at Atkinson County High School, about half a mile from the site. "It  shook real hard."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] UN military observers yesterday noted several  cease-fire violations in the Sarajevo region, for which the  soldiers of the Serbian aggressor's side were responsible.    Thus, one Bosnia-Herzegovina Army soldier was killed and two  were injured in the vicinity of (?Hrasnica). On that occasion  one aggressor's soldier was injured, too.    According to Major Jose (La Bandeira), UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] military representative in Sarajevo, one French  soldier sustained minor injures on Mt. Igman yesterday when  Karadzic's Serbs opened fire toward a French unit. Fire was  also opened at French soldiers in (?Dupovici) yesterday,  however, the shooting stopped when the French returned fire.    Major Jose (La Bandeira) says that six aggressor's howitzers  continue to be positioned in Ilijas, 900 meters inside the zone  that is supposed to be free of heavy arms. He did not explain,  though, what UNPROFOR will do to remove these arms.</p>

(``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On December 7, 1994, the PHLX withdrew the portion of the proposal requesting approval to list cash/spot foreign currency options in consecutive month and cycle month series. In addition, the PHLX requested accelerated approval for the portion of the proposal concerning holiday expirations and the definition of ``underlying foreign currency.'' See Letter from Michele R. Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, PHLX, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated December 5, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). Under Amendment No. 1, the contract listed on December 19, 1994, will be effected on Friday, December 23, 1994, will not be effected by the new procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PHLX proposes to amend PHLX Rule 1000, ``Applicability, Definitions, and References,'' to provide that the expiration date for cash/spot foreign currency options (``3D options'') that expire on a holiday or an Exchange designated bank holiday will be the business day following the holiday or the Exchange designated bank holiday. In addition, the PHLX proposes to amend PHLX Rule 1000(b)(14) to correct the definition of ``underlying foreign currency'' as it applies to 3D options. Under the proposal, the 3D option contract listed on December 19, 1994, will be effected by the proposed expiration procedure, but the 3D contract expiring on Friday, December 23, 1994, will not be effected by the proposed expiration procedure. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Amendment No. 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PHLX proposes to amend its rules to make two changes to its 3D options. Presently, 3D options expire every Monday at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. PHLX Rule 1000(b)(21)(iii), ``Expiration Date,'' provides that if Monday is a holiday or Exchange designated bank holiday, 3D options will expire on the preceding business day. The Exchange also trades physically settled foreign currency options that expire on the Friday preceding the third Wednesday of each month (``mid-month options'') and on the last Friday of each month (``month-end options''). the PHLX states that the Exchange created 3D options with a Monday expiration to attract users seeking an option capturing the risk associated with the weekend. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to existing PHLX Rule 1000(b)(21)(iii), if Monday is a holiday, the expiration reverts back to the preceding business day, which is usually Friday but on some occasions may be Thursday. The Exchange now realizes that this defeats the purpose of using 3D options to capture weekend risk. In response to this concern, which has been raised by users of the product, the Exchange proposes that 3D options expire on the following business day, instead of the previous business day, when the regular Monday expiration occurs on an Exchange holiday or designated bank holiday. This usually will be a Tuesday, however, it may be a Wednesday. For example, Monday, December 26, 1994, is an Exchange holiday, (Christmas) so expiration, as proposed, should be Tuesday. However, Tuesday, December 27, 1994, is a designated bank holiday (Boxing Day), so expiration would occur on Wednesday, December 28, 1994, if the proposed ``next business date'' rule were in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the PHLX proposes to revise the definition of ``underlying foreign currency'' to reflect that for 3D options which are cash settled, the underlying foreign currency is the currency that the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') would have been obligated to sell or purchase upon exercise of the contract since OCC actually transfers the cash value upon exercise of the foreign currency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Pensions - The White Paper: Qualified welcome from employers Employers' organisations yesterday gave a qualified welcome to the government's proposals for pension law reform, but the Trades Union Congress described it as 'totally inadequate'. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'The government has paid some attention to company representations and has proposed a less burdensome regime than the Goode Committee advocated, but one which nonetheless will improve security for occupational pension scheme members.' Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress said: 'We were looking for a tough package that would prevent employers ripping off their employees' pensions, but employees still will not be assured of that basic warranty. 'The framework in the white paper still would not prevent workers losing their pension rights to pay the price of their employers' dishonesty.' Employers' concerns focused on the costs of the proposed minimum solvency standards and the compensation scheme to cover losses resulting from theft or fraud. The Institute of Directors said the government had clearly tried to strike a balance between preventing another Maxwell episode and imposing heavy burdens and costs on companies operating pension schemes. But there was a price to pay for all new regulatory systems, and the proposal could make companies more reluctant to operate schemes. The definition of solvency and the precise application of the age rebates would be crucial. The CBI and the IoD were unhappy about the compensation scheme, and the extent to which good schemes will have to pay for bad ones. The proposed regulator and the compensation scheme should be financed by the government, said the CBI, rather than by a levy on schemes. The CBI said the obligation to maintain 100 per cent solvency, irrespective of short-term stock market fluctuations, 'could provoke large-scale switching from equities to gilts and, in the long run, reduce the returns available to pensioners'. The Engineering Employers Federation welcomed the phasing in of solvency standards, and the strengthening of the role of pension fund trustees. It pointed out that training for all trustees, and not just member trustees, was important. Mr Monks criticised the government for ignoring calls for a majority of the trustees to be elected by scheme members. 'Member trustees can play a vital role in eliminating pension fund fraud. Under these proposals they still will not comprise a majority on trustee boards,' he said. Other criticisms came from Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of the MSF, the scientific and technical union, who said: 'Pension law reform was supposed to protect pension scheme members against employers like Robert Maxwell. Far from closing the stable door on pension abuse this white paper leaves it propped open.' Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said the white paper had introduced a weak and ineffectual regulator without the necessary enforcement powers.</p>

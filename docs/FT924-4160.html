			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Germany props up weak franc FRANKFURT and the franc-fort dominated the foreign exchange markets yesterday as the Bundesbank propped up the french currency only hours after its president hit out at central bank intervention, writes Peter John. The moves took the spotlight from a strong pound and from the Danish krone which was supported by intervention from the Belgian and Dutch central banks. In Paris, foreign exchange dealers said the Bank of France dipped in to the market in the morning but they had seen no sign of the French central bank intervening determinedly to prop up the franc, as it had been on Tuesday. On the other hand, the announcement that the Bundesbank had chosen to buy francs before the french currency hit its floor of FFr3.4305 to the mark provided relief. There was no indication of the extent of the early intervention but the Bundesbank bought FFr50m at the midday Frankfurt bourse fixing and the inference was that it had bought a similar amount early on. That level of intra-marginal intervention was relatively slight compared with the massive flows of currency in September. There was a strong feeling that France's currency problems were still very much in evidence and devaluation was a growing possibility. The franc rallied a centime to FFr3.4030 against the mark following the intervention but drifted back again later and closed barely changed at FFr3.4110. Selling of the German currency also took some of the pressure off the dollar which has suffered in the past two days despite several pieces of encouraging economic news. Nevertheless, yesterday's figures on new home sales gave no strong impetus and profit-takers took the US currency down to DM1.5710 against DM1.5800. The dollar remained steady against the Yen at Y124.40. The krone remained at the bottom of the ERM league table despite intervention by the Danish central bank to support the currency against the Belgian franc and Dutch guilder, the two strongest currencies in the EMS. The Belgian and Dutch Central banks also lent their support. The Belgian National Bank said its support for weak ERM currencies totalled some BFr70bn in the week to November 30. The principal gainer yesterday was sterling which lifted half a pfennig to DM2.4325 from DM2.4275 and improved against the dollar to Dollars 1.5485 from Dollars 1.5365. One theory was that the very short-term refinancing following German intervention surrounding Black Wednesday, had been carried out and selling pressure on the pound had been lifted. The general consensus, however, was that the UK currency was benefiting from being on the sidelines and away from the contortions being suffered by the ERM member currencies. The Irish punt also improved allowing short term interest rates in the country to be cut to 30 per cent from 100 per cent.</p>

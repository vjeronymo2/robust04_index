			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) The same format used for the vacancy reduction plan should be used for developing an Improvement Plan under PHMAP if the PHA fails the PHMAP vacancy standard. (PHADA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department intends to coordinate the formats of these plans, to the extent possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The restrictions placed on assistance to troubled authorities (see &sect;968.413(b)) should be made consistent with the language of HOPE VI. (PHADA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The restrictions are prescribed by the authorizing statute for the program. However, in recognition of the comments requesting coordination of the Department's capital planning programs, the final rule includes new language that cross-references PHMAP indicators and clarifies the evaluation of the progress of troubled PHAs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) If a PHA presents a vacancy reduction plan that HUD approves, the PHA should receive operating subsidy based on its actual occupancy rate, rather than on the current formula rate. (CHA, AHA) How does the Department view this program in the context of the Performance Funding System (PFS) funding of vacant units? (PHADA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The vacancy reduction program is not intended as a substitute for the vacancy rule or to provide relief for PHAs that do not meet established goals under COPs. However, the vacancy reduction program should improve the revenue situations of participating PHAs in two ways: First, through direct funding of portions of the plans; second, through the increased operating subsidies and rent collections that will result from reoccupancy of those vacant units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Miscellaneous <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The survey results and data developed from analyzing the vacancy reduction plans should be released publicly. (PHADA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is releasing data from the survey as part of the NOFA published elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In addition, the Department intends to develop a report based on data and information provided by the assessment teams in their reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Vacancy Reduction Program should be separately funded, instead of using amounts set aside from regular modernization funding. (PHADA, CHA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As recognized by the commenters, Congress has authority over the mechanism used for funding the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Funding decisions under the program should recognize when a PHA has used existing resources to address its vacancy problem. For example, although a commitment to use a large portion of CGP funds to address vacancies will reduce the need for additional vacancy reduction funds, those CGP funds could have been used to fund other substantial needs of the PHA. (AHA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When PHAs have other modernization needs that cannot be met by current funding, Vacancy Reduction Program funds may be used instead of CGP funding committed but not yet under contract for vacancy reduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section-by-Section Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is establishing the Vacancy Reduction Program as new subpart D in 24 CFR part 968, with conforming amendments made as necessary in other sections of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The following discussion is a section-by-section description of the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 968.103  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> addresses the allocation of funds under section 14 of the 1937 Act. The Department is amending paragraph (c) to account for the new set-aside for the Vacancy Reduction Program. The new language repeats the statutory scheme for setting aside four percent of the section 14 funds remaining after deducting amounts for emergencies and natural and other disasters. Paragraph (c)(1) provides that 20 percent of these funds will be available for activities under section 6(j) of the 1937 Act, while the remaining 80 percent will be available for the Vacancy Reduction Program, as implemented by this rule. Section 968.103 also is amended to clarify that the Vacancy Reduction Program does not apply to Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

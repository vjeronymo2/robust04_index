			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nokia shrugs off the turmoil of the 1980s / A look at the strategy that has taken the Finnish group back to the black WHEN Mr Jorma Ollila and his band of young Nokia executives took two aeroplane-loads of guests this week to eastern Finland for a trip by lake steamer to the opera, they could afford to shrug off the cold damp weather that chilled the setting of Olavinlinna Castle. With Nokia riding back into the black on the back of rising demand for its telephone systems and mobile phones, and a near FM1bn (Dollars 185.2m) international share issue comfortably in the bag, the chief executive and his team could enjoy a stirring performance of Verdi's Macbeth warmed by the knowledge that Finland's highest profile company is looking in better shape than for some considerable time. The same day, Nokia had announced it was buying out Tandy Corporation's share of two joint venture producers that Nokia and Tandy had founded in South Korea and the US in a move by the Helsinki-based group to consolidate its position as the largest cellular mobile phone supplier in Europe. Its 20 per cent world market share is second only to Motorola of the US which has 30 per cent. The message from Mr Ollila was that Nokia is moving smartly ahead in its aim to concentrate on telecommunications - particularly in mobile telephone systems and equipment - where markets are expanding in spite of a faltering economic outlook, especially in Europe. Pre-tax profits for 1993 are seen by analysts as high as FM650m compared with a loss of FM158m last year. A sharply rising trend in Nokia shares suggests that the message has been well received. This week the price approached the FM200 mark, unchecked by the issue of 6m new shares and more than three times the level in early 1992. However, a cynical shareholder might well respond by saying 'about time, too'. The recovery apparently well under way at Nokia follows a long period of turmoil during which a series of hastily-assembled acquisitions in the late 1980s turned the group into an unwieldy high-technology conglomerate that stumbled into heavy losses and obscured the progress of its telecommunications business. Nokia is struggling with some of the legacy of that time: its loss-making consumer electronics division, still accounting for more than 30 per cent of overall sales, was responsible for the group's loss last year. The division, mainly making colour televisions for the depressed European market, is not expected to break even until 1994. Consumer electronics was one of the areas Nokia moved into in the 1980s under the charismatic leadership of Mr Kari Kairamo. Before his suicide in late 1988, he had added telecommunications and computers, as well as televisions and radios, to Nokia's traditional role as a paper, rubber goods and cable manufacturer built up since it was founded in 1865. The rush to expand was soon revealed as ill-judged. The acquisition in 1988 of Swedish rival Ericsson's data systems business, which became Nokia Data, was followed in 1991 by its sale to Fujitsu-owned ICL of Britain. Ericsson sold out because it had found it hard to combine computers with its core telecommunications business and wanted to concentrate on the latter. Nokia learnt the same lesson, but three years later. It was not lost on Mr Ollila. Although chief financial officer under Mr Kairamo, he makes no bones about the mistakes and led something of a management purge when he took over in January last year. He replaced the heads of the four main Nokia divisions, telecommunications, mobile phones, consumer electronics and cables and machinery, and sold off what remained of Nokia's paper businesses. A strategy of focusing on the telecommunications market is in place, driven by a young team. The average age among Nokia's top 12 executives is now 44, and just 32 among managers in the telecommunications divisions. Mr Ollila is still a month short of his 43rd birthday. Mr Pekka Ala-Pietila, who succeeded Mr Ollila as head of mobile phones, is just 36. 'I think that youth is a tremendous asset in a business that is changing fast,' Mr Ollila says. Nokia is betting its future on its strength in low-cost fixed telephone systems, based on many off-the-shelf components, and in mobile telephone systems and handsets. In spite of only coming to the telecommunications business in the 1970s, Nokia has built up a strong background of expertise in both areas. Like Ericsson, it benefited from the establishment, in the early 1980s, of a pan-Nordic mobile telephone standard and the emergence of the Nordic countries as world leaders in mobile phone penetration. Sweden and Finland, with 7.9 and 7.1 mobile phones per 100 people respectively, top the world league, compared to 4.9 in the US. Japan is still not in the top 10 on this measurement. Nokia is a market leader - second in the world to Ericsson - in equipping digital telephone networks. It remains strong in analog systems, but is banking on a strong growth in demand for the more expensive digital systems, such as Europe's GSM networks, throughout the rest of the 1990s. It will make its first move into Japan in digital mobile phones next year and intends to increase significantly the 16 per cent share of its FM20bn annual worldwide sales currently made in Asia. At present, 9 per cent of sales are in the US and the remainder in Europe. With half of its production still in Finland, Nokia has benefited from the 30 per cent decline in the value of the Finnish markka in the past year. Mr Ollila says he is happy to stay in home-based manufacturing now that the 'horrible' relative costs of a few years ago have been eroded. He says he is happy to keep in the group its residual tyre and power businesses, in spite of their incongruity, because they are in profit and produce healthy cash flow. For the time being, Mr Ollila is at pains to deny persistent market speculation that the consumer electronics business, in which four out of six TV manufacturing plants have been closed, will be sold off. A recent estimate by analysts Alfred Berg showed Nokia's anticipated earnings per share in 1993 of FM6.00 would double to FM12.30 if the consumer electronics side was disposed of. Mr Ollila says Nokia is looking for partnership agreements, not a buyer, but adds: 'We are working to reduce our exposure to consumer electronics. In future it will not be the 30 per cent of sales it is today.'</p>

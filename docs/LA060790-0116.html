			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAFFERS WHOSE BOSSES LOST TRY TO COPE THE DAY AFTER  </P> <P> Receptionist Molly Bien has answered telephones for the state Department of  Justice in Los Angeles for 18 years, and nothing at work has upset her as much  as the Tuesday election that made her boss a loser.  </P> <P> "Isn't it awful?" Bien asked Wednesday between phone calls, referring to Atty.  Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's loss to Dianne Feinstein in the Democratic  gubernatorial primary. "People just can't understand why they would choose her  over him."  </P> <P> Saddened and a bit angry, Bien did what any good employee would do the day  after defeat: She telephoned the boss's office and offered her condolences. "I  would only see him in the elevator, and he always was with a bodyguard, but I  felt so badly," she said.  </P> <P> Bien wasn't alone in her disappointment. While television cameras and newspaper  reporters buzzed around the victors in Tuesday's election, the rank-and-file  bureaucrats and secretaries who toil in the offices of the losers quietly and,  in some cases, awkwardly attempted to return to routines. In the workaday  environs of Van de Kamp, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, City Councilman Robert Farrell  and other politicians who sought higher office, the day after was one of  treading lightly, keeping the chin up and the nose to the grindstone.  </P> <P> "It is pretty somber here right now," said Linda Ortiz, one of Reiner's  secretaries.  </P> <P> "It is sort of like a divorce or death in the family," said a Van de Kamp aide.  "Everybody has different ways of dealing with uncomfortable situations."  </P> <P> There were even tears at some work stations. Mike Botula, Reiner's news  secretary, wept early Wednesday morning as he comforted Reiner after he lost  the Democratic nomination for attorney general.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Boss, we were here for you yesterday, and we are going to be here for  you tomorrow,' " said Botula, who choked up again telling the story.  </P> <P> Some employees made special trips down the hall or across the office just to  check in on the boss. Others sent flowers. But for most, post-election protocol  dictated laying low and avoiding a fuss.  </P> <P> "It is awkward," said Regina Birdsell, Van de Kamp's press secretary, who was  surprised when he showed up ready to work. "All of us thought, 'Gee, he must  feel bad.' "  </P> <P> Kaifa Tulay, Farrell's legislative assistant, arrived early Wednesday at City  Hall to pull together a speech for the councilman on banking services in  low-income sectors of the city, including parts of Farrell's South-Central Los  Angeles district. Farrell failed in his bid for the Democratic nomination for  the 48th Assembly District, but he showed up Wednesday for a City Council  meeting eager to speak about banking problems.  </P> <P> "We had to get right back into the routine," Tulay said. "Emotionally everyone  is down, but he was in a fighting mood this morning. He said this is just the  first time, that he will be back again. That helped people."  </P> <P> Around the corner, Hanna Yu, who had toyed with the idea of moving to  Sacramento if Farrell won a seat in the Legislature, pecked away at her  computer in Farrell's third-floor office as another deputy talked nearby with  some constituents.  </P> <P> "It is something that he really wanted," Yu said. "That is what you think  about."  </P> <P> On the 18th floor of the Los Angeles County Criminal Courts Building, Reiner  arrived for work half an hour early. He met with several of his closest  advisers, assuring them that he was ready "to go to work."  </P> <P> The mood in the office, however, was decidedly flat.  </P> <P> "I am still trying to readjust," said Gregory Thompson, Reiner's chief deputy.  "I have to get the focus right. It is like changing glasses. The first couple  of days you have them you aren't sure you are seeing quite right."  </P> <P> Jack B. White, chief of the office's bureau of investigation, said almost  everyone was still in shock.  </P> <P> "People are just astonished that he was beaten," White said. "I had looked  forward to perhaps joining Mr. Reiner in Sacramento. He hadn't been elected and  I hadn't been invited, but I guess we took some things for granted."  </P> <P> On the elevators at the Criminal Courts Building, deputy district attorneys  gossiped about the results, some wondering aloud what it would mean for them,  while others delighted in seeing their boss -- unpopular with many -- take an  embarrassing fall.  </P> <P> Gallows humor could be heard. "Yesterday, we were all trying to figure out who  would be next in line," one Reiner underling wisecracked for colleagues. "Now  we know. His name is Ira."  </P> <P> At Farrell's office, receptionist Nellie Nelson was a little put off by the  commotion the election had created.  </P> <P> "You win some and you lose some," Nelson said. "A lot of people are calling and  want to have a long conversation, but I just don't have the time being on the  switchboard and all."  </P> <P> Of course, for every loser there's a winner. Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan  Milke Flores, who won the Republican nomination for secretary of state, could  be seen proudly shaking hands Wednesday in council chambers. Downstairs, her  aides debated the merits of moving to Sacramento.  </P></p>

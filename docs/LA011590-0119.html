			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FEW EXPECTED AT SHUTTLE LANDING  </P> <P> Fewer than 2,000 spectators are expected when the space shuttle Columbia,  loaded with a bus-sized satellite, makes its late-night landing this week on  the Mojave Desert.  </P> <P> The landing, scheduled for 11:59 p.m. Thursday, will be only the second at  night for a shuttle. Columbia, which has no running lights, will touch down on  a concrete runway about five miles from the public viewing area.  </P> <P> "You'll hear a 'whoosh' sound as it comes through the air but you won't see  it," so no more than 2,000 people are expected, NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato  said.  </P></p>

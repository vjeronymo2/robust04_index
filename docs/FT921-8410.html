			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / The perils of tunnel vision: The EC is acting against its interests over Gatt It is depressingly familiar. A coalition of powers wins a great victory, only to let the coalition fragment. It happened after both world wars. It is happening once more. But no fundamental conflict of interest need prevent the west from sustaining co-operation, and of nowhere is this more true than trade. Even so, the Uruguay Round looks increasingly likely to expire. If it is to be revived, the European Community must cease defending the indefensible. When US Vice-President Dan Quayle said that global security would be endangered by a collapse of the Gatt round, he was right. When he forecast that failure to agree would increase American pressure to withdraw its military forces from Europe, he was also right. These were not threats, but good predictions. For the EC to insist, like some vainglorious barnyard cock, that it is too important to yield to American pressure is absurd. For Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC's external affairs commissioner, to say that the EC could not accept a deal which did not seem 'suitable and profitable to the Community's long-term economic interest' is still worse, since the EC is rejecting a deal that would, in fact, be in its long-term interests. Agriculture remains pivotal to a successful outcome in the Uruguay Round. Two central issues remain: whether the EC should accept quantitative limits on its volume of subsidised exports, which the EC adamantly rejects; and whether the compensation payments in Mr Ray MacSharry's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy should be put in the Gatt's 'green box' for non-distorting subsidies, on which the EC insists. Mr Andriessen would have the world believe that these two positions reflect the EC's 'long-term economic interest'. But why is it in the long-term economic interest of the EC to export farm products at lower prices than on sales to its own consumers, making up the difference from the pockets of its taxpayers? And why is it in the interest of the EC to pay farmers substantial 'compensation payments' indefinitely, merely on condition that they remain farmers? Mr Andriessen's definition of economic interest bears no relation to reality. This is not new. What has always characterised the CAP is its distance from reality. High prices, the heart and soul of the CAP, could never do more than raise land prices and increase wasteful production. They were completely inapposite to their main purpose, raising farmers' incomes, a point made in the excellent paper by the German agricultural economist, Professor Stefan Tangermann, for the London-based Institute of Economic Affairs, discussed by Samuel Brittan yesterday. Mr MacSharry's reform proposals are an improvement, but they do not go far enough. As Prof Tangermann points out, simpler reforms would avoid the problems inherent in these proposals. The ideal would be lower prices, no set-asides and direct income compensation, limited to those farming in a period in the recent past, and granted for a defined number of years. But, true to the first law of EC agricultural policy - that nothing simple will be tried if something more complex can be substituted - Mr MacSharry has added set-asides and the requirement for continued production, both of which will require not merely complex, but permanent, monitoring. Prof Tangermann's suggested changes to the Commission's proposals should be made - Mr Andriessen, please note - 'for domestic reasons . . . because they would greatly enhance the economic viability of CAP reform'. But they would also clear the way for agreement in the Gatt. His ideas for direct income compensation would fall inside the 'green box'. Furthermore, with support being lowered worldwide, farm prices would rise, reducing the need for what the EC euphemistically calls 'export restitutions'. Unfortunately, EC leaders have long resisted external efforts to limit the damage its farm policies have caused. They have failed to educate its public in their wastefulness. They took almost four years to come up with an inadequate negotiating position in the Uruguay Round. And now they are insisting that the rest of the world must accept half-baked reforms. Worst of all, the EC believes that this is the cause for which it should risk both its relations with the US and the prospects for sustaining the liberal international economy, on which the entire globe depends. In its half-century of pre-eminent influence, the US has made many mistakes, but it has also articulated a global vision. Even in the current Gatt round US policymakers have mostly sought both liberalisation and extension of the reach of trade rules. Against this, what is the EC's vision? Is it to make the world safe for the withered fruit of its farm politics? Many hail the EC's arrival as a great power. On the evidence, the question must be why.</p>

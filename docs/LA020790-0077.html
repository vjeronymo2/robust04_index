			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER DAY, NO PROGRESS IN TALKS  </P> <P> Baseball's collective bargaining talks droned on Tuesday. There was no apparent  progress, only more confusion, according to Don Fehr, executive director of the  Major League Players Assn.  </P> <P> Fehr said the union spent another futile negotiating session seeking answers to  basic questions about the owners' revenue-sharing proposal.  </P> <P> It has been the contention of the owners' Player Relations Committee that the  proposal is aimed at correcting the revenue disparity between teams in big and  small markets, a problem the committee has said will become critical at some  unspecified date in the future.  </P> <P> "But they don't know how to define large and small markets," Fehr said. "They  can't tell you what the disparity will be, and now they're saying that the  proposal isn't based on the market issue at all but on a desire to improve  labor relations by the formation of a partnership. It's weird. It's silly. I'm  astonished."  </P> <P> Fehr said the whole thing is a charade designed to mask the real intent of  revenue sharing, which is to lower salaries and eliminate free agency and  arbitration.  </P> <P> He said that since the owners can't justify it through negotiation, they'll  close the spring training camps and attempt to "starve the players into  accepting it. If they want a fight, there's nothing we can do about it. But  it's likely to be a very long one."  </P> <P> The PRC has said that the camps will not open on Feb. 15 unless the union  agrees to the necessity of a change in the compensation system. The owners will  meet Friday in Chicago to receive an update on the negotiations.  </P> <P> Charles O'Connor, the committee's general counsel, said Tuesday that he still  believes an eventual agreement on the concept of revenue sharing is possible.  </P> <P> He added that a stabilization of the relationship with the union has always  been the central issue of the negotiations, tied to a system that would produce  better cost certainty for the owners and an equalization of the playing field  for teams in the big and small markets.  </P></p>

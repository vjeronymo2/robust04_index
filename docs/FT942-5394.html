			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (4): Basic-rate taxpayers, beware - Unlike many unit trusts, investment trusts may impose an extra charge for personal equity plans. Scheherazade Daneshkhu recommends caution If a product is labelled tax-free, it is bound to arouse the interest of private investors. This is one reason why personal equity plans have proved a popular way for private investors to hold investment trust shares against a background of low interest rates. Some Pounds 300m flowed into investment trusts through Peps in the 1993-94 financial year, representing an increase of 42 per cent over the previous year, according to the Association of Investment Trust Companies. The choice is more limited than for unit trusts, but is nonetheless wide with 33 investment trust management companies offering 93 Peps. Current rules allow investors to hold up to Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep (and a further Pounds 3,000 in a single-company Pep, though investment trusts cannot be included in these). All income and capital gains are free of tax, but the plan has to be administered by a manager who will usually make a charge. In general, lower-rate taxpayers may find Peps a waste of money unless they intend to invest a lot over a long period, when substantial capital gains, exceeding the current annual exemption of Pounds 5,800, may be made. Along with their unit-trust brethren, investment trusts have been enjoying the benefits of the government's decision in 1992 to raise the annual limit on unit and investment trust Pep holdings from Pounds 3,000 to the full Pounds 6,000 general plan allowance. However, many are still restricted by the Pounds 1,500 Pep limit on 'non-qualifying' funds - that is, those trusts which do not have at least 50 per cent in Europe (including the UK). Given that so many investment trusts have their roots abroad, as many of their names (Scottish American, Foreign &amp; Colonial, Anglo &amp; Overseas) testify, this can be offputting for investors. Foreign &amp; Colonial, the world's largest investment trust is non-qualifying, and therefore eligible only for an annual maximum Pep investment of Pounds 1,500; but it decided in October 1992 to launch a qualifying trust, the Pep Investment Trust (Pepit) rather than tinker with the international trust. Pepit only has a one-year record, which showed growth of 20 per cent in the year to April 1, lower than the average return over the same period of 27.8 per cent in the UK general sector (Source: HSW, net income reinvested). Almost all investment trust Peps restrict choice between the manager's trusts; but Alliance Trust, which is non-qualifying, allows investors, at no extra charge, to top up the Pounds 1,500 maximum in its trust with shares from a large number of other investment trusts. This Pep has no initial or annual charge, and dealing costs are much lower than the industry standard at 0.15 per cent. Unlike unit trusts, investment trusts tend to impose an additional charge for Peps, because plans cost money to administer, and standard trust fees are relatively low by comparison with unit trusts. Although consistently good performance should always been the main determinant of an investor's choice, charges are an important consideration and competition has been driving down prices. Some companies are offering to run a Pep for nothing, and do not even charge dealing fees, although there may be a transfer charge. According to the AITC, these include Finsbury Asset Management, Henderson Touche Remnant Smaller Companies and Personal Assets which is administered by Ivory &amp; Sime. If your choice of investment trust does not have competitive Pep charges, it is always possible to take a self-select Pep administered by a stockbroker offering low charges and fill it with investment trust shares. Many investment trusts come with warrants attached to them, which give the investor the option of buying more shares at a fixed price in the future. Since warrants are not shares, they cannot usually be included in a Pep, but an exception is made for warrants that form part of a new investment trust issue as long as they are packaged with an ordinary share and the package is transferred within 42 days into the Pep. Finally, if attending shareholder meetings is important to you, it is worth asking the investment trust whether you will be able to do so through the Pep investment, and/or whether you will be charged for attending.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The best Pep-qualifying investment trusts over 5 years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Manager/Trust                       Return (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Law Debenture                          2,847.26 Finsbury Growth                        2,653.88 Henderson TR Elec &amp; Gen                2,621.89 Henderson TR City of London            2,488.07 Fleming Continental European           2,458.42 Baillie Gifford Scottish Mortgage      2,393.63 Kleinwort Benson Brunner               2,328.28 Ivory &amp; Sime Personal Assets           2,322.82 Dunedin Melville Street                2,294.13 Henderson TR Witan                     2,291.46  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The table shows the return on an initial Pounds 1,000 investment in the five years to March 1 Source: Chase de Vere/Micropal  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Killik &amp; Co, stockbroker, has produced a booklet called 'Investment Trusts and how to make them Pep-able'.

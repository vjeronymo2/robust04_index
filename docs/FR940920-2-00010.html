			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, for those respondents who had related parties in the United States and did not report inventory carrying costs on their ESP sales, we calculated these costs for these respondents using an inventory carrying period of seven days. This is the maximum amount of time which may transpire between the time a rose is cut and when it must be sold to the ultimate customer, according to a public report by Harry K.

For companies with sales to unrelated parties, we accepted that inventory carrying costs were included in U.S. credit expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We made company-specific adjustments, as discussed below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 31 May (AE) -- Workers Party [PT]  presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva today defended  the idea that the government must control prices and  speculators. He said he is against price freezes, but in favor  of price controls like those adopted in First World countries  such as Italy and the United States. "There will be no price  freeze, but the government will do its best to prevent abuse,"  he said. He added that the National Supply Superintendency or  any similar organization will be very active if he wins the  elections.    Lula said that one of the first steps his administration  would take would be to summon businessmen who failed to pay for  their taxes and reach an agreement for the payment of their  debts. Lula has been told that 50 percent of businessmen have  not paid their income tax, their tax on manufactured products,  or their debts with the National Social Security Institute. He  added that after the debt is rolled on, however, no one will be  pardoned. "Currently we have no means of collecting these  debts, because if the government now demands that the companies  pay their debts the businessmen will have to sell their  companies."    Lula added that, as the government also has huge debts, he  will propose to the creditor banks the rescheduling of the  domestic debt to enable the government to invest about $100  billion per year. According to his evaluations, this amount --  plus foreign investment -- will allow the country to grow from 5  percent to 7 percent per year. During an electoral rally in the  Federal District, Lula said: "Our economists say that the  domestic debt is much more serious than the foreign debt."  Nonetheless, Brazil's situation is better than that of Italy  and Japan. According to Lula, the Brazilian debt represents 34  percent of the GDP, while in Italy it represents 105 percent and  in Japan 50 percent.    Lula praised Federal Revenue Secretary Osiris Lopes Filho.  He said: "I believe he is a serious person who has good  intentions and is trying to put an end to tax evasion." Lula  believes, however, that good intentions are all he has, because  he does not have the tools to control abuse. "He cannot arrest  anyone for tax evasion," he said. He added that he will propose  a reduction of taxes, and that the PT is against the provisional  tax on financial operations.    If elected, Lula will only send draft bills to Congress  after  being sure they will be approved. "First, we will negotiate to  the point of exhaustion," he said. When the government is sure  that it has the majority of votes, it will send the draft bill  to Congress, Lula said. He became PT leader in the Chamber of  Deputies after being elected federal deputy for the 1987-1991  mandate. The PT fiscal reform could result from constitutional  reform or from proposals to amend the Constitution. To ensure  the latter, the government will have to count on the support of  three-fifths of the deputies and senators -- that is, 302  deputies and 49 senators.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> PANEL HELD BACK AIDS FINDING  </P> <P> A federal panel waited five months before announcing its finding that steroids  can halve the death rate from the pneumonia that is the leading killer of  people with AIDS, it was reported today.  </P> <P> The panel withheld the announcement until Oct. 10 because members could not  agree on how to word their statement, the New York Times said.  </P> <P> Part of the reason they could not agree, said panel Vice Chairman Dr. Paul  Meier, was that the findings had not yet been accepted at a prestigious medical  journal, and they feared that an early announcement would jeopardize  publication.  </P> <P> Many medical journals have a policy of not publishing studies that have been  reported in the popular press. The journals say the policy is aimed at ensuring  that studies are subjected to scrutiny by disinterested scientists.  </P></p>

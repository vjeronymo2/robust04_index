			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by State Duma deputy (and former Finance Minister) </F> Boris Fedorov: "No Reason To Revise Somber Forecasts"]    [Text] On 20 April the IMF Board of Governors approved the  granting to Russia of the second part of the "systemic" credit  of $1.5 billion, while at the very end of April 1994 the State  Duma received deficit "additions" to the budget. Highly  symptomatic.    First, the IMF. On page 57 of the documents examined by the  IMF council there is a curious table on Russia's implementation  of its earlier pledges on financial stabilization and economic  reforms as of the beginning of April 1994. The table contains  15 items, and on the right it shows the progress made in  implementing them. Now, you will encounter "not implemented"  nine times, "partially implemented" or "uncertain" twice, and  "implemented" four times, and all four occasions relate to 1993.    There are various ways of interpreting the esteemed IMF  governors' motives and the political factors that dictated the  positions of, for example, the "big seven." But you do not  exactly lack evidence that things are not as fine and dandy here  as certain officials would have it.    Let us look at the recent statement by the government and  Central Bank on economic policy in 1994. At least six times it  states the intention not to fix a currency rate or prices, not  to implement mutual offsetting of debts, not to resume import  subsidies or preferential credits. It is important, of course,  to give assurances of what "we will not do." But what "will we  do"?    The most important measures are the promise not to give  extensions on earlier credit issues any longer (interesting to  see how this would work in the agrarian complex), hold more  credit auctions, and reduce centralized exports and imports.  Fine, but by no means enough. The 1993 policy can and must be  continued, but the reforms must also continue.    The statement says that "the unification of the monetary  systems of the CIS states with the Russian monetary system is  possible only through the adaptation of the states' economic  systems...." Vague, but at least it is clear that there is a  need to adapt, and it will take many countries years to do that.  But adaption suddenly occurred in just a few days. How do you  explain the feverish signing of the agreement with Belorussia  [Belarus]? Incidentally, this is not taken into account in the  draft budget either from the viewpoint of inflationary processes  or from the viewpoint of promised state credits.    Most important is the government's objective. In this case  it is to reduce inflation to 7 percent in December 1994 from 8  percent in March at the time when the statement was prepared.  Not very ambitious....    But even the figures that are cited prompt questions. The  budget projections are fundamentally important. According to  them, the federal budget deficit will not exceed 62 trillion  rubles [R] in 1994. Now, at the end of April, we are being  offered a further deficit of R6.4 trillion in Central Bank  issues, mainly in the form of a concession to the agrarian  lobby. An obvious trend.    It is interesting that even the IMF experts, in their  report,  indicated that income had been overstated and expenditure  understated by at least R45 trillion, which it was intended to  find through various taxation and other measures. I dare say  that only a fraction of the income measures are at the adoption  stage, and there is no question of any real revenue or real cuts  at the moment.    My personal view is that the hidden deficit is of the order  of R60 trillion. If you add to this R80-90 trillion in  potential expenditure contained in laws, edicts, and decrees  which no one has abolished, but which are not included in the  budget, then the optimism dwindles even further.    The lack of real action, the creeping increase even in the  acknowledged budget deficit, and the deferential treatment given  to various lobbies are bound to cause alarm. I very much hope I  am mistaken, but at the moment I see no reason to revise my  somber forecasts. Once again we are on the path of rising  inflation, devaluation of savings, almost total curtailment of  investments, and absence of economies. And it is the poor who  are hit hardest by inflation.    The government's latest actions to increase the deficit  while  doing nothing in the economic policy sphere could well make even  the democratic factions in parliament stop supporting the draft  budget, which is cleary becoming simply bad, having been only  just tolerable. If a policy adjustment has begun, it will have  to be carried out with the support of different forces.</p>

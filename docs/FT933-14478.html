			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Observer: Changing horse The race to take over the presidency of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is turning out to be more complicated than first thought. Leaving aside Observer's suggestion yesterday that the wife of Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, may prefer her jet-setting husband to stay closer to home, it is gradually dawning upon other EC governments that de Larosiere's candidacy may in fact be an elaborate bluff. EC officials in Brussels say France's real aim is to secure the top job at the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of the independent European Central Bank, which under the Maastricht treaty will oversee a single European currency. Thus the de Larosiere candidacy serves a dual purpose: to preserve France's original claim to the EBRD seat which, if denied, would give Paris far greater leverage in determining the EMI appointment. France desperately wants the top job at the EMI because it would signal that the German stranglehold on European monetary policy exerted by the Bundesbank was at last being broken. It would also be a consolation prize in the light of the expected location of the putative European Central Bank in Germany, either in Bonn or Frankfurt. It is all gossip at the moment but it perhaps explains the behaviour at Monday's Ecofin meeting where only the Germans showed much enthusiasm for the candidacy of de Larosiere. The Belgians and Italians, who had been expected to support him, were surprisingly mute. Meanwhile, Lord Lawson is emerging as a wild card candidate for the EBRD post. Britain's ex-chancellor of the exchequer is widely believed to covet the job - but regards it as infra dig to apply. Know the feeling.</p>

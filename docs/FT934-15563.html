			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / US Money and Credit: Employment report kicks bond market back into life THE US BOND market, which has been trapped in a narrow trading range recently, has needed something to kick-start it back into life in the past couple of weeks. That something arrived last Friday in the shape of the September employment report. The monthly jobs data sparked a strong rally in Treasury prices, with particularly heavy buying by retail investors. By the day's end, the 30-year bond had climbed by 1 1/4 points, and the yield had dropped from near 6 per cent to 5.917 per cent - close to its historic low. At first glance, the bond market's reaction looked grossly overdone. The main figures - non-farm payrolls up 156,000 and the national unemployment rate steady at 6.7 per cent - were right in line with expectations. Traders and investors, however, quickly looked beyond the headline numbers and found plenty to get excited about. Among the data that lifted the bond market's spirits were: yet another fall in manufacturing jobs; a flat manufacturing work-week; a lower overall average work-week; no wage inflation; and a revision that showed an even bigger decline than previously reported in August non-farm payrolls. Much of the overall increase in payrolls was accounted for by a big increase in government hirings, which rose by 71,000. Taken together, the figures told a familiar story. The economy continues to grow slowly, creating new jobs at a subnormal pace, and lack of growth in the labour market should help keep a lid on inflation. All of this is clearly positive for bonds, which explains why prices took off on Friday. The data should also ensure that Federal Reserve policy will remain on hold for at least another few months. The chances that monetary policy will not be tightened soon has also been boosted by the news that the Fed's most well known anti-inflation 'hawk', governor Wayne Angell, is leaving the Federal Reserve Board at the end of this year. As brokerage house Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette commented: 'With his departure, there will be one less member of the FOMC (the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee) fighting against the grain.' DLJ also noted that the FOMC has a new member, in the form of Mr William McDonough, who took over the helm at the New York Fed a few months ago. The brokerage house says that recent comments by McDonough suggest he is concerned by the economy's poor performance, but satisfied with current levels of inflation. Angell's departure and McDonough's arrival can only shift the balance of power at the Fed further in favour of those who are more worried by the lack of economic growth than any possibility of a resurgence in inflation. This week's producer and consumer prices data for September should be a reminder of how non-threatening inflation is today. So far this year, consumer prices have risen at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent (down from 3.0 per cent last year) and producer prices at a rate of just 0.6 per cent (down from 2.1 per cent last year). Wall Street is expecting more of the same when the figures are released on Thursday and Friday. Analysts forecast that producer prices will have risen by about 0.3 per cent last month and consumer prices by about 0.2 per cent. If the numbers come in no higher than forecast, then bond prices could post fresh gains, sending long-dated yields down to new lows, and possibly even below 5.9 per cent for the first time. The US bond market will be closed today because of the Columbus Day holiday.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Disgraced PM makes come-back MR Yasuhiro Nakasone, the former Japanese prime minister, was yesterday re-admitted to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, ending a two-year banishment imposed for his involvement in the Recruit financial scandal. Mr Nakasone's return will pave the way for other Recruit-tainted politicians to make political come-backs, including Mr Noboru Takeshita, another former prime minister who resigned from office at the height of the scandal in 1989. Mr Takeshita has retained great influence behind the scenes and is widely thought to be considering campaigning for the prime ministership once more, when Mr Toshiki Kaifu's term expires in October. Mr Nakasone's recovery highlights the extraordinary flexibility of Japanese politics, where policy and principle are less important than personal ambition. Mr Nakasone was allowed back precisely because Mr Takeshita and other senior figures involved in the Recruit affair feel his return will improve their own prospects. One MP said LDP leaders had taken heart from recent local elections in which the party had extended its lead over opposition groups. This meant that 'people had forgotten about Recruit,' he said. Unlike Mr Takeshita, Mr Nakasone is no longer considered a candidate for high office. He will not, for the time being at least, return to the intra-party faction he headed, which has been taken over by his lieutenant, Mr Michiyo Watanabe. Mr Nakasone was never charged with any wrong-doing over Recruit but there was widespread doubt over his role.</p>

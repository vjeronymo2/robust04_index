			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN GENERAL INVITES U.S. ENVOYS BACK;  </P> <P> 'RUMORS' SPARKED EXIT FROM BEIRUT, AOUN'S AIDES SAY  </P> <P> Christian Gen. Michel Aoun and his Cabinet urged the United States today to  bring back its diplomats, calling their evacuation a misguided reaction to  rumors they were in danger.  </P> <P> "The Cabinet expresses its regret . . . because the U.S. Administration based  its decision on illusions, rumors and erroneous information," a statement from  Aoun's three-man Christian Cabinet said.  </P> <P> It called on the United States to "reconsider the pulling out of its diplomats  from Lebanon in order to preserve bilateral relations."  </P> <P> The statement marked a partial backing down by Aoun in his war of words with  Washington, although it was unclear to what extent this might be because it was  issued by the Cabinet rather than Aoun himself.  </P> <P> Aoun's Cabinet is one of two vying for power in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Earlier in the week, Aoun said U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy would be welcomed  back only if he presented his credentials to the Christian Cabinet and  recognized it as the legitimate government.  </P> <P> That demand was not reiterated in the new statement.  </P> <P> McCarthy arrived in Lebanon a year ago and did not present his credentials in  an obvious effort to avoid recognizing either the Christian or Muslim  governments.  </P> <P> The Christian Cabinet's statement was issued after a two-hour meeting at the  bunker under the bomb-ravaged presidential palace in suburban Baabda east of  Beirut.  </P> <P> A reliable Christian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Aoun  considers the U.S. evacuation "a move directed against his rule."  </P> <P> The diplomats were evacuated Wednesday a few hours after pro-Aoun Christian  youths besieged the embassy compound in Beirut's northern suburb of Aukar.  </P> <P> Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Syrian-backed Muslim Cabinet  vying for power with Aoun's, expressed "regret" over the pullout.  </P> <P> U.S. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the evacuation was  motivated by what she called a threat by Aoun to take Americans hostage.  </P> <P> In an interview published Sept. 1 in the French daily Figaro, Aoun was asked  whether the United States was putting pressure on France not to aid him.  </P> <P> He replied: "They put pressure on everyone and claim in addition to have so  acted because they have . . . hostages being held in Lebanon.  </P> <P> "As if the war were being waged without hostages or victims. If I understand  well, it would be enough that tomorrow I take 20 Americans hostage so that the  United States stops putting pressure on my friends."  </P></p>

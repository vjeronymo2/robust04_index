			<p>BFN     [Text] PLO official Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh has called for  immediate negotiations on the permanent status of the  territories instead of continuing the talks on Palestinian  autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    In an interview with correspondents in Tunis, 'Abd-Rabbuh  said that the agreement between the PLO and Israel was dying and  the diplomatic process was reaching a dead end.    In reaction, political sources in Jerusalem said that it was  the Israeli Government's policy to honor agreements. Therefore,  there was no point in discussing the next stage of the  negotiations between the PLO and Israel before the talks on  Gaza-Jericho First were completed.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCDONALD'S WILL DO AWAY WITH FOAM BOXES  </P> <P> Kudos to Rockwell for his tongue-in-cheek parody of moronic  anti-environmentalism, complete with pointedly brain-dead humor attempts and  justifications for swelling our landfills with Styrofoam (not to mention raping  the ozone layer). It was tongue in cheek, wasn't it?  </P> <P> DOUG WILSON, Moorpark  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROL FREAKS  </P> <P> Regarding control freaks ("Who's the Boss?" by Margo Kaufman, Dec. 3): Power  trips belong to a dying paradigm. A win-win partnership model is emerging in  fields as broad as world politics and as close as our own families. To reduce  the number of future control freaks, we should be raising children with  respect, learning how to share decision making with our partners and families  and taking better care of ourselves and our own self-esteem.  </P> <P> JAELLINE JAFFE, Los Angeles  </P></p>

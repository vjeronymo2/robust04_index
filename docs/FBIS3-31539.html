			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] One of the main topics of the news conference in  Prague today by the Russian and Czech foreign ministers, Andrey  Kozyrev and Josef Zieleniec, was the position of the Czech  Republic in Russia's policies as a great power. David  Stahlavsky has the details:    [Stahlavsky] Andrey Kozyrev has confirmed that there is no  direct clash of interests between our states. He attributed  some differences to the complexity of the problems we must solve  jointly. The Russian minister mentioned the need to prepare  quickly the documents on the visit of Prime Minister Klaus to  Russia, which was agreed last summer by Presidents Havel and  Yeltsin.    Although Minister Zieleniec thinks there are no great  differences of view on the attempts of our country to become a  member of West European structures, his Russian partner refused  to comment directly on whether Russia continues to consider the  Czech Republic to be in its sphere of vital interests. Good  relations are the vital interest.    Kozyrev repeatedly conceded to all countries, including the  Czech Republic, the right to join any international  organization, even NATO. He documented it jokingly by the  possibility of our entry to the Commonwealth of Independent  States. Russia would not be against it.    Russia, however, maintains the right to express its views on  the optimal construction of European security, which was  confirmed by President Yeltsin in his letter to Western  countries shortly after his visit to Warsaw and Prague, in which  he rejected the admission of Central and East European countries  to NATO before Russia. According to Kozyrev, however, this  argument is no longer topical by virtue of accepting the  Partership for Peace program. NATO is an organization with  which one has to cooperate, and Russia will join this program.  No organization on its own, however, can respond to Europe's  problems, Kozyrev said.</p>

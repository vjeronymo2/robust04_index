			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Argentine judges urged to resign POLITICAL pressure on Argentina's Supreme Court to resign intensified yesterday following Mr Antonio Boggiano's resignation on Tuesday as court president. Mr Boggiano quit after five of his colleagues said they no longer recognised his authority, following accusations by two fellow justices in September that he had tried to replace a court ruling against the central bank with a favourable one. However, he will remain a member of the nine-member court. The ruling Peronist and opposition Radical parties are demanding that at least three court justices resign immediately. A purge of the Supreme Court is one of the Radicals' conditions for supporting reform of the constitution, which is needed to allow President Carlos Menem to stand for re-election when his six-year term ends in 1995. Mr Eduardo Duhalde, the influential Peronist governor of Buenos Aires province, said yesterday that their resignations 'are overdue, there is no longer any space for anything else'. Last week, three cabinet ministers demanded resignations in the court. Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said all nine should be impeached by Congress. He has publicly accused two justices of corruption. Supreme Court justices are appointed for life to insulate them from political interference. But their reputation has been severely damaged by repeated allegations of corruption, incompetence and submission to the government. Nonetheless, there is widespread belief that a purge could further undermine the rule of law. The Radicals argue that the Supreme Court lost its independence when Mr Menem appointed five pro-government justices shortly after he took office in July 1989. Mr Raul Alfonsn, the Radicals' leader, demands that the government force the resignation of at least three of the court justices as a gesture of good faith before Friday's Radical party conference, which is to ratify talks with the government.</p>

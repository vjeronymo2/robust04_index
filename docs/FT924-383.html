			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Sport: What is the Italian for silly mid-on? - Cricket 'HAIL Cricket] glorious, manly, British game] First of all Sports] be first alike in fame] . . .' The opening lines of James Love's epic poem about Kent's defeat of All England in a cricket match in 1744. The poem extends to more than 300 lines, not one tarnished by the thought that the 'First of all Sports' might one day be played in foreign pastures such as continental Europe. Love would have been chastened to hear of cricket being played from Scandinavia to Greece, from Portugal to Albania. European cricket is a minor sport which is, in the words of Italian cricket's ambassador in England, Ian Massey, 'short on skill but big on spirit.' Its two most obvious turns of spirit are the wild, passionate, romantic one, in countries such as Italy and Greece, and the cool, calm one, in countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands. Often players are most strongly united in their mood of play when faced with the most alien opposition, as was shown in a recent game between a Greek and an English team. Greek cricket is pretty well limited to Corfu, where it was introduced by British sailors in the 19th. century. There is only one cricket ground in Corfu, fringed with cafes. There are four teams, unique among European cricket teams in being entirely home-grown. Byron, Gymnasticos, Phaex and Ergaticos use only Corfiot players, all of them tremendous hitters. In September 1991, Ergaticos were playing a Combined XI of Bethlehem Royal Hospital and Pinner Victorians. When they found they had only ten players, a tiny man of 67 called Lakis Kosteletos, a leading figure of Corfiot cricket, was persuaded to come out of retirement and have a go at the Anglo-Saxons. With his team's score at 70, Kosteletos was the seventh to be out, sat down by the scorer, collapsed and died. In the Netherlands and Denmark the climate is cooler. The Dutch have played cricket for a long time, the standard is high and there is a well organised league system. One only has to look at this year's Somerset squad to see how efficiently the Dutch encourage young players. Adrianus van Troost, Taunton's new, occasional, huge, fast bowler was born in the Dutch gin town of Schiedam 20 years ago and spotted for Somerset two years ago by Jack Birkenshaw, then Somerset's manager, in a youth cricket tournament at Radley College. He made his county debut in 1991, the year Taunton's other Dutchman, Roland Phillipe Lefebvre, from Rotterdam, won his county cap and his sizzling nick-names: Tulip and Clogsy. The North Sea end of European cricket is not glamorous. Nor does it seek to be. One would be unwise to pursue a silky image when one's National Cricket Association has an AGM called the Dansk Cricket Forbunds Repraesentantskabsmodet. The Danes take their cricket seriously. Last year the AGM spent cold, December days in Jutland organising Denmark's cricket into 'talent centres', to coach talented cricketers and teach talented coaches. In Germany, cricket is deeply unsure of itself. The game's negative points are that it is whimsical and eccentric, the result is unpredictable, whatever the state of play, and the whole thing started in England. Its great positive point is that it has a delicious and ever-growing abundance of rules. Anything with lots of rules is, says Rolf Schwiete, chairman of the Deutsche Cricket Bund, 'ideally suited to the German temperament.' This was confirmed by Alf and George Powley, identical twins, overseas training and liaison officers for the Association of Cricket Umpires. They have umpired on many cricket expeditions - six to Italy, two to France and one each to Germany, Luxembourg, Austria, Belgium and Israel. In Germany, the Powleys gave one of their umpiring seminars, which was gratifyingly well attended. Everyone understood English, give or take the odd beamer and bouncer. Everyone lapped up cricket's rules. Everyone wanted to do umpiring exams. 'We Germans love examinations,' chuckled one candidate, setting himself loose on his question paper. Evidently the written answer suits Germans better than the field of play. Native German cricketers are few on the ground, which last is a problem in itself, looked after as it is by suspicious, often antipathetic German groundsmen, cautious mowers to a man. But German cricket's main problem is the one which is the scourge of all European cricket: its tendency to be dominated by ex-patriots, from Britain and, increasingly, from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Cricket has been popular for years with the British forces in Germany, but few young Germans are interested in it. There was not one German in the German team that won this summer's European Cricketer Cup, sponsored by The European and organised by The Cricketer. (In conjunction with MCC). Germany won because their batting was too strong for the other teams: Austria, Switzerland, France, Italy, Malta, Belgium, Greece, Spain and Portugal. Germany's opener, Aamer Jung, nephew of the magnificent Nawab of Pataudi, demolished France in the final with his 99. His fellow opener, Gary Stevens, one-time bastion of Surrey's Malden Wanderers, was quieter. The team included a fast bowler from Barbados, eligible for Germany because he served in the US airforce on the Rhine for three years; a battery of Asians working in Germany and the captain, a biologist from Sydney. One supporter of Italy, whose team always has at least seven Italian players, said with battered pride after watching his team lose all four of their Cup matches that he would rather see them lose with honour than win without any Italians. This year's European Cup was played at Worksop College last July. According to one cricket journalist, 'Although the competition was quite bonkers for its structure, ten teams playing only four games out of seven and no-one knowing how the matches were picked or located, this was a joyous week of cricket.' There was sunshine over north Nottinghamshire and European flags were flying. The adverts in the programme included one for 'French Cricket au Difference'. There is a whiff of panache about French cricket. In the south it is a social game for English on the Dordogne. In Paris it is a university and Asian game, with Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Tamil teams. In the north it is Largely a French game. At Chauny, in north-east France, the local paper gave a willing but uncertain report of an umpiring weekend at Victor Hugo College, in October 1990 by 'Half et Georges Powley, anciens arbitres internationaux.' The French captain, Simon Hewitt, who has a French grand-mother and an Oxford blue and plays for the Paris Universities Club, translated the Powleys' seminar into the grandiose French which distinguishes cross-channel cricket. One does not break the wicket in France; one achieves 'la destruction totale du wicket.' At the same time, some phrases capture the game's finesse. To spin bowl in French is 'donner de l'effet a la balle.' Perfect. Simone Gambino, founder-president of the Italian Cricket Association and the European Cricket Federation, makes mammoth efforts on behalf of cricket. This noble character is at once the driving force and the Attila the Hun of Italian cricket, sweeping all opposition before him. He wages a constant battle in search of the cricketing balance between Italian passion, with its night-time, floodlit cricket, batsman making huge swipes at every ball, and English reticence, with its afternoon tea and Test Match Special. The answer, it seems, is style. 'You always get the glitterati attached to Italian cricket,' said the Powleys. 'In Italy, cricket is fashionable.' Italian papers cannot get enough of Italy's tiny quota of impeccably dressed cricket teams, leaning on their bats, driving the ball past mezzo-accesso stupido (silly mid-on) and doffing their caps to the umpires (30 per cent of Italian umpires are female) when given out. Appeals are operatic, with much rolling about on the ground and howling to the full moon. Fielding is keen. Batting is whole-hearted, across the line. Bowling is ambitious, appalling, wide. A slow delivery would be as ignoble as leaving a wide unhit; wides are all chased, however far, to be hit for six. A recent hero of Italian cricket, Manlio De Amicis of Lazio, was described by an Italian commentator in 1988 as 'el gladiatore' of Italian cricket. That is the style the public like. Italians find one-day cricket a bit long. They like it to be short, sharp and swashbuckling, as with the gladiator's 2 for 35 against the Pizza Express team in Brentwood. What matters is that he came to England on tour. There are only about 20 Italian clubs and their cricket is bad, but they are starting to play further afield and get more experience. Gambino has managed to find sponsors for Italian cricket. He helped make a Cricket World Cup broadcast to Italy and persuaded Martin Crowe to spend two months as Italy's national coach last summer. Everything is unlikely. Anything is possible. Anywhere in Europe.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs agree plan to save up to 19 pits THE CROSS-PARTY trade and industry committee last night agreed a unanimous report on the future of the coal industry, designed to rescue between 16 and 19 pits. After several hours' tough negotiations, the committee agreed a blueprint believed to create a market for the consumption of an additional 16m tonnes of domestic coal annually, with the possibility of another 3m to follow. But the announcement left a question mark over the exact consequences for each of the 31 threatened coal mines. The committee will not publish its final report until Friday. Leaving the last of the day's four negotiating sessions just before 11pm, Mr Richard Caborn, committee chairman, described the talks as 'difficult' and said he felt 'bloody knackered'. 'We have had three simple questions: is there a larger market for coal; if so how large; and how do you get to it,' he said. The report, he added, would be 'very, very detailed'. Last night's hard bargaining focused on the size of the extra market for domestic coal that could be justified and details of the restructuring measures that should be recommended to achieve it. Labour MPs had been holding out for a blueprint that would allow an extra 20m tonnes - equivalent to saving 20 or 21 pits - to be produced above a planned output of 40m in the year beginning in April this year. Some of the Labour group, reluctant to be associated with a report that sealed the fate of any pits, were also pressing for the remaining 10 to 11 mines to be kept going in the short term on a 'rape and pillage' basis, under which accessible seams would be plundered as cheaply as possible without worrying about long-term prospects. The Conservative camp, meanwhile, with a majority on the committee, had argued that a case could be made for an additional market of only 15m tonnes  -equivalent to 15 pits. This, it is widely suggested, would be enough to satisfy sufficient prospective Tory rebels to protect the government's 21-strong Commons majority. Though the future of the pits does not rest with the committee alone, its findings will be a strong influence on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, as he prepares his own solution to the controversy which began with the announcement of the closures last October. Mr Heseltine used an appearance on BBC television yesterday to emphasise that subsidies to British Coal would fall in the year ahead no matter how the UK energy market was reorganised. 'We are subsidising British Coal today to the tune of Pounds 1bn a year,' Mr Heseltine said. 'If they are to find a larger market there will need to be some form of subsidy, but it would be a smaller subsidy than that which we are paying today; the issue is how much smaller and over what period.' In the Commons, Mr John Smith chose coal as his theme for prime minister's questions. He said it was 'little short of astonishing that even now ministers do not accept the crisis arises from the botched privatisation of the electricity industry and not from any weakness in the British mining industry'. Roared on by backbenchers, the Labour leader said coal's crisis arose directly from the 'rigging' of the energy market and urged the government to accept that reform of the market to allow coal to compete fairly was 'the crucial and overriding issue'. 'What both the industry and the nation needs is not some short-term fix to save the government's face, but reform of the electricity market to allow British miners to compete fairly,' Mr Smith said. Standing in for prime minister John Major, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, retorted that the coal sector's problems stemmed rather from a long-term decline in demand for its products. He said Mr Heseltine's review would be 'very thorough' and would not simply look at the short term.</p>

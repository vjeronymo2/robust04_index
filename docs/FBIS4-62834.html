			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Zaynetdinov: "Look Out, The Osmium Has </F> Turned `Green'!"]    [Text] Two Yekaterinburg dealers were caught red-handed by  Sverdlovsk Oblast counterintelligence agents, together with  colleagues fronm the Regional Administration for Organized  Crime, trying to sell two grams of osmium-192 to a "company  representative." Aleksandr Grigoryev, press group chief at the  Sverdlovsk Federal Counterintelligence Service Administration,  said that the value of the rare isotope was $110,000    The dealers were caught handing over the commodity. The  entire sum was seized.    It has not yet been established where the so-called  businessmen obtained the scarce commodity. But one thing is for  sure: They were not selling it legally. Right now they stand  accused under Article 88 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code  of breaking the rules of currency transactions, since osmium is  classed as a precious hard-currency commodity.    Osmium-192 is used as a catalyst in nuclear reactors.  According to the counterintelligence agents' information, the  purchaser was a middleman and the goods were not intended for a  Russian customer.</p>

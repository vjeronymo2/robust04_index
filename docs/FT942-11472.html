			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: LDDS Communications makes Dollars 2bn bid for WilTel LDDS Communications, an acquisitive US telecommunications group, has made an unsolicited Dollars 2bn offer to buy WilTel, which runs the nation's fourth-largest long distance network and is a subsidiary of Williams Companies, the Oklahoma-based pipeline group. Williams, which revealed the approach yesterday, said it was considering alternative strategies for WilTel, including continued ownership, the LDDS offer, alliances with other partners and a spin-off of the business. The LDDS offer forms part of a gradual consolidation of the US telecommunications industry as it undergoes radical change, due to the blurring of boundaries between long-distance and local carriers and between the sector and the cable television and computer industries. LDDS, based in Jackson, Mississippi, is a long-distance reseller, buying access to long-distance lines in bulk and reselling at a profit. With revenues of Dollars 1.14bn last year, it has the fourth-largest long-distance customer base in the US and specialises in serving small to medium businesses, mainly in the south-east, south-west and mid-west. It is the second-largest customer of WilTel and is negotiating a new, long-term contract for services. WilTel, which specialises in the business market, operates an advanced national fibre optic network and had an operating profit last year of Dollars 89.7m on revenues of Dollars 958.1m. Its Tulsa-based parent is primarily the owner of a natural gas pipeline system. Analysts said LDDS's offer showed it wanted to move from being a reseller to the ranks of the leading US national carriers. They estimated a merger would give the combined business over 4 per cent of the Dollars 65bn long-distance market. That compares with the 10 per cent held by third-ranked Sprint, about 20 per cent for MCI Communications and 60 per cent for AT&amp;T. Williams said LDDS had offered to buy WilTel for Dollars 2bn in cash and/or stock, less the pay-off of WilTel's debt. Mr Keith Bailey, president of Williams, said the company was pleased with the recent performance and outlook for WilTel, and was comfortable continuing to own, operate and invest in the fast-growing business. However, it would look at the LDDS offer along with other alternatives. Williams's shares rose sharply to close at Dollars 29, up Dollars 3 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange, while LDDS shares ended Dollars  1/4 higher at Dollars 23 3/4 on the Nasdaq exchange.</p>

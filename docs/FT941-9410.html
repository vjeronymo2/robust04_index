			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Observer: Knight time 'Anyone who tells you they always get the stock market right is either called George Soros, or is a liar,' says Nick Knight, Nomura's London-based stock market strategist. Even so he's acquiring quite a following for being prepared to make the big stock market calls. Although he's still only 32 he seems to have been strutting London's stock market stage for ages. His detractors say that he makes so many aggressive calls that he's bound to get some right. However, the size of his fan club has increased considerably since he highlighted the 'once-in-a-lifetime' investment opportunities caused by Britain's sudden exit from the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. His latest target is Hong Kong. Last week he told clients that its market could fall by 30 per cent this week, which may help partly explain yesterday's 4.5 per cent fall. Knight admits getting the Japanese market wrong at the end of last year but regards himself as the stock market equivalent of golf's Arnold Palmer. 'The more I practice, the luckier I get,' says Knight.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>   [Text] Russia stands categorically against attacks of  retaliation on any of the parties involved in the Bosnian  conflict if such an attack is not within "the context of  defense" of the UN forces in the former Yugoslavia. This was  said by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev before his  departure to Tashkent on Monday evening.    However, the Russian foreign minister admitted that there  might be an attack if the UN peacekeeping forces were attacked.  "In this case, the UN forces' command in Bosnia must make a  proposal on military support, including one by air forces, to  the UN Secretary-General who is to conduct consultations with  the Security Council's permanent member-states, including  Russia," the foreign minister clarified.    In his words, it was "absolutely necessary" to defend the UN  peacekeeping forces stationed in the areas of conflicts. "If  Bosnian Serbs, Moslems or Croats launch an attack, in response  the international community may apply the appropriate measures  against them," the Russian foreign minister said.    He pointed out that "there was no way to speak about attacks  only against Serbs in the specific situation which has emerged  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Only the defense from an attack  committed by any party can be discussed," Kozyrev emphasized.    In his words, the current situation is "very unfavorable for  any kind of air attacks." "We will examine all the details.  Russian President Boris Yeltsin will make decisions on all  specific situations. However, in principle, counting on force  is not the most successful way out," the foreign minister  pointed out.    Kozyrev regretted that "some of our western partners were in  a hurry and did not study the Russian program of a settlement in  Bosnia properly." "Our initiative provided for convening the  Security Council, reinforcing the security zones around Sarajevo  and elsewhere, putting that city under UN control, and  demilitarizing Sarajevo and its surroundings by both sides. If  the initiative had taken effect, the latest tragedy in that city  could have been avoided. No one can say who caused such a huge  toll of lives. Unfortunately, as long as Moslems and Serbs are  amassing their artillery guns, similar tragedies cannot be  avoided," Kozyrev said.    He urged the need for effective measures "not to get caught  in a trap." "It was a well-placed trap and possibly a  provocation by one of the sides. The incident must be  investigated, and concrete measures must be taken, he said.    The minister recalled that "the death of Prince Ferdinand  through a provocation in Sarajevo in 1913 triggered off a global  tragedy." "That tragedy did not solve the Balkan issue, still  facing us today. For this reason, the escalation of violence in  the form of air strikes or any other foreign intervention except  that by the UN would most likely lead to a repetition of that  notorious tragic scenario," Kozyrev said.    In his words, "no one wants it." "That is why I think that  the international community will be guided (with all the heated  discussion and the indignation that we fully share) by common  sense and political reason rather than by emotions," he remarked.    Kozyrev believes that "time has come for our western  partners  in the Security Council to take a closer look at the Russian  proposals. It is possible to adopt effective measures on  Sarajevo by disengaging the troops to avoid violence rather than  by air strikes that would escalate it," the foreign minister  declared. He disclosed that he had discussed the problem with  his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher Sunday night.    He noted that a map to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina "was agreed  to in principle. There may be only 5 percent that remains for  the sides to agree on. Their argument can last endlessly. But  there is a way out for them through international arbitration at  the level of the UN Security Council, the Hague Court, or any  other authoritative body," he said.    Asked by an Interfax correspondent whether Russia would back  up sanctions against Croatia, Kozyrev replied: "Sanctions are  not the best way. Once agreements on a settlement in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are signed and concrete steps to implement  them are taken, the best thing would be to lift sanctions even  against Yugoslavia rather than to impose new ones."    However, he noted, "if Croatia continues outright  interference, sends troops to Bosnia and becomes directly  involved in the conflict there, the imposition of sanctions on  Zagreb may be considered. Would we like that? Of course not.  Because Croatian civilians would suffer as a result. Whether  such a turn of events is avoided will depend on how restrained  the Croatian authorities will be," the minister stressed.    The decision to bomb Serb positions in Bosnia must not be  taken until an unbiased international commission evaluates the  circumstances of the tragic explosion in Sarajevo, the head of  the State Duma committee for international affairs, Vladimir  Lukin, told journalists on Monday. According to him, such a  commission must include neither Europarliament representatives  nor Mr. Zhirinovskiy.    As Lukin said, the UN Secretary-General, Butrus  Butrus-Ghali,  displayed "some prejudice," when he suggested that NATO  structures should consider the possibility of bombing Serb  positions. According to the Russian parliamentarian, the UN  Security Council should convene all its members to discuss the  situation, and "it would be odd if Russia were excluded from  this process."    The State Duma, Lukin said, has already issued a statement  on  the situation in the former Yugoslavia, and it continues to  believe that "intensified military actions will not lead to  slackening hostilities, and bombardments with greater outside  military interference will not yield positive results."    Lukin pointed out that he himself does not share "the  extremist circles' opinion that the Serbs, or, on the contrary,  the Muslims, are presumed to be right." According to him, there  is a need to "find out objectively what is the best way to reach  a political solution" to the conflict in Yugoslavia.</p>

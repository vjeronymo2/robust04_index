			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Turkish bank in US private placement Bankers Trust has completed a Dollars 65m US private placement of certificates backed by credit card receivables serviced by Interbank, the private Turkish bank. It is the first time that any Turkish borrower other than the Republic has tapped the US market and follows a similar offering in the Eurobond market in 1992, also arranged by Bankers Trust, according to Mr Rahmi Sayder, vice-president of BT's European asset-backed securities group. The certificates are issued by Interbank/AKK Trust, a special purpose vehicle, which has purchased the right to receivables of Eurocard, MasterCard and Visa credit cards used by foreign tourists and business travellers in Turkey. Interbank's wholly owned subsidiary, Anadolu Kredi Karti (AKK), is a market leader in international credit card processing in Turkey. The credit card receivables deal allows Interbank to secure medium-term funding: the deal has a final maturity of five years and a four-year average life. Bankers Trust declined to disclose the coupon or yield spread paid on the fixed-rate securities. The certificates, rated A by US rating agency Duff &amp; Phelps, were placed with US institutions such as insurance companies, Mr Sayder said. He added that similar structures, using credit card or other receivables such as trade receivables, could be used in other countries, for example in Greece and Eastern Europe. 'This is a great way of mobilising assets which are not being used,' he said.</p>

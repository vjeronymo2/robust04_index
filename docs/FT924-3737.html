			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Understanding your council tax bill  -New burden for householders THE POLL tax will finally die on March 31 next year and will be replaced by the new council tax from April 1. The new tax aims to be fairer than the unpopular poll tax by taking into account the value of the property in which householders live. It will no longer be levied on the number of people living within one home but on each 'dwelling', so each household will receive only one bill. How is the bill worked out? The estimates of property values have been carried out by the Valuation Office Agency, part of the Inland Revenue. There are eight valuation bands, which differ for England, Scotland and Wales, and are shown in the table. The value is based on the amount the property would have fetched had it been sold on April 1, 1991. The government this week sent lists of the draft valuation banding for each house to all local authorities. Householders can contact their local authority, to discover the band their home falls into, though some may be slower than others in delivering this information. However, householders will not know for sure how much they will be paying until March next year, when local authorities set their budgets. This is because it is up to individual councils to set the level of charge for each household, and that will be influenced by their own spending. Grounds for appeal Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said this week that the government is expecting almost one million people to appeal against the level of their council tax bill. Many people are likely to disagree with the valuation given to their home, particularly if it falls at the edges of a band because of the fall in property prices since last year. But the Department of the Environment will not regard this as grounds for appeal. It says that even though the valuation is based on the market price of the home in April 1991, 'a general fall or rise in house prices will not in itself give grounds for appeal.' The main grounds for appeal are: if your bill is evidently wrong. For example, your house may be worth less than Pounds 40,000, yet you find you have been put into band G; your home decreases in value because part of it has been demolished; the house has been adapted for a disabled person; the property has been divided into separate dwellings since the valuation was carried out and this has escaped the government's notice. if you stop or start using part of your home for business purposes. Exemptions The council tax bill assumes that two adults live in each home. If you are a single person, you will be eligible for a discount of 25 per cent. If you own two homes, the council tax on your second home is halved. Those who are completely exempt from the council tax include: full-time students; resident hospital patients; people who are severly mentally impaired; careworkers on low pay working usually for charities 18 and 19 year olds who are at, or have just left, school. If you are sharing your home with someone who falls into the exempt category, your council tax bill will be reduced by 25 per cent - the size of the single person's discount. Households which include a disabled person will normally fall into a band below that of their valuation. How to appeal You cannot appeal against the council tax bill until April 1 1993, and the deadline is November 30 1993. If you think your house has been put into the wrong valuation band, write to the Listing Officer at the local office of the Valuation Office Agency. The Department of the Environment says it expects most appeals to be sorted out quickly but if agreement is not reached within six months, the case will be referred to a valuation tribunal. You will not be liable for these costs but you will have to bear the costs of supporting your case, such as getting an independent valuation for your home. In some cases, the cost of the valuation might be more than the difference in council tax payments of dropping to a lower band. If you think you are entitled to a discount or are receiving bills which should be directed to someone else, write to your council. It should give a decision within two months and if, you disagree, or there is a longer delay, you can appeal to a valuation tribunal. The government says you should pay the council tax bill you are challenging and if you win an appeal, the local authority will rebate the amount owed to you. There are three free pamphlets on the Council Tax: A Guide to the Tax; Valuation and Banding; Liability, Discounts and Exemptions. Write to Council Tax Publicity Material, PO Box 506, London SE99 7UY. A separate pamphlet - How to Appeal - will be issued later this month.  ------------------------------------------------------ VALUATION BANDS FOR COUNCIL TAX  ------------------------------------------------------ Band          England         Scotland            Wales  ------------------------------------------------------ A        under 40,000     under 27,000     under 30,000 B           40-52,000        27-35,000        30-39,000 C           52-68,000        35-45,000        39-51,000 D           68-88,000        45-58,000        51-66,000 E          88-120,000        58-80,000        66-90,000 F         120-160,000       80-106,000       90-120,000 G         160-320,000      106-212,000      120-240,000 H        320,000 plus     212,000 plus     240,000 plus  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: Valuation Office Agency  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Auditors criticise banking practices PRICE Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, yesterday criticised international practices that allowed banks to transfer funds in 'such a way that the identity of the original paying or receiving bank's customer is concealed'. The comment came in the firm's first detailed account of its role as auditor to Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the group closed last year after being fraudulently managed for years. The firm was replying to questions from the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee, which is trying to ascertain - among other issues - whether PW was remiss in its duties as auditor or whether the regulatory system needs changing. PW said the fraud was kept hidden for years because BCCI used a 'scheme of deception' which was both 'sophisticated and complex'. It highlighted four factors that prevented outsiders from uncovering the fraud: All significant executive power was concentrated in the hands of two men, the founder, Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, and his chief executive officer, Mr Swaleh Naqvi. The board of directors, which 'included several experienced European bankers', gave credibility to the bank's loan portfolio; The rapid worldwide expansion of the group and the scale of daily banking business helped it hide and spread improper transactions. The resources of bank regulators in Luxembourg and Cayman, BCCI's main territories of incorporation, were 'not commensurate with the fast expanding worldwide operations of the group'. The next question it addressed was when it first detected 'widespread fraud'. It said that its 1987 and 1988 audits found imprudent lending and that during the 1989 audit it identified that - contrary to management's assurances - further lending had been made to customer accounts that had already received big loans. PW identified loan transactions 'for which senior management were unable to provide adequate explanation'. The accountancy firm then 'communicated concerns and their implications on the credibility of management to the Bank of England in early 1990'. PW continued to brief the Bank of England, in March and April 1990, having become concerned about other banking transactions. At the suggestion of PW, BCCI's audit committee set up a task force to investigate the suspicious transactions. In a report to the Bank on April 18 1990, more than a year before BCCI was closed by the Bank, PW wrote: 'Our inquiries . . . have indicated that certain accounting transactions principally booked in Cayman and other offshore centres have either been false or deceitful'. Four months later, PW learned that Dollars 500m of loans to 'major customers' had been concealed. By October, the size of the fraud had become more apparent since the Abu Dhabi government, the controlling shareholder in BCCI, was pledging Dollars 1.5bn of support to cover potential losses on the problem loan accounts. In the coming months, PW uncovered more details of the fraud, culminating in the report it delivered on June 22 last year to the Bank of England which led to the closure of BCCI. However, the auditors said they never expressed an opinion to the Bank of England on the matter of whether BCCI should retain its authorisation as a bank. Price Waterhouse said it did not believe that bank secrecy laws impeded its work as BCCI's auditor or undermined its separate role as accountants reporting on BCCI to the Bank of England. However, it mentioned an exception in the case of Swiss secrecy laws, which precluded BCCI's Swiss affiliate from providing BCCI with 'customer specific information'. On the other hand, it was critical of practice which allowed banks to transfer funds throughout the international banking system in 'such a way that the identity of the original paying or receiving bank's customer is concealed'. Price Waterhouse then gave a clue to how the fraud was committed by making a recommendation on new controls that could be introduced to prevent misuse of the banking system. It stated that when funds are transferred between correspondent banks - or banks which have a close business relationship - officials of those banks should insist on being told the identity of all parties involved in the transaction, including the banks' customers. Price Waterhouse also provided an explanation of why it did not qualify BCCI's 1989 accounts - an accounting procedure that would have cast doubt on BCCI's fin-ancial performance - even though the accountancy firm had evidence of 'deceitful transactions'. Among other reasons, it said, 'the Bank of England . . . had been informed of all the uncertainties known to Price Waterhouse and of the financial-support commit-ment by the government of Abu Dhabi, and decided to allow BCCI to continue to operate'.</p>

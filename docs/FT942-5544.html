			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oslo deal on oil development in the Skagerakk The dispute over oil drilling in the Norwegian sector of the environmentally sensitive Skagerakk reached new heights yesterday after the minority Labour government cut a deal to gain backing for the move from the opposition Conservative party, which on Wednesday had vowed to block the proposal. In an about turn, the Conservative party decided to support Labour's proposal to open the Skagerakk for limited drilling, and eventually development, as a trade off for the government agreeing to undertake fresh environmental studies to assess the potential impact of oil activity there. As part of the deal, the government also agreed to re-examine its stand against lifting the so-called sliding scale. The measure allows the state to increase its shareholding in oil and gas fields once they have been declared commercial. Environmentalists, outraged by the Conservatives' move, described it as a political sell-out. The government two years ago removed the sliding-scale for licenses offered in the 14th licensing round and onwards, but the measure still exists for acreage allotted prior to the 14th round which has been proved commercial and is currently in the queue for development. Oil companies have repeatedly warned the government that such discoveries would not be developed unless the sliding scale was dropped and the draconian petroleum tax regime adjusted to take into consideration prevailing low oil prices. The government proposed opening the Skagerakk for limited drilling in March as part of a plan to expand drilling acreage by up to 16 per cent to stem a steep decline in oil production expected after 1996. The proposal has been met with wide-spread criticism from environmentalists, the fishing industry and the state pollution board.</p>

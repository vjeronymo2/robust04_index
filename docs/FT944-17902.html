			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Tokyo seeks big spending boost The Japanese government is planning significantly to increase public spending over the next 10 years in an effort to expand domestic demand and improve the nation's living standards. Mr Kozo Igarashi, chief cabinet secretary, confirmed that the government was working on a new public spending programme which is expected to increase investment to about Y630,000bn (Pounds 4,100bn) over 10 years from 1995. The programme will replace the current one which began in 1991, for which Y430,000bn has been earmarked. The beefed-up programme, expected to be put before the cabinet tomorrow for approval, follows Japan's pledge at the Group of Seven summit in Naples last July to review the existing spending programme with a view to stimulating the domestic economy further. In addition to increased public spending, the programme will call for greater allocation of funds to the building of social infrastructure, to improve the country's living standards and prepare for an ageing society. Increased housing, drainage, garbage treatment facilities and educational and social welfare issues are among priority candidates for increased investment. The plan is expected to call for greater investment in lifts in public places and wider sidewalks to accommodate wheelchairs. The programme will also aim to meet the changing needs of a society in which information is expected to play an increasingly important role.</p>

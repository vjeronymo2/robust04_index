They said the Japanese imperialists' act of forcing women to  serve the army as "comfort girls," which deprived them of the  last vestige of self-respect and trust in humanity was fiendish  crime unprecedented in human history, and demanded that the  Japanese prosecution punish those responsible for the  establishment of the system of "comfort women for the army" and  the assaulters, said the paper.</p>

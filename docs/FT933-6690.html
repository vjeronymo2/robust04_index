			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Arts: Jonathan Miller's 'Ariadne' - Opera at Broomhill Besides its stepped lawns and gracious vistas, Broomhill - Sir David Salomon's old country house near Tunbridge Wells - boasts its own little Victorian theatre, virtually unused in this century. Four years ago the tenor Kim Begley discovered it, and an idea was born. Since 1991 the Broomhill Trust has arranged summer seasons of concerts and 'community opera', and this year its First International Opera Course too. Meanwhile the theatre has been carefully refurbished, with a fine orchestra pit concealed beneath the stage (as at Bayreuth). Somebody must be thinking, irresistibly, in mini-Glyndebourne terms. On the strength of Broomhill's current Ariadne auf Naxos, that is not unrealistic. Strauss's opera is on just the right scale for the place: it was a pleasure to discover yet again how much more happily Ariadne plays in a small house, with the reduced band for which he wrote so ingeniously. (Bigger houses have to fatten the string-sections, at the sacrifice of a certain appealing frailty - tackiness, even - in the orchestral sound.) But it is no kind of piece for mere students; and in fact most of the participants here are full-blooded young professionals, for whom the Broomhill 'course' must count less as a study-camp than as an invaluable public showcase. The Broomhill music staff - headed by Jean Mallandaine and Courtney Kenny, both of them distinguished keyboard assets (celesta and piano) to the excellent Britten Sinfonia in the pit - have done their casting cannily and well, with satisfying results. The cast I heard on Monday was more than creditable, but there is a whole alternate cast as well: presumably not just a second eleven, since they were scheduled for the Royal Gala performance on Tuesday. I wish I could have heard them too. The quantity of well-schooled operatic talent these days is astonishing. Jonathan Miller is the director, far more at home with the Ariadne comedy than he was recently with the verismo melodrama of Giordano's Fedora (for Bregenz and Vienna). If Mark Bailey's vaguely Edwardian 'designs' seem mostly cobbled together from rented costumes and the theatre's own faded backdrops, they supply all that is needed - where the last Royal Opera production provided an ultra-lavish, comedy-killing excess of everything, and the last ENO one a glum hi-tech mess. It matters that the Ariadne opera-within-an-opera is meant to be put on almost impromptu, in a Viennese parvenu's Stadtpalais. Strauss and his librettist Hofmannsthal meant their Ariadne o-within-an-o. to be a farcical confrontation between lofty opera seria manners and earthy commedia dell'arte. For assiduous British theatregoers, unfortunately, the latter label has become attached to mannered, direly unfunny exercises. Miller has had the good sense to scrap any 'commedia' associations in favour of unabashed Cambridge Footlights knees-up style, and it works. The brightest of his comics, William Dazeley as Harlequin, is a Cambridge product, engaging enough to compensate for his somewhat gruff, un-tender delivery of 'Lieben, hassen', the gem of his part as Strauss composed it. The strenuously 'heroic' role Strauss wrote for his Bacchus, the god who rescues the abandoned heroine from her death-wish, flatters hardly any tenor (not since Jess Thomas, anyway), but Nicholas Buxton copes with it manfully. His Ariadne is Rachel Sparer, a very tall American soprano: intelligently musical, strongly projected (in a hard-ish timbre which awaits maturer depths), too little sensitive to her visionary words - but with delectable startled-moose reactions to the low-class commedia offensive. In this cast the young Composer is Teresa Shaw, upon whose heartfelt 'Musik ist eine heilige Kunst]' outburst Miller has foisted rather too many donnish tics and twitches. With their Zerbinetta, however - the Israeli-South African Sharon Rostorf - the Broomhill Trust has struck gold. If her top Es are steam-whistles, everything below those extravagant reaches is under insouciantly sexy control. In clown's trousers, somewhere between raggedy-doll and rag-and-bone man (like her commedia cohorts), she is artfully tough, funny and self-aware, even when Miller makes her go randy over the legs of a chaise-longue. Perhaps Zerbinetta's topmost reaches will never be quite comfortable for her; but the personality, the plucky coloratura and her wry aplomb should take her a good long way. Broomhill (David Salomons House), Southborough, Tunbridge Wells; box office 0892-517720. Further performances with cast as above August 27, 31 September 4; with alternate cast, August 28, September 1, 3</p>

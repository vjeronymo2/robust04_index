			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANNIVERSARY OF COLUMBUS' DISCOVERY  </P> <P> Rodriguez asks us not to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Christopher  Columbus' great adventure, which he prefers to call "genocide."  </P> <P> Forget for the moment that Spain's attitude towards the indigenous peoples of  America was no different than it was toward non-Christians at home, and in the  same year that Columbus sailed into the unknown the Jews were driven out of  Spain, forced to leave all of their property behind them, and that the horrors  of the Inquisition were in full control of the lives of the people of Spain.  </P> <P> No, Mr. Rodriguez, we are not going to celebrate genocide, but rather the  accomplishment of one rather courageous individual, whose adventure still  stands as the greatest voyage of mankind, including Neil Armstrong's walk on  the moon. In truth, a parallel would have Armstrong pleading with the President  -- over a period of eight years -- for use of a castoff spaceship and the  company of a few criminals and debtors to go with him on a voyage that he would  plan and carry out alone.  </P> <P> Columbus' serendipity -- a new world instead of China and Japan -- brought  lesser men after him, and when he punished a few Spanish gentlemen for  murdering Indians he was himself removed from power and returned to Spain in  chains.  </P> <P> JERE STUART FRENCH  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

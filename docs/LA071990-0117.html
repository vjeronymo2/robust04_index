			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SINGLES CLUB COOKS UP SOCIAL IDEA;  </P> <P> MIXING: GROUP OF PEOPLE HOPING TO CONNECT WITH FRIENDS OR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS  FORM A VALLEY CHAPTER THAT PROVIDES A WAY TO AVOID TV DINNERS.  </P> <P> As anyone who's single knows, solo diners seem as welcome to restaurateurs as  an outbreak of salmonella. It takes a courageous heart and a very hungry  stomach for a single diner to brave the steely eyes of a restaurant maitre d'  inquiring, "Only ONE for dinner?"  </P> <P> Five years ago, Gwen Minick of Calabasas found herself single again after her  husband rediscovered his high school sweetheart. Exploring ways to get back  into the social swing, she soon came upon a Los Angeles-based group known as  Single Diners Social Club.  </P> <P> "I liked what I saw," said Minick, who approached the group's founder, Marilyn  Wolff, about starting a San Fernando Valley chapter of the club.  </P> <P> Minick, an educator and administrator at a private school in the Valley, said  she did research with single parents at the school and found a common complaint  -- "the drudge of working all day, coming home to the children and never having  any social life. So I knew that there was a need for something like the Single  Diners Social Club with activities that are Valley-based."  </P> <P> The new Valley group had its first dinner in late June and plans a second one  Saturday at Breakers Seafood Restaurant in Northridge, Minick said.  </P> <P> Singles like structured social events, said Dr. Marilyn Ruman, a clinical  psychologist in Encino, because "adults find it uncomfortable to use meat  market facilities or the bar scene. These days, safety is just as important a  factor as finding intimacy. And when there is a focal point of interest, an  activity such as dining, people immediately have a common connecting point. An  activity club puts the activity first and foremost so personal rejection is not  paramount."  </P> <P> The 700 current active members of Single Diners Social Club now have the option  of attending either Los Angeles- or Valley-based events. Minick said the Valley  chapter is scheduling at least two dinner get-togethers each month at which she  and Wolff will be hosts.  </P> <P> For a $50 annual membership, Single Diners Social Club participants receive a  monthly newsletter on upcoming activities. When Wolff started in 1987, she was  arranging just one get-together a month, but today the events are weekly. Each  participant pays for dinner, which ranges from $25 to $40. Other upcoming  Valley events include patio dining at the Airtel Plaza Hotel on Aug. 2 and a  dinner and horseback ride at the B&amp;B Ranch in West Hills on Aug. 25.  </P> <P> Events average 35 attendees, with some special events attracting more than 50.  </P> <P> The mix of participants ranges from art gallery sales people and doctors to  secretaries and business owners. "Some members also use the group for business  as well as social networking," Wolff said.  </P> <P> Bill Gertler, a freight management consultant from Tarzana, said his joining  the Valley chapter doesn't mean that he's "under any illusion or delusion that  any one group will satisfy what I'm looking for. I've been single a long time,  and I'm associated with several different singles groups, so the Single Diners  Social Club is just another venue for me to meet people. And I happen to like  dining out.  </P> <P> "I have a saying, 'I never eat, I dine.' And I don't like dances with loud  music where it's hard to talk to and meet people."  </P> <P> Another Valley participant, a marketing manager from Canoga Park who asked that  his name not be used, was hesitant to give the group his approval, but said:  "The people I met were very nice and the event was nicely organized with a  festive atmosphere."  </P> <P> Minick and Wolff caution club members not to join with stars in their eyes  about romance: "We're not a dating service," Wolff said.  </P> <P> "Our mission is to have everyone at the end of the evening walk out of the  restaurant feeling good," she said. "As far as I'm concerned, club activities  are the next best thing to hosting a dinner party at my own home."  </P> <P> "We're encouraged to see a lot of enthusiasm for our first Valley chapter  dinner and a pretty evenly balanced turnout," Minick added.  </P> <P> In Southern California, it is estimated that as many as one out of two adults  is either single, widowed or divorced. And in the continuing search to connect  with friends or significant others, group activities such as the Single Diners  Social Club provides seem a legitimate way to avoid TV dinners and the tube.  </P> <P> Dr. Michael Glasser, medical director of the Mental Health Center at Encino  Hospital, agreed, noting that "any environment that allows people to meet on a  continuing basis with the same circle of people, around events that are not a  one-shot deal, seems to work best at helping single people connect in Los  Angeles."  </P> <P>  The next meeting of the Valley chapter of the Single Diners Social Club is  Saturday at Breakers Seafood Restaurant, 9000 Corbin Ave. in Northridge.

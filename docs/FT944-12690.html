			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Brittan finds solace in past achievement: Commissioner claims some credit for E Europe's advance towards EU entry It was with a certain savagery that Sir Leon Brittan, the UK's senior European commissioner, yesterday described the EU's progress to date in embracing former communist countries of east and central Europe. 'We have taken a quantum leap towards bringing the countries of east and central Europe into the European Union and it is for me personally a cause of great satisfaction and pride that we have been able to do so,' he said. Two days after learning that the prize task of negotiating Europe's enlargement to the east had been lopped off his Brussels portfolio, the smarting commissioner took the opportunity of an EU foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg - attended by ministers from six east European countries - to sum up the great strides taken since Berlin's wall was knocked down. No one was left in any doubt whom to thank: 'The reason why we were able to have a meeting of substance today was because of the work that has already taken place. . . a great deal has been done and the countries are now set formally on the path towards membership of the EU.' But in spite of his evident irritation and disappointment, Sir Leon held fire and did not announce a resignation. Evidently friends, supporters and most especially the British government - horrified at the prospect of further domestic turmoil over Europe - had been to work on him. As Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, put it: 'I am extremely glad that he has decided to stay on in the Commission.' Sir Leon himself was putting on a brave face: 'After the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the Gatt negotiation, I turned myself increasingly to the affairs of eastern and central Europe of the former Soviet Union, so I was naturally disappointed,' he said. 'But I have received messages from governments asking me to stay on,' he said. 'The portfolio I have been offered does represent an important and major challenge. . . I am under no illusion about the magnitude of that task.' Mr Hurd and Sir Leon himself were not the only people praising the former conservative MP's two-year efforts as commissioner responsible for central and eastern Europe. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said: 'I have thanked Sir Leon for the excellent work done in producing a strategy paper which has in part prepared the way for accession.' There were diplomatic words, too, from the Polish foreign minister, Mr Andrezj Olechowski. 'We were very pleased with the work done by Sir Leon. We think he was, and continues to be, convinced about the future membership of our country and has done a great deal of work and made much contribution,' he said. But as he tactfully put it, the east Europeans were not losing a friend as a result of Mr Jacques Santer's division of labour, they were merely gaining a new one. 'We have no reason to think the new commissioner will not be as enthusiastic and able as the other.' Sir Leon is not a stranger to controversial, news-shattering resignations following his role in the Westland helicopter dispute of the Thatcher government. Yesterday he took unkindly to suggestions that he should have acted more decisively this time round. 'Maybe you have always found it easy to make big personal decisions,' he snapped at one journalist. 'Not everybody is in that happy situation.'</p>

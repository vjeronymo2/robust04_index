			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRLINES;  </P> <P> EASTERN OFFERS UNSECURED CREDITORS 10 CENTS ON DOLLAR  </P> <P> Since filing for bankruptcy last March, Eastern Airlines has consistently vowed  to pay all creditors in full, but it made a significant reversal on Thursday in  offering unsecured creditors just 10 cents on the dollar, in cash.  </P> <P> The troubled carrier said it would repay another 70% of its debt over the next  decade, though without interest. In return, Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp.,  said it would give creditors up to 40% of its equity in the Miami-based  airline.  </P> <P> "The plan proposes that certain creditors make contributions to assure  Eastern's post-reorganization successful operations and participate in the  equity of the company," Eastern said in a statement released as creditors met  here Thursday. It predicted that its plan "would enable the company to emerge  from bankruptcy as soon as midyear as a strong competitor with $500 million in  cash, access to new aircraft and a revamped, more conservative balance sheet."  </P> <P> The carrier said unsecured creditors would also get preferred stock with a  liquidation value of $80 million and convertible into 40% of its common stock,  though it did not explain when or under what conditions the issue could be  converted. (Unsecured debts are obligations not backed by specific collateral  and include payments for jet fuel, catering, landing fees and airplane leases.)  </P> <P> Eastern added that holders of secured debt would be paid in full, and that  holders of $45 million in tickets purchased before bankruptcy would be fully  reimbursed once the plan is approved.  </P> <P> The airline's president, Phil Bakes, called the plan "fair for all the  financial stake holders in the company."  </P> <P> The new reorganization plan, the latest of several offered by the airline, must  be approved by Eastern's creditor committee and, ultimately, by Federal  Bankruptcy Court. It is almost certain that creditors will insist on  modifications, but no one representing them could be reached for comment  Thursday.  </P> <P> The new plan, with its watered-down payment offer, resulted from the recent  dismal performance of the airline industry and from greatly increased fuel  prices, analysts said. Eastern's planes flew only 53.7% full in December, down  from 57.2% 12 months earlier.  </P> <P> "The deterioration has caused lower-than-anticipated revenues," said analyst  John W. Mattis of Shearson Lehman Hutton. "As a result Texas Air is willing to  give up 40% of its ownership to keep the airline going."  </P> <P> Analyst Paul Karos of First Boston Corp. said he interprets the plan as  "Eastern saying in the long term that it cannot make money with the capital  structure it now has. It needs breathing room, and is asking its creditors for  significant concessions in return for stock." If Eastern prospers, he said,  these shareholders could also benefit.  </P> <P> Eastern said it will report a $280-million loss for the last quarter of 1989  and a loss of $850 million for the year. It also predicted that it will lose  $125 million in the present quarter, cut the loss to about $30 million in the  second quarter and break even in the second half of the year.  </P> <P> The airline has been operating under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code  since last March 9 -- five days after its machinists, pilots and flight  attendants struck. Only the machinists remain on strike.  </P> <P> The airline said it will ask the court for an additional $100 million from the  $600 million that it holds in escrow as proceeds from selling off assets. It  previously sought $210 million.  </P></p>

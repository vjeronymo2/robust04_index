			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / United in disunity: The Arab mood Never in the 22 months of the Middle East peace process have minds been more wonderfully concentrated. To its advocates, the 'Gaza-Jericho first' proposal offers for the first time the prospect of Palestinian autonomy in the lands occupied by Israel in 1967. To its opponents, it is a 'catastrophe', in the words yesterday of Mr Abdul Aziz Rantisi, the exiled leader of Hamas, the Palestinians' militant Islamic movement. The next few weeks will show whether Mr Rantisi and other rejectionists can avert this 'catastrophe'. For the moderate Arab governments who have pressured the Palestinian leadership to agree to this first, limited form of autonomy, the 'Gaza-Jericho first' proposal is the start of the endgame. Mr Amr Moussa, the Egyptian foreign minister, welcomed the proposed deal as such yesterday, saying any withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied lands was welcome, though only so if it was the first step in a greater disengagement. But the rejectionists within the Palestinian fold signalled their profound distaste for a deal which they see as a sell-out by a beleaguered Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Can organisations such as Mr Ahmed Jibril's radical PFLP-GC and Hamas, which has been the main beneficiary within Gaza and the West Bank of the long stalemate in the peace process, muster the force to stop the proposal? The answer will lie partly in the hands of the sponsors of these groups, who have a habit of playing the rejectionist card for their own ends - most particularly Syria and Iran. Very little is ever clear about the strategy of Syria's President Hafez al-Assad, except that it involves patience and caution. But he has already shown willingness to rein in rejectionist groups his government sponsors in the interests of an eventual peace. The recent decision to lean on Hizbollah, the pro-Iranian and deeply rejectionist guerrilla group, after its attacks on Israel prompted a week-long bombardment of south Lebanon, was the most telling example - and seems to have cleared the air in the Syria-Israel peace talks. But whether Syria would be prepared to act similarly with respect to groups such as Mr Jibril's is unclear. Equally, there is doubt as to whether either Syria or Iran can decisively control rejectionist groups which have garnered increasingly strong grass-roots support in the occupied territories. Mr Assad is not in a strong position to argue with them, given that many Palestinians see him as hastening to conclude a 'separate peace' with Israel involving the return of all or part of the Golan Heights, captured by the Israelis in the 1967 war. The Syrian leader's repeated assertions that he has no intention of proceeding to a full peace with Israel without them do not cut much ice with Palestinians mindful of the violent history of their relations with Damascus. Those who oppose the current peace plan argue that once a limited autonomy deal is concluded, Syria will move full-speed to a broad normalisation of relations with Israel. The result, say the critics, could be a matter of 'Gaza-Jericho last' as well as first, with the Palestinians having to settle for exercising self-rule only in those two small enclaves. Syria's attitude  -and Jordan's, a country whose own peace deal with Israel is all but done - may also be influenced by the way the present proposal was reached substantially without their consultation. Some observers suggested yesterday that this could prompt both countries to take a harder line with Israel, partly so as to resist pressure to make greater concessions themselves. Both Amman and Damascus were notably muted yesterday in their response to the proposal. Much will depend on the contents of an eventual 'Gaza-Jericho' agreement. If it appears to open the way for direct linkage between an interim period of Palestinian autonomy and a final agreement - one which would address the still unresolved issue of the status of Jerusalem - it would be hard for either Syria or Jordan to hold out against the PLO-negotiated deal. But if opposition to the deal deepens and widens, both within the occupied territories and among the hundreds of thousands of diaspora Palestinians in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, then Jordan, in particular, could decide to position itself for a broader agreement giving it greater control over the occupied West Bank. Syria, too, might then decide that it cannot peg its own peace with Israel to an interim agreement which proves to have broad, grass-roots opposition among the Palestinians. The key, in both cases, will be the degree of Palestinian opposition to the agreement. Many independent Palestinian groups, and even many in the mainstream Fatah group, have already voiced doubts about 'Gaza-Jericho'. Mr Arafat will have to demonstrate to the Palestinian rejectionists that this deal will be tightly linked to a comprehensive settlement leading to a total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories, and recognising the right of diaspora refugees to return. Whatever else the 'Gaza-Jericho' proposal will achieve, it appears already to have shifted the fundamental axis on which the peace process will turn. As Mr Mohammed Sayed Ahmed, the Egyptian commentator, noted yesterday: 'We are no longer looking simply at an Arab-Israeli confrontation - now the confrontation is within the Palestinian camp.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Five years ago, Cao  Yongxian, a farmer in Caozhuang village in suburban Jieshou  city, Anhui Province, tried hard to persuade eight villagers to  contribute 15,000 yuan each for building a paper mill.    Then most villagers did not support cooperative companies  because they feared that the establishment of these companies  meant returning to egalitarianism, known in China as "sharing  porridge out of the same big pot."    However, the mill, called Yingnan Paper Mill, turned out to  be a complete success, as it has scored an annual increase of  400 percent in terms of output value and profits.    To date, the first eight partners have assets worth 250,000  yuan each.    The mill has introduced a standard managerial system under  which its funds are raised by villagers, and shareholders are  responsible for its operation, draw dividends on schedule and  cover its risks.    As a result, the joint stock cooperative system has been  mushrooming in Caozhuang village and has become the biggest  source of income for villagers.    A village head said that Caozhuang now has 51 cooperative  businesses, with shares totalling 40 million yuan. In 1993 the  net income of each villager was 1,500 yuan, 70 percent of which  came from dividends, he added.    An Anhui Provincial Government official said that Anhui  currently has 23,000 such businesses, 6,000 of which were set up  in 1993.    Lu Rongjing, secretary of the provincial committee of the  Chinese Communist Party, has asked local party and government  officials to speed up the spread of such system, in a move to  invigorate the rural economy and increase farmers' incomes.    The official said that Fuyang Prefecture, which used to be  the least developed area in Anhui, is both a pioneer and a  pacesetter in instituting the system.    Prefectural authorities have chosen a number of township-run  factories to try out the system by standardizing their operation  and clearly defining their property rights.    The prefecture currently has 14,000 cooperative enterprises  owned by 100,000 shareholders, the official said. These  enterprises manufactured 1.5 billion yuan worth of goods in 1993.    Hu Yingchen, a farmer in Mengcheng county, administered by  Fuyang Prefecture, turned his private building materials factory  on the verge of bankruptcy into a cooperative company owned by  230 shareholders. The company has become a "superstar"  enterprise with an annual output exceeding 10 million yuan.    The official said that farmers can now also contribute their  skills, land and raw materials as shares in rural enterprises,  which have also attracted investors from urban areas.    Anhui provincial authorities are helping most township-run  businesses introduce the cooperative system to meet the needs of  a market economy, he said, adding that most newly-founded  enterprises are joint stock cooperative companies.    Various government departments are taking measures to help  introduce and standardize the system, he said.</p>

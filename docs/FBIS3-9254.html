			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, March 22 (TANJUG) -- Greece is in  possession of information that the United States is preparing to  open military bases in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  (F.Y.R.M.) and hastily building bases in Albania, as part of  preparations for possible NATO operations against Serbia, the  Belgrade daily VECERNJE NOVOSTI writes on Tuesday, citing Greek  sources.    The United States is hastily building its military bases and  adapting airports near the ports of Valona and Durazzo in  Albania, which is a part of the U.S. plan to form its militacy  satellites in this region. The second part of the U.S. plan is  to form military bases in the F.Y.R.M., Yorgos Harvalias, editor  of the Greek pro-government paper ELEFTHEROS TYPOS says.    Harvalias claims that Americans have sent logistics experts  to the F.Y.R.M. to restore a former Yugoslav Army base at  Krivolak so its could accommodate some 5,000 troops.    The Americans need bases in Albania and in the F.Y.R.M. if  they engage in fighting Serbia as NATO operations require two  fronts. The mountainous region between Albania and the Serbia's  southern province of Kosovo and Metohija does not permit of  waging a war with infantry but from the F.Y.R.M. territory it  would be much easier because second front is opened in this way,  Harvalias stresses.    Albanian separatists in Kosovo and Metohija have attempted  for decades to secede this Serbian province from the Yugoslav  Republic of Serbia and joint it to neighbouring Albania. To  achieve this aim, they are using conventional terrorist methods,  launching attacks on members of the army and police.    Over the past year, provocations on the Yugoslav-Albanian  border and illegal incursions into the territory of the F.R.Y.  are frequent.    The Krivolak testing range is the best equipped military  testing ground in Europe and the former Yugoslav Army invested  enormous funds in it, Radovan Kecojevic, the foremost Yugoslav  military expert for explosive devices and pyrotechnics, whose  knowledge and innovations are appreciated around the world, says.    The configuration of Krivolak's terrain is such that a  1-kilo  watt nuclear bomb can explode on it with no adverse effects for  the environment, Kecojevic told VECERNJE NOVOSTI on Tuesday.    A total of 322 U.S. troops, as part of the U.N.  peacekeepers,  are currently in the F.Y.R.M., and a possibility of bringing in  additional troops is considered so that the Scandinavian  peacekeeping contingent, currently in the F.Y.R.M., could be  re-deployed in Bosnia.</p>

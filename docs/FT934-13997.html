			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: United Friendly buys American Express arm UNITED FRIENDLY, the life assurance company, is acquiring Acuma, the UK personal financial consulting and life insurance subsidiary of American Express, for about Pounds 13.6m. As a result of the takeover, up to 300 job losses are expected at Acuma's head office. About 730 people currently work there and some of the job losses will be through a compulsory redundancy programme. United Friendly is buying Acuma Fin-ancial Products Limited and Acuma Limited. The book value of the assets to be acquired was Pounds 6.3m at the end of December 1992. At the same date AFP had shareholder assets of Pounds 4.1m and the value of the long-term fund of Acuma Life Assurance Limited was Pounds 75.9m. United Friendly intends to expand Acuma's business beyond its base in south-east England to areas such as Scotland, Wales and the north of England. It expects to double the Acuma sales force to about 600 or so within the next five years. The acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, will also give United Friendly access to better-off households, where Acuma already has about 20,000 clients. Acuma's sales force will continue to operate separately. United Friendly's main business at present is in life assurance and general insurance to middle and lower income households. In the year to December 31 1992, AFP had a gross premium income of Pounds 42m and suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds 400,000. After a short transitional period, to allow for the costs of establishing the business, Acuma is expected to generate profits on an embedded value basis - intended to recognise in the accounts the value of the future profits stream. But the current accounting basis used by United Friendly will give rise to small losses for several years after the acquisition, the directors explained.</p>

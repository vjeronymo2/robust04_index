			<p>SUMMARY                                             As Ukraine enters the final weeks before the 27 March Supreme  Soviet election, a very large number of candidates are competing  for most of the 450 parliamentary seats, guaranteeing many  runoffs and even raising the possibility that not enough deputies  may be elected to form a parliament.  Activity by parties varies  widely--strong in Lviv and Donetsk but weak in many other places.  With nationalist and democratic parties likely to run well in the  west, leftist and liberal parties in the east, but non-party  candidates likely to win the most seats nationwide, prospects are  for a badly splintered Supreme Soviet with weak parties and  little ability to resolve the country's tough problems.                                       END SUMMARY     Easy filing requirements and lax filing deadlines contributed to  the flood of candidates.  According to the election law,  candidates had to file only 10 signatures by 60 days before the  election (late January) to become a "candidate for candidate" and  then 300 signatures by 45 days before the election (i.e., 10  February) to become a registered candidate (Vidomosti Verkhovnoi  Rady Ukrainy, 30 November 1993).  Although plenty of candidates  had already qualified, the Central Electoral Commission (CEC)  allowed registration to continue after 10 February (Nezavisimost,  11 February), apparently until individual local electoral  commissions decided to close it.  Robitnycha Hazeta reported on  18 February that registration had ended in 211 of the 450  districts, and Holos Ukrainy reported on 23 February that all  registration had finally ended on 17 February.  In late February  the CEC reported that 5,833 (86 percent) of the 6,750 "candidates  for candidate" had been registered as final candidates (Holos  Ukrainy, 2 March).  The lists of candidates began appearing in  local papers in mid-February, and candidates began appearing on  local television in groups--for example, the 16 candidates for  Kiev city district no. 14 were slated to make the first joint  appearance on 14 February (Vecherniy Kiev, 12 February).     Parties' Role Limited     Parties played a limited role in putting forward candidates,  formally nominating only a small percentage of the candidates in  most districts.  Groups of voters nominated 3,633 (62 percent),  work collectives 1,557 (27 percent), while parties nominated only  643 (11 percent), according to the 2 March Holos Ukrainy.  However, some areas, such as Lviv and Donetsk, had a much higher  proportion of party nominees than the republic-wide 11 percent  (See Box 1).     In reality, however, there are far more party-affiliated  candidates on the ballot than party nominations would indicate  because some who were identified with a party in local papers  were nominated by groups of electors or collectives.  In Kiev  Oblast, only 12 candidates were nominated by parties, but 46  candidates actually belong to parties (Kiyvska Pravda, 28  January).  And in Donetsk, lists of candidates for the first 10  districts in Vecherniy Donetsk identified one third to one half  of the candidates in most districts as affiliated with parties,  far more than the number nominated by parties.     At the same time, not all candidates affiliated with a party are  endorsed as candidates by the party.  A DemPU (Democratic Party  of Ukraine) candidate is running against former Defense Minister  Kostyantyn Morozov in Kiev district No. 1 but DemPU itself is  backing Morozov (Samostiyna Ukraina, 23-28 February).     So far, no parties have published republic-wide lists of their  candidates, and though several publicly set a goal of running  candidates in all districts, it appears none came close.  Few  parties have even provided numbers of their candidates.  The  paper Rada (published by Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil) on 3  March carried an article reporting that Rukh members were running  in 260 of the 450 districts and that there also were dozens of  independent candidates "who support Rukh and promise to join  Rukh's faction if elected."  The URP's paper Samostiyna Ukraina  (23-28 February) reported that the URP had registered 132  candidates (including 17 in Lviv, 17 in Kiev, 10 in Ternopil, and  8 in Ivano-Frankivsk), while the DemPU was running fewer  (including only 6 in Kiev city).  The Post-Postup News Agency  reported that a 24 January UNA (Ukrainian National Assembly)  press conference announced 60 candidates (15 in Kiev, 15 in  Poltava and Cherkassy, 12 in Donbass, 4 in Rivne, 3 in Kiev  Oblast, 2 in Odesa, Ternopil, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and Vinnytsa).  The Central Electoral Commission announced that the CPU was  running the most candidates--6.7 percent of all, followed by Rukh  (4.1 percent), SPU (3.11 percent), URP (2.42 percent), Liberal  Party (1.43 percent), and DemPU (1.28 percent), but that there  were also many "hidden" party candidates (Holos Ukrainy,  Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 4 March; Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 March).     Joint Candidacies     Another of the reasons for the limited number of party-nominated  candidates may be agreement among parties to back each others'  candidates to avoid fratricidal contests between like-minded  parties.  In the initial months after announcement of the  election, success at uniting parties behind candidates was very  limited.  More recently, Levko Lukyanenko, head of the "Ukraine"  Democratic Union (the latest name for the coordinating organ set  up by democratic parties in December), has claimed that  democratic parties have made great progress in agreeing on  candidates.  He said at a February press conference that  democratic parties had "agreed on a single candidate" in over 320  of the 450 districts (Kiyvska Pravda, 22 February).  In another  version of his remarks--given in the 22 February Silski Visti and  23 February Khreshchatyk--he reportedly said there were "agreed"  candidates in 342 districts.  He named candidates in 6 Kiev  Oblast districts that the "Ukraine" union would back with both  organizational and financial support (Kiyvska Pravda, 22  February).     Rukh Chairman and longtime Lukyanenko foe Vyacheslav Chornovil  took a more pessimistic view than Lukyanenko of democratic  parties' success in uniting behind agreed candidates.  In a 15  February Sribna Zemlya interview, Chornovil said that the  "Ukraine" union was mainly just Rukh, the URP, and DemPU.  The  PDVU, New Ukraine, social democrats, liberal democrats, christian  democrats, and the "left center" had not joined, he said.  He  also complained that in Lviv the URP had fielded too many  candidates.     Moreover, even Lukyanenko admitted that democrats had been unable  to agree on candidates in 38 districts--mainly in Lviv, Ivano-  Frankivsk, and Ternopil (Silski Visti, 22 February).  In these  areas, where democrats are virtually sure to win, they apparently  felt less need to unite and more opportunity to win on their own.  When the Lviv democratic coordinating council finally announced  its list of candidates, it was able to endorse an agreed  candidate in only 2 of the 23 districts; in the rest it endorsed  more than one candidate or noted that some member-parties were  backing candidates other than the council's (Vysokyy Zamok, 5  March).  Lukyanenko also acknowledged that democrats had been  unable to field any candidates in 18 districts, mainly in the  east--5 in Odesa, 4 in Donetsk, 4 in Luhansk, 2 in Zaporizhzhya,  2 in Krym, and 1 in Poltava (Khreshchatyk, 23 February).     Prospects Vary in Regions     Lists of candidates and reports on party activity in local Kiev,  Lviv, and Donetsk papers provide a sample of the varied and  complex picture in Ukraine's regions.     Kiev     Party strength among candidates for Kiev city's 23 seats is hard  to measure because in listing candidates local papers often  failed to indicate if candidates were associated with a party.  Among the few candidates identified with parties in the papers, 8  were from the CPU, 6 from the SPU, 5 from Rukh, 5 from the PDVU,  3 from the UNA, 3 from the tJKRP (Ukrainian Conservative  Republican Party), and only 1 from the URP and the Liberal Party,  and none from DemPU or New Ukraine.  Fifty-eight were  specifically identified as nonpartisan.  Most of the rest of the  almost 500 candidates listed in the paper Khreshchatyk were not  identified with any party or even identified as nonpartisan.     Although few Kiev candidates bear the Rukh label, Rukh should win  some seats because it has some big names--Chairman of the Supreme  Soviet's democratic faction, Narodna Rada, Ivan Zayets, outspoken  Rukh leader Serhiy Holovatyy, and Minister of Environmental  Protection Yuriy Kostenko.  Democrats in general should do well  since some of their prominent candidates look like easy winners-  -former Defense Minister Kostyantyn Morozov, city soviet chairman  Vasyl Nesterenko, popular maverick Kiev leader Ivan Saliy (who  was fired by Kravchuk as presidential representative for the  city), outspoken Vecherniy Kiev editor Vitaliy Karpenko, and  economic reformer and former Deputy Premier and Minister of  Economy Volodymyr Lanovyy.   Morozov, Karpenko, Zayets,  Holovatyy, and Kostenko were endorsed by several nationalist  democratic organizations (Vecherniy Kiev, 6 January).  Democratic  parties could not reach agreement on single candidates in many  districts, however.  When the "Ukraine" Democratic Union issued  its list of approved candidates, it endorsed candidates for only  14 of the city's 23 districts (Vecherniy Kiev, 10 March).     In general, though, Kiev city appears likely to produce fewer  prominent deputies than in the past.  Many big names on the  incumbent Kiev Supreme Soviet delegation are running for  reelection in other regions where they apparently rate their  chances for election better.  VNRU (National Rukh of Ukraine--the  anti-Chornovil Rukh) leader Larysa Skoryk and Rukh leader Les  Tanyuk are running in Lviv, democrat Pavlo Movchan in Ivano-  Frankivsk, former Premier Vi told Fokin in Cherkassy, and URP  leader Oles Shevchenko in Kiev 'Oblast.  Lukyanenko complained  that too many Kiev democrats were running in the west, where it  is easier to win (Kiyvska Pravda, Khreshchatyk, 22 February)-  -although Kiev city has also been relatively receptive to  democrats in the past, since 17 of the 22 deputies elected from  Kiev city in 1990 joined the democrats' Narodna Rada shortly  after the election.     Lviv     Lviv will remain the main stronghold for democrats and  nationalists.  Its present delegation has many prominent  democrats and nationalists--Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn, UKRP  chairman Stepan Khmara, former Deputy Premier for economic reform  Viktor Pynzenyk, former First Deputy Premier Ihor Yukhnovskyy,  Rukh Chairman Chornovil, city Mayor Mykola Horyn, nationalist  Iryna Kalinets, and PDVU leader Taras Stetskiv.  Now, with others  from outside--Skoryk, Tanyuk, prominent Rukh economist Volodymyr  Chernyak, and Rukh Deputy Chairman Oleksandr Lavrynovych added,  the field has become crowded.  Despite Lukyanenko's complaint  that Kievites are running in Lviv because it is easier to win  there, Tanyuk reportedly dropped out of a Kiev race to clear the  way for an URP candidate (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January), probably  as part of efforts to coordinate candidacies.  Rukh Chairman  Chornovil actually went against the trend, deciding to run in  Ternopil, not Lviv, this time.  He explained that he was not  running in Lviv district 266 in order to help clear the way for  election of Rukh candidate Mykhaylo Boychyshyn (who was kidnapped  a few weeks ago and is still missing) or in district 267 to make  way for Tanyuk (Kievskiye Novosti, 18 February).     Rukh, URP, and New Wave have coordinated some candidates, and  democratic candidates are prominent enough to probably win on the  first ballot in several Lviv districts.  Probable first round  winners include Yukhnovskyy (New Wave), Pynzenyk (New Wave),  Tanyuk (Rukh), Chernyak (Rukh), Lavrynovych (Rukh), Ihor Hryniv  (backed by New Wave, Rukh, and the PDVU--Vysokyy Zamok, 11, 20  January, 3 February; Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 12 January), Lviv tJRP  Chairman Oleh Pavlyshyn, Lviv Rukh Chairman Yuriy Klyuchkovskyy,  and Supreme Soviet member Mykhaylo Kosiv (backed by Rukh, New  Wave, URP, and other organizations--Vysokyy Zamok, 5 February;  Rada, 10 February).     In contrast, the many extreme nationalist candidates (KUN, OUN,  UNA, UKRP, and SNPU) will probably splinter the ultranationalist  vote.  These parties appeared to make little attempt to  coordinate, with the SNPU (Social National Party of Ukraine)  nominating 21 candidates for Lviv's 23 districts (Kievskiye  Vedomosti, 5 March), KUN 14 (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January) and the  UKRP 9 (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 5 January).     District races in Lviv include some notable contests between  prominent figures, sometimes pitting democrats against  ultranationalists:  URP Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn is facing  controversial ultranationalist UKRP Chairman Stepan Khmara in  district no. 261; PDVU leader Taras Stetskiv opposes KUN leader  Iryna Kalynets in district no. 273; and oblast soviet Chairman  Mykola Horyn (Rukh) is running against UNA leader and commander  of UNA's paramilitary arm UNS0 (Ukrainian National Self-Defense)  Oleh Vitovych in district no. 275.     Donetsk     Judging by identifications in the Donetsk press, leftist parties  (CPU, SPU, and the Party of Labor) and the more centrist Liberal  Party and Party of Justice have been the most active in  nominating candidates, while Rukh has some candidates, but few  PDVU, URP, DemPU, or ultranationalists are running.  The 138  candidates for the 10 districts (listed in Vecherniy Donetsk on  19 February) include 11 Liberal Party affiliated candidates, 9  CPU, 8 SPU, 5 Party of Labor, and 5 Party of Justice, but only 3  Rukh, 2 KUN, 1 URP, 1 DemPU, and 1 PDVU.  Holos Ukrainy on 8  February said the largest number of the party candidates in  Donetsk are Communists and Liberals, followed by the Party of  Labor, but most candidates were nominated by groups of electors.  CPU leaders Petro Symonenko and Yevhen Marmazov are running here  (Pravda Ukrainy, 18 January).     Democrats, at least nationalist democrats, are clearly weak in  Donetsk.  Lukyanenko said that there are few democrats running in  general and none at all in 4 Donetsk districts (Khreshchatyk, 23  February).  Post-Postup reported a 15 January Rukh conference had  managed to nominate 12 candidates for Donetsk's 47 districts.  The lists of candidates, at least in the first 10 districts, not  only showed few Rukh, URP, and DemPU candidates, but also few or  no candidates from the non-nationalist democratic parties or  blocs that should be strong in the east--New Ukraine, PDVU, the  Labor Congress of Ukraine, and the Interregional Bloc for Reform  set up by former Premier Leonid Kuchma and former Supreme Soviet  Deputy Chairman Volodymyr Hrynyov, which appears active in  Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk.     A new local Donetsk bloc has also sprung up recently and  nominated many candidates.  The "People's Congress of Donetsk,"  which backs Ukrainian independence but opposes what it calls the  present "speculative anarchy" and wants more state control and  social protection for the public, registered candidates in most  Donetsk districts, according to a 3 February Demokratychna  Ukraina article.     Dangers in Electoral Process     The large number of candidates and limited ability of parties to  organize support for candidates and provide some sort of order to  the competition indicates there may be few winners on the first  ballot, necessitating runoffs in many districts.  To win, a  candidate has to get over 50 percent of the votes cast and votes  of at least 25 percent of registered voters (according to the  election law in the Vidomosti, 30 November 1993).  For the  election itself to be valid, 50 percent of the registered voters  have to vote, according to the Ukrainian law.  These requirements  apply to all rounds of balloting.  If no candidate qualifies as a  winner on the first round, the two highest vote-getters run in a  runoff, which must be held within two weeks after the first  round.  In the 12 December Russian parliamentary election, only a  plurality was needed, so almost all seats were filled on the  first ballot.     In addition to the difficulty of getting enough voters out to  vote and of candidates garnering a majority of the votes cast,  the voting procedures may produce many invalid votes, which also  could prevent anyone winning.  As in past elections, voters have  to cross off all candidates except the one they wish to vote for.  With 25 or 30 candidates in many districts, the voter has to  cross off a large number of names, and if he inadvertently leaves  more than one name not crossed off, the ballot will be invalid.  If a voter crosses off all names, his vote is valid, however.  In  the 12 December Russian election, Russia changed over to positive  voting, whereby voters put a mark only by the names of those they  wished to vote for.     The prospect of many runoffs has led to concern that voters will  lose interest and too few will vote in the second round to meet  the requirements for a valid election or that even in the runoff  no one will win a majority (if a substantial number of voters  cross out both candidates).  In this case, the election rules  provide for new elections within a month of the original election  in which all candidates in the original election would be barred  (Vidomosti, 30 November 1993).  With the need to quickly come up  with new candidates who had not participated earlier, it seems  likely that the quality of the candidates would decline and voter  interest may drop further, producing more invalid elections and  leaving many seats unfilled--perhaps even enough to prevent the  formation of a new Supreme Soviet.     Outlook     Although most news reporting on the Ukrainian elections has  focused on the activity of parties and their candidates, most  candidates are unaffiliated, and presumably they will win most  seats, especially in rural areas where parties are weakest.  Many  of these unaffiliated may be conservative-leaning representatives  of interest groups, lobbies, or behind-the-scenes power  structures.  While democrats are strong in west Ukraine, they  appear to have little organization or support in much of the rest  of the country, further adding to the prospect for returning a  conservative legislature.  There is also a danger that low voter  turnout could void the balloting in enough districts to prevent  formation of a new Supreme Soviet, raising the prospect of a  paralysis of government.     Box 1                          Regional Variations in Party Activity     In Lviv, parties were very active, judging by reports in local  papers of meetings by Rukh, KUN (Congress of Ukrainian  Nationalists), New Wave, UKRP (Ukrainian Conservative Republican  Party), and the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party that nominated  candidates for Lviv's 23 districts (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4, 12  January; Vysokyy Zamok, 4, 6, 18 January).  Although lists of  candidates in Lviv papers often did not report the organization  nominating, a relatively large proportion of candidates were  identified as affiliated with a party--in most districts about  half the candidates.  Many of these candidates, however, were  nominated by groups rather than parties.     In Donetsk, which encompasses 47 districts as the most populous  oblast of Ukraine, a high proportion of candidates were  identified with parties and parties nominated numerous  candidates.  The 19 February Vecherniy Donetsk report on the  first 10 Donetsk districts* identified 51 of the 138 candidates  with parties and listed 7 candidates nominated by the CPU  (Communist Party of Ukraine), 6 by the SPU (Socialist Party of  Ukraine), 6 by the Liberal Party, 4 by the Party of Labor, 3 by  Rukh, 3 by the Party of Justice, 3 by the Peoples Congress of  Donetsk, and 1 by the URP (Ukrainian Republican Party).     In Zaporizhzhya (18 districts) 20 percent of the candidates were  nominated by parties (18 by Rukh, 18 by the SPU, 12 by the CPU, 7  by the Liberal Party, and 4 by the Labor Party), according to the  8 February Holos Ukrainy.     On the other hand, in Kiev Oblast (17 districts) only 12 of the  264 candidates were nominated by parties (Kiyvska Pravda, 22  February)--about 5 percent.  Kiyvska Pravda on 20 January  identified the 1JRP as the most active party in nominating  candidates.  In Dnipropetrovsk (34 seats) only 17 candidates were  nominated by parties, versus 129 by groups of voters and 58 by  collectives (Pravda Ukrainy, 27 January)--about 9 percent.  In  Krym (23 seats), parties--the URP, CPU, PDVU (Party of Democratic  Revival of Ukraine), and the Party for Economic Revival of Krym-  -nominated only 26 of the 140 candidates (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 23  February).     *The subsequent Donetsk papers listing the candidates in the  other 37 districts have not yet come in.     End Box 1     Box 2                               Roster of Parties Mentioned     Leftist:     CPU (Communist Party of Ukraine), led by Petro Symonenko.     Party of Labor, led by Mykola Azarov, anti-nationalist, pro-  socialist.     SPU (Socialist Party of Ukraine), led by 0leksandr Moroz, pro-  communist.     Non-nationalist democratic centrist:     LPU (Liberal Party of Ukraine), led by Ihor Markulov, pro-  business, pro-privatization, based predominately in east Ukraine.     New Ukraine, led by Volodymyr Hrynyov, pro-reform, anti-Kravchuk.  PDVU (Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine), led by Volodymyr  Filenko, anti-Rukh, anti-Kravchuk, pro-reform.     People's Congress of Donetsk.  (The stance of this new bloc is  not clear, but it appears fairly centrist, reportedly favoring  Ukrainian independence and also more state control and social  protection of the public, according to a 3 February Demokratychna  Ukraina article).     TKU (Labor Congress of Ukraine), led by Anatoliy Matviyenko.  Ukrainian Party of Justice, led by Mykhaylo Hrechka.  (Classified  as "liberal centrist," along with the Liberal Party and Labor  Congress, by an 8 February Moloda Ukraina article).     Nationalist democratic centrist:     DemPU (Democratic Party of Ukraine), led by Volodymyr  Yavorivskyy, pro-Kravchuk, anti-Chornovil.     New Wave, created in Lviv by some PDVU, Rukh, URP and other  democrats as an election bloc. (See The Trends of 2 February  1994, page 30.)     Rukh, led by Vyacheslav Chornovil, anti-Kravchuk, pro-reform.     USDP (Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party), led by Serhiy  Plachynda, close to Rukh.     URP (Ukrainian Republican Party), led by Mykhaylo Horyn, pro-  Kravchuk, anti-Chornovil.     VNRU (National Rukh of Ukraine), led by Larysa Skoryk, pro-  Kravchuk, anti-Chornovil.     Ultranationalist:     KUN (Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists), led by Yaroslav  Stetsko.     OUN (Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists), led by Mykola  Slyvka.     SNPU (Social National Party of Ukraine), formerly called National  Socialist Party of Ukraine, semi-fascist.     UKRP (Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party), led by Stepan  Khmara, anti-Kravchuk.     UNA (Ukrainian National Assembly), led by Yuriy Shukhevych,  militantly nationalist.     End Box 2     Box 3                             Nomination of Prominent Leaders     Supreme Soviet:  Chairman Ivan Plyushch, at present representing  Kiev Oblast, is now registered as a candidate in Chernihiv  (Kiyvska Pravda, 22 February), while Deputy Chairman Vasyl  Durdinets is running in Kirovohrad (Holos Ukrainy, 22 January),  where he was elected before--apparently safe districts.  Most of  the Supreme Soviet's incumbent deputies are not running, however.  The Central Electoral Commission announced that only 145 current  deputies are running, while 42 others had been candidates for  candidate but had dropped out (Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 March).     Presidential hopefuls:  Former Premier Kuchma switched from his  native Dnipropetrovsk to run in Chernihiv (Rada, 3 March;  Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 March), former Supreme Soviet Deputy  Chairman Hrynyov is again running in his home oblast of Kharkiv,  and Rukh Chairman Chornovil switched from Lviv to Ternopil.     Leaders of parties:  SPU leader Oleksandr Moroz is apparently  running again in Kiev 0blast, UKRP leader Khmara again in Lviv,  TKU (Labor Congress of Ukraine) leader Anatoliy Matviyenko again  in Vinnytsa, CPU leader Petro Symonenko in Donetsk, URP leader  Mykhaylo Horyn again in Lviv, and DemPU leader Volodymyr  Yavorivskyy again in Kirovohrad.  Liberal Party Chairman Ihor  Markulov announced he would not run for parliament (Pravda  Ukrainy, 1 February).     Members of the government:  Many officials are registered as  candidates even though they apparently cannot retain their jobs  if elected, since the new Supreme Soviet is supposed to be a  fulltime job--to avoid the present frequent absences by deputies  with other jobs.  The election law stipulates that candidates  must file a statement promising to give up other jobs if elected.  Despite this, acting Premier Yukhym Zvyahilskyy and Deputy  Premier Valentyn Landyk were nominated in their native Donetsk,  and in all, 4 deputy premiers and 37 ministers and deputy  ministers are registered as candidates (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 4  March; Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 March).  President Kravchuk was  nominated in several districts but, pointing out that the law  does not allow the president to run for the Supreme Soviet,  declined the nominations (Ukraina Moloda, 15 February).

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Olympic symbol to become copyright THE OLYMPIC symbol is to become the subject of exclusive copyright in Britain, Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, announced yesterday, Gillian Tett writes. Under legislation expected to be passed soon, the British Olympic Association will have sole UK control over the five-ringed Olympic symbol, with rights to sell the symbol to promoters. Until now use of the symbol has been unregulated. with a number of businesses across Britain adopting versions for their marketing. Mr Brooke said the move underlined the government's support for Manchester's bid to host the 2000 Olympics. The International Olympic Committee required countries hosting the games to provide a copyright guarantee for the symbol. The British Olympic Association said that companies wishing to use any version of the symbol would have to pay 'at least a six-figure sum' to become official sponsors.</p>

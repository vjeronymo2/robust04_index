			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Maxwell company linked to share deal INVESTIGATORS have dis-covered that funds paid to the US investment bank Goldman Sachs to buy shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation came from a company controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The order to buy the shares, however, came from Swiss companies said to be unconnected to Mr Maxwell. This new evidence has been uncovered by accountants from Arthur Andersen, which is investigating an alleged illegal attempt to support the MCC share price. Arthur Andersen has found a facsimile from Mr Eric Sheinberg, a Goldman partner, to Dr Werner Rechsteiner, a Zurich-based lawyer, detailing a transaction in 25m MCC shares. Goldman acted as broker in the sale for Pounds 56m of 25m MCC shares to two secretive Swiss companies, Servex and Yakosa, on April 26 1991. Dr Rechsteiner is a director of Yakosa and is also a director of other Swiss companies linked to Servex. The authorisation for the transaction came from Zurich. However, the money to pay for the shares is understood to have come from Bishopsgate Investment Trust, an investment company controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell. Investigators believe that after the purchase, BIT held the shares in trust for the Swiss vehicles. If Mr Maxwell funded the transaction, he should under company law have disclosed his interest in the 25m shares. Arthur Andersen is also concerned that some of the funds used in the alleged share support operation may have been channeled from Mr Maxwell's public company, MCC. It is illegal for a public company to assist in the purchase of its own shares without obtaining shareholder approval. Investigators will therefore press Goldman for answers to these questions: Did Goldman suspect that there were links between Mr Maxwell and the Swiss companies, Yakosa and Servex? Did Goldman suspect that BIT provided the funds to settle the transaction? Did Goldman suspect that the MCC shares might have been subsequently held in trust by a Maxwell private company? Goldman refused to comment for fear of breaching client confidentiality rules. There is evidence that Goldman had been concerned that some of the investors which bought MCC shares from it in 1991 might be connected to Mr Maxwell. Goldman obtained oral confirmation from these clients - most of them introduced to it by Mr Maxwell - that they were not connected to Mr Maxwell. It subsequently obtained further confirmation in writing from all but one of the clients. Dr Rechsteiner has said that Servex and Yakosa held MCC shares at one point, but has added that he believes they have nothing to hide. Goldman may have been ignorant that BIT held the MCC shares, since the shares may have been passed to another temporary holder before reaching BIT. It is also likely to argue that the source of the funds would have been known only to its settlements department, which takes no part in the broking of deals.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday, Vice President Arturo Herbruger Asturias  denied any possibility that the government and the Army are  planning an offensive against residents of the Communities of  Resistant People (CPR). "The Defense Ministry has already denied  such accusations. It clearly stated that there will not be  unreasonable actions against them or that there will be any  persecution," he added.    In paid advertisements, CPR members claim that since 10  February, there have been "large military mobilizations"  apparently aimed at subjecting them to military control,  preventing them from rebuilding the Ixcan Grande Cooperative,  and stopping more refugees from returning.    Herbruger noted that far from organizing acts to intimidate  or affect these people, the government is involved in efforts to  protect them.    Deputy Foreign Minister Bernardo Arevalo also said the  members of the OAS Inter-American Human Rights Commission  (CIDH), who recently visited these communities, did not tell the  Foreign Ministry about similar complaints. Arevalo said that in  the letter requesting permission to visit the CPR's, the CIDH  did not mention this as a motive and only limited itself to  saying that it wanted to observe the reintegration of refugees  into the communities process.</p>

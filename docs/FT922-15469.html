			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC moving to a decision on farm reform package THE EUROPEAN Community is set to decide next month whether it can agree on the most radical overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy in its 30-year history. At the same time, the Community roundly rejected yesterday's ruling by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that the new EC oilseeds regime discriminated against US soya imports, in a response likely to worsen further the transatlantic conflict over farm trade. The European Commission and the current Portuguese presidency of the EC are to push for the conclusion of the 14-month negotiations on CAP reform at the next Council of the 12 farm ministers in Luxembourg on April 28. This followed individual negotiations with each of the ministers late into Monday night. All objections of principle to the Brussels reform blueprint appear to have been set aside, according to Commission officials and senior officials from member states. They stressed, nevertheless, that critical details remained to be tied up in horse-trading that could easily last into June. 'There was a lot of sweetness and light,' a senior Commission official remarked without a hint of irony. But he cautioned that the farm council had accepted the reform in principle in November, only to have the UK, Netherlands and Denmark restate fundamental objections earlier this month. The Dutch and Danes now appear willing to negotiate the best outcome for their interests on the details of the reform, their officials say. The British, de facto, are doing the same, even though Mr John Gummer, UK farm minister, insisted yesterday that agreement would not be possible if Britain's bigger farms were discriminated against. The reform, in essence, calls for heavy price cuts, with full compensation which medium-to-large farms would only get by setting aside 15 per cent of their land, for which the larger farms would not get recompense. The Commission has persistently argued that the big farmers who benefit most from the CAP budget of Ecu35.3bn (Pounds 25bn) get about 20 per cent more than they need to remain competitive. The main cloud over CAP reform now appears to be the outcome of the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation talks, where final agreement is being held up by the inability of the EC and US to agree on farm subsidy cuts. In particular, they disagree about whether compensation payments under CAP reform would be allowed into the Gatt 'green box', permitting subsidies which do not promote production and distort trade. Ministers yesterday eased their opposition slightly to Gatt's demand that the EC restrict the volume of its subsidised exports, as well as the amount of the subsidy, indicating that a mix of the two could be acceptable. But the council unanimously rejected a Gatt panel's verdict - formally announced yesterday - outlawing the EC's new oilseeds regime. This regime was designed to comply with an earlier Gatt ruling which found that the EC discriminated against US oilseeds, which are allowed into the Community duty-free under a 1962 Gatt agreement. Ministers judged that the panel had exceeded its remit in condemning the oilseed subsidies - copied from the CAP reform blueprint  - as an incentive to producers. By deriving their judgment from the Uruguay Round conclusions of last December - which the EC has not accepted  - the Gatt was prejudging the 'green box' negotiations, ministers concluded. A senior Commission official added that the US attitude to the EC across all the Gatt fronts where the two sides are in dispute was 'come out with your hands up'. Mr Gummer argued that US baulking at liberalisation of services within the Uruguay Round was now a greater stumbling block than agriculture, and warned Washington against bullying. 'The Americans have got to learn that this is an international negotiation in which they are not the imperial power, and we are negotiating with them on equal terms,' he said.</p>

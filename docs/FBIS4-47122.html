			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Yuryevich Grushevskiy, deputy director </F> of the Center for Economic and Regional Studies: "'And Once  Again the Trumpet Sounds....'"; subtitled "Crimean Triangle"]    [Text] Ukrainian airborne forces and Spetsnaz have once  again landed on the pages of Russian newspapers, and Ukrainian  armored transport vehicles have been glimpsed on the television  screens. New crisis in southern Ukraine, new crisis in  Russian-Ukrainian relations. And no matter that the sources of  the information--the Crimean administration and the press center  of the Black Sea Fleet--are all too often regaling us with  defective news, they are achieving their purposes: The exposures  have an indistinct ring, and a new image of the enemy--a  perfidious and aggressive Ukraine encroaching on Russian land,  Russian property, and Russian honor and glory--is being shaped  and is strengthening.    The psychological preparation of the general consciousness  for the perception of such a position was manifested distinctly  at the time of the recent Crimean crisis, when the notion that  the conflict between Kiev and Simferopol was needed by the  forces in Ukraine that, playing the "Crimea card," are  endeavoring to postpone the presidential elections and remain in  power for as long as possible was prevalent in Russian public  opinion.    An effective version, but improbable, nonetheless. And it is  not only that practically nowhere in the post-Soviet world that  has rejected totalitarianism does policy resemble a  well-calculated chess match but is reminiscent almost everywhere  of the patching of holes in one part of a caftan by creating  them in another. The abundance of diverse (but always most  acute) problems and life's ineradicable trivia physically  prevent the administration from switching from the level of  tactical tasks to a higher strategic level. The disruption of  the traditional patterns of decisionmaking and the malfunction  in the mechanisms of their realization are more often than not  permitting the authorities merely to respond in haste to the  rapidly changing situation. What time does the new elite have  here for calculated multi-move maneuvers! And Ukraine is no  exception in this respect. But even were this not the case and  were Kravchuk's team really attempting to play the "Crimea  card," it is hard, all the same, to agree that such a pragmatist  as Kravchuk (and he is undoubtedly in this category of  politicians) has deliberately moved toward an open conflict with  Crimea for the sake of preservation of his power and the  cohesion of his nation. Regardless of his personal affections,  the president of Ukraine cannot fail to take account of the fact  that Meshkov is today backed by a majority of the Crimean  electorate and that the Crimean administration is supported by a  significant part of the command of the Black Sea Fleet and that,  given certain circumstances, the entire might and authority of  the Russian Federation could be behind him. With this alignment  of forces, Kiev would find itself in an obviously losing  situation in a confrontation with Simferopol and could not  realistically hope to win a conflict and retain control of the  peninsula.    In addition, an unpleasant outcome of the Crimean crisis for  Kiev would threaten a sharp exacerbation of the internal  political situation. It would inevitably entail an increase in  the influence of extremist and the radicalization of moderate  political forces and a growth of the separatist mood in a number  of southern and eastern oblasts, which is fraught with the  danger of a split of all of Ukrainian society and could put to  rest the very idea of an independent unified Ukrainian state  within its present borders. The example of Georgia, which was  pulled into a conflict, is all too fresh and graphic for the  leadership of Ukraine not to draw conclusions from the sorry  Georgian experience. And it hardly needs to be recalled how  lamentable is the lot of the presidents of ruined  countries--power is no joy to them. The risk of such a  development of events is too great for Kravchuk to attempt to  hold on to power by provoking a large-scale conflict in Crimea.  All Kiev's actions are, meanwhile, reminiscent more of attempts  to curb what could be for itself an unpropitious development of  events and to return processes on the peninsula to the framework  of the Ukrainian Constitution. It is essential here to make an  allowance for the fact that Ukraine has encountered a crisis of  such a scale for the first time and that the machinery of state,  which is largely in the grip of old ideas, was hardly prepared  to respond in skilled and appropriate fashion to this challenge  ahead of time.    On the other hand, it has to be noted that the crisis is to  the benefit of the forces that have come to power in Crimea,  inasmuch as only via confrontation can they realize their  program goals and, if not separate, then, availing themselves of  the tension, "push" the peninsula as far away from Ukraine as  possible. In a stable and calm atmosphere, however, they would  hardly succeed in persuading the authorities of Ukraine to  renounce its internationally recognized borders and to recognize  the self-proclaimed republic as a full-fledged subject of  international relations.    A particular danger for peace and security in the region in  this connection emanates from the attempts of the Crimean  administration to portray Ukraine in the form of an aggressor  and to pull Russia into the conflict in order, at a minimum, to  conduct a further conversation with Kiev with Russia behind its  back. The appeal of six weeks ago of the Office of the President  of the Republic of Crimea to Moscow requesting that it stop a  Ukrainian assault landing in Simferopol that was allegedly under  way, the present appeals to the news media with reports of the  arrival on the peninsula of appreciable contingents of Ukrainian  national guardsmen (not confirmed, for that matter), the  assurances of Kuznetsov, the Crimean minister of internal  affairs, of Kiev's intention of transporting to the peninsula  overnight 60,000 Ukrainian servicemen (the technical feasibility  of which under the present conditions military experts seriously  doubt), the disinformation concerning the Ukrainian Spetsnaz's  storming of the Crimean Ministry of Internal Affairs, and much  else may be recalled here. Any rash reaction on the part of  Russia to the calls for help coming from Simferopol would have  irreversibly transferred the conflict to a new, practically  uncontrollable level, which, thank God, did not happen.    The recent crisis in Crimea has shown that a further  escalation of tension could result in a serious regional  conflict, in which there would be no winners. This, by all  accounts, is clearly understood in Kiev, of which the readiness  with which the Ukrainian leadership agreed to negotiations with  Moscow and to consultations with Simferopol may serve as  evidence. What, then, can be done today for a peaceful  settlement of the situation that has taken shape in connection  with Crimea? Efforts should be made first and foremost to  localize the conflict and prevent its further escalation, and  Kiev's attempts to resort to simple solutions and put power  pressure on its opponents would seem to be ineffective in this  connection. The result could be the direct opposite of that  expected, especially since the Crimean administration is trying  to appear the victim of its "northern neighbor" as it is. As the  experience of other conflicts on the territory of the former  Soviet Union shows, a balanced, wait-and-see position and a  shift of the emphases from ideological opposition to the  economic sphere and the sphere of actual policy could prove more  productive at this phase of development of the crisis situation.    And recent information testifies that Kiev is opting for  this  path in relations with Simferopol. Inasmuch as the military are  frequently an independent force in zones of ethno-political  tension and conflicts, a lowering of the level of confrontation  and the further resolution of the conflict will depend to a  large extent on the surmounting of the uncertainty of the status  of the units and subunits of the Black Sea Fleet stationed on  the peninsula and in the south of the Ukrainian mainland. Having  agreed with Kazakhstan on the leasing of Baykonur and having  found mutual understanding with Latvia on the use on the  radar-tracking station in Skrunda, Russia simply cannot share  the naval legacy of the USSR with Ukraine by laying claim to the  infrastructure even in Izmail, which is remote from the Russian  Federation. The result would be the spread of tension not only  at the locations where the Black Sea Fleet is based on the  peninsula, but also in practically all the Black Sea ports of  Ukraine. I would like to hope that the continuation of  negotiations on a division of the Black Sea Fleet and its  infrastructure begun by the prime ministers of the two countries  will reduce the danger of the involvement of regulation military  units in the confrontation. Special attention should be paid  simultaneously to the prevention of the interference in the  conflict of extremist formations--illegal groups of militants of  political movements, Cossacks, and volunteers.    Considering Russia's special role in this region, it would  be  no great exaggeration to say that Moscow bears the  responsibility at this time for the further development of  events. And its mission in the localization and minimization of  the conflict could be, despite the pressure of the imperial  opposition and despite the emotional pressure of Crimea, to  prevent itself from becoming involved in a direct confrontation  with Ukraine, to remain within the framework of international  and bilateral agreements, and, in the event of an appeal by the  interested parties, to make every effort for the development of  dialogue between Simferopol and Kiev.</p>

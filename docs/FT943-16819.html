			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Tenders sought for lottery TV shows Camelot, the consortium that will launch the National Lottery in November, is planning to ask independent producers to make the main lottery television programmes, including the multi-million pound draw on national television on Saturday nights. The tender is likely to be one of the most high-profile series of programmes available to independent producers for many years. Camelot, whose investors range from Cadbury Schweppes to De la Rue and Racal, is close to finalising a deal with the BBC for two programmes a week  -one on Saturday evenings and the other mid-week.</p>

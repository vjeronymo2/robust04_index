			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / How To Spend It: Making risky arrangements over the phone - How can you make sure that the florist does what you want? Lucia van der Post explains how to pick your words when you say it with flowers IT'S EASTER . . . or Mother's Day . . . or St. Valentine's Day . . . or somebody's birthday or a friend is in hospital . . . a 'floral tribute' seems just the thing. More substantial than a card, less fattening than chocolates, more welcoming than hankies, nobody anywhere ever had too many flowers. So you ring up the florist and ask for something pretty and appropriate to be sent. You are profusely and warmly thanked but probably have little real idea of what has been dispatched in your name. You hope it was everything you dreamed of - an enchanting collection that gives great pleasure but also speaks (but discreetly, of course) of taste, style and generosity. But taste and style among the Oasis set is a moveable feast. What once was absolutely a la mode - the elaborate confections of yesteryear - are deemed by the taste police of today to be as out-of-date as the power suit. Artlessness and simplicity is what new-age floristry is all about. Originality, too. No longer do flowers necessarily come wrapped simply in paper and standard-issue ribbon - baskets of every shape and size, glass bowls, even . . . in Elizabeth Azagury's case . . . an Hermes scarf all serve to wrap and contain the flowers, twigs and foliage. All the most sought-after florists are either going for simple posies of a single flower or doing wild things with twigs and berries, fruits and nuts. The school of floristry, first pioneered by Pulbrook &amp; Gould, which deemed that 'fronds of cow parsley were as important as a stem lilies; where a branch of blackberries enhanced rare dark roses; where a small bunch of mixed herbs was more special than a dozen carnations' has won the day. If you mind about such things how can you be sure of what is being sent in your name? Generous or regular flower senders build up warm and loyal relationships with a particular florist who gets to know their taste and style. But for the rest of us, who resort to florists but rarely, it is a chancier business. To see just what some of London's best florists are currently offering I decided to draw up a cast of imaginary but typical characters and ask each florist to devise something that they felt would be just right. Photographed here are their solutions. ***** Rob Van Helden, 156 The Grampians, Shepherd's Bush Road, London W6. Tel: 071-603-0443. We asked Rob to create something suitable for a metropolitan sophisticate - a dauntingly chic successful business woman with an equally daunting lifestyle, given to first-class travel but not to suffering fools gladly. Always the first with the latest trends, she is a demanding customer to please. Rob's speciality is hugely generous baskets filled with interesting foliage and sophisticated combinations of shades of white, blue and white or white and pink. What he devised for our picky sophisticate is typical of his style  -a chunky, reusable basket filled with glossy green foliage and a combination of white hyacinths and tulips, interspersed with berries. Rob's creations are most notable for their generosity - that is a very large basket, brimming with greenery and flora, and all for Pounds 40, including delivery in the London area. Our picky lady would love the all-white combination (tres tres chic in her circles) and she would love the fact that she does not have to stop and arrange the flowers herself - she can simply put the whole basket on to a convenient table and there it will sit looking chic, voluptuous and smelling wonderfully of the country. For those who want to send something smaller Rob also does simple tied bouquets, or sometimes uses glass containers (again the collection arrives ready be put wherever it looks best). He likes best to use seasonal flowers and is particularly fond of single-colour arrangements - blue hyacinths at the moment are a particular favourite. His prices include delivery in the London area but, for an extra delivery charge, he will deliver anywhere in the UK. ***** Forever Flowering, Orchard House, Mortlake Road, Kew Gardens, Surrey TW9 4AS. Tel: 081-392-9929. We asked for something to please a young girl - not a trendy, disco-going metropolitan miss but somebody sweet and a touch old-fashioned, who dresses at Laura Ashley and Monsoon, bicycles to work, has trouble making ends meet and whose idea of a good night out is listening to Bach at The Wigmore Hall. What arrived was perfect - an authentic traditional Sussex garden trug (10 in size) filled with nothing but pink parrot tulips. Delivered exactly as it is, to any address in the UK it would cost Pounds 35 plus Pounds 5 delivery charge. Orders placed before noon are delivered the next day. A larger trug, 14 ins size, costs Pounds 45 but prices start from Pounds 20. There are also sweet little willow basket with low handles, brimming with flowers. Or you could order a box of cut flowers tied with a simple white ribbon - choose the colour combination you like best (Forever Flowers tends to favour two colours: white and blue or pink and green). As Forever Flowering points out, these make double gifts - the flowers are beautiful and afterwards the trug or basket can be used again and again. It can hold eggs or fruit or other flowers. Forever Flowering specialises in simple, natural country flowers - 'If I tell you,' says Sandra Rangecroft, who started it, 'that we NEVER use chrysanthemums or carnations that probably tells you all you need to know.' She uses mainly seasonal flowers - at the moment parrot tulips, hyacinths, chincherinchees from the Netherlands - and one of her most popular arrangements is a simply tied bunch of dried lavender surrounding a bunch of fresh pale pink parrot tulips. ***** Azagury, 50 Knightsbridge, London SW1. Tel: 071-235-0799. From Azagury we asked for something to suit a nice, sweet, gentle Sloane Ranger. She has a small flat in Clapham, her spiritual home is Peter Jones, during the week she cooks lunches for the directors in a merchant bank and at weekends she speeds off to see Mummy and Daddy in Hampshire and exercise her horse. Elizabeth Azagury produced probably the most stunning and original collection of the lot (see photograph below) - our Sloane Ranger would be very, very impressed. Elizabeth Azagury had done wondrous things with contorted willow and eucalyptus, with pink amaryllis, white lilac and French tulips. With relatively few flowers she had created a very theatrical impression. By some wizardry she had managed to put together even this dramatic collection in such a way that all one had to do was undo the wrapping and it was ready to be plonked straight into a vase. The final, witty, Sloane touch was that the whole was wrapped in a beautiful pale blue, white and buttercup yellow Hermes silk scarf. The arrangement cost about Pounds 25 without the silk scarf - an extra Pounds 135 with it. Elizabeth Azagury also likes using hot or acid colours and is currently given to teaming fuchsia with purples and oranges. She is also rather fond of lots of lime green. When she is not using hot colours she likes very fresh ones (like the ones used for the arrangement she sent us). She also likes flowers loosely put together, nothing too stiff or too formal, a little touch of wildness never goes amiss - 'though it must be properly balanced'. She can only handle deliveries in the London area. ***** Caroline Dickenson, 5 William Street, London SW1. Tel: 071-245-9599. From Caroline Dickenson we asked for something to please a lady-who-lunches  -you have read about them, perhaps you even know one. She is addicted to Chanel (what is she going to do now that Grunge is coming in?), her favourite haunts are San Lorenzo and the Caprice. She lives in Kensington, where her chief preoccupations are her nanny, her aerobics class and her Pekinese. Caroline Dickenson sent the vibrant hand-tied posy pictured left. A combination of red anemones and orange calypso roses it, like the other hand-tied bunches, arrives ready to dunk into a vase. Wonderfully tasteful though all white and green arrangements are, it has to be said that her brilliant colours made a refreshing change from the purity and simplicity of the all-white school of floristry. At just Pounds 15 (including delivery) it was good value for money. Caroline Dickenson finds her own tastes have moved on to a much more dramatic colour palette - she now often uses flowers in the sort of colours that Christian Lacroix uses in his clothes - clashing and opulent. This is the direction the new, young florists are heading. ***** Pulbrook &amp; Gould, Liscartan House, 127, Sloane Street, London SW1X 9AS. Tel: 071-730-0030. With Pulbrook &amp; Gould we asked that they devise something for a much-loved mother, the sort of person who has spent most of her grown-up years looking after other people. Generous and unselfish, she has far too much to do to worry about what is in fashion and what is out. When there is any money left over she tends to spend it on her husband or one of her many children. What she needs, above all, is a treat. Just because she isn't bothered about what is in and what is out is no reason to give her second-best. Pulbrook &amp; Gould pulled out all the stops - white ranunculas, freesias, guelder roses, anemones and lots of thick, glossy green foliage with some dark exotic berries made for an offering that was at once ravishingly pretty and madly chic. A simply tied bouquet means that the bunch needs no arranging - once the string is undone the flowers are ready to put into a vase. Pulbrook &amp; Gould report that there is currently a big vogue for simplicity - where a few years ago they would have been sending proper bouquets these days they find their customers like simple, tied bunches. These can range from tiny little bunches of lilies of the valley or miniature roses up to large bunches of roses. They have always used a lot of foliage and they try, above all, to use flowers that are in season. Though they have strong likes and dislikes they would try, they say, to give a customer what he wanted - the more information you can give the florist when you ring, the more you are likely to be pleased with the result. Prices start at Pounds 45 for a tied posy or a bunch like the one photographed above</p>

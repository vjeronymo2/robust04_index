			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Goodies for a big feast: Though the UK chancellor has little room for manoeuvre he still wants to unveil a Budget to remember Old Treasury hands are beginning to wonder what is wrong. With this year's UK Budget less than four weeks away, an eerie silence is surrounding their massive Edwardian pile overlooking Parliament Square. The customary fevered speculation about imminent fiscal change has been absent this year. The activity of lobbyists has been restrained. If Mr Kenneth Clarke's second Budget is creeping up on the nation in carpet slippers, the reasons are clear. The chancellor has himself destroyed one potentially big story by insisting that tax cuts are not on the agenda. The government already has a multi-year deficit reduction programme in place following its two Budgets of 1993. Midway between elections is rarely the time for fiscal sensations. Professor Wynne Godley, one of the Treasury's panel of independent forecasters or 'wise men', has argued that in terms of macro-economic policy the right course for the immediate future 'is to do nothing at all'. But Mr Clarke cannot stand up on November 29 and stay silent. More than ever, after last year's unification of the old spring revenue-raising budget with the Autumn Statement detailing future government spending, the Budget is the chancellor's great set-piece occasion in which he explains the government's financial and economic policies to the parliament and nation. In spite of the calm, much may be riding on this year's Budget. It could give the government a chance to put behind it recent mishaps such as the climb-down on Post Office privatisation and allegations of sleaze. Mid-term Budgets may not feature much in history books, but they often set the tone of policy in the approach to the next general election. Mr Clarke's performance could have important repercussions in the middle ground of politics, where the government has to meet the challenge from Mr Tony Blair's new model Labour Party. There are a host of nitty-gritty tax and spending matters that the government must tackle every year. But this year's Budget may be more interesting for the way it addresses broad social issues, such as unemployment and the changing world of work. Although Mr Clarke has established his credentials as a prudent and decisive chancellor since moving into Number 11 Downing Street in May 1993, he has a much wider range of political interests than his Tory predecessors in the job since 1979. Issues such as tax reform have less appeal for him than trying to ensure that Britain's voters feel prosperous. Perhaps reflecting these priorities, Mr Clarke has appeared less than obsessed with preparations for this Budget. It is difficult to imagine Lord Lawson or Mr Norman Lamont cancelling preparatory discussions with ministers and senior Treasury officials at the chancellor's country residence in Dorneywood to fly to a meeting of European Union finance ministers to settle a row over Italian milk quotas as did Mr Clarke last month. The Treasury too has had other things on its mind. Its internal reorganisation, unveiled last month, absorbed a great deal of senior mandarins' time. But there is no sign of the Budget falling behind schedule. Remarkably, given the controversies surrounding Mr Jonathan Aitken, the chief secretary, the cabinet is scheduled to meet next Tuesday to try to finalise the spending side of the Budget. One reason why the Budget appears to be clicking into place is that it has long been reasonably clear what the government has to do on both the taxation and spending sides. Mr Clarke has insisted that talk of tax cuts is 'hopelessly premature' as long as the government is running a large deficit. Even if the public sector borrowing requirement can be cut in 1995-96 to Pounds 25bn - the average expectation of the Treasury's wise men this week - the deficit would be more than 3 per cent of gross domestic product and so outside the Maastricht definition of a prudent fiscal stance. Conversely, it is fair to assume that the chancellor is being advised against raising taxes further. There are still those inside the Treasury who worry that past tax increases and those in prospect could bring recovery grinding to a halt. They will have drawn comfort from this week's report from the Treasury's panel of wise men which advocated a neutral Budget, in which existing tax plans would go ahead and that any further changes should have only a marginal effect. The scale of the tax increases in the pipeline is impressive. According to the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), the two budgets in 1993 tightened fiscal policy by 3 per cent of gross domestic product per year until spring 1997. The present chancellor's first Budget last November is due to increase taxes in 1995-96 by nearly Pounds 5bn on top of increased charges that were announced in Mr Lamont's March 1993 Budget. Thus, a married couple with a mortgage will lose up to Pounds 3.95 a week from next April because of new restrictions in the married couples' income tax allowance and mortgage interest relief. These measures will yield Pounds 830m and Pounds 900m respectively for the government. Road fuel duties are due to rise by an average of at least 5 per cent a year in real terms for environmental reasons. This move is due to add Pounds 710m to government revenues this year and will yield an extra Pounds 1.1bn in 1995-96. In spite of his liking for cigars, Mr Clarke has committed the government to increasing tobacco duties by 3 per cent a year in real terms in future Budgets. This measure to curb smoking will lift government revenues by Pounds 590m in 1995-96 after garnering an extra Pounds 375m in the current financial year. The insurance premium tax and air passenger duties, introduced this autumn, will provide extra revenues of more than Pounds 1.1bn in their first full financial year in 1995-96. Also next year, the March 1993 decision to levy value added tax on fuel and power will have its full impact. The rate is set to rise to 17.5 per cent in April from 8 per cent at present, lifting revenues from this source to an estimated Pounds 2.3bn in 1995-96 from Pounds 950m in 1994-95. On the spending side of the Budget, Mr Clarke has to cut existing spending totals if he is to maintain the credibility of the government's deficit reduction programme. Last November's Budget forecast that underlying inflation - the year-on-year rise in retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments  - would be 3 1/4 per cent in the current quarter. Instead, it fell to a 27-year low of 2 per cent in September and has been below 3 per cent for 12 months. This means that the 'control totals' for overall departmental spending in the current and subsequent financial years will have to be revised downwards. Otherwise expenditure will rise in real terms and the Budget will not qualify as 'neutral' in the sense employed by the wise men. Mr Clarke has always maintained that the control totals of Pounds 251.3bn for this financial year, Pounds 263bn for 1995-96 and Pounds 272.3bn will be tough to meet. But the IFS, in collaboration with Goldman Sachs, the US-owned investment bank, has calculated that the 1994-95 control total should be trimmed to Pounds 247.6bn to be consistent with unchanged real spending plans. That for 1995-96 should be cut by Pounds 5bn to Pounds 258bn. General government expenditure, which includes elements of social security expenditure that are affected by the business cycle, should fall more sharply than the control totals given the strength of Britain's economic recovery. Mr Clarke, unlike some of his colleagues, is not hostile to government spending and is a keen supporter of what he calls the UK's 'great public services'. But there are powerful arguments for his at least holding spending plans unchanged in real terms to avoid a loss of credibility on the financial markets that could trigger a rise in long-term interest rates. But the constraints imposed by the bond markets, Mr Clarke's self-denying ordinance on tax cuts and the need to cut nominal public spending totals should not condemn the chancellor to inactivity. This Budget gives him the opportunity to reinforce the recovery and attempt to rebuild some of the feel-good factor that has been absent since the recession of the early 1990s. If there has been a consistent theme since Mr Clarke became chancellor, it is that he is in the business of fashioning a recovery that will last and avoid the boom and bust excesses of past UK upturns. This has been coupled with an awareness that ordinary people from backgrounds similar to his own are deeply disturbed by the pace of change in the global economy. The old certainties such as steady employment and a job for life no longer exist. Earlier this year, Mr Clarke delivered the annual Mais lecture to London's City University Business School. In that, he outlined two areas where the government needed to make 'much more progress over the next few years' beyond its existing policy of creating a more flexible labour market. These were overcoming the fear of change caused by rapid developments in the market for jobs and 'ensuring that the growth of prosperity is extended to all, by bringing the disadvantaged into the mainstream of economic life'. Could this lecture have provided a foretaste in this year's Budget? It is possible. After all, Mr Clarke declared that unemployment must be 'the main pre-occupation of economic policy makers in the 1990s'. He emphasised the need to raise the standards of general education in Britain - a task that he described as 'the biggest supply-side challenge facing the British government'. He underlined the growing importance of small businesses as creators of jobs. He extolled the virtues of a strong welfare state in giving a sense of security to workers in a fast-changing world. He made clear that the government was seeking to correct the way in which the welfare system distorts work incentives for the low-paid, and said he was looking at ways to ensure that the welfare system encourages the unemployed to accept low-paid work. Mr Clarke started down this path in his first Budget when he reduced the lower rates of employers' National Insurance contributions and announced an allowance for those on family credit to help pay for child care. An important part of the jobseeker's allowance, announced last month, is to put the unemployed more in touch with the world of work. Picking up on these themes, the IFS has suggested improvements to family credit and housing benefit to help the low-paid. Among proposals from the wise men this week was a suggestion for taking the lowest paid out of the National Insurance system. Such changes to the tax and benefit system are notoriously difficult to put into practice. But they may offer Mr Clarke the best chance of conjuring up a 'big theme' for his second Budget day appearance.</p>

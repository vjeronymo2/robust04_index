			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Sorrows drown in Pounds 50 bubbly Profits may be down and the markets bearish, but the bubbly was still flowing in the wine bars of London's financial centre this week. 'There is champagne being drunk, and people are still here past eight on a weekday evening,' said a Lloyd's reinsurance broker, who was certainly accurate about Corney and Barrow's wine bar in the City's Leadenhall market. 'I think it is hard to look at two isolated incidents of Warburg and Hambros doing badly and suddenly say the entire City is nervous about its jobs.' He shrugged and poured a generous glass of champagne for his companion. 'But I'm in insurance so I couldn't say how it is over in the big banks.' At Broadgate Circle, the heart of the City's banking district, the mood in the watering holes was no less cheerful. A trader at a Japanese bank quipped as he sank a beer: 'If you think this is hopping, you should see the places where everyone has moved on to.' He said the profit warnings issued last week by SG Warburg, the investment bank, and Hambros, the merchant bank, appeared dismal only when compared with the previous year's performance. 'Last year was not normal,' he said. 'The average person does not generate Dollars 10m revenue a year, but now that he is only making Dollars 2m, suddenly everyone says it's a tragedy.' If anything, the misfortunes of Warburg and Hambros elicited smirks rather than signs of anxiety. 'They made their money too easy last year,' said a trader in the structured finance department of Bank of Scotland, who was relaxing with colleagues at The Arbitrager on Throgmorton Street. 'They made their money for turning up at work.' Under the influence of office sobriety, financiers admitted that the profit warnings could signal tighter times. A derivatives risk manager at JP Morgan said: 'Last year it was easy to hire a mediocre risk manager because it was such an easy market to trade. What you will see after bonuses are paid is that a two-tier system will develop.' He said banks would continue to hire and pay 'quality' people well but, he added: 'What I am hearing around is that people are getting rid of the bottom 10 per cent of performers as they are rated internally.' So is it curtains for ski holidays, Christmas bonuses and magnums of champagne? The revellers at Corney and Barrow in Broadgate scoffed as they ordered more champagne. A trader at a UK bank said: 'At the end of the day people who work in this industry make a lot more money than people in any other business. So if they have a bad day and do not make a million, it's not as if buying another bottle of Moet for Pounds 50 is going to be a problem.'</p>

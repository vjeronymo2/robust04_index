			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (6): New targets for rocket makers - US hit by missiles shakeup AFTER A false start in Europe, the shake-out in the missile business has begun in earnest in the US. The sale of General Dynamics' guided weapons business to Hughes Aircraft, the General Motors subsidiary, creates a missile company of roughly equal dimensions to the one British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF of France tried unsuccessfully to set up by merging their operations. The move, announced in May, is expected approximately to double Hughes' turnover in missiles to Dollars 2.7bn. But it does not afford Hughes the same domination of the US industry that the planned BAe-Thomson venture would have enjoyed in Europe. Hughes, with wide-ranging interests in defence electronics, followed the announcement with plans to shed 9,000 jobs over the next 18 months, about 15 per cent of its workforce. General Dynamics, perhaps the most broadly-based of all US defence manufacturers with products ranging from combat jets to tanks and submarines, decided to ditch its missile activities as part of a plan to reduce itself in size in response to the downturn in defence spending, rather than try to diversify into new civilian activities. Missiles made up about 16 per cent of General Dynamics' Dollars 8.75bn sales last year. This included production of the Tomahawk cruise missiles that were launched from US warships in the Gulf war, and Stinger shoulder-fired weapons. The company had considered including missiles as one of its future 'core activities'. But Mr William Anders, its chairman, said it 'could not achieve sufficient market position to be the leader in a field which includes nearly a dozen firms in the US alone.' That statement summarises the challenge facing the missile sector. It will remain a central part of the defence business, a large and diverse sector with a wide range of products, subject to constant technological advances. But the industry is over-populated and the number of projects is getting smaller. The confidence of US manufacturers in the products they have developed has meanwhile been undermined by the policy of 'second-sourcing' production of weapons such as the Stinger or the Standard naval air defence missile. Further concentration in the industry - which includes Boeing, Hughes, Lockheed, Loral, Northrop, Martin Marietta, McDonnell Douglas, Raytheon, Rockwell and Texas Instruments - can now be expected. In Europe, the Eurodynamics venture confidently planned by BAe and Thomson was abandoned early last year after failure to agree on the value of the two companies' respective businesses - the French company having been boosted in the interim by a fresh air-defence order from Saudi Arabia. Thomson, which saw BAe's weapon production complementing its own expertise in guidance systems, sought a similar match in the US with the planned takeover of the missile business of LTV, whose activities include the international Multiple Launch Rocket System. However, Thomson's plan, part of a Dollars 450m deal for LTV accepted by a New York bankruptcy judge, came up against the barrier of US security concerns. Seeking to consolidate its position in air-defence systems, Thomson reached agreement last year with Short Brothers of the UK on joint development of a new generation of weapons, succeeding the Shorts' latest Starstreak system. GEC-Marconi, the traditional supplier of guidance for BAe weapons, has meanwhile set out to challenge BAe's position as the automatic UK choice as prime contractor for missiles. With BAe in the throes of rationalising its Dynamics division - currently being reduced to 5,300 employees, less than a third of the level of four years ago - it recently completed the takeover of Ferranti International's missile operations. The acquisition provides GEC-Marconi, which has also established links with Matra and Dassault Electronique of France, with a capability for producing complete weapon systems. However, the company had a bitter disappointment when it failed in its bid with Matra to supplant BAe's long-troubled Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile project (Asraam). BAe, collaborating with Hughes, won the Pounds 570m contract for development and initial production for the RAF in March, just before the general election. BAe and GEC-Marconi are also on different sides in a contest to supply a medium-range surface-to-air missile, replacing the already retired Bloodhound. BAe has entered a joint bid with Raytheon of the US, proposing an updated version of the Patriot missile which gained fame in the Gulf against Iraqi Scuds, together with an additional purchase of BAe's latest Rapier 2000 low-level air-defence system. GEC-Marconi has meanwhile joined with the French-Italian Eurosam consortium to offer the SAMP-T, part of a new family of missiles. Hughes is also competing, alongside NFT of Norway, with a ground-launched version of its Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (Amraam). Another Pounds 500m-plus battle is shaping up between potential British, French, US, Swedish and Italian contenders for a conventionally-armed stand-off missile for the RAF, expected to be decided late next year or in early 1994. The UK also still has plans for a nuclear-armed stand-off missile. However, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, said recently that this was 'certainly not something I am expecting to arrive on my desk in the next few weeks'.</p>

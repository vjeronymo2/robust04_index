The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioners arguments in favor of relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=3 --> Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) (Waiver Petition Docket Number SA&hyph;94&hyph;10)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The BN seeks a waiver of compliance from certain sections of the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49 CFR Part 231).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BN requests a waiver from 49 CFR 231.4_Fixed-end low-side gondola and low-side hopper cars; (a)(3)(ii) states: ``The brake shaft shall be located on end of car, to the left of and not more than 22-inches from center.'' This regulation has been applied to coiled steel cars that have end platforms, commonly identified as a coiled steel gondola.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BN is requesting that the wording be adopted as used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49 CFR 231.6_Flat cars (3)(ii): ``The brake shaft shall be located on end of car to the left of center, or on side of car not more than 36 inches from right-hand end thereof.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BN states that modern flat cars, particularly double stack cars, have used handbrakes in complete compliance with 49 CFR 231.6(a)(3)(ii), which locates the handbrake lower to the ground and closer to the side sill than allowed by other specified car types. This has led to a handbrake application that makes it possible to apply or release the handbrake from the ground when the car is stopped, or while riding the car when it is moving. Additionally, coil cars have been built that have an end platform and appear similar to a flat car, especially toward the end of the car. Historically, the handbrake has been mounted to the end of the trough bulkhead, inboard of the end platform. This requires a person to climb onto the car to operate the handbrake. At this location the handbrake is very susceptible to damage when the coils are loaded into the car. By lowering the handbrake and moving it outboard on the end sill, the handbrake is out of the way of the loading process and less likely to be damaged. The BN request is to locate the handbrake on the end sill and toward the side sill in excess of the 22-inches from the cars center line on coil cars having platforms with a AAR gondola mechanical designation. This request is to include all coil cars equipped with end platforms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.

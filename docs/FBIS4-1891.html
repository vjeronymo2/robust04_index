Prime Minister Esko Aho made the above remarks in reply to a  written questionnaire by XINHUA, RENMIN RIBAO, and GUANGMING  RIBAO reporters on the eve of his forthcoming visit to China.  At the invitation of State Council Premier Li Peng, Prime  Minister Asko Aho and his wife will pay an official visit to  China from 6 to 11 April.    Prime Minister Asko Aho emphatically pointed out that  Finland  was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations  with China. He said: Since then, "the relations between the  two countries have always been stable and have undergone tests  during difficult periods." "The current visit is to further  strengthen friendly relations between Finland and China."    He said that, during his visit, he would hear with great  interest Chinese leaders' introduction of the situation of  China's economic reform and, in particular, the influence of the  reform on China's foreign trade and Chinese leaders' views on  the outlook of development and cooperation in the Asian region.  He himself will also introduce Finland's views of the European  situation to the Chinese leaders.    Touching on the outlook of the development of relations  between the two countries in the future, Prime Minister Asko Aho  pointed out: "There are broad prospects for developing relations  between Finland and China. The trade between the two countries  has been expanded to cover all rapidly developed fields in  Finland." He said: Although Finland is a small country, it  occupies a leading position in certain fields. Finland is  prepared to share with China those specialized technologies.    Prime Minister Asko Aho said: "Finland is world-renowned for  forestry and forestry industry. Other advanced technologies  which will attract China's interest include the development of  energy sources and communications. I would like to stress the  significance of environmental protection technologies, which  will be a new field of cooperation between the two countries.  Under the current situation in which China has been attaching  increasingly greater importance to environmental protection,  Finland can provide environmental protection technologies for  China."</p>

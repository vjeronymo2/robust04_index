			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Divisions over Europe highlight Tory disunity: The PM's possible strategy to avert fratricide within his party IT IS not the fault-lines in the European exchange rate mechanism which will preoccupy Mr John Major this weekend. As he reflects on the past few bruising days for his government, the prime minister's first concern will be the fractures in his party. It was Mr John Smith's forensic demolition of the government's handling of the sterling crisis which caught most of the headlines. But it is the simmering discontent - and implicit threat of revolt - from the Tory backbenches which hold the real perils for Mr Major. The careful Tory coalition for pragmatic Europeanism which he so painstakingly constructed from the wreckage of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's departure is beginning to crumble. The prospect that the Conservative party could tear itself apart over Europe for the second time in two years can longer be dismissed as fantasy. It is too early to be apocalyptic. Just as it is possible to see the mines strewn across Mr Major's path as he seeks to reconstruct credible policies on the economy and Europe, it is possible also to see the escape routes. Mr Major is at present shattered by the shock of the pound's retreat from the ERM. Backbench MPs, dragged back from their holidays to be gleefully derided by an opposition they trounced in the April election, are muttering about the need for something called leadership. In reply, ministers remind the critics that the prime minister has shown little else, and that he has the political acumen and personal skills to bridge the divisions in his own party. But some of the mines look certain to explode. The succession of events leading from the No vote in the Danish referendum on Maastricht through sterling's departure from the ERM to the narrow Yes vote in the French poll have proved a fertile recruiting ground for his party's Euro-sceptics. Mr Major's achievement last year was to shrink the support for the Euro-sceptics to a core group of about 20 to 30 irreconcilables. The dissidents could then be branded a splinter rather than a split. But the events of the last few months have swelled the numbers. More than 60 Tory MPs yesterday signed a Commons motion demanding the government abandon any thought of a return to fixed exchange rates. The list, which may attract another dozen or so names, provides a reasonable proxy of the strength ranged against all things pro-European. The prime minister has acknowledged that strength. The conditions set for sterling's eventual return to the ERM reflect in part genuine anxieties over how the mechanism works. But they also reflect Mr Major's judgment that a decision to re-tie sterling to the D-Mark before a recovery in the domestic economy is in place would provoke a powerful revolt. So too does his decision in effect to postpone the Maastricht ratification process until early next year. So Mr Major is playing for time. His assessment runs as follows. The next few months will see all of Europe's leaders struggling to find an accommodation which brings Denmark back to the Maastricht fold. That may prove impossible and the treaty will collapse, averting the need for a confrontation in the Conservative party. If an accommodation is found then it will be on lines - commitments to decentralisation and the disavowal of a common defence and policy - which could help win back the 'soft' Euro-sceptics. In parallel, the relaxation of Britain's monetary policy should trigger the economic recovery needed to restore more general confidence on his backbenches. It is credible strategy - and probably the only one. The question is whether Mr Major will have time to implement it. While the pressure from his party is to stall, if not to abandon, Maastricht, Mr Major's European partners - including the German chancellor Helmut Kohl - are determined to press ahead. What Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner, refers to as the 'recurring nightmare' of an inner core of European nations making decisions which profoundly affect the UK but over which the government has no influence has returned. It was that nightmare that prompted the Conservatives to ditch Mrs Thatcher. It still horrifies prominent cabinet ministers such as Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke. And, for all the noise now being made by the Euro-sceptics, the relegation of Britain to Europe's second division is no more acceptable now to most in the Conservative party or to the majority in the cabinet than it was two years ago. The enthusiasts for Europe are for now keeping their counsel in the hope that Mr Major's strategy will deliver his party for the second time in a year. The alternative is another civil war.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 17/6/1994 -- The recent  meeting of the Moldovan and Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs  reconfirmed the intention to finalize a timetable for the 14th  Army's withdrawal in the 9th round of negotiations to be held in  Chisinau, stated to BASA Vasile Sova, head of the CIS Direction  of the Moldovan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During the Moscow  negotiations, the Russian side proposed to withdraw the 14th  Army within three years of the signing of the basic agreement.  Taking into account Russia's experience in this field, the  Moldovan side proposed that the troops located in Eastern  Moldova be withdrawn within 1.5 years by 1 January 1996,  mentioned Sova. Experts will have to examine thoroughly the  technical conditions for the withdrawal by using the method  approved by the military departments of the both sides in the  eighth round of negotiations held in April. An agreement was  reached on the share of expenses to be defrayed by Moldova for  the relocation of the Russian troops. According to Sova,  Chisinau proposed to deploy the funds earned from the sales of  the 14th Army's properties. It was proposed that Russian  soldiers have the right to privatize the flats they inhabited in  Moldova and to use the profits from the sales to buy others in  Russia. The Moldovan delegation opposed the allotment of funds  for Russian soldiers from the Moldovan budget. Sova said that  the Moldovan budget did not provide for such expenses. According  to him, during a meeting with representatives of the Ukrainian  and Moldovan diplomatic departments, Chisinau was assured that  Kiev officials will not oppose the Russian troops' crossing of  the Ukraine. "We have no reasons for believing that the Ukraine  will be an obstacle, but this is a delicate issue that requires  elaboration of detailed plans for the withdrawal," mentioned  Sova.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Shareholders keep Banesto guessing Rarely in Spain has a shareholders' meeting been so anxiously awaited as the one being staged in Madrid tomorrow by Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto). Three months after the Bank of Spain sacked the board and took the bank under its wing, the extraordinary meeting is being asked to approve a rescue plan designed to recapitalise Banesto and restore its balance sheet in readiness for handing over control in May. Three other leading Spanish banks - Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Banco Santander and the state-controlled Argentaria - are preparing to compete for the controlling stake in Banesto which, with 2,500 branches, has one of the biggest networks in the country. The Bank of Spain wants to move quickly to avoid further damage to Banesto, one of the traditional pillars of the Spanish financial establishment. However, any group among the bank's 300,000 shareholders with a 5 per cent interest between them is entitled to challenge the plan, which includes writing down the nominal value of current shareholdings by 43 per cent. Even if such a challenge were overruled, the legal process would take up to 45 days, threatening to hold up the rescue scheme. Bank of Spain officials say they would try to try to press ahead with the injection of new capital regardless. A majority in favour of the scheme is assured, with sufficient votes delegated to the current Banesto board, including most of the 10 per cent held by Banesto employees. Crucially, J. P. Morgan of the US, whose Corsair fund has the biggest single shareholding of 8 per cent, has finally consented to the plan. The main figures on the dismissed board are also understood to have agreed not to oppose the scheme. These include the controversial former chairman Mr Mario Conde, who owns about 3.8 per cent of the stock. The new board may take up legal proceedings against Mr Conde and his former colleagues if asked to do so by shareholders representing at least 5 per cent of the capital. Official intervention followed a Bank of Spain inspection which found Banesto had grossly overvalued its assets. An audit subsequently estimated this 'hole' in the balance sheet to be 20 per cent bigger than the Bank of Spain's earlier reckoning, at Pta605bn (Dollars 4.3bn). This compared with capital and reserves of just under Pta360bn. Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund, to which private banks and the Bank of Spain contribute in equal proportions, is to sink Pta285bn into Banesto under the plan. It will also contribute Pta30bn in the form of a five-year interest-free loan to offset current losses. The Deposit Guarantee Fund will also, in the first instance, subscribe to a Pta180bn capital increase, making up 73 per cent of Banesto's restructured capital. Other banks will have four weeks to put bids together, either individually or in consortia, for this entire holding. Among the conditions is that the winner will then offer a 13 per cent slice at the new par value of Pta400 to existing shareholders, on the basis of one share for two held. The bid process is intended to bring a profit for the Deposit Guarantee Fund, reducing its costs in the Banesto rescue. Mr Jose Lus Leal, chairman of the Spanish Private Banking Association said yesterday the rescue plan would cost the banks Pta44bn a year for the next four years, or between 7 and 8 per cent of combined pre-tax profit. He added emphatically: 'There is no other problem bank in Spain.'</p>

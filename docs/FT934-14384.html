			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Gardening: You'll never look at a lawn the same way again - Bridget Bloom discovers that mowing your patch of green, green grass can be positively harmful FLY OVER the suburbs of any American city and what do you see? Swimming pools, perhaps, in the more affluent, but the most common sight surely is the green of countless well-mown lawns abutting pavements and paths. No hedges there, and few flower beds. In Britain, home of the herbaceous border, the pattern is somewhat different, for the garden hedge still marks many a surburban boundary. But lawns are still important, as the hum of the mower attests in any surburban street at virtually any weekend hour. But should they be? Grassy spaces may rest the eyes or assuage the spirit, but what they do to the environment might be positively harmful. That, at least, is the challenging thesis of three American academics who, in a refreshingly non-polemical 150 pages, argue that in their efforts to make lawns 'a constant companion of surburban development,' American gardeners 'unnecessarily contribute to some of the most severe problems facing the world today.' According to professors Bormann, Balmori and Geballe, authors of Redesigning the American Lawn (Yale University Press, Pounds 16, 295 pages), irrigating lawns depletes water resources while mowing them using aerators, leaf blowers, weed whackers and edgers 'all add to pollution and eventually to global warming.' Excess fertilisers and pesticides run off into streams and lakes. Even lawn clippings swell household waste vastly. The professors quote some impressive statistics to show how the 'lawn care' industry - at Dollars 25bn a year equal in size, apparently, to the pesticide market world-wide - wastes precious resources. In one hour, it seems, the average power mower emits pollutants equivalent to a car driving 350 miles. Indeed, California's Air Resources Board claims that annual pollutant emissions from 'lawn utility machines' in that state are 'equivalent to the emissions of 3.5m 1991-model automobiles driven 16,000 miles each.' Across the US, lawns cover 25m acres, making grass the country's largest single crop, Lawn owners use up to 10 times more chemical pesticides an acre than do farmers, while lawn watering has become so common that, in western states, it can account for 60 per cent of urban water use. Britons are not, perhaps, so fanatical and thus are more likely to be open to the less radical of the professors' suggestions - use fewer chemicals, and mow and water less often. The most far-reaching proposal, however, is revolutionary in the US context: re-design gardens to suit the natural ecology; rockeries, not greensward, in Arizona; scrub and shrub, not lawn, in Nebraska. Such basic change is difficult to envisage in the US, but could it happen in Britain? Dr Philip Gates, a botanist at Durham University, believes UK gardeners will have to change their habits, not so much because of what they do wrong now but because change will be forced on them by fundamental alterations in our climate. In Spring Fever (Fontana, Pounds 5.99), Gates rues a thesis propounded late in the 1980s when British summers suddenly seemed hotter and winters milder. Gates believes UK gardeners will have to get used to a new calendar. No longer will they be able to count on putting up their feet for four or five months of the year, lulled into inactivity by a roaring fire and the seed catalogues. A milder and probably drier climate will extend the growing season, allowing little respite from pruning, planting or mowing, if they are to maintain today's type of garden. Most British gardeners will find this unwelcome, Gates surmises, and not just because they like to be idle in the winter. He believes many people will 'recoil in horror' at the onset of a Mediterranean-type climate, since it could mean the disappearance of beloved landscapes. Gates' remedies accord with those of the American professors: respect natural ecology, do not fight it, and conserve or adapt precious habitats carefully to the changing climate. It is rather less clear where the message of Building Green, published by the London Ecology Unit at Pounds 12.95 (and with a foreword by the Prince of Wales), fits in. Authors Jacklyn Johnston and John Newton would have city dwellers plant much more greenery, and tell us how to do it. In the city of tomorrow, not only would they have more trees alongside buildings and more vegetation in courtyards and on balconies and terraces - they also would create meadows and lawns on the roofs of houses, factories and offices. Many of the ideas are obvious and some are fun, but they do come with a 'health warning': check with a professional - and, perhaps more to the point, your insurance broker - before you follow the authors' advice.</p>

With the approval of the Propaganda Department of the  Xinjiang Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and the autonomous  region's press and publications bureau, this year's XINJIANG  RIBAO (Chinese edition) will be published in eight pages on  Wednesdays and Saturdays. The expanded portion will be  published in the form of "LIVING GUIDANCE, [shenghuo dao bao,  3932 3172 1418 1032]" and every effort will be made to enable it  to cover Xinjiang's economic life, social life, family life, and  cultural life, so that it can truly reflect life in Xinjiang,  serve people's needs, provide guidance for people's daily life,  and make our lives better.    The "LIVING GUIDANCE" will be published as XINJIANG RIBAO's  expanded edition and will be published and distributed along  with XINJIANG RIBAO. However, it can be separately subscribed to  and sold.</p>

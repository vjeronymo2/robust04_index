			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Observer: Pioneers under fire Scottish bankers like to think of themselves as pioneers. The first Institute of Bankers was founded in Scotland as was the first savings bank and investment trust. Talk to many of the top managers in overseas banks like the Hongkong and Shanghai and Standard Chartered and you find that they got their training behind a Scottish bank till. But when it comes to playing with paper money, the Scots are way behind. The Royal Bank of Scotland is making much of yesterday's decision to stop burning its old bank notes after 264 years. Next week, an environmentally friendly granulator will take over. Lord Younger was on hand to help chief stoker Joe Kelly torch the last Pounds 1m in front of an invited media cast. The bank has even issued a tie to commemorate the event. For once, the Royal Bank seems to be one step ahead of its Scottish rivals. The Bank of Scotland and the Clydesdale still burn their notes, although the Clydesdale plans to stop soon. However, the Bank of England has not burnt its notes for several years now and the last English bank to stop issuing its own bank notes was Fox Fowler &amp; Co, over 70 years ago. How much longer are the Scots going to be allowed to carry on this unpatriotic practice?</p>

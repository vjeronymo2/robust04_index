			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / International Company News: Italian paper group in rights issue Cartiere Burgo, the Italian paper and packaging group, plans a rights issue to raise about L230bn (Dollars 146.7m). The money is to help pay for a cellulose factory linked to a recently-acquired Belgian papermaker, writes Andrew Hill. The operation will involve the issue of new shares at L9,000 each, on the basis of one new share for every five held. They will also carry warrants, giving the right to subscribe to a further 4.33m new shares. Burgo has an option to buy the cellulose factory, which has annual capacity of 240,000 tonnes, before the end of September. It said economic and technical evaluation of the site was under way, and that 'the first indications are increasingly interesting'. Proceeds of the rights issue will also be used for existing investment.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / People: Armstrong leaves Leigh Interests Robert Armstrong has quit as managing director of the waste services company Leigh Interests. His departure is believed to be the direct result of the appointment of Shaun Bowden as chief executive last November, a post for which Armstrong had been considered a strong candidate. Arthur Kent, finance director, rejected suggestions that Armstrong's departure had been acrimonious. 'The board just got a little top-heavy,' he said. 'After discussions it was agreed he would pursue other interests.' Armstrong had been central to Leigh's efforts to improve the group's quality standards, Kent said. Armstrong had been with Leigh for 15 years, working his way through the ranks of the environmental division. Four years ago he was promoted to the main board when Malcolm Wood, the then-chief executive, assumed the additional role of chairman. Wood died last year, after nominating Bowden to the chief executive's post. Leigh is believed to have embarked on a substantial cost-cutting exercise in recent weeks. Some 15 other senior managment jobs are thought to have been cut. The group is expected to clarify its future strategy when the results are published in early June.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Alcoa falls 33% to ADollars 203.5m ALCOA of Australia, the aluminium group, yesterday blamed weak world prices for a 33 per cent fall in net profit to ADollars 203.5m (USDollars 145.30m) in the nine months to the end of September, on sales down 20 per cent to ADollars 1.5bn. Alcoa said lower prices for alumina, aluminium and gold contributed to the fall in earnings, but were partly offset by lower energy and power costs and a marginally weaker Australian currency. Alcoa said aluminium prices had fallen below USDollars 1,200 per tonne after exceeding USDollars 1,300 earlier this year. However, alumina's price, which provides about three-quarters of revenue, had improved from about USDollars 140 per tonne to USDollars 160. Net profits were also boosted by settlement of a tax dispute which reduced the tax payment from ADollars 198m to ADollars 126m. 'While conditions in the industry remain difficult, the company is confident it has the capacity to respond to the requirements of its customers as markets improve,' the directors said. Alcoa last month paid a fully-franked annual dividend of ADollars 60m, taking its total dividend payments for the nine months to ADollars 180m, a return of 43.3 cents a share. Alcoa is 48.3 per cent owned by Western Mining Corporation, the Australian resources group. Western Mining warned shareholders in its annual statement that markets for most of its mineral products were likely to remain depressed in the current year. 'Improvements in the major world economies appear slow at best and 1992-93 will most likely be another poor year for the mineral industry,' said Sir Arvi Parbo, chairman.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Salim Salih Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F> Sanaa Has Two Days To Stop Fighting; Otherwise, We Will Demand  Announcement of Recognition of South"]    [Text] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- In a statement to  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Salim Salih, member of the Yemeni Presidential  Council, has given Sanaa two days to announce and comply with a  cease-fire, otherwise Aden will be entitled to demand that the  Security Council impose sanctions on Sanaa and announce world  states' recognition of the Democratic Republic of Yemen.    He said: For our part, we are ready for anything when a  cease-fire is announced first, then we can discuss the mechanism  of halting the fighting.    He said: The task of the joint southern-northern committee  meeting in Cairo is just to discuss the formation of the  military committee or team to be assigned to monitor the  cease-fire. And there is no major disagreement between us and  Sanaa with regard to accepting [the participation of] Arab and  Islamic states and Security Council member states, but the  committee will be under UN supervision.    Salim pointed to Sanaa's defiance of the international  community and the Arab community by escalating the political and  military situations and by constantly shelling Aden -- which  proves it has no desire to halt the fighting. He said: I want  [UN secretary general's envoy] Brahimi's mission to succeed and  the Security Council resolutions to be complied with. We are  exerting every effort to halt the fighting.    He reemphasized Aden's steadfastness despite the cutting off  of water and electricity. All that Sanaa is saying about its  occupation of Aden is an attempt to play for time and give  public opinion the impression that the rebels have surrendered  and the war is over.    He said: The issue of abolishing the state of the Democratic  Republic of Yemen is now in the hands of the Yemeni people, and  it is they who have to decide on it. And the people are  currently fighting the occupation and the bombardment of  villages and cities.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Lib Dems rule out voting pact with Labour THE Liberal Democrat leadership yesterday ruled out any prospect of an electoral pact with Labour ahead of the next general election. Senior party figures said that informal contacts with members of Mr John Smith's shadow cabinet had indicated that the Labour leader would be unable to deliver a pre-election voting deal. But as the perennial issue of the Liberal Democrats' relationship with Labour resurfaced on the opening day of the party's conference, several senior figures stressed the need to exploit common ground with Labour on a range of social and economic policies. Mr Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat president, voiced the prevailing view in a speech to the conference suggesting that a move by Labour to reform its institutional links with the unions might provide the catalyst for a much bigger shift in Britain's political landscape. The power of the unions in Labour decision-making has hitherto proved one of biggest obstacles to the creation of a broad anti-Conservative coalition. Mr Kennedy said dilution of that role could remove the 'Berlin Wall' of British politics. The momentum for increased co-operation has been strengthened by a visible shift towards the centre-left in the Liberal Democrats' economic strategy. Mr Kennedy suggested also that his party must exploit the wave of anti-government sentiment sweeping the electorate by co-operating with Labour in defending the welfare state. Sir Gordon Borrie, the head of Labour's Social Justice Commission, was last night among a number of Labour supporters invited to address fringe meetings at the conference. Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said his party would be guilty of 'blind stupidity' if it ignored the overwhelming similarities between its policies for health, education, transport and social welfare and those advocated by Mr Smith. To the visible irritation of Mr Malcolm Bruce - the party's spokesman for trade and industry - Mr Hughes said Liberal Democrats must admit the overriding priority of removing the Conservatives from office. Mr Ashdown and his colleagues appear determined to avoid a public row over the issue of pacts. Senior party figures said the idea had been canvassed in informal discussions with sympathetic members of the Labour shadow cabinet. The message was that Mr Smith is convinced his party can win the next election without any pre-election deal. The central calculation of senior Liberal Democrat officials remains that even on relatively optimistic assumptions it will be difficult to win more than 35 seats at the next general election. An ICM poll released yesterday suggested that the combined support for Labour and the Liberal Democrats - at present 69 per cent - would fall only slightly to 62 per cent if the two parties agreed a formal electoral pact. But the assumption that many Tory defectors would stick with the Liberal Democrats in the event of such a deal was challenged by several senior party figures.</p>

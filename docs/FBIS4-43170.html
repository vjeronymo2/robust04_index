			<p>BFN     [Text] Madrid, June 13, IRNA -- The Iranian Embassy here  today rejected as "baseless and utterly false" a report in the  latest issue of the weekly TIEMPO alleging secret links between  Iranians and the Basque separatist group ETA (Euzkadi Ta  Azcatasuma [Basque Fatherland and Liberty]).    The statement said "Iranian officials believe that the  objective behind the groundless article is to create tension in  the friendly relations between Islamic Iran and Spain."    ETA which means `Basque Homeland and Liberty' was founded in  1959 and is regarded as an `illegal terrorist' organization by  the Spanish Government.    The Basques are an ethnic minority inhabiting the western  Pyrenees mountains in northern Spain on the Bay of Biscay.</p>

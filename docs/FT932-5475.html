			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Orkla acquires Swedish food group ORKLA, the Norwegian industrial group, is to acquire BOB Industrier, part of Sweden's ICA Handlarnas group. Analysts said the deal could be worth between NKr400m and NKr600m (Dollars 59m-Dollars 88m). The takeover is being made through Nora, Orkla's food products arm. BOB has sales of SKr700m and pre-tax profits of around SKr40m. Its product areas - jam, juice, ready-meals and desserts - overlap with parts of Nora's product range and are sold through ICA retailers. Nora's sales run at around NKr4bn and 1992 operating profits were NKr304m. Orkla's 1992 sales totalled NKr16.8bn, of which NKr13bn was accounted for by sales of branded consumer goods. ICA is Sweden's largest retail-wholesale group with a 35 per cent domestic market share. 'Nora is a long-term industrial investor which will provide BOB with the opportunity to further develop its activities . . . in Scandinavia,' said Mr Roland Fahlin, ICA group chief executive. Borregaard Industries, another Orkla unit, is to acquire the lignin business of Finland's Metsa-Serla group. Financial details were not disclosed. Lignin is derived from sulphite pulp production and is processed into a wide-range of binding and dispersing agents. Metsa-Serla's lignin business has annual sales of around NKr60m. The acquisition will lift Borregaard sales to NKr850m.</p>

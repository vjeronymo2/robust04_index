			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Britain, Iran exchange diplomat expulsions Relations between Britain and Iran deteriorated further yesterday as both governments announced the expulsion of a diplomat. The Foreign Office in London yesterday made public its decision to expel Mr Vahid Belourchi, a first secretary at the Iranian embassy, for allegedly distributing forged documents about British policy in Bosnia. Iran had been told of the British decision last week, when it was agreed that no publicity would be given to the expulsion in the hope of avoiding further repercussions. However, Tehran said yesterday it was retaliating by expelling Mr Hamish Cowell, the deputy head of the British mission in Tehran. No further official explanation was offered by the Iranian government, but Iranian newspapers linked the expulsion to 'extensive British propaganda against Iran, designed to please the US'. The latest downward turn in relations between the two countries began in April when Britain accused Iran of establishing links with the IRA, and of planning to provide weapons and training for Irish republican extremists. Iran denied that any contacts had taken place and suggested instead that a listening device had been found implanted in the wall of its refurbished embassy in London. The Foreign Office said the Iranian diplomat had been asked to leave 'because members of the Iranian embassy had been involved in attempting to distribute forged documents purporting to show that Britain's policy in Bosnia was directed against the Moslems'. Iran has become frustrated at its inability to aid Moslems in Bosnia and the refusal by western powers to accept the deployment of Iranian peace-keeping forces in the former Yugoslavia. The regime in Tehran also believes that Britain is playing a key supporting role in the US policy of denying Iran access to international financial markets at a time of growing economic difficulties in the Islamic republic.</p>

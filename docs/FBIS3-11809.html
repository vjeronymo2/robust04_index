			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of Mexico  City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish reporting on domestic and  foreign reaction to the 23 March assassination in Tijuana, Baja  California, of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential  candidate for the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI.    Radio ACIR at 0544 GMT on 24 March carries a two-minute  report on a communique issued by the Revolutionary Workers  Party, PRT, regretting the attack on Luis Donaldo Colosio  Murrieta and pointing out that although "this action might open  a period of grave political uncertainty, it should not be cause  for a repressive atmosphere of political persecution." The PRT  urges a thorough investigation of the attack, and calls on the  citizens to remain calm.    At 0549 GMT on 24 March, Radio ACIR reports that Canadian  Prime Minister Jean Chretien said: "In spite of the attack  against Colosio, Mexico should not stop the changes and reforms  it has carried out." "This is the price of democracy, the price  of seeking the people and being close to the people. I cannot  find words to express the shock of this terrible tragedy,"  Chretien concluded.    Radio ACIR carries a one-minute report at 0603 GMT on 24  March on a communique issued on 23 March by the Mexican Senate  expressing condolences to the Colosio family over the  "regrettable" death of Luis Donaldo Colosio. In the communique,  the Senate adds that "the nation has lost a politician committed  to freedom, democracy, social justice, and the sovereignty of  Mexico."    At 0628 GMT on 24 March, Radio ACIR reports that the  Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front from El Salvador has  sent condolences, expressing "the strongest rejection of this  criminal action that will not tarnish the democratic ideals of  the Mexican people."    Mexico City ACIR Network in Spanish at 1457 GMT on 24 March  carries a live report by Luis Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal  de las Casas, Chiapas State. Santoyo reports that the death of  Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta has been "shocking" to the people  in San Cristobal de las Casas. The report adds that peace  commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis first made a statement then  withdrew to the hotel where he remained throughout the night  while "security measures were increased." Radio ACIR adds that  Camacho Solis "looks sad and, to a certain extent, insecure. He  is very worried about what is happening. He said he did not  want to make any statements because these are not moments to  talk about other matters. He said that he feels very sad and  will go to Mexico City to express his sympathy to Colosio's  family and the country's political family," the report concluded.    Radio ACIR adds at 1551 GMT on 24 March that Honduran  President Carlos Roberto Reina "deplored" the murder of Colosio,  and that Reina had telephoned the Mexican ambassador in  Tegucigalpa to express "the solidarity of the people and  government of Honduras."</p>

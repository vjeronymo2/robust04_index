			<p>BFN     [Text] North Korea appears set to test-fire a ballistic  missile to rattle states seeking to punish it for defying U.N.  nuclear inspectors, a leading expert said Thursday, citing U.S.  intelligence sources.    Joseph Bermudez, a consultant to Jane's Intelligence Review  who is an authority on the North's military and intelligence  affairs, said the intelligence community expected Pyongyang to  test-fire a Nodong-1 ballistic missile "any day now."    North Korea initially test-fired its Nodong-1 into the East  Sea (Sea of Japan) in May 1993.</p>

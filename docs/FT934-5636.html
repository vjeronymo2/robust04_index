			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / International Company News: Dutch publisher pulls out of battle for Extel VNU, the Dutch publishing group, has dropped out of the bid battle to take over London-based Extel Financial, the on-line financial information service company put up for sale two months ago by its owners, United Newspapers. VNU had submitted an 'indicative' bid for Extel last month and was believed to be one of the front-runners. But Mr Joep Brentjens, VNU's chairman, told Amsterdam's Het Financieele Dagblad newspaper that United Newspapers' asking price was too high. Mr Brentjens said VNU recently broke off talks with United Newspapers, but he declined to reveal the asking price. Dutch newspapers had put VNU's offer at about Fl 195m (Pounds 68.6m). 'We were very interested in a part of Extel, company information, but the other activities were less suitable for VNU,' Mr Brentjens was quoted as saying. VNU is best known as a publisher of consumer and professional magazines, but it also owns minority stakes in the Dutch television station RTL4 and operates several on-line financial and professional information services in the US, some of which are similar to the services provided by Extel Financial. Many of the world's largest information providers have expressed interest in buying the 121-year old organisation and about 40 potential suitors are thought to have approached Veronis Suhler, the US investment bank managing the auction. Other bidders known to have expressed an interest in the past include FT Profile, the on-line information service owned by the Financial Times, and Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency. However, Reuters, the global information company, ruled itself out as a potential bidder at an early stage. Extel Financial made an estimated profit of about Pounds 5m on sales of Pounds 33m last year, but soaked up Pounds 6m in investment in technology. United Newspapers is expected to use the proceeds from the sale to reduce borrowings.</p>

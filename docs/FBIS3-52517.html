The visitor brought  along with him three Syrian surprises to Amman:    1. The Syrians asked Jordan to exclude the PLO from  coordination meetings between Arab negotiators. Despite  Jordan's anger with the PLO, which has refused to coordinate  with it and kept delaying a Jordanian-Palestinian economic  agreement, the Jordanians had some reservations about the Syrian  request. Amman thinks that isolating the PLO at this time in  particular could have serious consequences on Jordan, the  occupied Arab territories, and Palestinian citizens.    2. The Syrians also asked for a coordination meeting  grouping  the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese foreign ministers and  negotiators, with Egypt's participation, before 15 January to  precede al-Asad-Clinton summit. The Syrians believe such a  meeting will give the summit a chance to discuss substantive  issues, including agreement on a new round of negotiations that  could produce tangible progress.    3. As for the third Syrian request, it was in response to an  earlier Jordanian request to resume the meetings of the joint  higher committee under the two prime ministers of the two  countries.    Asked by AL-WASAT, a Jordanian official declined to answer a  question about Jordan's reply to Syria's request to exclude the  PLO from coordination. The official said, however, that  coordination with Syria is basic and necessary.    Before leaving Amman, the Syrian foreign minister said  coordination with the PLO ended when the secret negotiations  with Israel in Oslo were uncovered.</p>

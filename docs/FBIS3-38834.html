The call for the NATO-led strike was made by the UN  secretary  general, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, after 68 civilians were killed and  almost 200 others were wounded in a mortar attack on a Sarajevo  market place on Saturday [5 February].    Mr. Chretien says Ottawa wants to consult its NATO allies  and  to obtain a report from Canadian peacekeepers in Bosnia, before  reaching its decision.    A primary consideration for Ottawa is the safety of Canada's  2,400 peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia, but Mr. Chretien  told the House of Commons that the situation in Bosnia is very,  very bad, and that a decision may be taken in the next few days.    The United States and the European Union support the call by  Mr. Butrus-Ghali, but Russia has signalled strong opposition to  any attack.</p>

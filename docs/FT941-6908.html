			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Daimler-Benz head likely to chair Airbus Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz and one of Germany's most powerful industrialists, is likely to become the next supervisory board chairman of Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft manufacturer. The appointment would prompt significant board changes at Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial company. Deutsche Bank, the country's largest bank, is likely to relinquish its traditional role as supplier of the Daimler supervisory board's chairman. Such a move would further weaken the two groups' link, which has been at the heart of the traditional organisation of German industry, with banks playing a direct role in supervising companies. It confirms Deutsche Bank's intention to reduce its direct involvement in German industry to concentrate on its mainstream banking. The bank also plans to shed 3 per cent of its 28 per cent stake in Daimler. Mr Reuter's move to Airbus is likely within the next year. It would significantly strengthen the senior management of the European aircraft manufacturing consortium as it faces intense competition from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, its two US rivals. It would also reinforce Daimler's voice within the consortium, confirming Germany's ambitions to enhance its role in the European aerospace industry. Daimler, through its Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) subsidiary, owns a 37.9 per cent in Airbus, with Aerospatiale of France also owning 37.9 per cent; British Aerospace 20 per cent; and Casa of Spain the remaining 4.2 per cent. Germany has traditionally held the chairmanship of the Airbus supervisory board, whose members include the chief executives of the four partner companies. The supervisory board takes all significant strategic decisions, including the launch of new aircraft programmes. Mr Reuter, the architect of Daimler's diversification into the aerospace business, is officially due to step down at Daimler early next year. However, European aerospace industry sources suggested that he might decide to step down earlier to take over at Airbus from Mr Hans Friderichs, a German businessman and former federal economics minister. Should he decide to step down sooner, Mr Reuter is also being tipped to replace Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, who chairs the Daimler-Benz supervisory board. Mr Kopper would remain on the Daimler supervisory board with the role of an ordinary director. The Daimler board is expected to discuss the succession to Mr Reuter at a meeting tomorrow that will also focus on Mercedes-Benz's decision to develop a small city car with Swatch, the Swiss watchmaker. The meeting will consider a proposal that the car should be marketed as a Mercedes. Two candidates have already been tipped to succeed Mr Reuter. The favourite appears to be Mr Jurgen Schrempp, head of Deutsche Aerospace Dasa. The other is Mr Helmut Werner, head of Mercedes-Benz's car oper-ations, which account for about 70 per cent of the group's overall turnover.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-PRESIDENT OF ASHTON-TATE TO HEAD NEW FIRM  </P> <P> Luther J. Nussbaum, who quit his job as president of troubled software vendor  Ashton-Tate last July, has resurfaced as chairman and chief executive of an  unusual new company that is acquiring computer networking firms around the  country.  </P> <P> Evernet Systems, a Los Angeles firm whose formal debut will be announced  Monday, aims to forge a national company for the installation and maintenance  of so-called local and wide area networks, which are increasingly used by  businesses to link personal computers and related equipment.  </P> <P> Backed by $5 million in venture capital, Evernet is buying small local computer  service firms -- known as value-added resellers (VARs) -- that specialize in  local area networks, offering them a small amount of cash and a larger amount  of Evernet stock. The companies then become the local office for Evernet.  </P> <P> Evernet expects to buy 10-15 companies during the next year, each with revenues  in the $3-million to $10-million range, and then continue its growth through  internal expansion before going public in several years. It is also opening an  Orange County office, which Nussbaum said will serve as a trial run in opening  new branches from scratch.  </P></p>

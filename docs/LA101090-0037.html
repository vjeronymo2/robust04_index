			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS TO CHARGE FOR DRIVER TRAINING R  </P> <P> The Ventura Unified School District board approved a plan Tuesday to charge  high school students a fee for driver training classes, which had been  suspended because of state budget cuts. The district's proposal, passed by a 4  to 1 vote, transfers financial jurisdiction of driver training from its general  fund to its adult education program.  </P> <P> Instead of receiving the training for free, a fee will be charged.Board  President Barbara Myers voted against the proposal. Statewide, schools are  grappling to find ways to continue offering the program after Gov. George  Deukmejian vetoed $21.2 million in driver training funds when he signed the  final budget in July. Other districts, including the Conejo Valley Unified  School District, have already decided to offer driver training for a fee  through adult education or community education programs. The Conejo district  charges students $120 for behind-the-wheel training. The cost for the training  in Ventura has not yet been determined but may be between $120 and $150,  depending on the number of students who sign up, Assistant Supt. Richard  Welcher said.

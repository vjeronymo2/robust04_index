			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Vladimir </F> Mlynar; place and date not given: "With Vaclav Klaus About the  Nation, Europe, and the Civic Democratic Party"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Mlynar] Two years ago, as  you assumed the post of prime minister, you told RESPEKT that it  is "too early to define Czech interests." How would you  characterize Czech interests today?    [Klaus] If I recall correctly, I told you also that I am  against essays that would force one to formulate elevated  phrases while sitting in a closed study, and then attempt to  squeeze reality into them. I would say again today that I  cannot give you a simple definition of Czech interests. I would  say: Take the last two volumes of my collected works, and you  will find there what you are looking for in all its variety and  scale.    The fundamental issue today is, I believe, to find our, to a  certain degree lost, national identity, and not to immediately  lose it again through entry into Europe. I keep telling our  foreign guests that we do not want to dissolve in Europe like a  piece of sugar in coffee. That is for me, at this time, the  dominant issue, or if you wish, the Czech interest.  <H5>  Eurorealist </H5>   [Mlynar] What you say corresponds to your reputation of a  Euroskeptic. That certainly is in many regards a prudential  stand, nonetheless, there is a certain difference: if Norway,  for instance -- which is firmly linked to the West and is a NATO  member -- acts Euroskeptically, it does not risk anything. We  are in danger, however, if we overdo the Euroskepticism, of  another alternative: We could be left in the gray zone of  "Inter-Europe," and in an even worse instance under a certain  influence of the East. Do you see any other possibility for the  Czech Republic but its integration into the European Union?    [Klaus] I am not aware of any other alternative, and, as a  matter of fact, I also refuse the term Euroskepticism.  Personally, I would rather subscribe to -- if labels are  necessary -- to the term Eurorealism. I understand it as a  stand that accepts the reality, attempts to live in it, and, at  the same time, maximize the effect of it that we can enjoy. I  disagree with the slogans currently fashionable in the West  about the end of ideologies -- I do not believe that the  discussions about the form of European integration are over.  Far from it, we live in the process of constant redefinition of  these concepts, and every change in Europe moves us somewhere  else. Last year's failure of the European monetary system said  something about the Maastricht vision of European currency, the  Italian elections said something as they resulted in Foreign  Minister Martino, who, as a conservative, cannot have the same  opinion on the European integration as, for instance, the  Belgian foreign minister. The European reality simply keeps  changing. I take it into account, and react very sensitively so  that this country benefits.    [Mlynar] Would it not be better for the Czech Republic to  seek an alternative to entry into the European Union? A  specific status similar to that of Switzerland has been  mentioned occasionally in this context.    [Klaus] It has never been mentioned in my presence.  Moreover, a specific status like that of Switzerland seems to  me a bit too great an ambition.  <H5>  The Unique Experience of Communism </H5>   [Mlynar] How would you like the Czech Republic to look in 10  years?    [Klaus] In 10 years the Czech Republic will be -- and I am  not saying that this will not happen earlier -- a European  country indistinguishable from those that have not experienced  communism. I mean it politically, socially, and economically.  That is my rather clear vision.    [Mlynar] You said recently that the "Western world of ideas  is not exactly where" you would like it to be, and that the  "Western European proclivity to the left will weigh on us."  When you say that in 10 years we will be indistinguishable from  our Western neighbors, is the "proclivity to the left" a part of  it?    [Klaus] The Czech Republic has a chance -- within the  historical period we are discussing -- to avoid this danger. We  have experienced communism, and that makes us hypersensitive to  certain things that the West does not feel so acutely.    [Mlynar] Nevertheless, when assessing the results of the  Hungarian elections, you said that the reason for the victory of  the left wing was that it has a feasible program, and that was  more important for the voters than the experience of real  communism. That certainly contradicts what you have just said  now.    [Klaus] I would not say that there is a contradiction. I  clearly differentiate in this context between the Czech and the  Hungarian experiences. In Poland and Hungary they did not  experience the 1960s as we did, nor did they experience the  brutal destruction of all democratization processes. Thanks to  this, a significant part of the Polish and Hungarian  intelligentsia lived in the delusion of the possibility of  revising the communist system from within. Moreover, a vast  majority of my Polish friends and colleagues were not pushed to  the edge of society in the 1970s and the 1980s as was the case  in Czechoslovakia. During those two decades, they frequently  sat down side by side with communist leaders in the incessant  succession of reform groups. That led to Poland and Hungary  having been more liberal in those 20 years than Czechoslovakia  was at the time, but also to these people not keeping their  distance from the communist regime. Therefore, even in the  1970s and 1980s, the Polish and Hungarian economists were less  radical than we were. I know it because I was in frequent  contact with them. All this has been projected to a different  view of the transformation process today, to the different  political structures of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary.  <H5>  The Time for a Discussion About Joining the European Union </H5> Is Only Coming    [Mlynar] As one of a few Czech politicians, you do not  hesitate to use the word nation. What does this concept mean to  you, and how does it agree with your liberal convictions?    [Klaus] You must concede that the liberal approach is not a  limitless and false cosmopolitanism. Liberalism teaches that  the point of departure is man, an individual, and that any human  fusion should be based on immanent interests of man, and not on  a doctrine imposed by force from without. In this respect, I  believe that the term nation is a word of which we should not be  ashamed. Although in the name of nation things happened in  human history that were certainly not the best, I am convinced  that many good things also happened in its name. Therefore I  insist on the differentiation between the notions of nation and  national, and the adjective nationalist. These are two  completely different things. I claim that only large, and  therefore indisputable, nations take the liberty of playing down  the term national, and these nations are actually much more  nationalist than we are. Those Czech intellectuals who put on  cosmopolitan airs only think that talking about the nation is  not good manners.    [Mlynar] Let us, in this context, go back to our joining the  European structures. Why, do you think, are the consequences of  such a step discussed so little?    [Klaus] The Czech public is only getting there, and that is  in order. The discussions about the impact of joining the  somewhat limiting European institutions still lie ahead of us,  and I do not see any reason for getting to these discussions any  faster. I am dealing with it almost incessantly because it  interests me, but I do not believe that it is the main topic we  must discuss today. The time must be ripe for it, just as it is  now for the debate on the senate. To seriously discuss a topic  means to read books about it, debate it with friends, and that  cannot be speeded up.    [Mlynar] When do you think the time will be ripe for this  debate?    [Klaus] I would say that in about two years this country  will be ready to replace the slogan "return to Europe" with a  discussion about what joining a certain institution means.  <H5>  The Program for Every Day </H5>   [Mlynar] For several months now, Josef Zieleniec, deputy  chairman [of the Civic Democratic Party], has been talking about  the need for preparing for the Civic Democratic Party a  so-called program for every day that would formulate clearly and  in detail the party policy on such matters as the housing  market, education, health care privatization, and security. At  the Civic Democratic Party congress in Koprivnice, you described  this idea as nonsystemic. How do you feel about it today?    [Klaus] The idea of the program for every day died in  principle. I declare with all responsibility that since the  Koprivnice congress, I have not encountered anyone, anywhere,  who would want to revive it. I believe that it was just a  momentary idea.    I certainly do not have anything against the need for a  constant rationalization of the political party program, but I  do not feel it necessary to do this rationalization with a  capital R precisely now. I take it as a permanent process, and  if you read the articles that I write for LIDOVE NOVINY, for  instance, you know that the Civic Democratic Party program  theses are cerebrated there and expanded ad infinitum the way I  see them.    [Mlynar] Your articles in LIDOVE NOVINY represent, however,  the stand of the prime minister, or possibly of the Civic  Democratic Party chairman, and not that of the party.    [Klaus] That is not the issue. It is a part of the  permanent dialogue that we conduct incessantly and at all  possible levels of the Civic Democratic Party. Right now, for  instance, we are in the process of preparing the election  program for the local elections and we hold broad discussions  about its individual chapters -- that is the constant  reflection, of which my articles are also a part. That is the  reality. It seems to me that the debate in the media on the  program for every day was somewhat exaggerated, that it was an  attempt at finding some controversy within the Civic Democratic  Party that does not exist.

State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said Washington  did not rule out further steps "against any other Russian  diplomats who are subsequently implicated in the Ames affair."    McCurry was referring to Aldrich Ames, former chief of the  Central Intelligence Agency's counterintelligence center's  Soviet section who, together with his wife, was accused of  selling vital CIA operations and personnel information to Moscow.    Lysenko, whom the U.S. said is "the chief Russian  intelligence official" that is "in a position to be responsible  for the Ames espionage case, was ordered to leave the United  States within seven days, McCurry said.    The Russian side protested the U.S. move, McCurry said.    Before announcing the demarche, McCurry stressed the United  States would continue its support for Russian reforms that  "extremely important" to Washington. [sentence as received]    Earlier, President Bill Clinton urged the nation not to  reduce or suspend aid to Moscow because helping Russian reforms  is in the very interest of Washington.    Clinton argued that the bulk of U.S. aid for Russia is to  help dismantling nuclear weapons "that were aimed at the United  States for over four decades."    Besides, Clinton said, Washington's economic assistance was  "flowing not to government, but to reformers outside Moscow,  most in the nongovernmental sector, to help them start business  and privatize existing businesses."    However, Clinton reiterated that Washington took the Ames  spying case seriously and urged Russia to take steps required by  the United States.    "The Russians ought to be at least told what we know...and  given an opportunity to take whatever action they wanted to  take," Clinton said.    Local observers said the expulsion of Lysenko was only a  measured response to the Ames case and relations between  Washington and Moscow would eventually resume to normal.</p>

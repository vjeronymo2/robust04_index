			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Marcos Samondo yesterday urged the UN Security  Council not to impose sanctions against the National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in view of the progress  made in the ongoing negotiations.    [Begin Samondo recording] I hope the good sense will prevail  so that the UN Security Council does not make the mistake of  imposing sanctions on UNITA, because this will just complicate  the process, and will not bring peace to Angola. [end recording]    Dr. Marcos Samondo, UNITA's representative in New York,  later  on said that UNITA wants to govern Huambo because it is a matter  of survival, since Huambo is a place of security for UNITA, and  this should be understood within the framework of reconciliation.    [Begin Samondo recording] At present there is an obstacle on  the issue of governing Huambo. It is vital that the Security  Council understand that Huambo is important for UNITA, because  Huambo at present represents a third in security and protection  against government intents. As you know populations were  massacred in Luanda [words indistinct]. The observers and the  mediator have not yet understood the importance of Huambo in the  national reconciliation process. I just hope that the Security  Council will not state that UNITA should give up its stand on  the Huambo issue, because for us Huambo is vital at this stage  of negotiations, as well as in this process of reconciliation,  and in the agreements which may eventually be signed. [end  recording]    On the involvement of South African President Nelson Mandela  in the Angolan peace process, encouraged by UN Special  Representative Alioune Blondin Beye who has been to South Africa  recently, and hailed by UNITA, the UNITA representative in the  United Nations said this intervention may be void if the UN  Security Council imposes further sanctions.    [Begin Samondo recording] Chief Beye has recently been to  South Africa where he met with South African President Mandela  having requested him to play a role in the Angolan process.  However, 90 percent of the document on the Lusaka accord is  already complete, and only 10 percent remains to be tackled. On  the 10 percent, the fundamental issue regards Huambo, and I  believe President Mandela may play a positive role, but if the  United Nations imposes sanctions on UNITA I do not believe Mr.  Mandela will have any chance or opportunity of being involved in  the mediation.

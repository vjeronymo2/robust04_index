			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Tax Credit Certificates (Certificados Abono Tributario CATs)): Petitioner contends that it is not clear that the CAT program was terminated as it continues to undergo fundamental changes. Petitioner also urges that although the Central Bank is not granting CATs in new export contracts, it is unclear whether the same or different benefits could be granted without using export contracts which are currently required to obtain CAT benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings: The agreement requires exporters to maintain separate accounting records for subject and non-subject merchandise. Petitioner argues that as only one company, American Flower, maintains separate records of duty and tax exemption benefits received for exports of non-subject merchandise, the Department cannot confirm whether flower producers and exporters have received countervailable benefits on exports of subject merchandise. Petitioner contends that flower producers and exporters were eligible to apply for the income tax exemption if they had tax-exempt export profits and if they segregated domestic and export sales income in calculating income tax. Consequently, petitioner asserts, it is unlikely that new flower producers and exporters not previously subject to the agreement will maintain separate records for the subject merchandise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondents argue that the GOCR and ACOFLOR have pledged to maintain controls to monitor receipt of benefits and that the GOCR is committed to eliminating incentives that distort trade. Respondents argue that it is unlikely that the flower producers and exporters will use the following six programs after termination: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases: Respondents argue that, in most cases, it will not always be feasible for flower producers and exporters to switch equipment from the production of a product which is non-subject merchandise to subject merchandise product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Exporter Exemptions for Taxes and Duties on Imports: Respondents made the same arguments as above for the Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Accelerated Depreciation: Respondents assert that there are two separate government agencies, Ministry of Finance and CENPRO, which have established government controls to block access to the use of accelerated depreciation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) CIEX: Respondents argue that this program was terminated in 1988. Respondents argue that even if some of the funds authorized for this program in 1988 were not actually distributed until 1991, the GOCR made no CIEX distributions to flower producers and exporters. The respondents also argue that the fact that such funds may have actually been distributed in 1991 does not alter that fact that the CIEX program was effectively terminated in 1984 for lack of funding and officially closed in 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) CATs: Respondents argue that the only verified fundamental changes to the CAT program are those reducing or restricting its benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings: Respondents contend that with the continuation of GOCR controls, the GOCR will not grant exemptions unless the claimant can demonstrate that the income for which an exemption is sought is not derived from exports of the subject merchandise. Respondents also note that this program is being phased out. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 355.25(a)(2) of the Department's regulations provides that the Department may terminate a suspension agreement despite the fact that the subsidy programs have not been abolished, provided the Department concludes that the requirements of this provision are met. As explained in Comment 1, the Department determines that the original signatories have complied with the terms of the agreement and the requirements of &sect;355.25(a)(2)(i). Regarding &sect;355.25(a)(2)(ii), ACOFLOR has certified that the signatories are not likely to apply for or receive any countervailable subsidies in the future. The GOCR and ACOFLOR have certified that the control mechanisms to ensure compliance with the agreement will remain in place if the agreement is terminated. Furthermore, government officials stated during verification that Costa Rican subsidies in general were being phased out. In sum, as the Department determined in the preliminary results of review, the record contains no evidence indicating that the signatories will apply for or receive any net subsidy on the subject merchandise in the future. 59 FR at 6238. Petitioner has offered no arguments which would reasonably contradict this determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we disagree with each of the petitioner's program-specific arguments for the following reasons: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases and (2) Exporter Exemptions for Taxes and Duties on Imports: The GOCR and ACOFLOR have certified that the control mechanisms currently in place to monitor compliance with the agreement will remain in place so that equipment on which duties or taxes were exempted will not be switched to the production of subject merchandise after termination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

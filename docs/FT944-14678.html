			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Earthquake losses continue to shake Sears, Roebuck results January's California earth-quake again shook Sears, Roebuck's bottom line in the third quarter, with additional catastrophe losses announced by its Allstate insurance subsidiary in September reducing the US retailer's net income by Dollars 182.4m. Allstate yesterday reported its quake-related losses had reached Dollars 845m for the first nine months of the year, with Sears' share of those losses at Dollars 677.1m. Income growth at Sears' merchandising division helped offset the insurance losses, with Sears reporting third-quarter earnings of Dollars 363.5m, or 91 cents a share, down from Dollars 388.4m, or 98 cents, in last year's third quarter. Sales for the quarter were up about 3.8 per cent, to Dollars 13.2bn, from last year's Dollars 12.7bn. Sears' Merchandise Group recorded third-quarter net income of Dollars 196m, up from Dollars 159m last year, while sales rose to Dollars 7.7bn from Dollars 7.3bn last time. 'Our core retailing and insurance businesses continued to post very good operating performances in the quarter, highlighted by the Mer-chandise Group's earnings in-crease of about 24 per cent and Allstate's significantly improv-ed underwriting performance excluding the impact of the earthquake,' said Mr Edward Brennan, Sears chairman. 'The fundamentals of our Sears and Allstate businesses are very sound,' he added. For the first nine months net income was Dollars 769.0m, or Dollars 1.92 a share, on revenues of Dollars 38.48bn. In the same 1993 period Sears had income of Dollars 1.83bn, or Dollars 4.73, which included a Dollars 635.1m gain from Allstate's share offering. Sears' revenues in the period last year were Dollars 36.17bn. Allstate, 80.1 per cent owned by Sears, separately reported its third-quarter income at Dollars 193.9m, or 43 cents, down sharply from Dollars 325.7m, or 72 cents, last time. The company said losses from the California earthquake reduced third-quarter earnings by 51 cents a share. Allstate's third-quarter revenues were Dollars 5.39bn, up from Dollars 5.32bn. For the nine months Allstate's income was Dollars 320.7m, or 71 cents, against Dollars 1.04bn, or Dollars 2.42. Sales for the period were Dollars 16.03bn, up from Dollars 15.66bn.</p>

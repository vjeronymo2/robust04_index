			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FAA WARNS OF POSSIBLE HIJACK TRY IN EUROPE  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration has warned U.S. airlines of a possible  hijacking attempt by Palestinian terrorists in Europe, the U.S. Embassy and the  FAA said today.  </P> <P> But officials at the U.S. Embassy in London, the FAA and the White House denied  a report today in the tabloid Daily Express that U.S. diplomats and military  personnel had been notified of the warning. They also denied that the warning  said the hijacking could occur over Easter weekend.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, West Germany, said it  was aware of the warning but did not pass it along to military personnel.  </P> <P> The front-page Daily Express report came during a political debate in Britain  over whether airlines were properly informed about a radio-cassette bomb before  Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747 bound for New York, was blown apart over  Lockerbie in Scotland on Dec. 21, killing 270 people.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fitzwater Comments  </P> <P> In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged today  that the warning was issued March 16 and that it was "similar to many, many  similar kinds of information and security bulletins that go out."  </P> <P> Fitzwater said that "it was not given to any military or diplomatic personnel  but rather just to security experts at aviation airports and airlines." The  notice did not mention any specific time period, such as Easter, Fitzwater  said, nor did it mention a specific airline or airport.  </P></p>

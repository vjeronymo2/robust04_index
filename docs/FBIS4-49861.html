			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- In the process of  further deepening the reform of its planning and investment  system, China will exploit the advantages of both planning and  market means to promote a sustained, high-speed and healthy  development of the national economy.    Gui Shiyong, deputy minister of the State Planning  Commission, said this in his speech at the opening of the "94  China Beijing Senior Economic Seminar" here today.    Gui said that from now on the task of planning is to  rationally define the strategies of national economic and social  development, macro-control targets and industrial policies;  carry out economic calculations; and draft plans for major  economic structures, the arrangement of the productive forces  and land management, and construction of key projects.    All economic activities which should be, or are qualified to  be, regulated by the market, will be brought under market  regulation, he added.    He said that the existing planning management style will be  reformed, so as to realize the shift from direct control to  indirect control, mainly using economic policies, regulations  and other economic levers to guide the operation of the economy.    Gui said that China will also rationally define and perfect  the economic management rights between the central and local  governments. The unity and authority of macro-control by the  central government should be guaranteed, while bringing the  enthusiasm of local governments into full play, he stressed.    Meanwhile, he said, more attention should be paid to the  participation of enterprises, market mediation organizations,  scientific research units, universities, non-governmental  organizations and other social circles in drafting plans.  Efforts must be made to open planning work further, he said.    Gui said that the major contents of the reform of the  investment system include the intensification of the investment  risk restraining mechanism; the reform of the investment and  fund-raising patterns; the reinforcement of macro-control on the  investment volume and structure; and the establishment of  policy-oriented investment and fund-raising systems by the  central government and the State Development Bank.</p>

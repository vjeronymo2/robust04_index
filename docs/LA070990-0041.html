			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TRICKLE'S FIELD DAY LEADS HOCKEY EFFORT  </P> <P> Goals were the goal for Taylor Trickle and on Sunday, the 18-year-old from  Camarillo delivered.  </P> <P> He scored three -- none of which trickled in -- helping the South field hockey  team blank the North, 5-0.  </P> <P> Trickle's hat trick was the first such outburst in two days of play at Augsburg  College, site of play in the U. S. Olympic Festival.  </P> <P> "I came into the Festival with the goal to score goals," Trickle said, "but I  never expected to score three in one game."  </P> <P> Eric Holtz, 29, of Simi Valley, scored the first two goals for the South (2-0).  South goalkeeper Tom Vano, also of Simi Valley, made nine saves.  </P> <P> In figure skating, strong long programs enabled Tish Walker, 16, of Thousand  Oaks, to move up from fifth in singles and the duo of Tristen Vega of Torrance  and Richard Alexander of Simi Valley to do the same in pairs.  </P> <P> Which in the end made it all the more frustrating.  </P> <P> Walker finished fourth, the same as Vega and Alexander -- one place short of a  medal.  </P> <P> Walker stirred a capacity crowd of more than 13,000 with an exhilarating  performance.  </P> <P> Afterward, that was of some consolation.  </P> <P> "I was hoping to get a medal and just missed, but I'm still pleased with my  performance and how I skated," Walker said. "The crowd was great. They really  gave me inspiration and motivation out there."  </P> <P> Ditto for Vega and Alexander, who moved into medal contention with a strong  finishing routine.  </P> <P> The ladies' singles event was won by Nancy Kerrigan of Stoneham, Mass. Angela  Deneweth of Westland, Mich., and John Denton of Morro Bay took the gold medal  in pairs.  </P> <P> In swimming, Kristine Quance made her festival debut with a performance that  she won't soon forget.  </P> <P> Neither, probably, will those who pursued her in the race at the University of  Minnesota Aquatics Center.  </P> <P> The 15-year-old from Northridge won a gold medal in the women's 400-meter  individual medley, defeating second-place Natasha Kohne of Stanton, Calif., by  well over two seconds.  </P> <P> Quance won with a time of 4 minutes 56.77 seconds.  </P> <P> Kohne finished in 4:59.46 and Kelly Leaman of Centerville, Ohio, was third in  5:02.48.  </P> <P> In canoeing, Dave and Fred Spaulding, brothers from Ventura, have proven to be  double trouble on the water at Lake Elmo.  </P> <P> On Sunday, the Spauldings won their second goal medal as a doubles team in what  ended up a two-canoe race.  </P> <P> Spaulding and Spaulding nipped Jim Terrell of El Toro and Wyatt Jones of  Honolulu, 1:54.65 to 1:54.97, in the 500-meter doubles race.  </P> <P> They had defeated the same pair on Saturday in the 1,000-meter race.  </P> <P> Joe Harper of Ventura and Stewart Carr of Indianapolis led the second pack home  in the 500 and earned the bronze with a time of 2:03.21.  </P> <P> Harper also placed sixth in the 500-meter singles race with a time of 2:20.52.  Terrell won the event in 2:06.24.  </P> <P> In tennis, Natasha Pospich of Woodland Hills advanced to today's second round  of women's singles play with a 6-0, 3-6, 6-4, victory over Jennifer Poulos of  Boston.  </P> <P> Pospich and mixed doubles teammate Chris Pressley of Miami didn't fare as well.  They dropped a 6-4, 6-2, first-round decision to Keirsten Alley of Melrose,  Mass., and Jason Marler of Enid, Okla.  </P> <P> In men's basketball, Lucious Harris' shooting slump continued.  </P> <P> However, he managed to reach double figures in scoring for the second  consecutive day, helping the West to a 117-96 victory over the East.  </P> <P> Harris, who played at Cleveland High, made only four of 12 field-goal attempts  and was two of four from the free-throw line, finishing with 11 points.  </P> <P> Dedan Thomas, who played at Antelope Valley College last season, experienced  similar difficulties, making two of six shots and finishing with four points.  </P> <P> Shon Tarver, from Santa Clara High, only wished he would have been around to  take a shot.  </P> <P> Tarver landed heavily on his back after going for a rebound only four minutes  into the game.  </P> <P> He sustained a deep bruise, but X-rays showed no fracture and he attended  therapy sessions later in the day.  </P> <P> Tarver, who had 18 points in the West's first game, is listed as questionable  for today's game against the North.  </P> <P> In cycling, Katie Beck placed fifth in the women's 50-kilometer road race with  a time of 1:23.26. Amy Gibson of Boise, Idaho, won the event with a time of  1:22.29.  </P></p>

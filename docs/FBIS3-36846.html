The defence minister positively assessed the construction of  houses for Russian servicemen withdrawn from abroad, adding that  the construction was going ahead at a fast pace. Grachev  visited three regions and one republic and pointed out that he  was satisfied with the attitude of local authorities to  servicemen.    On Wednesday, Grachev visited troops stationed in the  Ulyanovsk region, defence-related enterprises and met with  regional heads and the city administration.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Silvano Costanzo: "Borrelli Says Elections Will </F> Not Stop the `Clean Hands' Operation"]    [Text]--Rome The chief district attorney of Milan  says companies are cooperating because they have no more money  for bribes.    "Candidates must certify their honesty."    "The truth is that there was no more money. And that is why  the Clean Hands investigation could uncover the Bribe City  scandals." Francesco Saverio Borrelli, chief district attorney  of Milan, is speaking. He is speaking about "how everything  started." That is, about one of the crucial points in the  judicial affair that is changing the face of the country. But he  is also speaking about the future, about possible solutions. And  he issued a warning to politicians who intend to confront the  new elections as protagonists: "If you have any skeletons in  your closet, hurry up and take them out. Or we will get them out  for you."    Francesco Saverio Borrelli is speaking. He does it by giving  a long interview to the Viennese daily DER STANDARD. And by  appearing before the microphone of Paolo Garimberti, head of  Television News Channel 2.    Borrelli explained to the Austrian daily why his prosecuting  attorney's office had "better luck," with respect to others, in  the investigations into bribes.    The chief district attorney said "As long as there was  plenty  of money, the deals could be paid. But when the profit margins  narrowed and the individual company's struggle for survival  became more severe, the burden became unbearable. And that is  just how it happened. But there was another important reason:  The prospect of the European Single Market and the need to stand  up to competition with foreign companies convinced Italian  business men that the system imposed by politics (a hidden  system and parallel to that of the state) could not and should  not be maintained. Business men thus helped bring about its  collapse."    Instead, at Paolo Garimberti's microphone for Television  News  Channel 2 yesterday evening, Borrelli even spoke of the future.  He said, "Our work will not slow down in connection with the  forthcoming political deadlines." In brief, there will be no  electoral-type slowing down. On the contrary. "Personalities  stepping into the political limelight are the first to know  whether there are episodes in their past that might compromise  their image. We shall not stop our investigations even during  the elections. Therefore, I advise these persons to provide a  certain self-certification concerning the transparency of their  past to the political forces that are backing them."    About the Cusani trial, Borelli denied the existence of an  "oligarchy" at the summit of Bribe City. "There is no cupola, in  the Mafia sense of the term. Instead, there is a progressive  slipping and decline in political morals and ethics. Not only  concerning the leading class but, I should say, on the part of  the Italian population in general."    Borrelli did not express optimism about the timing and the  possible closing of this dark page of the First Republic. "A  submerged and potentially limitless universe has been discovered  over these two years. I do not know whether the new Parliament  intends to put a political type of end to the matter. Nor do I  know whether Italians would be pleased with such a choice. What  I do hope is that all the trials will be held. The  investigations could meet with obstacles only if the political  situation regressed to the levels of two years ago. And perhaps  one would not stop even in such a case. But, in my opinion, the  danger is something different; namely, that a future parliament,  stronger and sounder thanks to the uninominal system, might give  in to the temptation to reduce judicial power."    And then there could no longer be any revelations of  possible  new Bribe Cities.</p>

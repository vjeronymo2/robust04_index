			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] On 29 March, the Coordinating Committee for  National Mobilization presented the text of a resolution  opposing Aristide to parliament. This resolution was handed over  to the office of the lower chamber and to the unofficial office  of the Upper Chamber. Hubert De Ronceray [leader of the  Mobilization for National Development], Gabriel Augustin [leader  of the Assembly of Democrats for the Republic], Rony Durand, and  Herve Leveille [of the Group of Citizens of the Greater North,  CCGN] are the principal members of this delegation demanding  that parliamentarians either reactivate Article 149 or form an  ad hoc government.    A member of the delegation told Signal FM that the office of  the lower chamber has promised to give a ruling on this  resolution soon. Rony Durand demands a Haitian solution to the  crisis. The delegation and the office of the lower chamber met  in camera. [passage omitted]    Herve Leveille of CCGN expects a positive response to their  request from the parliamentarians.

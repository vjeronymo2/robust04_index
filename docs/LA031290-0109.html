			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNISTS AND BUDDHISTS STAGE RALLIES IN MONGOLIA  </P> <P> Thousands of Communist Party supporters staged a pro-government rally in the  Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator on Sunday, while Buddhists held a separate  demonstration demanding resumption of religious activity at an old temple.  </P> <P> There were no reports of violence.  </P> <P> However, the competing protests marked a new level of tension as opposition  forces press demands for rapid political change and the government's response  remains uncertain.  </P> <P> In a concession to the opposition, Mongolian President Jambyn Batmonh promised  last week that all members of the policy-setting Politburo, which he heads,  will submit their resignations at a meeting today of the ruling Communist  Party's Central Committee. It was not clear, however, whether the resignations  will be accepted or whether many of the same leaders might be immediately  reelected.  </P> <P> Sunday's pro-government demonstration, which, according to reports from the  Mongolian capital, drew about 5,000 people, appeared aimed at reinforcing the  political position of Batmonh and other leaders of the Mongolian People's  Revolutionary Party, as the Communists are officially known, before today's  meeting.  </P> <P> The opposition-backed pro-Buddhist demonstration, joined by about 2,000 people,  reflected a recent upsurge in respect for all aspects of Mongolia's ancient  traditions.  </P> <P> The protesters, according to a European diplomat reached by telephone from  Beijing, were demanding that a former Buddhist temple in Ulan Bator now used as  a museum be restored to its religious function.  </P></p>

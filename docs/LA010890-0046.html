			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NORTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> STORM DUMPS SNOW; MORE RAIN EXPECTED  </P> <P> A Pacific storm system dampened Northern California and dropped up to half a  foot of snow on the Sierra Nevada, and forecasters predicted that another front  would bring more welcome precipitation today.  </P> <P> While the latest storm brought only light rain followed by decreasing showers  to most of the region, it drenched the North Coast with several inches,  according to the National Weather Service. The storm also doused parts of the  Sierra Nevada with several inches of snow. Rain was predicted for the North  Coast, the Sacramento Valley and the Bay Area today. The prognosis wasn't that  good for the Southland, however. Forecasters said the next chance of rain here  will not occur until Thursday.  </P></p>

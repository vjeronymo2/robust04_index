			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Danish bank returns to black with DKr885m Unidanmark, the second-largest Danish banking group, reported a return to profit in 1993 after three consecutive years in the red. Net profit was DKr885m (Dollars 132m), compared with a loss in 1992 of DKr4.66bn and losses in 1990 and 1991 of DKr1.09bn and DKr1.65bn respectively. The group omitted a dividend for the second year, but announced a DKr550m new share issue at market price and without preferential rights for existing shareholders which should raise about DKr1.3bn. A cut in bad loss provisions to DKr3.88bn last year from DKr6.28bn and income from securities and foreign exchange of DKr2.56bn, compared with a loss of DKr273m in 1992, helped the turnround. The increase in profits from securities and foreign exchange reflected the sharp rise in bond and share prices on the Copenhagen stock exchange last year. Mr Thorleif Krarup, group chief executive, said about DKr1.5bn of the DKr2.5bn profit under this heading were trading profits and the rest a gain in the value of securities. Mr Krarup was brought into the bank in the autumn of 1992 after repeated forecasts of an improved performance were falsified.</p>

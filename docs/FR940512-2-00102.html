The Original Plan is a 401(k) profit sharing plan formerly named ``Radiology Medical Group Profit Sharing Plan'', which was established by Radiology Medical Group, Inc. (the Original Employer), a California professional corporation engaged in the general practice of radiological medicine in San Diego, California. Effective January 1, 1990, the Original Employer underwent a corporate reorganization, resulting in the creation of an additional professional corporation, Radiation Medical Group, Inc. (the New Employer), to assume the radiation therapy portion of the medical practice previously performed by the Original Employer. The employees performing the radiation therapy services were transferred to the New Employer. The Employers are separate entities, with no common shareholders or employees. The Original Plan was amended to change its name to its current name and to enable the New Employer to adopt the Original Plan for its employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effective January 1, 1992, the boards of directors of the Original Employer and the New Employer (together, the Employers) determined that the Employers should maintain separate retirement plans. The New Employer continued as the sponsor of the Original Plan, and the Original Employer adopted the New Plan as a 401(k) profit sharing plan for its employees. The assets of both Plans are maintained under one trust, the trustee of which is the Union Bank in San Diego, California (the Trustee), which was formerly named California First Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Among the assets in the Original Plan is the Property, a parcel of real property located at 2466 First Avenue in San Diego, California. The Original Employer owns a medical office building and other improvements on the Property which are maintained as the Employers' principal place of business. The Original Employer leases the Property from the Original Plan (the Original Lease) pursuant to an individual administrative exemption granted by the Department, Prohibited Transaction Exemption 84&hyph;175 (PTE 84&hyph;175, 49 FR 48834, December 14, 1984). Pursuant to PTE 84&hyph;175, the interests of the Original Plan under the Original Lease are represented by the Trustee. Since the corporate reorganization, the Employers share the use of the Property, and the Original Employer continues as lessee under the Original Lease. The Original Plan, sponsored by the New Employer, continues to hold title to the Property. The participant accounts of employees of the Original Employer, now participating in the New Plan, constitute 57 percent of the assets of the Original Plan. The participant accounts of employees of the New Employer, now participating in the Original Plan, constitute 43 percent of the assets of the Original Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Employers have determined that each Plan should own a proportionate interest in the Property, in direct relation to each Plan's proportionate interests in the assets of the Original Plan. Accordingly, the Employers propose to direct the Trustee to transfer a 57 percent interest in the Property (the Interest) from the Original Plan to the New Plan, representing the ownership interest of the New Plan participants in the Property. Additionally, the Employers propose that the Plans lease their respective interests in the Property to the Employers pursuant to a modification and continuation of the Original Lease in the form of two separate leases. The Employers are requesting an exemption for such transactions under the terms and conditions described herein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

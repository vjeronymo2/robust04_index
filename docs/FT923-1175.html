			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Observer: Ore no more Bang goes another little piece of history. Sweden's 10 ore coin is to be taken out of circulation next Thursday, the authorities having finally deemed it no longer worth keeping. While it still represents slightly more than Britain's 1p, decades of inflation have reconciled even sentimental Swedes to the disappearance of the tiny coins, which must be swapped for krona by the end of the year. Indeed, it's not uncommon for 10 ore pieces to be left lying on the ground, simply because the people who've accidentally dropped them can't be bothered to pick them up. But given the national abhorrence of waste, at least in principle, the citizenry will be reassured by the promise that good use will be found for the estimated Pounds 21m worth of ore due for withdrawal. The coins are to be sold off for melting down into scrap metal.</p>

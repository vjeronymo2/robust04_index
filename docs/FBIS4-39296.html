			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Kotov] </F>   [Text] New Delhi June 3 TASS -- Russian Deputy Prime  Minister Yuriy Yarov arrived here today at the head of a  delegation. His visit is aimed at preparing documents to be  signed during Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's  official visit to Russia towards the end of June, and  activization the work of the joint Russian- Indian trade,  economic, scientific and technical cooperation commission. In  his capacity as chairman of the Russian part of the commission,  Yarov will hold working meetings with its co-chairman from the  Indian side, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee and talks with  other members of the government of India.    "India is among those few states, relations with which have  never undergone any cardinal changes and are not subject to any  reassessment as a result of serious political and economic  changes that took place in our country," Yuriy Yarov said in an  interview with ITAR-TASS after his arrival in Delhi. "India has  always been given top priority in Russia's foreign policy, which  was emphasised by President Boris Yeltsin in his address to  members of Indian Parliament during his visit to Delhi," he  emphasised.    Yuriy Yarov had a working meeting with Indian Commerce  Minister Pranab Mukherjee in the Hyderabad House in Delhi today.    In his opening speech, the Indian commerce minister  emphasised that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to India  in January, 1993 was an important stage in the history of  Russian-Indian relations. The visit helped resolve many  important questions, including the payment of India's debt to  Russia, and helped determine the further path of our cooperation  in economic, trade and scientific spheres. Mukherjee expressed  the hope that new avenues of cooperation between Russia and  India will be opened in trade, economic and scientific spheres  during Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's forthcoming  visit to Moscow, and as a result of his talks with Russian  leaders.    The chairman of the joint Russian-Indian commission, in  particular, highly appreciated fruitful and mutually beneficial  cooperation between Russia and India which is now embracing all  spheres of economic activities. But due to a number of reasons  the trade between Russia and India slumped, leading to a  significant fall in turnover over the past few years, he said.    Mukherjee expressed confidence that Russian-Indian trade  will  soon be doubled from its current level of 25 billion rupees, and  cooperation between the two countries will considerably increase  thanks to economic reforms being carried out in Russia and  India. The Indian minister recalled that an important role has  to be played by representativies of Russian and Indian private  sectors. Their activities will not only help considerably  increase exports from India to Russia to clear India's debt to  Russia, but will also help set up joint enterprises for selling  goods to third countries.    The two co-chairmen discussed specific questions about  expanding trade, activizing economic cooperation and using new  forms of cooperation between business circles of the two  countries. Both sides paid special attention to resolve the  problem of avoiding double taxation in their bilateral trade,  the question of increasing supplies of goods from India to clear  its debt to Russia, the introduction of concessional import duty  on Indian goods and setting up a Russian-Indian bank.    Today Yuriy Yarov also held talks with Indian Finance  Minister Manmohan Singh and Minister of State for Steel Santosh  Mohan Dev.    The Russian delegation will fly to Bangalore on Saturday to  acquaint itself with the work of Indian aeronautics and space  industry enterprises. Their programme also includes a visit to  Bombay, the "trade capital of India", where Yuriy Yarov and  officials accompanying him will see shipyards, and also be  guests of scientists of the Bhabha atomic research centre.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (14): In search of antiques - The best places in which to find old masters, silver plate, old books, antique furniture and other objects of value - and some advice on what to look for in the city Zurich is an attractive hunting ground for antique lovers. The leading shops are concentrated in the area between Ramistrasse and Niederdorf and around Paradeplatz. They deal in old masters, antique furniture, silver, porcelain, non-European art and old books. The best address for old masters from the Dutch baroque, early Renaissance and Venetian painting schools is David Koetser in Talstrasse 37. Koetser is the youngest member of a art-dealing dynasty of Anglo-Dutch descent. Inside Koetser's distinguished but unobtrusive premises you will find the whole palette of artists from the Golden Age. Craggy peaks under stormy skies point to Joost de Momper. Cheery skaters frolic on the ice in front of a wintry village scene with snow-covered houses - the sort of subjects that could stem from Hendrick Avercamp or Pieter Brueghel the younger. Jan Brueghel the Older liked to create rich vegetation in typical turquoise-brown contrast dotted with tiny figures. Scenes from the Old Testament or mythology were often painted with minute finesse. Grandiose landscapes with the melancholy or serene atmospheres of Salomon and Jacob van Ruysdael hang opposite an endless range of still-life works painted by Jan Davidsz de Heem, Pieter Claesz or Jan van Kessel. Between flowers and fruit, wine goblets and oysters, you will find fine droplets of water glittering, delicate insects crawling and cute mice sitting up and begging. The prices range from SFr50,000 up to seven figures and beyond. The leading specialist in silver plate for the distinguished table is Fritz Payer in Pelikanstrasse 6. Most of the pieces he offers are of German origin from the 17th and 18th centuries, quite often partially gold-plated. Figures and floral patterns on sideboard bowls, imposing carafes with medallions, voluptuous lidded jugs and trophies with floral decoration in filigree, solid mugs with emblems and curved handles provide a breath of luxury to the discerning user. Prices go into five or six figures. English and French furniture, flanked by objets d'art and 19th century silver, is offered by the dealer pair Monica Hellman and Richard Redding in Strehlgasse 9 - again for prices in five or six figures. A rare carriage clock made of marble and gold-plated bronze in the shape of a graceful lyre costs SFr55,000. The signature on the enamel clockface is Robert Robin, clockmaker to the King in Paris (approx 1785). Or you may prefer a heavy silver mustard holder from Napoleon Bonaparte for SFr25,000. The engraved hallmark promises highest quality craftsmanship. Or how about a superbly decorative pair of wine carafes of crystal and gold plated silver, specially created by Christofle for the World Exhibition in Amsterdam in 1883 and now going for SFr45,000? In 1898 Elkington &amp; Co created an exceptional solid silver bowl - decorated with a scene from mythology and featuring two panthers audaciously bent over the rim. Price SFr28,000. British noblesse or Asian meditation radiate from the furniture, sculptures and objects at Robert Hafter, St. Peterstr. 10. Hafter has a broad range of Buddha statues, some of which feature costly gold plating. A bronze Buddha head from Thailand, Sukhothai (14-15th century) costs SFr12,000, while a sitting Buddha made of wood with gold setting (around 1800 from Burma) has SFr10,000 on the price tag. A Tibetan casket with dragon decoration in black and gold on red background (17th century) costs SFr9,000. A mahogany bookcase, Regency, created around 1810, is priced at SFr38,000. The little mahogany 'Drum table' of the same period (around 1815) is a charming and versatile piece costing SFr12,000, and an oil lamp in the shape of a young Greek (around 1810) costs SFr7,800. Marguerite Iseli-Mooser is the leader in Zurich in the area of antique furniture from the Louis XV and Transition periods. Her business, Arts et Decors in Kirchgasse 33, is a pearl. A bewitching small chest of drawers created by Maitre Louis-Noel Malle in Paris 1765 is an example of the highest level of craftmanship. Richly decorated with inlays in precious woods of musical instruments, amphora flowers and geometric patterns, and with brass handles and a marble top, this piece costs SFr136,000. A further small commode (1765-1770) from Paris is remarkable for its oak base, worked with rosewood with maple inlay. This decorative piece which features the original handles and an original grey-white marble top is on offer for SFr52,000. Two charming Transition gueridons also await a discerning buyer. One of them bears the mark of Jean-Pierre Dusautoy (1719-1800) and is veneered and richly inlaid a la reine (with coloured exotic wood) for SFr65,000. The other gueridon for SFr48,000 has oak bodywork with rosewood veneer. Both are crowned with a gilt, perforated gallery, chutes and sabots and a white and grey marble top. The cheaper piece may not have any inlay work, but offers a pull-out writing top with leather inlay inside the drawers. A few houses further down at Kirchgasse 31 is Fortuna Galerie. Here Margit Szechenyi offers decorative graphic art contrasting with fascinating antiques from the Mediterranean area. An Etruscan, early Hellenic pair of anthropomorphic handles made in bronze (330-280 BC) with beautiful rust-red patina draw attention. The finely modelled figures of young men probably served as handles on a carafe or an amphora. Their hair falls to the rim of the vessel providing a frame for the broad strong faces. The price is SFr40,000 for the pair. The late-Etruscan-Hellenic silver on bronze bottle dated 2nd or 3rd century BC, once containing perfume, would grace a museum. Ornamental strips are laid over the smooth base ring. It is priced at SFr28,000. Worth a mention among the graphic art is a charming lithograph called 'Zurich from the vantage point Waid' which shows the town embedded in green fields and pastures. It stems from Lemercier in Paris around 1860 and costs SFr20,000 framed. A picturesque view of old 'Zurich with Paradeplatz' dated 1950, from a print by Johann Konrad Werdmuller and part of a series of views of old Zurich, costs just SFr1,200. Hellmut Schumann AG, Ramistrasse 25, offers antiquarian books. This establishment is a leader in the field of rare manuscripts and books, 15th to 19th century literature and a wide range of Helvetica. For SFr25,000 there is a large one-side printed woodcut from an 'Ars Moriendi' book (around 1470) on offer, originating from Niederrhein in north-west Germany. The Master ES has caught for posterity the fate of a man on his deathbed being tempted by three demons. The Latin title says that there is no hope of salvation. Giovanni Alessandro Brambilla compiled an 'Instrumentarium chirurgicum Viennense' (SFr23,500) published by Matthias Andreas Schmidt in 1781 and containing hundreds of illustrations by Ferdinand Landerer. In Bernhard von Breydenbach's 'Peregrinationes in Terram Sanctam' published by Peter Drach in Speyer in 1505 (SFr65,000) you can discover one of the most famous pilgrimages to the Holy Land and to the Catherine Monastery on Mount Sinai. 'Der Romische Carneval' (1789) is judged to be Goethe's most imposing work. An edition with title illustration by Heinrich Lips and 20 coloured copper engravings by Georg Melchior Kraus from Johann Georg Schutz is on offer for SFr45,000.</p>

Vice-Premier Avtandil Margiani, Aleksandr Kavsadsze,  chairman of the Committee for the Protection of Human Rights and  Interethnic Relations, and Vladimir Zemskiy, Russian Federation  ambassador in Georgia, were present at the meeting.    The conversation focused on the traditional goodneighborly  relations existing between the two neighboring peoples. "If one  neighbor is having problems, this affects the other neighbor, if  it is happy, the other is also happy," stated the guests from  Dagestan. They pointed out that they have always viewed Georgia  as a conscientious and peace-loving neighbor. Therefore, no  matter what pain is caused to one another by individual  excesses, this cannot change the goodwill between our two  nations that has become ingrained over the centuries. Batoni  [Georgian polite form of address] Eduard Shevardnadze spoke at  the meeting about mutual support between neighboring republics,  which has such importance today during what is a difficult time  for all. He emphasized the necessity of emerging from the  crisis through joint efforts and by means of restoring old  contacts and creating new ones. Dagestan could play one of the  decisive roles in the Caucasus, particularly in that big issue  that is called the "Caucasian dialogue," added the head of state  at the end of the meeting.</p>

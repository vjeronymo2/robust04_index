			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Tring strengthens board ahead of placing this month - Issue News Tring International, the budget recording company, yesterday announced plans for its stock market flotation. It said that Mr Joseph Bollom, a director of First Leisure, and Mr Robert Leigh, chairman of Electron House, the electronic components distributor, had joined the board. The flotation will be by way of a placing by UBS, with dealings expected to start on February 23. The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, says that Tring faces legal claims over the rights to some of the music on its products. It adds, however, that the claims will not have a significant effect on its financial position. The company says it has paid out only Pounds 50,000, including costs, to other companies over disputed music rights since 1990. Last month Tring paid Pounds 20,000 to EMI Music to settle two breaches of copyright actions. Among actions still outstanding are claims from music groups PolyGram and MCA. Tring's pathfinder prospectus says it can be difficult to trace ownership of music rights, particularly of older material. It adds: 'Many factors contribute to this problem, including poorly documented agreements with artists, a multiplicity of recordings of certain old popular hits and the absence of any comprehensive central register of rights.' Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 1993 were Pounds 3.3m on turnover of Pounds 16.5m. Tring is forecasting profits for the current year of Pounds 5.1m. It sells compact discs for Pounds 2.99 or Pounds 3.99 and cassettes for Pounds 1.99 or Pounds 2.99 through supermarkets, petrol stations and duty free shops. It also sells through Virgin and Our Price. Last year, agreement was reached with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to make 50 classical recordings.</p>

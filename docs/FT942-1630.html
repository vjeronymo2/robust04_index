			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Telegraph A recent study by management consultants McKinsey argued that the only reliable way to win price wars was to avoid them. On that reckoning, the Daily Telegraph can only lose heavily by cutting its cover price. The Telegraph accepts it could lose Pounds 40m in annual circulation revenue, although that will be partly offset by increased advertising and lower costs. The more worrying thought is that the Telegraph has ceded control of its destiny to its chief competitor. The Telegraph's move only makes sense if The Times now stops hostilities. Sadly, Mr Rupert Murdoch is not renowned for such generosity.</p>

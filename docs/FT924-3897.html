			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palladium price pushed to highest for 21 months PALLADIUM, A platinum group metal used by the electrical and dental industries and by car catalyst producers, was at the centre of a speculative overnight rally in New York and Tokyo and then its price was fixed in London yesterday morning at Dollars 101.80 a troy ounce, the highest since April, 1991. Mr Neil Carson, marketing director, platinum, for Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group, suggested that underlying the rise was a sharp increase to 10 per cent in the rate for leasing palladium. This was probably the highest level seen for two years and well above the cost of money. Many palladium leases were due to mature in December and some users were almost certainly borrowing US dollars to buy the metal rather than renewing their leases. This would put more pressure on a market which JM believed would this year suffer a supply deficit. Mr Carson recalled that a recent JM study suggested palladium supply, including sales to the west from Russia, the world's biggest producer, would this year total 3.75m ounces while demand would move up to 3.86m, leaving a shortfall of 110,000 ounces. The electrical industry, which uses about 1.8m ounces a year and where palladium is employed mainly in multi-layer ceramic capacitors found in products such as computers and video recorders, and the dental industry (1.2m ounces a year), which uses it in alloys to fill teeth, provide most of the demand for the metal. But palladium for anti-pollution car catalysts is expected to grow by a third this year and show the fastest growth. Palladium's price eased to Dollars 100.85 an ounce at the afternoon 'fix' in London yesterday, up Dollars 3.35. Some analysts expected the price to fall back to Dollars 98 but others suggested that, if it closed above Dollars 103 in New York it could climb towards Dollars 127.</p>

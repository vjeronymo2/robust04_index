			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A lawyer who contends she was struck by a San Diego County sheriff's deputy  while inside the downtown County Jail is entitled to have a lawsuit on the  claim heard in Superior Court, not Municipal Court, a state appellate court  ruled Tuesday.  </P> <P> The possibility of a damage recovery is far greater in Superior Court.  </P> <P> Under state law, claims in Municipal Court are limited to $25,000, while it  takes at least a $25,000 claim to pursue a case in Superior Court.  </P> <P> Lawyer Lucy Gilcrest Mesecher listed out-of-pocket expenses of $18,400 from the  Dec. 9, 1987, incident, the 4th District Court of Appeal said. Mesecher claims  that, as she left a client at a video arraignment room at the jail, a deputy  who apparently did not know she was a lawyer on official business pushed her  and hurt her arm.  </P> <P> Mesecher also offered to settle the case for $12,000, well below the $25,000  floor, Judge Gilbert Nares said for the court.  </P> <P> But Nares added that Mesecher also claimed substantial, though unspecified,  damages for emotional distress, and that was enough for her to be heard in  Superior Court.  </P> <P> Mesecher, who had been a lawyer with Community Defenders and the Legal Aid  Society of San Diego, since has moved her law practice to Santa Barbara, Nares  said. She could not be reached Tuesday for comment.  </P></p>

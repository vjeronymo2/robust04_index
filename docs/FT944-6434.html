			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (8): Cash-generating practice - Securities lending / The value of this bolt-on service Of all the services global custodians provide, none causes as much interest as securities lending. This is the business where an efficient custodian can earn enough cash to be able to offer a new client a basic service almost free of charge. 'There is only one bolt-on service which is of value to the provider and that is securities lending,' said John Lee, partner at Lee Schwartz Associates, a consulting firm specialising in custody. 'There is an increasing number of custody contracts tendered for on the basis of 'We will do the custody for free if we get the securities lending bit',' Mr Lee said. However, some custodians are cautioning against linking pricing decisions too closely to securities lending. 'Securities lending does influence pricing decisions,' said Dick Feehan, managing director at Bankers Trust's European global products division. 'But the structure of a portfolio can change overnight,' he warned. It may be reconstituted in a way which offers far less potential for lending than had been thought and the custodian could be underpricing his service. Securities lending offers clients a chance to earn not only a rate of return on the loaned securities, but on the investment of the collateral held against it. Yet, custodians say, even after years of successful stock lending in the US which has enhanced returns and cut operating costs significantly, many UK pension funds remain wary of the practice. Demand for loaned securities - both equity and debt - has been driven by the growing use of derivative instruments by fund managers and securities houses. These encourage investors to take short positions - that is, to sell securities they do not own - and there are times when investors need to borrow stock to fill a short position. Also, international stock lending has been driven by vastly increased interest in emerging and less efficient markets by US and UK investors. Investors willing to lend Spanish securities, for instance, may earn up to 3 per cent of the value of securities loaned reflecting both market inefficiencies and the reluctance of domestic investors to lend in an environment of legal ambiguity about the status of the practice. Inefficient, paper-based markets also offer great potential for lending at high margins. Brokers eager to sell shares to clients find they may not be able to obtain them outright and borrow them from intermediaries to make good delivery. As more investors become willing to lend, margins come down. In Japan, for instance, margins have fallen from three percentage points a few years ago to roughly 0.3 per cent at present. 'Securities lending has become a much bigger part of the business,' said Charles Cassidy, senior vice-president at State Street Bank in charge of financial asset servicing in Europe. State Street has roughly Dollars 200bn in custody accounts which clients have given permission to lend. 'That is a significant increase over the past year when we had about Dollars 30bn in total that clients were willing to lend,' he said. About 25 per cent is out on loan at any one time, he said. The biggest participants are the large public sector pension funds whose knowledge and sophistication are rapidly increasing. However, in the UK clients are far more reluctant. 'We do very little lending in the UK,' he said. Partly, that reluctance might reflect the relatively low returns earned on domestic stock lending. While margins are also low in the US, volumes are so large that investors who do participate earn quite attractive returns. Mark Weeks, marketing director at London Global Securities, an independent stock lending intermediary, notes that in the UK, the disappearance of more than Pounds 440m from pension funds formerly controlled by the late Robert Maxwell had tarnished the image of stock lending and given trustees a justification for avoiding the practice. 'In a relatively risk-free environment, you can make a certain amount of money. So why would you turn it down?' Mr Weeks argues. London Global is one of the few lending intermediaries which acts as principal in stock-borrowing agreements, a status which many pension trustees say gives them greater comfort. If the borrower disappears with the stock, London Global makes good any loss. Moreover, all stock lending - unlike that allegedly carried on by the Maxwell-controlled pension funds - is collateralised. London Global, an unusual outfit in that it unbundles the custody activity from that of stock lending, passes the collateral it receives back to the lender, who is then free to invest it as he sees fit. However, the common practice is for the global custodian to invest the collateral. This is not a totally risk-free activity as Chicago-based Harris Trust found out earlier this year. In the second quarter of 1994, Harris took a Dollars 33m write-off to reflect more than Dollars 51m in losses stemming from a decision to invest held against client loans of securities in volatile collateralised mortgage obligations. While these offer relatively low counterparty risk, they face significant market risk and fell sharply in value when interest rates rose earlier this year. Harris, which says it ranks among the top US-based global custodians, 'made whole' all of its clients which had sustained the losses. Moreover, a spokeswoman said that Harris has revised its internal risk management procedures as a result. Typically, Mr Weeks notes, there are three types of collateral which institutions regard as acceptable. These are cash, letters of credit and Treasury bills. Mr Weeks says because client agreements usually promise an end-client a set rate of return, say 3 per cent, there is an incentive for custodians to try to earn an extra turn for themselves by investing in modestly riskier investments.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SETTLEMENT INDEX* Major markets  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country     Volume (% of      Settling           Benchmark            total trades)     (% on SD)     Q2 94     Q3 94    % change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia           5.79         97.60     95.23     96.30        1.12 Belgium             0.42         84.97     83.99     73.93      -11.98 Canada              8.30         96.34     89.25     96.76        8.41 Denmark             0.63         90.02     89.81     80.58      -10.28 France              0.80         89.69     79.72     84.39        5.86 Germany             0.93         89.96     82.19     89.08        8.38 Italy               0.94         93.29     82.42     90.05        9.26 Japan               6.68         94.36     93.45     95.80        2.51 Netherlands         1.52         87.00     92.45     66.11      -28.49 Spain               0.50         90.80     92.52     83.07      -11.04 Switzerland         0.20         79.54     89.82     56.56      -37.03 UK                 16.46         95.27     91.37     91.94        0.62 US                 19.28         97.10     92.63     97.34        5.08 Eurobonds          37.57         85.26     60.57     66.68       10.08  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * The purpose of the settlement benchmark is to provide a means of comparing the settlement efficiency of different markets and to track the evolution of settlement performance in individual markets over time. The benchmark incorporates the four components which, combined together, reflect the overall cost to market patricipants of failed trades. These include average trade size, local market interest rates, the proportion of trades that fail, and the length of time for which they fail. By converting information back into a base currency, comparisons between markets become possible. The benchmarks are expressed as a score out of a maximum 100. The lower the score the higher the effective operational costs of failed transactions in any given market.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: GSCS Benchmark  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

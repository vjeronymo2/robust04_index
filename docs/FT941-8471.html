			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Gestetner to cut gearing via Pounds 16m placing Gestetner, the distributor of office equipment and photographic supplies, yesterday raised Pounds 16.2m net from a placing of shares aimed at reducing gearing and providing capital for potential small acquisitions. Mr Stephen King, finance director, said the board had decided the group was undercapitalised following a Pounds 65m drop in shareholders funds last year. The cash from the placing of 9.09m new shares at 180p, a 5 per cent discount to Thursday's closing price. will reduce gearing from 66 per cent to 53 per cent. The issue, arranged by James Capel, is underwritten by Schroders. The shares fell 8p to 181p yesterday. Gestetner is emerging from a troubled period. It announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 33.2m for the year to October 1993, reflecting exceptional losses of Pounds 50m to cover restructuring. This represented the attempts of a revamped board of directors - comprising Mr David Thompson, former Rank Xerox chairman, and three directors from Inchcape - to reduce costs and refocus on the core office equipment business. Gestetner said at the time that a main objective for the current year was the reduction of debt, and this could fall more substantially through conversion of outstanding 6.75 per cent convertible loan stock. In May 1993, when Inchcape, the international distribution and marketing group, took a 15 per cent stake in Gestetner from Chiltern, an Australian company, it bought an additional option to purchase its holding of convertible loan stock. Conversion of this stock would increase Inchcape's stake to close to 25 per cent, and would reduce Gestetner's gearing to 30 per cent. Inchcape's effective conversion price is 172p, and most brokers expect it to take up the option, which expires on July 1. Conversion can take place up to September 1999. Mr King said operating conditions remained tough for Gestetner, although sales were in line with expectations. 'We're not planning on market expansion in any areas we operate in,' he said. Brokers expect some further development of Gestetner's distribution network, but no significant investment.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the "Defense Sector" column: </F> "The Impoverished Military Industrial Complex Finds Freedom  Beyond Its Means. Arms Producers Confer With State Company  Rosvooruzheniye Leadership"]    [Text] May's government Resolution 479 granted  manufacturers the right independently to export arms. It would  be quite natural to interpret the liberation of  "military-technical cooperation" as a victory by the military  industrial complex. Those "liberated," however, seem to be of a  different opinion.    Yesterday a conference was held in Moscow between main arms  and military equipment producers and the leadership of the state  company Rosvooruzheniye on "prospects of military-technical  cooperation" under new conditions. Rosvooruzheniye  representatives (Marshal Shaposhnikov, Viktor Samoylov, and  department chiefs) called for unity and partnership in the  common struggle for survival by Russia's defense industry and  its army. The manufacturers related amazingly well to this  appeal.    As of now, arms producers may choose their own  intermediaries  but virtually all "liberated" plant directors and general  designers have spoken in favor of continuing cooperation with  Rosvooruzheniye. Moreover, manufacturers consider Resolution 479  harmful or at best senseless. The fact is that in the past two  years many arms producers have managed to secure a whole number  of individual "preferential" government resolutions and edicts.  Now these firms and research and production associations will  again have to undergo the protracted process of bureaucratic  licensing to obtain the rights they enjoyed in the past.    Besides, on their own, the producers did not sell very many  weapons. Vladimir Kuzmin, general director of the Dementyev  MAPO [possibly Moscow Aviation Production Association] (MiG  aircraft), said that in the past two years MAPO spent $3 million  for advertising and promotion (air shows, and so forth) of MiG  fighter aircraft abroad. Yet in spite of dozens of business  contracts, "not a single serious hard currency contract has so  far been concluded." (The Malaysian contract has been prepared  with the participation of Rosvooruzheniye). MAPO's general  director called on all manufacturers to cooperate with  Rosvooruzheniye, which not only has representative offices and  old business links in many countries but also available  resources for easy credits against contracts signed. The  producers themselves have funds neither for marketing nor making  prepayments to component manufacturers in order to meet contract  terms. Military industrial complex directors are not content  with the conditions set by commercial banks.    What conference participants saw as an artificially inflated  rate of the ruble to the dollar and also rapidly increasing  overheads cripple the effectiveness of arms exports. Export  production of ammunition and spare parts is currently losing  money in all cases, while deductions and taxes imposed by the  Finance Ministry have made arms export -- for instance, to  India, which pays in "clearing" dollars or rupees --  unattractive, and therefore the contracts concluded are not  being honored.    In any event, all military industrial complex "generals" are  at one in that their chief enemy is not Rosvooruzheniye but  state bureaucracy, which hinders the expeditious exporting of  new weapons. The conference criticized most the Finance Ministry  and the Defense Ministry's Export Control Committee.</p>

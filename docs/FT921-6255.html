			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Iscor profits plunge on doubled finance charges ISCOR, South Africa's largest steel producer, saw earnings drop by 43 per cent in the six months to the end of December as finance charges compounded the effect of weak domestic and international markets. Turnover rose by 15.6 per cent to R4.16bn (Dollars 1.45bn) on the back of a 5.3 increase in steel sales to 2.94m tonnes. Although local sales decreased by 7.2 per cent, exports were up by 20.6 per cent and contributed more than half of the total, compared with 45 per cent in the same period in 1990. Income before tax and finance charges declined by 9.6 per cent to R395m, a function of weaker margins, particularly in the saturated international market. The results took a heavy knock, however, from finance charges, which doubled to R218m from R108m in 1990. Mr Willem van Wyk, managing director, said this was the result of a substantial increase in borrowings, necessary to complete important spending projects, on account of lower than expected revenues from iron and steel sales. Attributable earnings dropped by 43 per cent to R171m. Mr van Wyk said finance charges would be lower in future as the capital expenditure programme was nearly complete. Looking ahead for the balance of the financial year, Mr Marius de Waal, chairman, said: 'There are no signs of recovery in the domestic market, and it is expected that surplus capacity worldwide will continue to depress dollar prices of steel for at least the balance of 1992.' He said no improvement in the earnings trend was forecast. Against this background, the dividend was cut by one-third to 3 cents a share on earnings down to 9.2 cents from 16.1 cents per share. Murray and Roberts, the engineering and construction group, lifted attributable earnings by 29 per cent to R96.2m on a turnover of R2.65bn, in the six months to the end of December, up from R2.24bn a year earlier.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nabil al-Wadi and Latif al-Tayyib] </F>   [Text] Interior Ministry inspectors have embarked on an  intensive campaign covering major marketplaces in Baghdad's new  areas: al-Hurriyah, al-Sadriyah, and the Malhani marketplace, as  well as the vegetable marketplaces in al-Hillah, eastern  al-Karradah, al-A'zamiyah, and al-Dawrah. On 28 and 29 May,  AL-JUMHURIYAH noticed relative stability in prices and a rush by  citizens to buy vegetables and fruit, which had seen prices  skyrocket during the blessed 'Id al-Adha holidays. The price  hikes were caused by the greed of shopkeepers and grocers who  insist on maintaining this situation in the market, disregarding  the suffering of citizens, especially low-income citizens.    At the beginning of their campaign, the men of the Economic  Crime Combat Department made sure materials sold at the prices  set by the state's agencies. In some cases, they took charge of  direct selling to the public.    AL-JUMHURIYAH toured the main fruit and vegetable  marketplaces. It noticed a drop in prices in comparison with the  'Id al-Adha prices. In interviews with AL-JUMHURIYAH, citizens  expressed appreciation for this experience, hoping that prices  will continue to drop or at least remain stable. Colonel Diya'  Qaddah 'Abd-al-Ghaffar, chief of the Economic Crime Combat  Department, spoke about the dimensions of the new campaign and  its effective results to stabilize prices. He noted citizens'  satisfaction with this campaign. He said that during the past  two days, inspectors have reported many price violations,  especially of vegetable and fruit prices. He said the fine for  the first price violation has been set at 10,000 dinars. If the  violation is repeated, the fine will be doubled. This is  especially necessary because it has been noted that some vendors  raise prices beyond normal ranges, overburdening low-income  citizens. He told AL-JUMHURIYAH that the department has  controlled the process of selling agricultural crops, obligating  farmers to sell their crops at the marketing offices in  accordance with official prices and under the supervision of  economic crime combat men. He said this move has been effective  in making available plenty of crops and commodities. He said  this has resulted in increasing supply and reducing prices.    He said that this comprehensive campaign at marketplaces  started after many citizens complained about conditions in the  marketplaces and unjustifiable price increases. He said this  campaign will continue "nonstop", to put an end to whoever is  deluded into tampering with the people's subsistence. He said  that during the past two days, inspectors closed 58 vegetable  shops and confiscated their contents. They also seized large  quantities of banned materials, such as imported cigarettes.  Soft drinks factories, he noted, have been uncovered in many  areas of Baghdad, especially in the al-Dawrah area. Samples of  their products have been sent to laboratories to ensure their  fitness for human consumption.    The colonel stressed that the objective of this campaign is  to serve citizens and to end price violations and fraud in the  marketplaces. He said the economic crime combat men have  apprehended a large number of people who had impersonated  economic security men, prompted by their greed to tamper with  citizens' money and property. He said they had been wearing  military uniform with guns on their waists, using vehicles  similar to those used by the economic crime combat men, and  carrying false identification.    The director of the Economic Crime Combat Department  stressed  to AL-JUMHURIYAH that all divisions of the department have been  mobilized to implement the "new plan." The objective of this  plan is to ease citizens' burdens, he noted. He said the coming  days will witness true improvement in the situation, in terms of  commodities availability, prices, and stability. He urged  citizens to cooperate with inspectors by reporting violations  and contacting the complaints section on 8878319 so immediate  deterrent measures can be taken against violators.</p>

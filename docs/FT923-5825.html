			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Bid for Galerias with Mountleigh receiver A BID to acquire Galerias Preciados, the loss-making Spanish department store chain, has been received by Peat Marwick, receiver of Mountleigh, the UK property group which owns Galerias. The bid, understood to be the first firm one to be made for Galerias, has been launched jointly by Parques Urbanos, a company that has been associated with Galerias in the past in the promotion of large shopping centres in Madrid and elsewhere, and by Zara, a profitable textile manufacturer and distributor with more than 200 retail outlets in Spain. Mr Carlos Balabron, chairman of Aserinvest, Madrid consultants advising the bid, said yesterday that the sooner it was accepted the better: 'Galerias cannot remain in its present impasse.' Mr Balabron, who did not disclose details of the offer, said, however, that it was subject to an audit on Galerias, ordered by the receivers, which is being completed by Price Waterhouse. Peat Marwick is interested in a quick sale of Galerias. The chain of 29 large retail stores, with debts of some Pta20bn (Pounds 111m), is expected to post substantial operating losses this year. It is estimated to represent as much as 50 per cent of Mountleigh's assets. Mountleigh went into receivership in May with debts of Pounds 590m after it proved unable to meet obligations to bond holders. Its problems were blamed on difficulties in selling UK property. Mountleigh's creditors were told last week not to expect a swift realisation of assets. The receiver said it was impossible to estimate how much the assets would fetch, because the affairs of companies in the group were closely interlinked. Unsecured creditors had little hope of payment.</p>

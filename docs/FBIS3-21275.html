This is a sign to  which investors attach great expectations, hoping that it will  lead the market out of the stagnation it has been experiencing  for several months.    AL-MAJALLAH has become certain that a number of transactions  were concluded in recent weeks as a result of a 5-10 percent  drop in land prices and a 20-25 percent drop in apartment  prices, whereas investment real estate has maintained its high  levels.    Arab and foreign firms owned by Jordanians led the market  activity in a step which has been characterized by observers as  being within the framework of preparation for the post-peace  era, which has entered the countdown phase.    High-level economic sources expect great growth in the  Jordanian building and construction sector in the foreseeable  future. They expect this sector's contribution to the domestic  product to exceed the figures recorded in 1992, amounting to 99  percent [as published], and to the added value, amounting to 164  million dinars [JD] ($237.8 million). This sector is  characterized by the fact that it is interlocked with the other  sectors. Nearly 15 percent of the gross domestic product is  attributed to this sector.    This real estate market activity coincides with the imminent  implementation of the Jordanian five-year plan projects. This  plan's investment program abounds with a large number of  infrastructure construction projects. Construction sector  experts assert that the volume of credit facilities provided by  Jordanian banking apparatus units from the beginning of the year  to the end of last August amounted to JD572 million, amounting  to 21 percent and ranking second behind the commercial sector.    Engineer Muhammad Ibrahim, a Jordanian real estate officer,  believes that the banks' demands of real estate investors  compelled the latter to reduce their prices in order to fulfill  their bank obligations. The market responded promptly to this  reduction, which amounted to nearly 20 percent in some cases,  thus devouring investors' profits.    Engineer Ibrahim expects that the building and construction  sector's performance will improve with the inauguration of the  economic activities of the Palestinian-Israeli accord, which  will extend to the other sectors because of the link between the  Palestinian and Jordanian economies.    Engineer Muhammad Khayr Zayd al-Kaylani, a real estate  investor and chairman of the Housing Real Estate Investors  Association, does not agree with Engineer Ibrahim regarding the  reduced prices' impact on the market. But al-Kaylani did agree  that the market has been experiencing severe stagnation since  last September because of political reasons, coupled with lack  of clarity in the Jordanian economy's future trends and the  state of anticipation and caution prevailing in the various  sectors of the Jordanian economy.    Al-Kaylani agrees that the market suffers from a surplus in  housing apartments, noting that this surplus started to  accumulate in the second half of this year. He added that 2.7  million square meters were licensed in 1990. The figure rose to  4.37 million square meters in 1991 and 6.5 millions square  meters in 1992 as a result of the leap in demand for housing and  land in wake of the return of 350,000 expatriates from Kuwait.  Al-Kaylani added that the picture has changed this year, with  the licensed area amounting in the first half of this year to  1.65 square million meters. The figure is expected to amount to  3 million square meters by the end of the year.    Fawwaz Mahmud, the head of a business group, denied that  there is a big surplus in housing apartments in the Jordanian  real estate market. He asserted that the international apartment  vacancy rate ranges from 7-10 percent to meet demand for  relocation, seasonal tourism, citizens' needs to change their  housing, and other reasons. Mahmud expects apartment prices to  hold up, supporting his opinion with the statement that most of  the building and construction industry raw material is imported  from abroad and not subject to local market activity. He added  that selling apartments at reduced prices means saddling real  estate investors with losses.    On his part, Isma'il 'Amr, director of the Amman  International Real Estate Firm, expects the real estate market  to move later, perhaps in 1995, because the market has  experienced unprecedented construction activity and real estate  investments amounted to JD1.5 billion ($2.2 billion). He added  that this activity was not planned activity and that the fifth  private sector took the initiative in this activity. Excess  local liquidity, large and unstable demand for housing real  estate, and limited investment opportunities in the Jordanian  market added momentum to the construction activity.    In the past 30 years the real estate market has experienced  fluctuations, strangulations, and demand periods, spurred mainly  by compulsory evacuations, political events witnessed by the  region since 1967, the Lebanese war and the Kuwait war of  liberation, and finally, the peace process and the Gaza-Jericho  accord and the results they are expected to produce.</p>

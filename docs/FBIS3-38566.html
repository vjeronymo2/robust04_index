			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Left-Wing Pole Emerges United With </F> Programme Ready"]    [Text] Rome, 1 Feb (ANSA) -- Italy's left wing will fight  the March 27 general elections on a united footing, after giving  wholehearted support to a programme document approved in a  meeting here Tuesday [1 February]. "This is a great day for the  progressives," said Achille Occhetto, secretary of the Left  Democrat Party. "We have put together a glorious fighting  machine."    Present for today's talks were representatives from the Left  Democrat Party, the Rete, the Greens, Communist Renewal, the  Socialist Party, Socialist Renewal, the Social Christians and  Democratic Alliance.    The document approved today "does not solve all problems  pertaining to government, but it is one on which we can  construct a hypothesis for government," a clearly elated  Occhetto told the press. According to the document, the united  left will field just one joint candidate in each constituency  under a banner specially created for the alliance, "while at the  same time maintaining the values of our autonomous cultural and  political inspirations."    The process of selecting candidates will begin tomorrow, but  criteria for the choice was already being drawn up Tuesday  evening. Each party involved in the pact will present a  selection of possibilities from which the alliance candidates  will be drawn.    "The progressive, reformist democratic forces, drawn from  socialist, Catholic, lay and environmental backgrounds...wish to  give a precise, realistic, constructive response to the problems  raised by the bankruptcy of the old order and the ancien  regime," the programme document said. At the basis of the  wide-ranging alliance, which stretches from centrist Socialists  and Democratic Alliance to the far-left Communist Renewal, is a  desire to "restore a foundation of ethical values to politics."    Fears that differences between the far left and centre would  prove irreconcilable were proved wrong, with carefully-worded  solutions found even for such sticking points as privatisation:  "to restore dynamism to the economy, to combat parasitism and  state hand-outs, we must shore up the public sector but also,  when the case arises, encourage privatisation on the basis of  rigorous analysis to evaluate when this would be of use to  society, and not only on merely accounting bases."    The compromises found placated Communist Renewal chief  Fausto  Bertinotti who said "the hypothesis of two separate negotiating  tables, one for an electoral accord and another one on politics  and government policy, has collapsed. We are heading for  elections with an exhaustive document, although this does not  mean that it cannot be widened."    Pledges in the left-wing alliance document include one to  "regenerate democratic institutions," and, in the economic  field, to "open up new paths for development, while guaranteeing  an improvement in public finances, an increase in employment,  and protection for our cultural and environmental heritage."  Tax fairness was promised, as were shorter working hours and an  end to an "individual consumist model" and to concentration of  power in central government.    The progressive alliance made no bones about the "austerity  implied" by its programme promises, but pledged to make sure  that the weakest did not bear the brunt of this temporary  hardship. On a foreign policy note, the document stated the  alliance's commitment to "peace and the formation of a new world  order based on democratic rules and human rights." The  progressives came down in favour of a strong European Union and  of "a society of democracy, hard work, solidarity and tolerance."    The document failed to state clearly the alliance's position  on the direct election of the prime minister, a topic dear to  the hearts of the left-wing intellectuals grouped under the  Democratic Alliance banner.    During the press conference to present the progressives'  document, Occhetto claimed that the issue had be "made  ridiculous" by electoral reform champion [Pact for Italy leader]  Mario Segni "who woke up one fine morning and ran here there and  everywhere saying 'I want to be premier'. This is no way to  carry on." The left must now "make this a serious subject once  again," said Occhetto, adding that a white paper on the election  of a premier will be presented at the beginning of the next  legislature.    As a satisfied Occhetto briefed the press on the agreement  reached, leading lights in other political parties involved were  also sounding positive about the outcome of today's talks. "We  would never say we agreed with something if we did not," said  Ferdinando Adornato of Democratic Alliance, while the Rete's  leader Leoluca Orlando stated "this is an electoral agreement  which can become a government agreement, once it has been  through the essential checks by economic and social groups,  associations, the voluntary sector and private enterprise." La  Rete has announced that it will field candidates under its own  banner, and not jointly with the left-wing alliance, for the 25  percent of parliamentary seats to be assigned with a  proportional representation system. The remaining 75 percent  will be handed out on a first-past-the-post basis.    Carlo Ripa di Meana said that his Green Party had given  "unconditional support" to the left-wing programme, and said  that vetoes placed by his environmental line-up on topics such  as a high-speed train network for Italy had been accepted by the  others around the progressive negotiating table.</p>

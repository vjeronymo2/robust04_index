			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MALL BUILDER PAYS DEPOSIT OF $1 MILLION TO BURBANK  </P> <P> The Burbank City Council, acting as the city's Redevelopment Agency, has  formally agreed to negotiate exclusively with developer Alexander Haagen to  build a downtown shopping mall that could cost as much as $200 million.  </P> <P> As part of the agreement, Haagen, a major developer of malls in Southern  California, paid a "good-faith" deposit of $1 million to the city. The deposit  will be applied toward the purchase price or lease payment for the proposed  shopping center site.  </P> <P> Haagen is also giving the city an additional $500,000 to pay the city's costs  in negotiating an agreement and preparing environmental studies on the project.  </P> <P> The agreement, announced Tuesday, marks the latest step in Burbank's plan to  have a major shopping mall within the city limits. The city has tried  unsuccessfully to develop a mall on 41 acres near the Civic Center, but  projects proposed by several developers have fallen through.  </P> <P> Haagen has proposed building the Burbank Gateway Center, a 1.4  million-square-foot project to include a two-level mall, offices, hotels and  restaurants. The shopping center will be anchored by the Ikea furniture store,  as well as Buffums, Mervyn's and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. department stores.  The site is at Magnolia and Burbank boulevards near the Golden State Freeway.  </P> <P> Community Development officials said the city will negotiate details of the  proposal, including how much the project will cost, in the next 30 to 90 days.  </P> <P> If the council approves the concept and details, an environmental review of the  project will be conducted. After that, a final plan would be brought before the  council.  </P></p>

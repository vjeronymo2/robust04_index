			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Despite the fact that Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad  Sifi came to power over one month ago, there has been no effort  made toward establishing comprehensive discussions. Instead,  government officials repeat their promises and sometimes pledge  new ones.    In his latest speech, the Algerian prime minister promised  to  hold parliamentary elections soon, but said this depends on the  outcome of talks among the country's political forces. Sifi  also emphasized that all factions respecting the Constitution  and the law can participate in the talks.    But it seems that such statements are somewhat in  contradiction to government practices, and that the new Algerian  Government insists on repeating the mistakes of its predecessors.    What could be the meaning of talks and a pretense of  reconciliation whene leaders of the most important political  organization are in prison, and while the government does not  even recognized them?    In the opinion of most political observers, the current  Algerian statesmen are trying to play for time because they  realize that they can not have the upper hand in any dialogue,  and to achieve supremacy it is necessary to guarantee the  support of other parties other than the Islamic Salvation Front  [FIS]. In other words, a coalition should be formed against the  Front, and public opinion should become skeptical of the nature,  operation and aims of the Front in order to reduce its popular  support. Political experts thus see yesterday's demonstrations  in Algeria within this context.    Thousands of people participated in a peaceful march and  called for an end to violence and the continuation of talks.    According to news agency reports, parties close to the  government had organized the demonstrations, with the support of  the police. Political experts say that the move was designed to  agitate public opinion against FIS and to measure popular  tendencies, but it was cooly received and was countereffective.    Meanwhile, it was announced in Algeria that two French  citizens were killed after being targeted by armed men. France  is the main foreign supporter of Algeria's military government,  and last year, Islamic combatants warned that -- in order to end  western governments' support -- western citizens would be  targeted and that they they must leave Algeria before the end of  the year.    But attacks against foreigners came to an end following  promises of talks with Islamists. It now seems, however, that  FIS leaders prefer not to put hope in the empty official  promises, which only gives more time to the ruling military to  uproot Muslim combatants and destroy their organization, and  thus attain obtain its own interests in the political arena.</p>

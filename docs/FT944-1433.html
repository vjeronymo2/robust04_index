			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Standard Life expands health side Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, is to inject a further Pounds 10m into Prime Health, its health insurance subsidiary, to help its expansion in the intermediary market. The move is expected to be announced later this week. While the sum is small in terms of Standard Life, it represents two thirds of Prime Health's existing working capital of about Pounds 15m. At the same time, Standard is said to have revised slightly downwards the new business figures it set for Prime. It is thought to have set the target to rise from about Pounds 15m this year to about Pounds 20m next year, but this has now been shaded back to nearer Pounds 18m. Even though there is no doubt that Standard is right behind the health insurer, some large intermediaries are said to have wanted to see more capital in the subsidiary itself before being prepared to do business with it. Standard announced in June that it was buying Prime from Municipal Mutual, the local authority-owned insurance company, for an undisclosed amount. Last year, Prime's gross premium income was Pounds 54m  - making it the fifth largest health insurer in the UK. Its policies cover about 50,000 people. However, it suffered a slight hiccup last month with the departure of one of its two regional sales mana-gers. The acquisition was Standard's first move outside life and pensions policies. Though the scale of the venture is small at present, health insurance is expected to be a fast-growing part of the market. Next year, Standard faces both the loss of its relationship with Halifax Building Society, in which the UK's largest mortgage lender sold only Standard Life financial services, and increasing competition for sales through independent financial advisers.</p>

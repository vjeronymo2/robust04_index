			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: The O'Higgins road to riches / Testing an intriguing investment theory PRIVATE investors are constantly being told that they should buy shares, and now that the Conservatives have been re-elected they may be tempted to plunge into the stock market. But which shares should they buy? A US fund manager has recently outlined a stock-picking theory which is beguilingly simple, appears to be remarkably profitable, and also seems to work in the UK. The theory, which appears in a US book* by money manager Michael O'Higgins, is designed to be easy for private investors to use. All you need is the share price pages of a newspaper, some patience, and an initial slug of capital. Between 1973 and 1991, a portfolio chosen by the O'Higgins method produced annual average returns of 19.4 per cent, compared with 10.4 per cent from the Dow Jones Industrial Index. So what is this apparently miraculous theory? All it involves is the 30 blue chip stocks that make up the Dow Jones Index. The constituents change only rarely; 12 remain from the original 1928 list. O'Higgins suggests writing down the Dow stocks and checking, via a newspaper, the share prices and dividend yields. The first step is to circle the 10 shares with the highest yields. The next step is to tick off the five circled stocks with the lowest share prices. Those five shares form the portfolio for the year. After one year, the whole exercise can be repeated. O'Higgins says you must be ruthless and sell stocks which no longer appear in the top five. If one of the selected stocks drops out of the index, it should be retained till the end of that year; but cannot qualify as one of the five stocks in subsequent years. Now, the wise man is suspicious of such 'wonder theories'. On O'Higgins' figures, the strategy has not worked every year; only after a number of years do the advantages begin to tell. But why should it work at all? In essence, it is just a variation on the age old tactic of 'value investing'. The yield of a share is merely the dividend expressed as a percentage of a share price. If share prices fall while dividends are constant, the yield will rise. So a high yielding stock with a low price is almost certainly one which has seen a share price decline. One type of 'value investing' is to choose such stocks on the grounds that the decline has been overdone. This tactic is far from infallible. Of our four test portfolios started last July (see page IV), the high yield selection has done the worst. High yield comes at a price: high risk. In normal markets, if a share yields over 10 per cent, the chances are that many investors do not expect the dividend to be maintained, or paid at all; and some may fear that the company will go bust. The O'Higgins method, by concentrating on only the 30 blue chip Dow Jones stocks, much reduces the risk of disasters. These are stocks with a long, relatively stable, history. Impressed by the simplicity of this theory, I decided to test it in the UK. The London market has a ready equivalent to the Dow Jones Industrial - the FT 30 Ordinary Index, first compiled in 1935. This index also consists of leading blue chip companies, although some of the original components, such as Fine Spinners and Doublers, have disappeared. To make the exercise fair, I decided to make some adjustments. The geometric method for calculating the FT 30 Index makes it a poor measure of investment performance over a long period (it understates growth). So I decided to use the FT All-Share Index, acknowledged to be a tough measure to beat, as the benchmark. O'Higgins also does not allow, in his calculations, for commissions, or taxes. I deducted 5 per cent a year for dealing costs from the returns achieved by the selected portfolio (no costs were taken from All-Share returns). On taxes, I did not deduct CGT but I did use the net, rather than gross, dividend yield. The calculations were made by the simple method of looking up the share prices and yields in the first edition of the FT each year. Following the example of O'Higgins, I calculated the returns by adding the dividends for the year to the capital gain or loss, and expressing the result as a percentage of the original price. So, if BT had been bought for 100p, paid 5p in net dividends for the year, and was sold after one year for 110p, the total return, before costs, would be 15 per cent. The return for the All-Share was calculated by adding the yield on the All-Share at the end of the year to the percentage rise or fall in the index over the year. So if the index rose from 200 to 210 over the year, and the net yield at the end was 5 per cent, the return would be 10 per cent. It also seemed sensible to limit the test to the years since 1979. This is long enough to test the theory but only covers Conservative administrations. After following these conditions, the table and the graph show the results. The 'fiver' portfolio of the high yield, low price FT 30 stocks lagged behind initially, but pulled ahead in 1983 and has stayed ahead ever since. A sum of Pounds 10,000 in 1979 would have grown, after all dividends had been reinvested, into more than Pounds 130,000 by the start of 1992 (an annual return of just under 22 per cent). The same sum invested in the All-Share would have grown to around Pounds 81,540 (an annual return of around 17.5 per cent) . Just in case dividend reinvestment is impractical, I also worked out the returns on a capital growth basis alone. The result is much closer (Pounds 68,151 versus Pounds 53,914) but the 'fiver' portfolio is still ahead. What stocks has this method chosen? In 1981, the five selections would have been old names such as John Brown, Dunlop, UDS, London Brick and Allied Breweries. For 1991, the method picked out British Airways, GEC, Hanson, NatWest Bank and GKN. Is the theory foolproof? Of course not. Just because it has worked to date is no guarantee that it will work in future. It is often the case that as soon as a pricing anomaly is discovered, and investors try to exploit it, it disappears. A FT 30 stock might collapse entirely (it happened to British Leyland); the stock market might have changed fundamentally after Britain's entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism. One should be particularly wary of assuming that the nominal returns achieved between 1979 and 1991 can be repeated. That seems highly unlikely, although real (after inflation) returns may still be healthy. The system is aiming to beat the All-Share rather than to produce any particular level of absolute return. But as in 1990, one can beat the All-Share and still lose money. On average, one is required to sell three stocks each year. If more stocks are needed to be sold, or if the portfolio is lower than the suggested size of Pounds 10,000, costs may be higher than I have estimated. In addition, you can see from the table that the system has outperformed the All-Share in eight years, and underperformed in five. The next two or three years may be underperformers. Private investors will also be aware that broader diversification than just five stocks is generally agreed to be the best strategy. In summary, anyone tempted to try this system should be both patient and alert to the dangers. Having said that, which stocks would the system select now? The FT 30 currently consists of: Allied Lyons, Asda, BICC, BOC, BTR, Blue Circle, Boots, British Airways, British Gas, BP, BT, Cadbury Schweppes, Courtaulds, Forte, GEC, Glaxo, Grand Met, GKN, Guinness, Hanson, ICI, Lucas, Marks &amp; Spencer, NatWest, P&amp;O, Reuters, Royal Insurance, Smithkline Beecham, Tate &amp; Lyle, and Thorn EMI. Using Friday's FT, the ten constituents with the highest yields were: Asda (8.9), BP (8.7), BICC (7.9), P&amp;O (7.5), Royal Insurance (7.5), Lucas (7.3), NatWest (7.3), GKN (7.0), British Gas (6.7) and Hanson (6.2). The five of those with the lowest share prices were: Asda (31.5), Lucas (128), Royal Insurance (201), Hanson (235.5) and BP (257). There would be high risks attached to such a portfolio. Both Asda and Royal Insurance passed their final dividends recently, and the yields shown relate solely to the previous interims. This is not a selection for the cautious. *Beating the Dow, by Michael O'Higgins with John Downes, HarperCollins Publishers, 10 East 53rd Street, New York, NY 10022, US.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          YEARLY PERFORMANCE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Year     'Fiver portfolio'                 All-Share               Total          Accumulated     Total    Accumulated             return (%)*     sum (Pounds)  return (%)  sum (Pounds) 1979         -1.9              9,810         8.7        10,870 1980         25.8             12,341        31.8        14,327 1981          2.4             12,637        11.2        15,931 1982         40.9             17,806        25.8        20,042 1983         52.3             27,118        26.4        25,332 1984         33.3             36,149        29.2        32,730 1985         44.1             52,090        18.3        38,719 1986         19.0             61,987        25.3        48,515 1987         11.6             69,178         7.4        52,105 1988         23.6             85,504         9.5        57,055 1989         41.4            120,902        34.6        76,796 1990         -8.8            110,263       -10.7        68,579 1991         18.3            130,441        18.9        81,540  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Assuming initial Pounds 10,000 investment.*  After basic rate tax on dividends and 5 per cent reduction for costs.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

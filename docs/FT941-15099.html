			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: AGF appoints banker to board Assurances Generales de France (AGF) has appointed Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani to its board of directors. This is seen as paving the way for his likely appointment on Wednesday by the government to the presidency of the state-controlled insurance group. The 57-year-old banker, who heads Banque Indosuez, had already been widely tipped to succeed Mr Michel Albert, who, after more than a decade as the president of the insurance group, was earlier this month named to the new, independent monetary policy committee set up to advise the Bank of France.</p>

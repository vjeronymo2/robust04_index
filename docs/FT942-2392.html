			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Tax-collection record slammed Labour yesterday attacked the government's 'scandalous' tax-collection record, saying 10 times more tax was being written off today than when the Tories came to power. Releasing figures indicating that the amount of tax written off last year was a record Pounds 1.5bn, Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief Treasury secretary, said this was more than would be raised by increasing the rate of value added tax on domestic fuel from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent. She said the sum was also equivalent to nearly half the government's employment and training budget. The Inland Revenue said last month that more than three-quarters of the amount of tax written off was the product of insolvencies during recession.</p>

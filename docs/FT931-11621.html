			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / ITC will consider separate city TV THE Independent Television Commission will examine the possibility of starting a series of city television channels on Channel 5 now that plans for a national network have been rejected. The study will be part of an ITC assessment on what to do about Channel 5 after the rejection of the only application to run the national network. It came from Channel 5 Holdings, a venture backed by Thames Television and Time Warner. The original plan drawn up with the Department of Trade and Industry was to use 33 transmitters, allowing 74 per cent of the population to receive the channel. The winner of the franchise would have had to pay for the re-tuning of millions of video recorders. The ITC will examine using different frequencies, removing the need for most re-tuning. The frequencies are those once considered for a sixth national channel, which was rejected because it would have reached no more than 40 per cent of the population. The ITC will study whether these frequencies could provide more scope for city stations. The 1990 Broadcasting Act would have to be amended to allow separate licences for city-based services on Channel 5 rather than a single national licence. The ITC is expected to spend several months on a technical review and publish a consultative document on future options for Channel 5 later this year. Thames was last night considering the ITC statement. The company has not yet ruled out seeking a judicial review of the rejection of the Channel 5 bid.</p>

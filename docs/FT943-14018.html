			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI says no demerger yet Shares in Thorn EMI fell by 9p to 1065p yesterday as Sir Colin Southgate, the chairman, dismissed reports that the music and rentals group was about to be demerged. Sir Colin told the group's annual meeting that the current group structure was a positive advantage and added significant value. Speculation that a demerger announcement was close had helped lift Thorn's shares from 1039p on Monday morning to 1074p on Thursday. Sir Colin suggested that the board would not return to the demerger question for another year. He said: 'As a board, we review the group strategy once a year. I am able to tell you that at our recent strategy review - held over the past two days - the board did analyse, in great detail, the strategic options for the business. The immediate challenge is to capitalise on the excellent prospects which now exist for our businesses.' The speculation that Thorn would be split into two companies - one centred on music and one on rentals - arose because the group appeared close to completing its disposals programme. Sir Colin has said in the past that the time to discuss demerger would be when Thorn had sold the businesses it no longer wanted. He said yesterday that the group raised Pounds 192.3m last year from divestments of non-strategic businesses, including Thorn Lighting and its majority interest in Thames Television. Discussions on the sale of the remaining businesses in Thorn Electronics were continuing. Sir Colin said that once buyers had been found for these, the group's divestment programme would be complete. The chairman also said that Thorn had signed a letter of intent to increase its holding in Toshiba-EMI, its joint music venture in Japan. Under the agreement, Thorn's stake in the venture would rise from 50 to 55 per cent.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hardys &amp; Hansons rises by 10% to Pounds 3.66m Hardys &amp; Hansons, the Nottingham-based independent brewer, yesterday reported a 10 per cent increase in interim profits. On turnover marginally ahead to Pounds 15.6m, trading profits advanced to Pounds 3.35m (Pounds 2.94m); after reduced net interest receivable of Pounds 292,000 (Pounds 338,000) the pre-tax line for the half year to April 1 amounted to Pounds 3.66m, up from Pounds 3.32m last time. Mr Richard Hanson, chairman and managing director, attributed the 'very satisfactory' improvement to the contribution from new or recently modernised houses. The outcome was also aided, he added, by an early Easter with sales in the run-up to the holiday falling in the first half. The interim dividend is raised 13 per cent, from 3p to 3.4p, payable from earnings of 9.827p per share, compared with 8.975p.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Travel: Six-legged friends in Provence - Nicholas Haslam watches a tragic mating ceremony in the Vaucluse WE MADE AN unlikely group, gathered on a limestone outcrop high in Provence: an insurance broker, a management consultant, a retired horticultural teacher, a nurse and an executive from a large frozen food company. But then, in addition to the Barbour jackets and sensibly dubbined walking boots, we did have one abiding interest in common. We were all curious about natural history and had signed up for a week's exploration of the vast array of natural habitats in the hills of the Vaucluse. Our guide, Richard Vulliamy, was a Cornish expatriate who had moved to the region a few years before. Looking more like a Methodist lay preacher who should be striding rain-sodden moors to deliver fiery sermons in dank chapels, his enthusiasm for his chosen land knew no bounds. As we stood gasping after a long climb over steep limestone cliffs, he pointed out the extraordinary wealth of habitats that we would be exploring over the coming week. Before us lay the high summit of Mount Ventoux, dusted by an uncharacteristically early fall of snow. In the valleys below we could dimly hear the shouts of shirt-sleeved workers, toiling in the serried vineyards, getting in the grapes for the harvest of Cotes du Rhone. 'At one glance', he said, you can see the entire range of habitats in Europe, from the Arctic through to the Mediterranean'. Over the next week we left no stone unturned as we pried into the secrets of the natural history of the area. With binoculars and magnifying glasses poised, we checked deep rocky crannies and scanned the high hill tops. With so much to see, each day's walk was given over to a different theme or species. On the second day, for example, insects were our main target. In autumn, the hillsides were alive with shameless fecundity as hordes of six-legged creatures had a last fling before the frosts. Equally shamelessly, we gathered around a pair of mating mantises, and watched the smaller male meet his end in flagrante delicto: the female started eating him before he was halfway. 'They are,' said Richard, 'totally indiscriminate in their prey. If anything passes in front of their eyes that looks remotely edible, then it gets eaten.' Day three found us clambering up a steep gorge alongside a clear running river. In the heat of summer the Ouveze, on its way to join the Rhone, is a popular spot for campers and tourists. Now, in autumn, the camps were deserted, the river banks uncluttered. We were on the look out for Castor fiber, more commonly known as the European beaver. I had thought the beaver long extinct in Europe, but pockets still survive in France and in fact are being reintroduced 'They are very shy animals,' hissed Richard as we crept through willow thickets in hope of glimpsing the creature, or hearing the hard crack of its tail on water. We saw no animal, unfortunately, but found plenty of traces of their activities. In one clearing by the river the willows had been felled systematically, and a large poplar lay forlornly on its side, surrounded by fresh chippings and with the trunk grooved by the beaver's enormous incisors. Janet, a former nurse, came across some bones in the path by the river. She paled, and held them to Richard for close examination. 'The only bones I've seen like this before,' she said, 'came from a human hand.' There was a general intake of breath, clearly audible over the sound of the river. Richard gave them a cursory glance. 'The hind leg of a beaver,' he ruled. We breathed again, but Janet carefully buried the bones and did not look too convinced. In the evenings, we returned to a gite d'etape, a converted farmhouse owned by a Provencal chef. As dusk fell over the mountains behind us, we sat in the courtyard sipping pastis and poring over insect and plant books, discussing and identifying the puzzles of the day. Around us, other walkers looked on in amazement as heated discussions about the genus of a particular plant filled the air, with complex Latin names bandied about with alarming fluency. One French walker tipped me a wink and then stage-whispered to his companion: 'Mais vraiment ils sont fous, ces anglais'. Unwittingly, the following day, we trespassed onto another French preserve. The autumn woods of Provence provide a much-prized addition to the French table, edible fungi, and the whereabouts of the yellow trumpet-shaped chanterelle, a mushroom that commands a high price in local markets, are a closely guarded secret. We were looking for another species altogether when we found a rich crop of chanterelles spread across the floor of a copse. We picked a few for the evening meal, and then walked on, passing not far away an old French farmer who looked with dismay at the plastic bags we carried, and who strode past with a surly 'bonsoir.' Looking back, we saw him fall upon the mushrooms; when we passed him again later in the afternoon, his rucksack bulged. Perhaps the week's high spot was our visit to the Camargue. Only 60 miles south of our base, the Camargue offers a vast number of lagoons and marshes in the delta of the Rhone. At that time of year the sky was alive with Africa-bound birds. In just a few hours we spotted more species than I had ever seen in years of casual bird watching in Britain. From the privacy of a hide we saw kingfishers swoop down and egrets and herons patrol the water's edge. Flamingoes in their hundreds sifted through the muddy waters further out in the lagoons, and long skeins of geese circled after their long flight from the north. A certain sadness hung over us all. Unlike the birds, we could not give way to instinct. That evening we would be leaving the hills of Provence and heading north, to grey England and its winter. Nicholas Haslam travelled to Marseilles c/o British Airways. Fares start at Pounds 177 return. His week was organised by Provencal Field Study Holidays of 2 Rose Cottage, Luckett, Nr Callington, Cornwall (tel: 0579-370411), which organises tours in May, June, September, October and November. Cost, including accommodation, full board and rail transport from Victoria to Avignon, starts at Pounds 430, with an optional surcharge for air travel.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Dr Pepper 'poison pill' suit A SHAREHOLDER of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up has filed a suit against the company and its directors in Delaware Chancery Court alleging they have breached their fiduciary duties by thwarting a possible bid for the company's shares, Reuter reports. Dr Pepper recently adopted a 'poison pill' defence against a possible hostile takeover attempt by Cadbury Schweppes, the UK confectionery and soft drinks group. In August, Cadbury said it was buying a 20.2 per cent stake in Dr Pepper. It has not ruled out a bid sometime in the future. Dr Pepper said its board adopted a shareholder rights plan aimed at assuring holders are treated fairly should a takeover become imminent. The company said the plan was not intended to prevent a takeover on terms beneficial to shareholders. The Delaware suit was filed last Friday and made public yesterday. It asked the court for a preliminary injunction as soon as possible.</p>

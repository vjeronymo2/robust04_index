			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Cuba's presence at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit  in Cartagena de Indias was closely linked with its interest in  adopting specific actions in favor of regional integration. That  is why it supported previous presidential summits and the one  that recently concluded in Colombia. Everything that sponsors  trade -- investments, exchanges, technical aid, and scientific  and technical cooperation in this hemisphere -- has been firmly  supported by this blockaded island. In fact, the Cuban position  goes so far as to support the so-called second generation  economic reforms proposed by the United States for this region,  provided the summit unilaterally organized for December in Miami  does not become a forum to set guidelines for Latin America and  to isolate Cuba.    Making progress within the integration plans is still part  of  the Cuban position, even when results achieved in this respect  at three previous summits have somehow failed to fulfill the  hopes for an effective, specific consensus. Even though Latin  American countries have participated in the integrationist  efforts exerted for many years, they admit they have yet to  eliminate the obstacles that must preclude an integration in the  economic, trade, and investment sectors despite a more favorable  international situation. This is proved by the underhanded  economic pressure frequently exerted by the United States on  nations in this geographic area.    The presidents' reflections on the economic, trade, and  financial blockade against Cuba were not directly expressed in  their speeches to the fourth summit's plenary session, nor were  they included in the lengthy text of the final declaration.  Paradoxically, the most important international organization,  the UN General Assembly, approved resolutions that condemn the  blockade that the United States maintains against our country,  yet the summit of statesmen and rulers in this hemisphere  briefly alludes to the unjustifiable measure without even  calling it by its name.</p>

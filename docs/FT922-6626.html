			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / More charities submit accounts A TOTAL of 46 per cent of Britain's registered charities submitted accounts to the Charity Commission last year in response to its drive to improve administration of the sector. This compares with only 11 per cent in 1989. Under the new Charities Act, financial controls will be strengthened and the commission believes a target of obtaining accounts from 80 per cent to 90 per cent of charities can be achieved by 1994. The commission concluded 397 inquiries into charities last year as a result of public complaints and its own monitoring, and irregularities were discovered in 129 cases.</p>

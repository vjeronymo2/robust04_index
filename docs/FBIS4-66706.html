			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anand K. Sahay: "India, Iran Agree on Human </F> Rights"]    [Text] Tehran, March 5. In an hour-long meeting between the  External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, and the Iranian  Foreign Minister, Mr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati, India and Iran today  agreed that human rights should not be used as a political ploy  against countries.    In a separate development, the Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr.  Qian Qichen, who is also currently here noted that his country  believed that issues such as human rights should not be used as  a weapon to exert pressure on countries because, every country  was ruled according to its own social and religious systems.    The identity of views thus emanating from three foreign  ministers of leading Asian states appears to indicate growing  political conversions on critical political issues in the  international context.    The Indian and Iranian foreign ministers also agreed today  that India and Pakistan should sort out their problem in Kashmir  through bilateral negotiations.    These developments have led to interesting speculations here  whether Iran would not abstain on the Pakistani resolution in  Geneva, and go a step further and  canvass...............[sentence as published]    Setting out the perspective for his two-day visit to Iran,  the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, told THE HINDU  before landing at the Mehrabad airport here that "India, Iran,  China, the Gulf and ASEAN could form a tremendous basis for  Asian cooperation."    While Mr. Singh is here for the seventh meeting of the  Indo-Iran Joint Commission at the Ministerial level which would  focus on enhancing economic and commercial ties to a prominent  new level, it is difficult to miss the warm political  undercurrents with which the External Affairs Minister's visit  is awash.    The Indian and the Chinese Foreign Ministers are slated to  discuss substantive bilateral and regional issues tomorrow.    This would only be their second one-to-one interaction, the  last being at the session of the U.N. General Assembly in New  York.    Mr. Singh is expected to suggest to his Chinese counterpart  that the process of establishing peace and tranquillity on the  line of Actual Control (LAC) between the two countries be  speeded up with a view to relatively early realisation, rather  than be allowed to languish like the earlier boundary talks.    On Kashmir, India could tell the Chinese dignitary that so  far human rights had been a tool employed by the West for  political purposes against developing countries. It was ironical  that Pakistan should seek to exploit the same route at Geneva  against India.    The Chinese anxiety naturally centres on Tibet, and Mr. Qian  could take the opportunity of his meeting with Mr. Singh to  convey his worries over an international conference of  Parliamentarians on Tibet in the Indian capital later this  month. It is expected that the External Affairs Minister would  inform the Chinese dignitary that the Government of India had no  role in the proposed conference.    Contrary to earlier belief, Mr. Singh would deliver a letter  from the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao to the Iranian  President, Mr. Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, whom he calls on  tomorrow.    Mr. Rao is understood to have invited the Iranian President  for an official visit. His letter may be expected to adhere to  protocol norms of wishing more fulsome bilateral ties.    Mr. Singh told this correspondent that "There is tremendous  possibility of close economic cooperation between Iran and  India, and this could enhance prosperity in the whole region."    After a lull, India and Iran picked up the threads of their  relations once again with a visit to India in March, 1992 by the  Iran Foreign Minister.    This was at Mr. Velayati's own initiative.    Since then the pace of strengthening ties has been very  quick. Mr. Velayati had urged taking bilateral relations to a  higher level, and also cooperation with India at the Nonaligned  Forum, clearly in view of the pressures brought against both  countries by the U.S.</p>

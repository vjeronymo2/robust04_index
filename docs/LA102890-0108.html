			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HULL GETS 14TH GOAL AND BLUES WIN, 3-0  </P> <P> Until he scored 72 goals last season, Brett Hull was best known merely as the  son of former NHL star Bobby Hull.  </P> <P> The day may come when Bobby Hull will be better known as the father of Brett  Hull.  </P> <P> Brett Hull scored his 14th goal, his seventh in the past three games, Saturday  at St. Louis to lead the Blues to a 3-0 victory over the Montreal Canadiens.  </P> <P> Vincent Riendeau stopped 27 shots for his second career shutout in the first  Blue victory at home against the Canadiens in almost three years. The Blues  moved into a tie with the Detroit Red Wings for first place in the Norris  Division.  </P> <P> Many believe that Wayne Gretzky's record of 92 goals during the 1981-82 season  will never be broken. But with 14 goals in 11 games, Hull is on a pace that  would break it.  </P> <P> "I don't even think about that record," Hull said. "All I'm doing is trying to  help us win a Stanley Cup. That would be something special."  </P> <P> Defenseman Glen Featherstone scored the last goal for St. Louis. It was his  first in 87 NHL games.  </P> <P> Boston 5, Chicago 4 -- Jacques Cloutier and the Blackhawks were rolling after  two periods at Boston. Cloutier had faced only nine shots and Chicago led, 2-0.  </P> <P> The Blackhawks made the score 3-0 when Michel Goulet scored two minutes into  the final period. But with Randy Burridge and Cam Neely leading the way, the  Bruins scored five times to pull out the victory.  </P> <P> Burridge scored twice, including the inner with 1:49 left. Neely had a goal and  an assist.  </P> <P> With two seconds to play, Dirk Graham scored an apparent tying goal, but  referee Andy Van Hellemond ruled the net was dislodged before the puck went  into the net.  </P> <P> Calgary 9, Washington 4 -- Joe Nieuwendyk was due to break loose and the  Capitals were the victims at Calgary.  </P> <P> Nieuwendyk, scoreless in the previous seven games, had two goals and three  assists as the Flames swept into first place, ahead of the Kings, in the Smythe  Division.  </P> <P> Dave Tippett scored twice for the Capitals, who are 0-3-2 in their past five  games at Calgary.  </P> <P> New York Rangers 4, Quebec 1 -- Defenseman James Patrick broke a tie with a  power-play goal 15 seconds into the third period at Quebec and the Rangers went  on to their ninth victory in the past 10 games.  </P> <P> The Nordiques, who lost their third in a row, took a 1-0 lead on Joe Sakic's  eighth goal early in the second period. Shortly thereafter, the Rangers (9-3-0)  started putting the pressure on and the Nordiques wilted.  </P> <P> New Jersey 7, Pittsburgh 5 -- Laurie Boschman and John MacLean scored 31  seconds apart in the third period and the Devils extended their home ice record  to 7-0-1.  </P> <P> With the score 4-4 after two periods, the Penguins replaced goalie Tom Barrasso  with Wendell Young.  </P> <P> Young couldn't handle Boschman's long shot at 3:06, the puck hitting his skate  and bouncing into the net. Young then let MacLean's shot slide across the  crease into the far corner.  </P> <P> Vancouver 4, Hartford 2 -- The Whalers are learning the hard way that it isn't  the number of shots, it's the quality that wins hockey games.  </P> <P> In this game at Hartford, Conn., the Whalers outshot their opponent for the  third game in a row -- and lost.  </P> <P> Trevor Linden scored twice and rookie Troy Gamble blocked 40 shots to lead the  Canucks.  </P> <P> New York Islanders 5, Philadelphia 2 -- Pat LaFontaine, recently back from an  injury, had a hat trick at Uniondale, N.Y., and the Islanders ended a four-game  losing streak.  </P> <P> The Flyers lost more than their third in a row. Goalie Ron Hextall, sidelined  because of a groin injury for two weeks, had to leave before the middle of the  second period after suffering a knee injury.  </P> <P> Buffalo 3, Toronto 1 -- Firing Coach Doug Carpenter apparently wasn't the  answer for the Maple Leafs.  </P> <P> Pierre Turgeon and Dale Hawerchuk scored third-period goals at Toronto to lead  the Sabres. The Maple Leafs are 1-10-1.  </P> <P> Detroit 2, Minnesota 2 -- Jimmy Carson scored his seventh goal with 7:10 left  in regulation at Bloomington, Minn., to get the Red Wings a tie.  </P> <P> The Red Wings trailed, 2-0, and had only 10 shots on goal in the first 40  minutes.

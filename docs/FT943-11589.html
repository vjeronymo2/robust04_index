			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Arts: A Ring with colour-coded leitmotifs - Alfred Kirchner's new production Half a cheer for the new Ring at Bayreuth. It is abstract, colourful and apolitical - a bigger contrast with its predecessor, the 1988 Kupfer production, is hard to imagine. The stage direction is minimal, the costumes are a riot. James Levine has inspired the festival orchestra to play with a tonal ripeness and clarity unsurpassed in a generation, but his tempi - although marvellously consistent - have been rather stately. These are early days. Das Rheingold and Die Walkure have just been unveiled in conditions of sweltering heat, but with no apparent hiccups. Siegfried follows this afternoon and Gotterdammerung on Sunday. The producer, Alfred Kirchner, and his designer, known only as Rosalie, came with a reputation for radical ideas, but their approach has been surprisingly anodyne. Kirchner, an experienced theatre director in Berlin and Vienna, made his breakthrough in opera more than a decade ago during the Gielen years at Frankfurt. In interviews before the first night, he rejected the idea of tying Wagner's tetralogy to a particular time or philosophy. His aim, he said, was simply to find new mythical pictures for a many-sided epic; to use the colours and materials of nature without implying naturalism; and by unfolding the story without ideological baggage, to let the audience draw its own conclusions. Admirable thoughts - and doubtless the reason why Kirchner and Rosalie have been let off so lightly at their curtain calls. With decor reduced to a convex circular platform (the top of the globe), augmented by a variety of geometrically arranged lights and panels, the production focuses directly on words and music - providing you are not distracted by the costumes. And there's the rub. A random collage of styles and associations, they pretend to illustrate or comment on each character's function in the drama, through colour-coding and other symbols. Freia skitters about in a green-and-gold hooped outfit, apparently denoting youth and fruitfulness. Fricka follows her straw dress in Rheingold with a bizarre Cleopatra gown for Walkure - domesticity and regality. Sieglinde has an iron collar, a symbol of bondage which she discards after doping Hunding. Alberich sports shorts and a reptilian back-pack, like a friendly little porcupine. Others are harder to fathom. The Valkyries, for example, are lumbered with outsize red-and-black pannier dresses. With rare exceptions - notably the inhabitants of Nibelheim, a mass of wriggling worm-like robots - the costumes are a phoney fashion-designer's caprice, reducing Wagner's characters to figures of fun. Take away the costumes, however, and you have no production. It must be a long time since Bayreuth saw such poverty of theatrical imagination, such an abdication of the stage director's role. Apart from a splendid whirl of light-cylinders in the Ride of the Valkyries, Kirchner simply dumps his cast centre-stage and, give or take a bit of posturing, leaves them to get on with it. Even accounting for the difficulties of staging all four parts of The Ring in one go, the dialogue is unbelievably limp, especially in the crucial encounters of Die Walkure. The worst instance is the start of Act 2: stranded on separate levels, Wotan and Brunnhilde barely begin to address each other; the father-daughter relationship, with all its affectionate playfulness, has to be taken as read. Of greed, lust and ambition, of sex and violence, deceit and betrayal, this production offers barely a trace. We are in a Wagnerian kindergarten, a world in which the Woodentops would feel at home. Just what Levine thinks of all this is the subject of much speculation. Judging by the way he embraced Kirchner at their Walkure curtain call, he would have us believe he endorses the approach. But given Levine's conservative reputation, there must have been huge compromises. The stage curtain, for example, remains closed throughout the prelude to each act - unheard of in Germany today - and comes down again before the final orchestral flourish, making for a strange anticlimax to the Walkure love scene. Levine's experience of conducting The Ring in New York pays notable dividends. He brings out the natural character of the score, flawlessly unfolding the structure and paragraphing, with the manifold cross-currents and counterpoints coherently integrated. Das Rheingold was a revelation - so much detail to enjoy, and the orchestra playing like angels. With Levine in charge, the singers can do nothing but sing lyrically, enough to turn even minor episodes like Froh's 'Wie liebliche Luft' into a hymn of joy. The corollary, of course, is that the music lacks theatrical intensity - particularly in Die Walkure. It is a symphonic reading, without the dramatic extremes which made the Barenboim-Kupfer production so thrilling. The biggest loser in the new Ring is John Tomlinson's Wotan. He is neutered by a blue rubber skirt, and his Norman helmet shuts out facial expression. There is little scope for him to show dignity or ruthlessness, and the character fails to develop between Rheingold and Walkure. Even his handling of the text has been smoothed over. With such a superficial dramatic framework, the spotlight falls on his voice, which he hoists up heroically but with some strain. He was unfairly booed. Several others are inherited from previous casts - among them Siegfried Jerusalem's harmless Loge, Manfred Jung's squawky Mime, Ekkehard Wlaschiha's rich-toned Alberich and Hans Sotin's anonymous Hunding. Deborah Polaski returns as Brunnhilde, her top as constricted as ever. Poul Elming's Siegmund was in splendid voice, partnered now by his Danish compatriot Tina Kiberg - who lends the production a welcome ray of femininity, even if she lacks a Wagnerian voice. And there are two outstanding contributions: Hanna Schwarz's majestic, mettlesome Fricka and Rene Pape's Fasolt, the only singer to rise above his surroundings and provide the humanity sadly lacking in this production so far.</p>

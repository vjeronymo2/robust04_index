			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Gt Portland Pounds 18.9m acquisition Great Portland Estates has acquired a portfolio of seven freehold properties from a private company for Pounds 18.9m, satisfied by the issue of 5m shares and Pounds 9.6m in cash. The portfolio comprises two office buildings, one retail, and four distribution warehouses located in Cardiff and Plymouth. The properties generate an annual rental income of Pounds 1.5m, suggesting that Great Portland is buying on a yield of about 8 per cent. The company said that it expected rental income to increase by 10 per cent over the next year as a result of rent reviews, which would push the yield on the properties to 8.75 per cent. Mr Patrick Hall, deputy managing director, said that all the properties had been built or refurbished within the last 10 years and were let to blue-chip tenants. The deal will leave the vendors holding 1.5 per cent of Great Portland's enlarged share capital. In June, Great Portland bought a portfolio of buildings from a private company for Pounds 28m and the Royal Oak Industrial Estate for Pounds 30m.</p>

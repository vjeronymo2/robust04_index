			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Lee Ming Tee group faces inquiry THE FUTURE of Mr Lee Ming Tee's sprawling property-based empire was in doubt yesterday when the Hong Kong government appointed an inspector to investigate his flagship Allied Group and four other companies associated with him. The government acted on advice from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the colony's corporate watchdog which, for the past nine months, has been investigating Allied's intra-group share dealings. The inspector, likely to be named within a week, will investigate Allied Group, Allied Properties, Crusader Holdings, Paragon Holdings and Wai Yick. In addition the SFC has gained suspension in share trading of five other companies connected with, or believed to be connected with, Mr Lee. Last year Mr Lee acquired control of Asia Securities - one of the companies whose shares were suspended yesterday - from Mr Bill Wyllie, a local asset trader, who joined the Allied board in June. Allied directors said they would co-operate fully with the inspector. They had not been warned that the group's shares would be suspended, and would seek an early resumption of trading after talks with the SFC and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The appointment of an inspector follows an SFC investigation into certain share dealings connected with an ambitious plan, announced by Mr Lee in November, to merge three listed associate companies with Allied. Under pressure from shareholders he was forced to improve the terms of share swaps he proposed on two occasions. But in February Allied said it had abandoned the proposed mergers because of a review by the SFC into share dealings.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: PROMOTER OF SEWAGE GREENBELTS KNOWS HE'S FIGHTING AN UPHILL  BATTLE  </P> <P> You and I think of sewage-treatment plants and we think of large, unsightly  tanks where a very smelly brew is stirred and sifted.  </P> <P> Roger Frauenfelder, a San Diego deputy city manager, thinks of sewage-treatment  plants and he envisions greenbelts, lush landscaping and recreational  facilities. He dreams of a plant in Laguna Niguel that resembles a horse ranch.  </P> <P> It is good he is able to keep such soothing images in mind.  </P> <P> It has fallen to Frauenfelder to persuade property owners in Poway, North City,  Santee, Mission Valley, Otay River Valley and South Bay that treatment plants  proposed for their communities can be "good neighbors."  </P> <P> If you think a condo project raises hackles, try a sewage plant.  </P> <P> As a way to win hearts and minds, Frauenfelder has authored one of the most  relentlessly upbeat municipal reports ever issued: "Architectural Concepts for  Aesthetically Pleasing Treatment Plants."  </P> <P> Sample: "In addition to designing the visual appearance of the plant to fit  adjacent land uses, other related aspects of designing to be a good neighbor  include addressing potential nuisances such as odor, noise, lighting, dust,  graffiti, litter and traffic."  </P> <P> Frauenfelder sees jogging and walking trails and oodles of greenery kept lovely  by reclaimed water. The water, however, presents a dilemma of Blue vs. Brown.  </P> <P> "Some people find open water surfaces to to be more aesthetically pleasing than  covered tanks, when viewed from above. On the other hand, the color of the  water is generally brown, not blue, and this does not meet people's visual  expectations."  </P> <P> Frauenfelder will soon take his report to the City Council and the task force  overseeing the $2.2-billion plan, and then to community meetings in North City,  Mission Valley and Chula Vista.  </P> <P> "I'm not naive enough," he says, "to believe that, when we actually come down  to picking a certain location, that the people closest to the plant won't have  objections."  </P> <P> Translation: NIMBY (Not in My Back Yard) is out there and waiting.  </P> <P> Suffocating Critics in Paper  </P> <P> Here and there.  </P> <P> * If nothing else, the proposed SDG&amp;E-Edison merger produced a mountain of  paper.  </P> <P> Michael Shames, director of the Utility Consumer Action Network, has arranged  with the I Love a Clean San Diego recyclers to cart off 60 boxes of unessential  documents.  </P> <P> "Edison has a policy of: give 'em everything so long as it's not relevant or  damaging," Shames said. "I ask for summaries of contracts; they give me the  entire contracts, appendices to the contracts, addenda to the contracts,  contracts unrelated to the contracts."  </P> <P> * A history is being written of Stern's Gym, the venerable weight-lifting  parlor in North Park.  </P> <P> Working title: "Don't Spit in The Water Fountain," taken from a sign posted for  years in the Rocky-style establishment.  </P> <P> * Despite howls from the press and needles from her colleagues, San Diego  Deputy Mayor Abbe Wolfsheimer is not backing down from her order barring  reporters from roaming the 10th-floor City Council offices.  </P> <P> Wolfsheimer wrote to Councilman Bruce Henderson that asking permission before  entering an office is but "common courtesy." Her scolding trump: "Courtesy is  not a dinosaur."  </P> <P> Bashing the Past  </P> <P> Oldies but goodies.  </P> <P> Pete Wilson still sees political gain in slamming Rose Bird, who was voted off  the California Supreme Court in 1986. Same for Jerry Brown, gone since 1982.  </P> <P> An opinion poll attached to a current fund-raising appeal for the former San  Diego mayor's campaign for governor asks whether a governor "should appoint  liberal judges like Rose Bird."  </P> <P> Another question: "Should we continue the sound conservative policies of George  Deukmejian or return to the irresponsible schemes of Jerry Brown?"  </P> <P> Each poll includes a wallet-size card with the names of the recipient's state  legislators. There, too, the Wilson campaign has trouble staying current.  </P> <P> The cards for inland North County list Assemblyman Bill Bradley of San Marcos.  He died June 1.  </P></p>

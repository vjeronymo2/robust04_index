			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Rub your nose, hook a finger in your ear . . . Business travellers on stressful long-haul flights are generally forced to work out for themselves how to deal with the crapulous exhaustion that results from many hours in the air with little diversion other than food, drink and a flickering TV screen. But do-it-yourself regimes can be useless. Avoiding excess and keeping to the path of virtue so that you get off your aircraft feeling half-way human is not only a hit-and-miss affair but calls for the sort of self-restraint that few possess. Which is why British Airways launched its Well-Being in the Air scheme last year to try to save passengers from themselves. The scheme was an umbrella concept which took in, inter alia, abstinence from alcohol and red meat, much exercise, organised rest, and sprays and gels to stop the skin from drying out. Its aim was modest: 'To reduce the effects of flying and help you arrive in better shape.' Initially the scheme was only a partial success. As a BA spokesman puts it: 'Some of the exercises were a little vigorous, and people tended to end up waving their arms about madly. Some were even unlucky enough to clout their neighbours.' As for the dietary restrictions: 'The special well-being menu was based on the yin-yang principle which, in reality, meant it was heavily vegetarian - at times, positively vegan - which didn't suit everyone.' Nor was everyone impressed by the relaxation tape. So BA tried again this year, with an improved programme that includes a tub of rehydration gel to neutralise cabin air, a rose water facial spray to relieve dry skin, and a soothing eye compress to freshen tired and puffy eyes. The programme also boasts a new relaxation tape with a commentary by psychologist Dr Avic Sigman. And the airline suggests that occasionally you bring your knees up to your chest five times, hook the tips of your fingers in your ears and lean your head over, and rotate the tip of your nose with the palm of your hand. Is anyone taking advantage of BA's thoughtfulness? 'Well, if one passenger does it, quite a lot of them start to do it,' says BA. No figures have been collected to find out how popular the scheme has become, but there have been hundreds of requests for the Well-Being brochure. 'We even got a call from the FBI, asking if they could use our exercise programme for their new recruits.' This may be an idea whose time has yet to come. A mini-poll of those airlines which might have been expected to provide something similar - such as Swissair, United Airways, Cathay Pacific and Virgin Atlantic (which offers aromatherapy on the ground) - produced denials or obfuscation. Only Japan Airlines seemed interested in offering a comparable service. It does not offer a complete programme but will give you an in-flight health drink containing royal jelly and kiwi fruit juice, a honeycomb face-mask which helps prevent dehydration in the nasal passages, an audio relaxation tape, and a list of in-seat exercises (less strenuous than BA's). The fact is that well-being programmes will remain a rarity so long as competitive advantage depends on being seen to offer the traveller more, not less. When you consider the airlines' efforts to promote in-flight consumption, it is not surprising that most passengers - no matter how experienced - will tend to capitulate and eat and drink what is bad for them the moment it appears on their laps. On a long flight self-denial is of only limited help in overcoming jet-lag, the most serious physiological drawback of long-distance flying. No well-being programme can compensate for this massive derangement of your internal clock. Nor, say some, can anything else, including such recently tested remedies as Chinese acupressure, intense-light regimes and the hormone melatonin (see accompanying story). If you are going to feel fairly dreadful whatever you do on an aircraft, you might as well indulge yourself.</p>

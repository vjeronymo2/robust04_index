			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kedrov: "Russians and Uzbeks--Brothers </F> Forever"]    [Text] "...Uzbekistan cannot imagine itself  without Russia. And this aspiration to come closer together  manifests itself not only in economics. It may be said without  exaggeration that there is a mutual attraction in categories  such as spirituality and morality." These words spoken by Uzbek  President Islam Karimov can be considered to be the leitmotif of  the speech given by Bakhtiyar Hamidov, a deputy prime minister  of the government of Uzbekistan, at the republic's embassy in  Moscow.    The economic reform that was started in the republic in  March  of this year promoted further reinforcement of Uzbek-Russian  ties. Besides relations at the state level, direct mutual  relations between goods manufacturers are acquiring increasingly  greater significance in the economic sphere, noted the Uzbek  deputy prime minister. Moreover Uzbekistan and Russia have moved  away from the principle of barter, and all commodity turnover is  now proceeding according to world prices.    The important guest advised that famous Uzbek vegetables and  fruits no longer receive any attention at all from Russian trade  organizations and firms, which prefer to buy such products,  often of lower quality, from countries of the far abroad. By the  way, the blame for this lies to an equal degree with both Uzbek  producers and marketing specialists, who haven't yet recovered  from destruction of the traditional interrepublican ties as a  result of the Union's disintegration. However, the process of  their recovery is gradually increasing in tempo.    Developing in a situation of stability and security,  Uzbekistan has avoided the numerous problems that arose in most  states in the post-Soviet period. It is especially gratifying  that manifestations of interethnic enmity are practically absent  in the republic; this is one of the few parts of the former USSR  where Russians continue to live and work in peace. The line  toward strengthening interethnic peace and harmony is being  pursued to the fullest extent possible by the Uzbek leadership.    In this connection something needs to be said about the  great  and active work being done in Moscow by the embassy of the  Republic of Uzbekistan to strengthen the knots of friendship  between our peoples. The republic's ambassador Yusif Abdullayev,  an energetic, broadly educated and sympathetic person, is  playing far from the last role in this noble effort.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] yesterday announced a  plan to conduct a reform of the tariff rate structure this year  in line with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral  trade negotiations.    As Korea committed itself to levying no tariffs on specific  products or harmonizing its tariff system with those of the GATT  members at the Uruguay Round, the overall overhaul of the  existing tariff rate structures is needed, MOF officials said.  Furthermore, Korea needs to come out with the new tariff rate  programs as its second five-year tariff rate reduction program  will be due this year, it said. Under the five-year plan,  Korea's average tariff rate will fall to 7.9 percent by the end  of this year, from 12.7 percent in 1989. The average tariff rate  was 7.1 percent for industrial products and 17.8 percent for  agricultural products at the end of last year, compared with  11.2 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively, in 1989.    Despite foreign "satisfaction" over Korea's "low" tariff  rates, there has been some criticism in the Korean business  community that the government lowered the tariff rate too  rapidly, without full taking into consideration the nation's  economic status.    The MOF yesterday held a first working-level conference to  reform the tariff rate structures. The new plan will become  effective from next year following a formal endorsement from the  National Assembly this fall, the MOF said. In the reform, the  government will institute a system of levying customs duties on  agriculture, fisheries and light industrial products on the  basis of the imported quantity, not the imported value. This is  designed to protect domestic industries from an influx of cheap  foreign goods, it said. The government will also retain the  right to levy tariffs on these agricultural products and light  industrial goods either on the basis of imported volume or  imported value, it said.    The reform will be made in such a way as to strengthen the  international competitiveness of domestic industries through  customs duties adjustment, it said. Existing imbalance of tariff  rates on different industrial sectors will be adjusted. Instead  of frequently levying "emergency or adjustment tariff rates,"  the government will made a realistic adjustment on customs  duties on specific products, it said.</p>

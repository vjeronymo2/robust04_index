			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Minister and Remploy set to meet Mr Phillip Oppenheim, the employment minister, will today meet Remploy, the manufacturer whose status as a priority supplier was removed by the government in line with a European directive on public procurement. It is the first direct contact between the government and the company, which employs 8,600 disabled workers in 95 factories in Britain, since Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, said he would comply with the directive. Mr Portillo said the new EU directive makes illegal the Priority Suppliers Scheme, which gave companies employing large numbers of disabled people some advantages in bidding for government work. EU officials have criticised his decision to end the scheme without referring to them because it was not intended to harm disabled workers. The talks come as Remploy workers were being balloted on strike action after rejecting a 2.5 per cent pay offer. Remploy said the move by the GMB general union was 'opportunist' and designed to scare the workforce into strike action. The union claimed the company's offer was linked to a cut in sick leave and changes in working patterns which could mean a 12-hour day without overtime pay. But Remploy insisted that its offer to employees 'is the best possible in a difficult trading situation. It does not contain any proposals about shift-working or working hours. Neither are there plans to introduce a 12-hour day without overtime. 'There is no reduction being made in sick pay. We are seeking only to reduce overall absence levels - with a monitoring scheme - as these currently run at the unacceptably high rate of 12 per cent.' The deadline for the postal ballot is September 8. The result is expected to be announced during the TUC annual conference.</p>

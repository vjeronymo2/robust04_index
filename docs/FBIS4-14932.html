			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Commonly Shared Problems of Ukraine's and Russia's Gas </F> Industry Alleviate Russian Gas Supply Problem" -- UKRINFORM  headline; From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 14, 28 Mar  - 3 Apr 94]    [Text] According to official information released by the  Ukrgazprom (Ukraine's Gas Industry) concern, over the last week  both the Russian and Ukrainian sides fully met their commitments  involving natural gas supplies.    Ukraine's gas piping agencies are reported to have made more  orderly Russian natural gas exports to Europe, while Russia's  gas suppliers were similarly punctual in supplying natural gas  to Ukraine both for themselves and for Turkmenistan to  compensate for the latter's discontinued supplies.    For some objective reasons, the issue of suspended natural  gas supplies by Russia to Ukraine has been deleted from the  agenda. Or, more specifically, no emphasis is placed on the  major underlying reason, which is Ukraine's fuel indebtedness.  At least, now it has become obvious that the Russo-Ukrainian  controversy, which the media used to interpret as the fuel  indebtedness problem, lies in the status of major gas and  petroleum pipe-lines, which have largely fallen within Ukraine's  jurisdiction after the former Soviet Union's disintegration,  though this fact is not at all tantamount to division of the  formerly integral pipe-line system and Russia's tacit agreement  with this. So, while persistently and actively overstating its  warnings about natural gas supply suspension the Russian side is  well aware of its virtual inability to make the threats  materialize, Ukraine's unpaid fuel debt to Russia  notwithstanding.    Since the latest Moscow agreement, under which Ukraine had  to  start repaying its debt and at least pay for the 1994 first  quarter's supplies with hard currency, Ukraine has factually  repaid about 46 million dollars, which is less than a half of  the sum subject to payment, according to Russia's Gazprom  sources.    The Ukrainian government's subsequent March decision on  lists  of enterprises and amounts of commodities they should supply to  Russia by way of repaying Ukraine's fuel debt, as well as the  endorsed scheme for settling, may be viewed as just another  palliative resolution among a series of five, which the  Ukrainian Cabinet approved over the past six months. As  analysts believe, it will be as inefficient, as its predecessors  were.    Ukraine's, or more specifically, the Ukrainian State  Committee's for oil and gas, major headache is the problem of  internal non- payment. The above decisions, as well as the  imposed rule of pre- payment starting with April 1, have all  invariably threatened to discontinue natural gas supplies to  debtor consumer-enterprises. To a certain extent, such threats  can be carried out by Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz against Ukrainian  consumer enterprises. At least, Ukrzarubezhneftegaz  spokespersons (this agency is in charge of control over mutual  settling in line with the latest governmental resolution) hope  that the threats, coupled with other administrative moves, which  are provided for by the resolution, will succeed in repayment of  the debt's major portion.    All the administrative pressure notwithstanding, Ukraine's  metallurgical and chemical enterprises are reported as highly  reluctant to comply with the government's strict order to remit  their currency accounts to only the state-owned Export-Import  Bank. The government's stratagem is too transparent and provides  for imposing the state's total and rigid control over export  enterprises' hard currency incomings with a view of channeling  them to repayment of Ukraine's fuel debt.    The Ukrainian State Committee for oil and gas is said to pin  its hopes on imposition of a rigid mechanism of payments for  imported fuels to extinguish the internal debt, which may be  implemented by the newly established Ukrneftegaz (Ukraine's Oil  and Gas) National Joint-Stock Company of the holding type.  Assuming the status of though state-run, yet monopolist in the  field of fuel supplies, the National Joint-Stock Company is  largely expected to realize its claims.    However as the Russian Gazprom association's experience may  suggest, the hope is hard to materialize, since Russia's Gazprom  has been acting in a similar manner toward intra-Russian gas  consumers and under conditions, very much similar to those of  Ukrgazprom.    The Russo-Ukrainian "debts should be repaid" dispute (as  Ukraine's acting prime-minister Zvyagilski once put it) has  ripened enough to assume the form of mutual proposals and  compromises. For objective reasons, Russia cannot drastically  curtail its natural gas supplies to Ukraine. Gas exports to  West Europe have shrunk with spring's onset, firstly. The  supply schedule for Ukraine, though it virtually exceeds the  domestic requirements, will not be a weighty argument, since  these gas supplies are basically intended for piping them to  underground storages.    Russia's natural gas extractors cannot significantly curtail  their extraction, either, purely for technical reasons, which  makes them look for ways to dispose of the extracted natural gas  somehow.    Besides, reduced natural gas piping may further compromise  the already deteriorated major gas pipe-lines, which the Russian  side has to admit. Ukraine's formal ownership of the pipe-lines  does not relieve Russia of troubles involved in maintaining them  technically operational. Ukraine is similarly interested in  their good operational condition. Thus, Russia has to share the  burden of operational costs involved in maintaining Ukraine's  segment of the gas pipe-line system, which links Russian gas  exporters with their West European customers.    In view of this one cannot but admit as quite rational  Russia's bid to own a part of the vital gas export  infrastructure, which is located in Ukraine. The latter, while  not rejecting Russia's claim outright, appears in no hurry to  meet it. Probably, this fact could be attributed to Ukraine's  domestic economic troubles and its petroleum and gas industry's  restructuring.    The Ukrainian side has apparently been doing its best to  postpone the final decision on Russia's co-ownership having  repeatedly promised Russia to sell stocks to be issued by  Ukrainian gas and oil industry enterprises, which are supposed  to undergo conversion into joint-stock societies, to Russian  related enterprises. However, these promises may be rendered  void by the privatization process, if it follows the pattern,  which is supposed to be approved for the Ukrainian oil and gas  industry.    Meanwhile, the CIS integral gas distribution system remains  operational with the bulk of it in Russia's possession. So, it  is Russia, who bears the burden of its operational costs. In  late March Moscow was the venue of a sitting convened by  Gazprom's Council for R&amp;D and technologies, which discussed  progress made in implementing the Highly Reliable Piping  Transport Program. Academician Boris Paton, director of the Ye.  Paton Arc Welding Research Institute, made a major speech.  This fact and Ukraine's great contribution to this and other  projects involving gas piping, may unambiguously and eloquently  testify to both commonly shared by Ukraine and Russia problems  and the integral quality of the major gas pipe-line  infrastructure.    The above Program was adopted in 1991 by the then Union  government. Its practical implementation started a year later.    The now independent governments of Russia and Ukraine  articulated their support for it as an intergovernmental  project. However, Ukraine had to drastically reduce its  financing, though R&amp;D efforts continued. The Program is said  to  contain nine major R&amp;D directions. However, their  implementation is now jeopardized. The Ukrainian party is  reported as intending to complete and implement on its own the  Program's Ukrainian section, which is but too logical  considering some most recent international projects in this  field.    Under the former USSR since the late 1960s about 22,000 to  26,000 km. of gas pipe-lines were annually commissioned  including some 15,000 km. of major gas pipe-lines.    According to the Gazprom Council, in the late 1970s-early  1980s annual gas extraction increments of 40 billion cu. m. and  more dictated construction of a high-capacity and superlong  major pipe-line. Thus, high-pressure 1,420 mm. diameter gas  pipe-lines were constructed. Over 50,000 km. of these were  constructed in the Russian Federation alone.    The CIS major gas pipe-line system is 220,000 km. long with  compressor stations' aggregate power of 50 million kW.    According to Russia's Gazprom, Russia operates 138,500 km.  of  major gas pipe-lines, 48,000 km. of major oil pipe-lines under  the Transneft Company, and 13,000 km. of major petroleum product  pipe- lines under the Transnefteprodukt company.    Many of these are used to pipe up to 250 billion cu. m. of  natural gas a year from West Siberian fields to Europe. Some of  these pipe as much as over 340 billion cu. m. of gas. Major  pipe-lines cross railroads and highways in 15,000 cases, and  water arteries in 2,000 cases, which makes their reliability and  safety problem a vital and obvious one.    Their wear and tear poses great environmental pollution  risks, since 25 per cent of gas pipe-lines have been operational  for over 20 years, 38 per cent for between 10 and 20 years and 5  per cent have surpassed the limit of 33 years.    According to Gazprom, in 1993 there were 30 cases of  pipe-line destruction. Compared to most developed nations, the  number is not great. However, the pipe-lines' aging and failure  to meet the European standards coupled with inadequate control  over their technical safety may adversely affect the unified CIS  - West European gas supply system.</p>

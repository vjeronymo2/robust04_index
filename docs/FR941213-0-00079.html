			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this final rule, high theft MPVs and LDTs, and lines listed in Appendix B must add parts marking for a total of $5.06 per vehicle. Based on 1991 production figures, an additional 7.4 million would need to be marked, making the approximate cost of marking high theft MPVs, LDTs, and lines listed in Appendix B, $37 million. However, NHTSA believes the $37 million estimate is high because many manufacturers will petition for approval to use an antitheft device, in lieu of parts marking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, NHTSA estimates that the total cost of this final rule would be approximately $37 million, considerably less than the $89 million estimated in the NPRM, which included costs to mark glazing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA cannot estimate the benefits of this final rule. The average value of a stolen vehicle is approximately $6,100. Thus, this final rule would have to result in the prevention of about 6,100 vehicle thefts ($37 million divided by $6,100) to break even with the costs imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify that this proposed rule, if made final, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As already noted, this final rule defines ``light duty truck'' and ``multipurpose passenger vehicle,'' and specifies parts for MPVs and LDTs that should be designated as ``major parts.'' The final rule itself will have minimal effects on small manufacturers of passenger motor vehicles, as almost none of the manufacturers of passenger motor vehicles that may be subject to this rule is considered a small business. This final rule will have no effect on small organizations or governmental units that purchase passenger motor vehicles. Accordingly, the agency has not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the agency has considered the environmental impacts of this proposed rule and determined that if made final, it will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The procedures in this rule for manufacturers to mark vehicle identification numbers on specified parts of high theft passenger motor vehicle lines, are considered to be information collection requirements as that term is defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 5 CFR part 1320. The information collection requirements for part 541 have been submitted to and approved by the OMB, pursuant to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). This collection of information has been assigned OMB Control No. 2127&hyph;0510, (Consolidated Vehicle Identification Number Requirements) and has been approved for use through June 30, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Civil Justice Reform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule would not have any retroactive effect, and it does not preempt any State law. 49 U.S.C. 33117 provides that judicial review of this rule may be obtained pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 32909. Section 33117 does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 541  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Labeling, Motor vehicles, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR part 541 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 541_FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT PREVENTION STANDARD <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

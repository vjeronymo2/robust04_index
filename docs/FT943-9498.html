			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Maverick may bring Beijing's anger on Hong Kong business Mr Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong entrepreneur, has set fashion trends in China with his polo shirts, and publishing trends in his home territory with a rough and ready magazine. Now, he is setting a new standard for dealings between Hong Kong companies and the Chinese leadership. The case of Mr Lai is providing clues for Hong Kong business people wary of their fate after 1997, when China regains control of the territory. Having berated Chinese Premier Li Peng and called him a 'turtle's egg', a serious insult in Chinese, he is now considering his future as non-executive chairman of Giordano, the casual clothing company which is one of Hong Kong's most successful retailers within China. Things are never simple with Mr Lai. One partner in Giordano is Beijing-backed China Resources, which would not want his casual clothing company punished too harshly. However, on Monday, officials closed the company's Beijing store, and there are fears for its 28 other outlets in China. Mr Lai's likely resignation is being seen as an attempt to douse the fires he stoked with an abusive letter to Chinese premier Li Peng - a two-page stream-of-consciousness that heaped scorn on the leader's worth, intelligence and even looks. It was printed in his Next magazine, which has a weekly circulation of about 170,000 and is avidly read by those with a thirst for outspoken politics, gore and gossip. The 45-year-old Mr Lai has recently had little to do with the day-to-day running of Giordano in which he has a a 36 per cent stake. But his resignation could prove to be a step backwards for Hong Kong. By eliminating all effective ties with Giordano, Mr Lai would be separating his beliefs from the fortunes of the company, a move many say was prompted by the closure of the month-old Beijing store. Officially, Giordano says the Beijing outlet was closed because 'certain licensing formalities had not been completed'; but observers are linking it with Mr Lai's virulent open letter. They fear Beijing is cracking the whip on Hong Kong businesses. There is barely a company in Hong Kong which is not doing business in China, or plans to do so. For retailers and manufacturers of consumer goods especially, a market of 1.2bn people is the main reason to stay in the relatively saturated Hong Kong marketplace. Mr Lai has never been above a degree of co-operation with China where it suits. China Resources (Holdings), the trading company controlled by China's Foreign Trade and Economic Commission (the same body that closed the Beijing store), owns a 10 per cent holding in Giordano and is the likely beneficiary of Mr Lai's controlling voting rights. He may find himself called to do a little more back-peddling next March, when he plans to float Next Magazine. Investors may prove harder to please than readers, and shy from a company which so blatantly attacks the leadership when 1997 is just around the corner. Giordano has tapped demand in China for primary coloured polo shirts, jeans and sweat-shirts. The value-for-money concept, of reasonable price tags attached to quality clothes, has ensured the chain's popularity on both sides of the border and helped stimulate profits. Last year the company recorded net profits of HKDollars 137.6m (Pounds 11.6m), compared with HKDollars 115m in 1992. First half earnings this year rose 58 per cent to HKDollars 85m. Mr Lai himself is the Hong Kong story made flesh. Leaving school young and with little by way of qualifications he wound up in Hong Kong and swiftly developed an appetite for philosophy, commerce and politics. His conversation can be peppered with insights and words gleaned from Adam Smith and Milton Friedman or it can be colourful, unstructured invective. His estimated personal wealth has been put as high as HKDollars 2bn. He was incensed by the events of June 1989, when tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square to crush the democracy movement, and Next Magazine - started up two years later - was born out of this anger. Mr Lai has said while the group will adjust its editorial policy it will not 'kowtow to get business going'.</p>

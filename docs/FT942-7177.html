			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Japan Tobacco bucks trend with 10.9% rise Japan Tobacco, the state-owned cigarette group aiming for privatisation this year, yesterday bucked the trend of a grim results season and reported a sharp rise in annual profits. Taxable profits at the group, the world's third-largest tobacco company, rose by 10.9 per cent to Y110.45bn (Dollars 1.06bn) in the year to the end of March, mainly due to cost reductions, on sales up by 1.6 per cent to Y3,462bn. The small increase in turnover reflects the fact that Japan's tobacco market, where Japan Tobacco holds an 83 per cent share, is mature. But the group has lowered its break-even point by cutting staff and reducing the number of outlets in a restructuring programme which began in 1985. However, pre-tax profits for the current year are expected to stagnate at around Y110bn, said the group, on sales up slightly to Y3,500bn.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Arts: Music in 12 Parts Halfway through Thursday evening in the Festival Hall, I decided that 6 would be enough. Philip Glass and his loyal team were playing the complete dozen, his Late Minimalist magnum opus of 1971-74: from 7 o'clock to 11.30 as originally announced, but emended on the spot to 11.45 and by my reckoning, unlikely to finish much before midnight. Though the large audience looked like real devotees, I suspect that they began to slip away soon after I did. For younger readers, I should explain what Minimalism was. In postwar Europe, in the wake of Schoenberg and Webern, a whole generation of composers became convinced that if their music did not strike 'conventional' audiences as a-thematic and a-rhythmic, they must be trading indecently upon outworn expressive routines. As they bore that thought in mind, their audiences dwindled to a knowledgeable few. Later, the American Minimalists (Terry Riley first of all, then Steve Reich and Glass etc) hit upon a different and less rebarbative way of shucking off the past. It struck them that sour European dissonances were unnecessary. Instead you could recycle the simplest and most reassuringly familiar routines as long as you flattened them into plain, inexpressive elements. Your new claim on listeners' attention would lie in the new patterns you made with them: slow, almost subliminal shifts of tonal focus and rhythmic basis, as you let your component lines go out of step, and also the audible moire effects - quite new in music, and rich in potential - as the different levels separated off. For Terry Riley, that was only one line of untrammelled experiment among many; for Reich it is one that has drawn him into clever, close-focus explorations. Glass is harder to classify. His earlier music exploited the new possibilities hard, with a lot of fluent linear invention that gleamed brightly. (when rigorously played, and well transmitted). Music in 12 Parts had a broader aim: to sustain a marathon live-performance span, as it was suddenly fashionable to do in the early 1970s - commonly lubricated by a lot of dope. At the first interval it was deeply nostalgic to detect a sharp whiff of that in the Festival Hall foyer. In a relaxed, meditative frame of mind one can let one's thoughts wander as Glass's music winds on, and still register the big, glacial shifts when they make themselves felt. In plain practical terms, however, the South Bank performance failed the composer. Whether his linear knack or (less confidently) his harmonic lurches were meant to keep things going, the sound-reproduction in the hall sold him short. Instead, what we heard over certain of the amplified channels had a flat, ugly glare without depth, and around most of the soprano notes (from the super-reliable Lisa Carol Bielawa) there was a percussive surrounding crackle: not hi-tech at all, and eventually numbing to the ear - which was why I gave up early. If the price of hearing an expansive Glass concert is deafness for the next few concerts, it is too high.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under "In the State Duma" rubric: </F> "Parliament Changes Address"]    [Text] By fall the State Duma will move to its permanent  residence -- a complex of buildings along the capital's Okhotnyy  Ryad thoroughfare and Georgiyevskiy Pereulok. Repairs are under  way in these buildings to replace old fire-hazardous partitions.  This was reported in an interview with ITAR-TASS correspondents  by Sergey Filatov, leader of the Russian President's  Administration. In his opinion "the Russian Federation  president's edict has written the final chapter in the epic of  the State Duma's accommodations."    The lower house of parliament will be temporarily  accommodated in the Russian Management Academy in the  southwestern part of the capital. The president's  administration has counterarguments against protests from the  Russian Management Academy collective. The point is that the  audit carried out by the Control Administration under the  Russian Federation president revealed numerous infringements of  tax discipline by the Russian Management Academy leadership.  Thus, numerous commercial structures which rent the academy's  premises are either not officially registered at all or do not  pay taxes to the state budget.    As is known, under the Russian Federation president's edict  the Russian Management Academy will move to the parliamentary  center building on Tsvetnoy Bulvar.</p>

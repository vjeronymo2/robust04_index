			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPRESS LINE;  </P> <P> LUXURY IN A HURRY  </P> <P> CRABS AND CAKES  </P> <P> Steamed Dungeness crab  </P> <P> Sliced avocado, lettuce and tomato salad  </P> <P> Sourdough French bread or garlic bread  </P> <P> Espresso Praline Berry Cake  </P> <P> Sometimes, after a long, busy work day, you need a luxurious meal. Served with  wine and lit by candlelight, this easy dinner lets you pamper yourself without  the fuss and expense of eating out.  </P> <P> The main course is easy and fast. Simply pop the Dungeness crab, covered, in  the microwave on HIGH for several minutes to steam. Melt some butter with  crushed herbs, lemon juice or garlic and along with French bread, serve with  the crab.  </P> <P> With the time you save, you can make dessert. Dress up packaged angel food cake  with espresso-flavored whipped cream and colorful berries. Chopped praline made  from caramelized sugar and cashews adds crunch and sweet flavor.  </P> <P> Whipped in the food processor, the cream won't be as fluffy as real whipped  cream but it's smoother, richer and more stable. However, watch carefully --  whipped cream that spends too much time in the food processor turns into  butter.  </P> <P> ESPRESSO PRALINE BERRY CAKE  </P> <P> Staples  </P> <P> Sugar  </P> <P> Butter  </P> <P> Shopping List  </P> <P> 1 small can cashew halves  </P> <P> 1 pint whipping cream  </P> <P> 1 small bottle instant espresso  </P> <P> or coffee powder  </P> <P> 1 package angel food cake  </P> <P> 1 or 2 baskets fresh berries  </P> <P> 1.

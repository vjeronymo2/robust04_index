			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: BSkyB and Nickelodeon in channel joint venture BRITISH Sky Broadcasting and Nickelodeon, the children's channel owned by Viacom, the US media group, yesterday announced a joint venture to produce a children's television channel for the UK. The channel, which will include original British programmes for children, is the first example of BSkyB's policy of extending the range of channels on offer through joint ventures. The new channel, managed as an independent business, will be launched in October. This is the first move into the UK by Nickelodeon, which claims to be the largest producer of children's programmes in the world. In the US the Nickelodeon cable channel is available in 58m homes. Ms Anne Sweeney, senior vice-president of Nickelodeon's Program Enterprises, said yesterday one of its main goals was to create a worldwide network for children combining US programmes with programmes produced with local partners. The UK Nickelodeon channel will be part of BSkyB's planned 'basic tier' of channels. These are free but will later be included in a subscription package costing about Pounds 4 a month. An agreement in principle has already been reached between BSkyB, in which Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, has a 16 per cent stake, and TCI, the US cable group, to add three channels to the basic package. They are Bravo, the classic film channel, The Children's Channel and Discovery, the factual and documentary channel. The Nickelodeon deal makes it more likely that MTV, the pop music channel that is also owned by Viacom, can be enticed into the subscription package. By the autumn, BSkyB could be entirely a subscription service so that only those who pay for a special card will be able to view. BSkyB hopes to keep the cost of all the channels below Pounds 20 a month.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Argentina plans to boost car and truck exports ARGENTINA'S six car and truck manufacturers plan sharply to increase exports to about Dollars 650m (Pounds 350m) a year and to invest Dollars 1.6bn over the next three years as part of a mandatory investment and modernisation plan, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires. Six months ago the government told the companies it would relax import barriers under an export-oriented policy. It told them to draw up investment plans showing how they would adapt to liberalisation. Each company must run a positive trade balance by 1994 and cut its model range.</p>

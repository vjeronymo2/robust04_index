			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Delta shares fall despite 5% advance to Pounds 30.6m Shares in Delta fell by 31p to 468p after the cables and engineering group said increased activity in the UK construction market had not yet been fully reflected in demand for its plumbing products and electrical circuits. Delta's pre-tax profits rose 5 per cent from Pounds 29.1m to Pounds 30.6m in the six months to July 2; turnover grew by 3 per cent to Pounds 440m. Sir Martin Jacomb, chairman, said: 'Despite continuing encouraging signals, overall patterns of trading have remained inconsistent.' Mr Robert Easton, chief executive, said the 'light end' of the building materials market in the UK was still flat, but the European construction market had rebounded sharply. Delta's cable businesses continue to suffer from intense price competition. Mr Easton said the group had pushed through price increases of about 20 per cent in general cables and wiring, but this had been fully absorbed by higher prices for raw materials such as copper and pvc. The engineering division increased operating profits by 27 per cent, mainly because of a recovery in demand for plumbing products in Continental Europe. Industrial services also increased profits, reflecting growth in the Australian businesses. Circuit protection, however, was affected by a sharp downturn in demand for its products in the Middle East and by restructuring costs. Gearing fell from 28 to 23 per cent. Mr Eaton said the group would continue to develop through organic growth and appropriate acquisitions. The success of a Malaysian protective coatings plant had reinforced the group's commitment to further expansion in south-east Asia. Earnings per share increased by 4.8 per cent to 13.1p (12.5p), but the interim dividend was lifted by only by 2.4 per cent from 4.2p to 4.3p. COMMENT A 6 per cent drop in the share price seemed a little harsh for results which were in line with forecasts, even if the dividend was stingier than expected. Delta's trouble is that, having cut costs so much, it is seen as a prime beneficiary of a recovery in volume - and the cautious trading statement was enough to unsettle a twitchy market. The operational gearing argument still stacks up, however - a 2 per cent increase in engineering sales translated into a 27 per cent rise in operating profit. Even the troubled cables market could be lucrative when it turns - as BICC's results in the US recently demonstrated. Yesterday's share price fall was on low turnover of a tightly-held stock. Unchanged full-year forecasts put the shares on a prospective multiple of about 18. That 15 per cent premium to the market looks justified, on medium-term view.</p>

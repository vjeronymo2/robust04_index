			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Kim Chang-yong] </F>   [Text] Korea's motor vehicle industry, launched lees than  30 years ago, has gained a firm and solid footing in the  international market both by its expanding trade volume and  enhancing quality.    Already the sixth largest producer in the world, the  latecomer pursues fifth place before the close of the present  century in its aggressive "X-5 Project," mapped out by the Kim  Yong-sam administration with an eye to putting further vigor  into the auto field, locomotive of Korea's exports.    Individual companies, especially Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors  and Daewoo Motor, have their own visions of a brighter future,  pooling their wisdom and energy for a life-and-death battle on  one hand and cashing in on government policy on the other.    "Korea is one of several countries that has jumped into the  highly sophisticated technology- and capital-intensive sector  since World War II but is the only country that has now  succeeded there," Cho Kwan-hyon, executive vice chairman of the  Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association [KAMA], said in an  interview at his office yesterday.    The 58-year-old Cho was recently elected vice president of  the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers  (OICA), a Paris-based federation of 28 national organizations,  all representative of world auto producers and importers.    "My election is primarily attributable to the strong  position  of Korea's auto industry on the global scene. I think as an  OICA vice president, I can in turn promote the stature of our  industry one rung on the ladder to world leadership," a beaming  Cho viewed.    He will head the organization, established in 1919 and  granted United Nations Consultative Status as early as 1956,  along with one president and two other vice presidents for the  coming two years.    His accession to the post is an honor, the first to date for  a developing country. His predecessors have been all from just  a handful of auto powers including the United States, Germany,  France, Italy and Japan.    He said he would devote himself to articulating the voices  of  Korean and Asian automakers in the organization and  consolidating their roles in the development of the world  automobile and its industry, being faithful to OICA's general  purposes.    Actually, OICA aims at ensuring permanent link between its  members, undertaking, at their request, studies on any question  of mutual interest, collecting and circulating any useful  information for the benefit of member associations and their  respective members and representing the auto industry in  intergovernmental and international bodies.    The OICA vice president particularly plans to help Korea  join  three committees--the Technical Committee, Industrial and  Economic Policy Committee and Exhibition Committee. KAMA got  its OICA membership quite belatedly, in 1991, at his initiative  but has yet to be admitted to the specialized panels.    He seeks the organization's expertise on the setup of a  massive domestic motor show, scheduled for May next year in  Seoul, as the first full-scale show of its kind. KAMA, in close  cooperation with member auto producers, started preparing it  last year.    "During the one-week display," Cho said, "We will  demonstrate  the technology and service which our industry has accumulated  over the last decades.    Based on the experience, KAMA will hold an international  motor show in the spring or fall of 1997 though it will chart  out details for the scheme after the local event.    He painted a very rosy picture for the domestic auto  industry  in the present and future as well, foreseeing that it would  produce an estimated 5 million units including overseas output  in the year 2000 and stand only next to the United States,  Japan, Germany and France. "We will engage in a neck-and-neck  race with France then."    "The situation remains favorable. First of all, the home  market is stable. It is only here that auto sales swell by 10  percent or more annually. Korean automakers will be able to  make another jump- start by making the most of the local market  over the three or four years.    "Korean-built cars have unchallenged price competitiveness.  Given extensive investment in the research and development and  subsequent improvement in quality and styling, they will pose a  threat to century-old world top-notch brands," he reasoned.    Domestic producers are success-oriented and full of  confidence.    For one thing, he noted, Hyundai is going ahead with its  "Global Top 10 Project" designed to produce 2 million units by  2000, equal to the current output of Volkswagen and even more  than that of Mitsubishi or Mazda. Kia and Daewoo are  benchmarking Hyundai's "can-do spirit and ambitious push."    Cho complained about the administration's "hasty" concession  to the U.S. pressure to lower the tariff on imported vehicles.  "The administration's hasty slash of the tariff to 8 percent is  much lower than the internationally-acknowledged rate of 10  percent. The European Union, for instance, levies a 10 percent  tariff on foreign cars and we have to give European cars  preferential treatment here," he stressed.</p>

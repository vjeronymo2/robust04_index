[Al-Saqr] There were many motives for my resignation but I  do not believe it is appropriate to reveal them. They are  personal.    [Al-Salman] But it has been claimed that the resignation had  something to do with the Gaza-Jericho agreement.    [Al-Saqr] One of the reasons for the resignation was the  Gaza-Jericho agreement and the lifting of the boycott of Israel,  perhaps because I belong to a generation which has Arab  convictions. Generally speaking, my views may not be in harmony  with the current trend.    [Al-Salman] Why did you withdraw the resignation?    [Al-Saqr] At the insistence of my colleagues, the Assembly  members.    [Al-Salman] To what extent does the Foreign Affairs  Committee contribute to the formulation of Kuwait's foreign  policy?    [Al-Saqr] In the previous session the National Assembly  decided to form a joint overall committee combing the interior  and defense and foreign affairs committees to submit a study on  Kuwait's affairs, security, and defense strategy. And indeed we  did that and I chaired both committees. We began our work  during the previous session but the task was not completed.    [Al-Salman] Why not?    [Al-Saqr] Because of the complex diverse issues. We have  sought the assistance of some academicians, specialists, and  officers and we intend to seek the help of experts in the Arab  world, Europe, and the United States. That is why we have  requested an extension of the committee's deadline by another  year and the Assembly has granted that request.    [Al-Salman] How do you assess the Assembly's achievements?    [Al-Saqr] It made good achievements up to the last third of  the second term. For example, it discussed public funds and  investments and passed a law for the protection of all public  funds. All these were achievements. Let us not forget that  this Assembly came after the catastrophe of the Iraqi occupation  and it faced challenges in exceptional circumstances not  experienced by past legislative assemblies. The public believes  that some priority issues are not worth discussing but we should  view matters comprehensively and weigh the challenges which  Kuwait has had to meet.    [Al-Salman] What is the National Assembly's position on the  Damascus Declaration? How do you view it?    [Al-Saqr] We back and support the Damascus Declaration  because we see it as a step in the right direction. If we view  the Damascus Declaration as an advanced step in the development  of the Arab League's work and link it to the regional  organization of the Gulf Cooperation Council states on which we  pin great hopes, we will see a solid interlinked chain on the  right road.    [Al-Salman] What about Iran?    [Al-Saqr] Iran is a neighboring state with which we have  geographical and historical links. We seek relations based on  mutual respect. That "respect" is what we wish for.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOB HOPE STEPS UP TO THE PLATE FOR BIG A HONOR  </P> <P> With his customary mix of wit and charm, comedic legend Bob Hope accepted  accolades Thursday night at Anaheim Stadium for his longstanding commitment to  the nation's military -- and just as quickly turned this attention back to the  service members themselves.  </P> <P> It was Armed Forces Night at the stadium, as the Angels continued a weeklong  celebration before Tuesday's All-Star game.  </P> <P> And the man of the hour was Hope, 86, who since the outset of World War II has  spent thousands of hours entertaining U.S. troops worldwide.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Selfless Service'  </P> <P> It was for this "unprecedented, loyal and selfless service" to the military  that Orange County Centennial Committee representative Darrell Metzger honored  Hope at Thursday's ceremony.  </P> <P> But Hope, ushered to home plate in an Army jeep, quickly turned the tables,  using the occasion to salute the 3,000 military personnel who stood ramrod  straight behind him.  </P> <P> "Just to see this many servicemen brings back a lot of memories to me," Hope  said.  </P> <P> Noting the display around him, Hope said that while people may now legally burn  the American flag, "they will never burn the spirit behind that banner."  </P> <P> Hope saved his only jokes of the night for Angels owner and former Western star  Gene Autry, whom he called a "Donald Trump with saddle sores."  </P> <P> It was Autry, Hope quipped, who "taught Ronnie Reagan how to ride a horse," a  reference to the former President's being thrown from a bucking horse while  hunting on a friend's ranch in northern Mexico on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The ceremony ended with the 82nd Airborne Chorus singing Hope's signature song,  "Thanks for the Memory."  </P> <P> A scheduled flyby performance by California Air National Guard F-4E Phantom  jets was canceled because of an accident at March Air Force Base involving an  F-4, according to ceremony host Johnny Grant.  </P> <P> Grant, who is directing the Angels' weeklong All-Star celebration, said that  when he was asked "who I thought they should honor, I said, 'For Armed Forces  night, there is only one person -- and that is Bob Hope.'

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK stock market After this week's 53 point fall in the Footsie, the risks of an interest rate rise would appear to be at least partially discounted by UK equities. It may be, though, that the market is still unduly optimistic about 1993 corporate earnings given the prospects for low inflation, a likely continuation of high real interest rates, and no certainty of a devaluation of the pound. Certainly the depressing experience of industrial companies in 1990 and 1991 - for which earliest independent forecasts of a 10 to 15 per cent earnings rise compare with the reality of a 10 to 15 per cent collapse  -suggest that there could be downgradings aplenty to come. As S G Warburg points out, moreover, the composition of 1993 profits growth predicted by its analysts for the 72 Footsie stocks in the Industrial Index is very different from 1992. This year less than half the growth is expected to come from underlying trading, ie volume increases and price gains, thanks to substantial cost savings and acquisition benefits. Next year, however, the anticipated earnings increase is 75 per cent reliant on a general economic improvement. Investors need to be sure that this risk is priced in.</p>

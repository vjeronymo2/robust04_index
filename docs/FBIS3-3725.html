Living Buddha Yexiong Zhanyanggendeng Jianchuo,  deputy to the provincial people's congress and vice chairman of  the Huangnan Zang Autonomous Prefectural People's Congress, who  had just returned from a panel discussion, enthusiastically  showed us into the room, and accepted our interview with  pleasure.    The Living Buddha, in his red patchwork outer vestment and  with a string of beads in his hand, has a stout physique and a  sedate countenance and manner. He is 47 years old this year,  and a cousin of the late Great Master Bainqen Erdini Qoigyi  Gyaincain. He was tonsured when he was four years old, and is  now the abbot of several monasteries, including Xunhua's Wendu  Monastery and Tongren's Yexiong Monastery, as well as a council  member in charge of the Buddhist Association of China.    When we talked of the late Great Master Bainqen, Living  Buddha Ye Xiong became very excited, saying that Great Master  Bainqen Erdini often had taken care of him, and had showed great  concern for him in many ways. In particular, he had accompanied  Great Master Bainqen Erdini to visit Tibet on three occasions,  and personally had heard Great Master Bainqen Erdini propagate  party policy, and his several talks on safeguarding the  motherland's unity. He said: The government work report has  summarized the 1993 economic work in the province, and was  inspiring. This year, the whole province, from top to bottom,  should take longer strides so as to accelerate the pace of  economic development. As one from the religious circles, he  said that he too should exert efforts. In excitement, he raised  his hands and said: The patriotism and religious devotion of  the late Great Master Bainqen were genuine. Patriotism and  religious devotion are likened to a man's two hands; one hand  represents patriotism, and the other religious devotion. In  completing any undertaking, neither hand is dispensable.  Patriotism means to be in favor of socialism, and to support  the party and government in developing the economy, whereas  religious devotion means to observe state laws, decrees, rules  and regulations conscientiously; explain Buddhist teachings;  safeguard the unity of the motherland; and strengthen  nationality solidarity. Here the Living Buddha indicated that  it had been stressed in the government work report that normal  religious activities must be protected, whereas there must be a  stern crackdown on lawbreaking activities that take advantage of  religion to engage in actions that endanger society, stability  and unity. That passage is well put, and I approve of it with  both hands. Should patriotism and religious devotion be absent  in any religious person, this will violate the most basic  religious teaching. He added: Those individuals who have  failed to abide by basic religious teachings are like a burning  cigarette butt: If it is allowed to burn, a fire may break out  and endanger the monastery, as well as other people. Such  people must be purged from the religious circles. Living  Buddha Ye Xiong continued, only by strengthening unity and  maintaining stability will it be possible to pursue  construction, and achieve economic development. When the nation  prospers, Buddhism will prosper, too. Patriotism and religious  devotion are the common aspiration.    When the reporters concluded the interview and expressed  their thanks to Living Buddha Yexiong, the latter wanted the  reporters to relay one of his suggestions, which is that  specific departments should be given specific help when they  conduct experimental exploration in developing production to  support the maintenance of monasteries. For example, some plots  of land, or hill slopes, or woods should be allotted to them.  Thus their abilities will be strengthened, and the financial  burden of the government and the masses will be relieved. When  the reporters nodded approval of relaying his opinion to related  departments, Living Buddha Yexiong happily signed his name on  the reporters' books in beautiful Tibetan calligraphy.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THIRSTING FOR JUSTICE  </P> <P> Yes, I am doing my part in conserving water. A few years back when we went  through this same emphasis, people in our area pitched in to do their part,  only to be hit with a higher rate for water because we were using less.  </P> <P> Using less and being penalized? Of course, the rate never came down when water  became more plentiful.  </P> <P> Now tell me how this encourages people to conserve. Will we again be charged a  higher rate at the first sign of our using less water? You can just bet we  will!  </P> <P> MONA BARBOUR  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

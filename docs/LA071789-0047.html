			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCENROE TO MISS DAVIS CUP BECAUSE OF INJURY  </P> <P> The highly anticipated Davis Cup matchup between the United States and West  Germany this weekend took on a new light Sunday with the withdrawal of American  star John McEnroe.  </P> <P> McEnroe, who holds just about every U.S. Davis Cup record for matches played  and victories, withdrew because of tendinitis in his serving shoulder, an  injury that he suffered during a doubles match at Wimbledon. After he hurt his  shoulder at Wimbledon, he lost to Stefan Edberg in three close sets in the  semifinals.  </P> <P> McEnroe's replacement will be Brad Gilbert, the Northern Californian who has  played Davis Cup for team captain Tom Gorman before, who won a bronze medal for  a U.S. team led by Gorman at the '88 Olympics in Seoul and who has a history of  being a difficult opponent for German star Boris Becker. Gilbert has beaten  Becker in three of their four meetings.  </P> <P> The selection of Gilbert over young American star Michael Chang, the Placentia  player who won the French Open in May, has the potential to be controversial.  </P> <P> Gorman, contacted Monday morning in Munich, said that he talked directly to  Chang in the middle of last week, when McEnroe began to indicate he might not  be able to play.  </P> <P> "I talked to Michael and was told he would not be available," Gorman said.  </P> <P> Chang's father, Joe Chang, when reached in Placentia Sunday night, said that he  had heard nothing about McEnroe's inability to play.  </P> <P> "That is news to me," Joe Chang said. "The last we heard, John was healthy and  ready to play."  </P> <P> He also said that his family and Michael had just returned from a fishing trip,  and that his son was mentally and physically tired after having been away from  home for 2 1/2 months.  </P> <P> Gorman said he also spoke to Tim Mayotte, a fast-court specialist who would  appear to be well-suited for competition on the fast Pegulan carpet the match  will be played on in Munich's Olympia Halle Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> "Mostly, I'm concerned with the players who are going to play," Gorman said.  "I'm sure that those who couldn't make it all had valid reasons. The lateness  of this situation made things difficult.  </P> <P> "I'm happy to have Brad Gilbert here. When I called him, he didn't even pause  or ask any questions. He just said, 'When do you want me there?' I really like  that.  </P> <P> "And it has been interesting to watch the German press. You (American press)  have asked more questions about picking Gilbert than eight or so of them did in  a full press conference. They seemed quite concerned about Gilbert. They know  he has beaten Becker a lot, and they know he has also handled Eric Jelen many  times over the years. They see Gilbert as a real threat."  </P> <P> Gorman said that McEnroe started to talk about not being able to play about the  middle of last week, but he needed to have more tests by doctors. Once those  tests were completed Friday, the diagnosis was that he could seriously injure  himself if he tried to play in Munich and that he needed three to six weeks of  rest.  </P> <P> With McEnroe missing, Gilbert will be joined by Andre Agassi to play singles  against Becker and Carl-Uwe Steeb and Robert Seguso and Ken Flach will face  Becker and Jelen in doubles.  </P></p>

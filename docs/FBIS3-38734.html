Addressing a group of 150 people attending a seminar  sponsored by the NATO Defense College in Rome, the pope pointed  out, "Someone, some time, made some decisions which brought  terrible consequences of death, offense, destruction and  mourning."    Speaking in English, the pontiff affirmed that the "shocking  and bloody conflict which is shaking Europe" is making the  continent less certain of itself and warned that "Europe must  remember that its destiny cannot depend only on strategic or  economic interests. It must regain its spirit for the renewal of  its civil, moral and spiritual life," he added.    The ongoing appeals launched by the Holy See and other  religious leaders and "men of good will," he continued, "are  directed to the conscience of those who can do something to  change the course of things. To the present, hope has not been  compensated," he said before turning to prayer for "you and all  those who are in the service of the cause of peace."    Concluding his remarks, John Paul said, "Peace is a word and  a desire closed in the hearts of everyone, an essential asset on  which depends the well-being of the individual and the progress  of society and civilization."</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> President Bush and other Republican leaders who say they want to reach out to  blacks should "put up or shut up" on civil rights, Democratic National Chairman  Ron Brown told the NAACP on the fifth and final day of the group's annual  convention in Detroit. "We hear new words from the Republican Party," said  Brown, the first black to head the Democratic National Committee. "In politics,  as in poker, there's a phrase for it. I believe it's time that we tell George  Bush, Dan Quayle, (Housing and Urban Development Secretary) Jack Kemp, (GOP  National Chairman) Lee Atwater and the rest of those Republicans it's time to  put up or shut up." Kemp and Quayle addressed the convention earlier in the  week.  </P></p>

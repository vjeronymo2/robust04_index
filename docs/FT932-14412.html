			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / New trial in AMD and Intel dispute A US COURT ruling has opened the the way for Advanced Micro Devices to compete with Intel in the lucrative market for microprocessor chips used in the latest generation of personal computers. This follows a US judge's decision to set aside the verdict reached last year in a copyright dispute between the two companies and order a new trial. The ruling means AMD could immediately begin production of a clone of Intel's top-selling 486 microprocessor chip, rather than having to develop its own version of the 'microcode' software instructions that control the chip. The company is expected to announce its plans today. Competition between Intel and AMD in the 486 market could lead to lower prices for the devices and personal computers in which they are used, analysts predicted. AMD already sells its own version of Intel's earlier 386 microprocessor and has claimed more than half of the world market for that device. However, the 386 is rapidly being displaced by the more powerful 486 as the standard microprocessor for desk-top computers. AMD has developed its own version of the 486, but has been prevented from introducing the product by the outcome of last year's trial, in which the court rejected its claims that it had the right to use Intel's microcode under the terms of a 1976 agreement between the two companies.</p>

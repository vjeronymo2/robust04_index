			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Markets freed to attract investors Market liberalisation to attract foreign investors is the most important policy trend of the 1990s for international investment. But the greater freedom this gives multinationals needs to be matched by the assumption of greater social responsibilities, according to the World Investment Report. The completion of the Uruguay Round of global talks, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the single European market, not to mention increasing numbers of bilateral investment treaties - 64 in 1993 - have reinforced national policies of boosting foreign direct investment (FDI), the report says. However, while government approaches to FDI have converged, the process has been far from homogenous. The report warns that as a result foreign investors may focus on the differences in FDI regimes, increasing the scope for 'policy competition' between governments. Unctad identifies three main elements of liberalisation of FDI policies: the tempering or removal of restrictions on foreign investors, for instance relating to ownership or performance of foreign subsidiaries; the establishment of standards for the treatment of foreign investors, notably by according them 'national treatment' on a par with domestic companies and by strengthening legal protection; the introduction of regulations aimed at improving market efficiency and promoting broader economic and social concerns. These include competition rules, prudential supervision of banking and financial services, intellectual property protection, consumer, health and environmental standards and so on. The report notes growing support for a system of international rules governing the activities of multinationals. The OECD is now working on a new multilateral investment agreement and there are also proposals to negotiate international investment rules within the planned World Trade Organisation.</p>

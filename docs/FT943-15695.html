			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Lords warn on job references: Managers encouraged to watch their words in assessment of staff The legal scales tipped in favour of job hunters yesterday when the House of Lords ruled that employers have a duty to take reasonable care when writing references about former staff members. The case opens the possibility of court actions against companies on the grounds that they have been negligent in assessing the conduct and behaviour of employees, so damaging their chances of gaining work with other organisations. Although legal experts and companies were divided about the practical impact of the Law Lords' ruling, the case seems certain to lead to managers thinking more deeply about the implications of the thousands of references written every day. One effect, however, could be to encourage the practice of giving confidential references over the telephone, making it virtually impossible for disgruntled employees to bring legal cases. In yesterday's opinion, the Law Lords ruled, by a majority of four to one, that Guardian Assurance, a subsidiary of the Guardian Royal Exchange investment group, had not taken sufficient care when writing a reference on Mr Graham Spring, a former insurance salesman. The reference stated that Mr Spring had 'little or no integrity and could not be regarded as honest'. Mr Spring claimed this was untrue and that the reference meant he could not get another insurance job. Mr Tony Morgan, director of the Industrial Society, a body promoting good employment practice, said: 'A reference can affect the rest of somebody's life, so integrity is vital. This ruling will focus employers on good practice, which is to provide references which are fair and authentic, not opinionated and anecdotal.' Mr Witold Pawlak, Mr Spring's barrister, said the decision was of 'immense importance' and 'fills a gap in the law'. Mr Fraser Younson, vice-president of the Employment Lawyers Association, said employers already had to be circumspect in giving references because they owed a duty of care to the recipient company. The Law Lords had now extended that duty to employees. The effect could be that employers adopt a more tentative approach to references. The judgment's most immediate impact is likely to be in the insurance industry, which faces legal action by hundreds of former sales agents who have lost their jobs in the past four years. Other industries which have suffered in recent years from allegations about damaging references include accountancy, medicine and the legal profession. A practical difficulty in future cases, however, may be that it is often difficult for an employee to see his or her reference, which is normally given confidentially to potential employers. In Mr Spring's case, it took five court legal hearings before a High Court judge ordered GRE to hand over the reference. GRE said about Mr Spring's reference: 'It is fair to say it should have been crafted in a different way.' The legal outcome for Mr Spring is still hazy since his case has to return to the Court of Appeal for more judgments which may settle his claim for damages, thought to amount to tens of thousands of pounds.</p>

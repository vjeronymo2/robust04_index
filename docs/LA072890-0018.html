			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'THIRTYSOMETHING' FLAP  </P> <P> Thanks to Howard Rosenberg for his accurate sentiments in his July 19 column  "ABC Pulls Plug on a Rerun of 'thirtysomething.'  </P> <P> "  </P> <P> The rejected show, which had a scene of two men conversing in bed after having  sex, was one of the stronger ones, and the actors made it funny as well as  real.  </P> <P> It might very well be true that by not running it now, the producers can do  equally strong shows in the future, but somehow I don't believe that. It is  cowardice (and probably not effective business) to let the extreme right wing  of this country dictate television content.  </P> <P> DALE REYNOLDS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

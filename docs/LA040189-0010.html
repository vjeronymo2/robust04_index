			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAUDI KING ENDS CAIRO VISIT, PLEDGES TO SUPPORT EGYPT'S RETURN TO ARAB LEAGUE  </P> <P> King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, winding up the first visit to Cairo by a Saudi  monarch in 15 years, Friday pledged his influential support for Egypt's  reinstatement in the Arab League and endorsed the recent political concessions  made by the PLO as a "rare opportunity" to negotiate peace in the Middle East.  </P> <P> The Saudi monarch, in an interview with Egyptian newspaper editors, also  confirmed that Riyadh will help finance the reconstruction of an Iraqi nuclear  reactor destroyed by Israel in a 1981 air raid.  </P> <P> Both Israeli and U.S. officials have warned that Iraq, like its antagonistic  neighbor Iran, is trying to develop a nuclear weapons capability. While that  effort was set back by the Israeli air strike against a French-made nuclear  reactor near Baghdad nearly eight years ago, Rear Adm. Thomas A. Brooks,  director of naval intelligence, testified recently before the House Armed  Services Committee in Washington that Iraq was again "actively pursuing" a  nuclear capability.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crash Nuclear Program  </P> <P> Asked Friday about a Washington Post article quoting Israeli sources as saying  that Iraq is engaged in a crash program to develop a nuclear warhead, President  Bush said in Washington: "I don't want to give credence to the fact that Iraq  is in the process of building nuclear weapons. I cannot confirm that. Anytime  you see representations that there will be nuclear proliferation, it has got to  concern us."  </P> <P> King Fahd, in his remarks to the newspaper editors, which were published  Friday, denied that the reactor in question was meant to manufacture nuclear  weapons, which, he noted, Israel is widely assumed to already possess.  </P> <P> Affirming Saudi Arabia's "readiness to help rebuild" the Iraqi nuclear plant,  Fahd proposed that Israel and Iraq both agree to inspections by the  Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency to "determine which (reactor)  is for military uses: the one in Israel or the (Iraqi) one. . . . "  </P> <P> The Saudi monarch was referring to Israel's top-secret nuclear facility at  Dimona, which successive Israeli governments have refused to allow the IAEA to  inspect.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flurry of Interest  </P> <P> While Fahd's remarks about Iraq's postwar nuclear development plans provoked a  flurry of interest among diplomats and other observers here, it was his strong  and seemingly unequivocal endorsement of Egypt's readmission into the 22-member  Arab League that was, from the Egyptian point of view, the most important  outcome of his long-anticipated visit.  </P> <P> "Egypt's presence within the Arab group is indispensable . . . to effective  joint Arab action," Fahd said in a joint communique issued with Egyptian  President Hosni Mubarak at the end of his five-day visit.  </P> <P> The Arab League suspended Egypt's membership 10 years ago after Mubarak's  predecessor, the late President Anwar Sadat, signed a separate peace treaty  with Israel. Although most Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, resumed  diplomatic relations with Cairo more than a year ago, Egypt's formal return to  the Arab fold has been stymied by opposition from Syria, which the normally  skittish Saudis have been reluctant to antagonize.  </P> <P> In the complex currents of inter-Arab politics, however, several recent shifts  have emerged to prod the Saudis into taking a bolder stand on this issue.  </P> <P> The most significant of these, Egyptian and other Arab analysts said, was an  agreement last February among Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and Yemen to form the Arab  Cooperation Council, a loose economic confederation.  </P> <P> While the economic significance of this grouping is doubtful, given the  near-bankrupt state of its members' economies, its political point was not lost  on the Saudis, whose regional influence could be eclipsed by the emergence of  any post-Persian Gulf War alliance between Iraq and Egypt, the two largest Arab  military powers in the Middle East.  </P> <P> Egypt and Iraq have been pressing the Saudis for more economic assistance, and  the fact that Fahd's decision to visit both countries -- he stopped off in Iraq  before coming to Egypt -- followed the Arab Cooperation Council's formation was  not mere coincidence, a senior Egyptian official admitted privately.  </P> <P> "The Saudis decided to come when they saw that Egypt's weight was being  siphoned off toward Iraq and Jordan," this official said somewhat gleefully.  </P> <P> The joint Egyptian-Saudi communique said the two sides had agreed to establish  a committee to increase economic "cooperation," but there was no confirmation  of local press reports suggesting that Fahd had ordered Saudi banks to lend  Egypt $2 billion to meet a serious shortage of wheat and other essential  commodities this year. There was also no indication that Fahd had brought Egypt  a quick-fix check of several hundred million dollars, as had been rumored.  </P> <P> However, if Fahd's visit failed to meet Egyptian expectations on the financial  side, it clearly boosted Mubarak's prestige in several other ways, diplomats  and Egyptian officials agreed.  </P> <P> "Fahd in Cairo, more than any other single visit or event, symbolizes Egypt's  return to the Arab fold," a Western diplomat said.  </P> <P> By throwing his substantial weight behind Egypt's quest for readmittance into  the Arab League, Fahd has virtually assured that Egypt's suspension will be  lifted at the next Arab League summit, diplomats said.  </P> <P> Because it speaks directly to Egyptians' sense of pride, the gesture of the  visit is considered extremely important to Mubarak, who is facing growing  discontent at home over inflation, food shortages and other increasingly  visible signs of Egypt's worsening economic crisis. Indeed, the effusive,  almost fulsome, fuss that Egypt made over Fahd seemed to be aimed at least as  much at boosting Mubarak's image as Fahd's, analysts said.  </P> <P> The support the Saudi monarch gave to Egypt's diplomatic efforts to convene a  Middle East peace conference was also seen here as strengthening Mubarak's hand  on the eve of his first visit to Washington since President Bush took office,  the analysts added.  </P> <P> Praising Bush as a "far-sighted thinker" who will "spare no effort to solve the  Middle East problem," Fahd told the newspaper editors that Saudi Arabia "fully  supports . . . the constructive position" on the peace process that Mubarak  will try to persuade Bush to embrace when they meet in Washington on Monday.  </P> <P> This position, the joint communique added, calls for the convening of an  international peace conference, under the auspices of the U.N. Security  Council, as "the only formula" that can lead to peace in the Middle East.  </P> <P> The communique also endorsed the recent decisions by the Palestine Liberation  Organization to renounce terrorism and recognize Israel's right to exist as a  "positive development in the Palestinian position (that) offers a rare  opportunity all the parties should seize to reach a just and comprehensive  settlement" to the Middle East conflict.  </P> <P> Mubarak held talks last week with King Hussein of Jordan and PLO Chairman  Yasser Arafat to agree on the tack he will take in Washington. Now, with the  added weight of Saudi Arabia's support, he will go to the White House with the  enhanced stature of spokesman for an influential Arab consensus on the peace  process, Egyptian officials said.  </P></p>

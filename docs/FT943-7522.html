			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Revised GDP data show stronger recovery The recession was not quite as deep, and the recovery has not been quite as weak, as previously thought, according to figures released yesterday by the Central Statistical Office. Revisions to past gross domestic product data show that output fell 2.1 per cent in 1991, the worst year of the recession, rather than the 2.3 per cent previously estimated. From the peak of 1990 to the trough of 1992, the total fall in output is now estimated to have been 3.6 per cent rather than 3.9 per cent. Economic growth last year is now estimated at 2 per cent from the previous published figure of 1.9 per cent. Growth in the first two quarters of this year has also been revised upwards to 0.9 and 1.0 per cent respectively. Growth in GDP, on the expenditure measure, results from a combination of consumption, investment and the net trade position. In the second quarter, trade led the way, with net exports contributing 0.6 per cent of GDP, as the visible trade deficit fell from Pounds 2.9bn to Pounds 2.1bn. Investment fell 0.3 per cent in the second quarter. But the CSO said this was partly due to an easing of the very high demand for cars and aircraft in the first quarter. Compared with the same period last year second quarter investment - or gross domestic fixed capital formation - was 6.4 per cent ahead. Companies also reduced stocks by Pounds 694m in the second quarter after destocking by Pounds 696m in the first three months of the year. Consumers' expenditure rose 0.4 per cent between the first and second quarters and was 3 per cent ahead year-on-year. However, economists pointed to the slowing pace of growth in consumer spending, which grew 1.2 and 1 per cent respectively in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Average earnings actually fell between the first and second quarters because of the high level of bonuses in the first three months of the year. Although employment rose slightly, the net result was a 0.1 per cent quarterly increase in total employment income. Inflationary pressures, as measured by the implied GDP deflator, remained weak. The deflator, a measure of the costs of goods and services produced in the UK, rose 0.1 per cent quarter-on-quarter and 1.9 per cent year-on-year. The CSO also produced new information on external trade, in particular on invisible items. The current account deficit for last year was revised down to Pounds 10.3bn from the earlier estimate of Pounds 10.4bn and backward revisions were also made to the deficits in 1990, 1991 and 1992. The changed information on invisibles stemmed partly from a Bank of England survey of gilt ownership. This found that overseas gilt ownership was more widespread than previously thought, with the consequence that the invisible surplus is reduced by higher interest payments on those gilts. The gilts factor caused the 1990 current account deficit to widen Pounds 767m to Pounds 19bn and the 1991 surplus increased by Pounds 524m to Pounds 8.2bn. In 1992 and 1993, however, this factor was more than offset by additional earnings from banks, particularly in the interest rate swaps market. The 1992 deficit accordingly narrowed to Pounds 9.8bn from the previously estimated Pounds 10.2bn. Partly due to exchange-rate movements, net external assets at the end of 1993 were Pounds 20.3bn, up from Pounds 10.6bn at the end of 1992.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Allianz's east German unit likely to lose DM1.5bn ALLIANZ, Europe's largest insurer, is likely to make operating losses in excess of DM1.5bn (Dollars 897m) on Deutsche Versicherungs, its east German operation, before the business starts trading profitably early in 1996. The scale of the losses, disclosed yesterday by Mr Uwe Haasen, head of Allianz's domestic insurance operations, significantly exceeds analysts' estimates of the cost of Allianz's east German expansion. However, since the group estimates do not include DM711m paid for Deutsche Versicherungs or take account of the DM900m poured into the eastern operations since the acquisition, it is possible that Allianz will not show a positive return on its east German investment until the next century. Mr Haasen yesterday conceded that the acquisition was not a 'normal purchase of a company'. He said it should be seen as a strategic move to 'reoccupy' a market from which west German insurers have been excluded since the Second World War. He argued that the east represented a 25 per cent increase to the German market, and that over time the insurance needs of east Germans would grow in line with those of west Germans - at the time of reunification in 1990 Germans in the east spent some 10 per cent of what west Germans spent on insurance. Profits would be generated as east German premium rates adjusted to west German levels, and as productivity was increased, mainly through the staged reduction of Deutsche Versicherungs 14,000-strong workforce, Mr Haasen said. Around 10 per cent of the workforce will go this year. But Mr Haasen warned that the difficulties would not be over, even at the end of the century, saying it would take longer than that to strengthen the company's finances by building up reserves. Mr Haasen indicated that Deutsche Versicherungs's operating losses in 1991 would be in the region of DM550m, following a DM231m loss in the second half of 1990. Losses this year would be DM350m, dropping to between DM220 and DM250m in 1993, and DM200m in 1994 before breaking even in 1995. Pure insurance business in the west is expected to make profits for 1991 of a similar level to the DM265m of 1990.</p>

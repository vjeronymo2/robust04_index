			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Making it easier to calculate your own tax bill - Self assessment A raft of changes to the tax system were outlined as part of a move towards self assessment. The 1994 Finance Act introduced from the tax year 1996-97, new rules for filing tax returns including the option for people to calculate their own tax bill from the figures on their return, or to ask the Inland Revenue to make the calculation for them. To make this easier, the complex preceding-year basis which was used for taxing income from self-employment and some investment income was abolished, and payment dates were aligned for all income tax levied by assessment, and for capital gains tax. This allows all tax to be brought together in one bill. The measures, to be introduced in the Finance Bill, include reform and simplification of income tax, the basis of taxation of income from property; simplification of the procedures for taxing non-residents and align them with self assessment; provision for employers to give their employees information they will need to complete tax returns; introduction of anti-avoidance legislation to deter artificial manipulation of profits and income to take advantage of the transitional provisions introducing the current year basis of assessment for tax on the self-employed; plus various other changes to simplify the taxation system. These proposals represent the second phase of the changes necessary for a fundamental reform of personal tax administration. A key element of the proposals to make the tax system for the self-employed and those who receive investment income simpler and fairer, is the introduction of the current-year basis of assessment for all types of income. To permit the move from the preceding-year basis to the current-year basis, without taxing businesses and income twice, it is necessary to tax profits and income arising in the transitional period at an average rate reflecting the length of the period. Measures to ensure that employers give their employees the information to complete their tax returns after 6 April 1997 have been brought forward. employers should provide the Inland Revenue and their employees by 6 July, with details of expenses payments and benefits in kind provided in the previous tax year unless a dispensation has been given by their Inspector of Taxes. This would be a change from the rules under which the employer is required to provide the details to the Inland Revenue only and has to do so by 6 June; such details should include a calculation by the employer of a cash equivalent for any benefit in kind provided to the employee; the current penalty regime for failure to make returns to the Inland Revenue should be extended to apply where employers fail to provide the required information to employees; a time limit - 19 May following the end of the tax year - should be set for the provision by the employer of details of pay and tax deducted to employees. Most of the measures will be effected through PAYE Regulations, although some will be in legislation proposed for the 1995 Finance Bill. The 1994 Finance Act contains provisions for the introduction of the current-year basis of assessment for the profits of the self-employed and other income that is not taxed at source. Under the new basis, income arising in any year is taxed for that year. The old basis broadly taxed the income arising in the previous tax year. The rules for the transition from the previous year to the current year basis ensure broadly that there is no double taxation of business profits or other income. Other measures include changes to interest relief. As a consequence of the proposed changes to the taxation of income from property, existing provisions for allowing interest relief in respect of commercially let property will be changed. From 6 April 1995 interest payable in respect of a property letting business will be allowable as a deduction in computing the profits of the business. The rules - under which interest paid is allowed as a deduction from letting income, provided the property is let at a commercial rent (or is available for letting) for more than 26 weeks in a period of 52 weeks - will be repealed. In addition, minor amendments will be made to the provisions of the mortgage interest relief at source (MIRAS) scheme to reflect changes in other legislation. These will have effect from the time the 1995 Finance Bill receives Royal Assent. New rules will be introduced for the assessment and collection of tax on trust income and gains where there is more than one trustee. Anything done by or to any liable trustee will be treated as done by or to all the liable trustees. This means that any liable trustee will be able to make a return and self assessment and these will be treated as satisfying the tax obligations of all the liable trustees. Conversely liable trustees will be accountable for errors, failures or omissions in meeting their tax obligations. The new rules will take effect from the 1996-97 tax year. The tax treatment of residuary beneficiaries of deceased persons' estates will be simplified, making it easier for them to self assess. From 6 April 1995 payments to beneficiaries of the income of the residue of an estate will be taxable in the year of receipt. There will be no spreading of liabilities across the administration period. The new rules will apply to estates in the course of administration at 6 April 1995 as well as to new estates. At the same time technical defects will be corrected in the legislation applying to foreign income dividends and certain forms of deemed income received by personal representatives of deceased persons' estates, and to payments made out of such income to residuary beneficiaries. Further details of the changes will be provided when the Finance Bill is published in 1995. Most of the changes will come into effect for the tax year 1996-97, the first year of self assessment. The main exceptions are the changes to the rules for taxing income from property and the rules for beneficiaries of estates which apply from 1995-96.</p>

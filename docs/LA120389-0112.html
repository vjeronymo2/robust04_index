			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL THE BOWL GAMES;  </P> <P> DONS COOL OFF, THEN PUT HEAT ON MOORPARK FOR 31-28 WIN  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago struggled early in the opener of the Orange County Bowl  doubleheader at Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> First of all, the Dons were wearing black uniforms on a warm, sunny afternoon  and got tired. Then, after Moorpark took a 21-0 lead in the first quarter, some  of the Don players started to argue on the sidelines.  </P> <P> But thanks in part to a spirited halftime speech by Coach Dave Ogas, Rancho  Santiago rallied for a 31-28 victory.  </P> <P> The Dons, who trailed, 21-10, at halftime, were led by freshman running back  Estrus Crayton and quarterback Scott Wood.  </P> <P> Crayton, a first-team J.C. Grid-Wire All-American, had a 33-yard run that set  up a five-yard scoring pass from Wood to tight end Kyle Lynch to cut the lead  to 21-17 with 13:19 left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> That's when a Moorpark turnover helped Rancho Santiago take control of the  game.  </P> <P> Raider quarterback Jayson Merrill completed a pass to Rick Wright at the Don  15. Wright broke a tackle and was headed toward the end zone when the ball was  stripped away by Dave Spoolstra. It bounced into the end zone where Tony  Gonzalez recovered it for a touchback.  </P> <P> Crayton ran 80 yards for a touchdown on the next play and Rancho Santiago led,  24-21, with 8:11 left in the quarter. Crayton, who caught a screen pass and  turned it into a 45-yard gain in the first quarter, rushed for an Orange County  Bowl record of 193 yards in 24 carries and was named the most valuable player.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago scored its final touchdown when Wood broke a tackle then  completed a two-yard pass to Lynch on fourth down. The score gave the Dons a  31-21 lead with 6:58 left.  </P> <P> Moorpark (9-2) scored with 4:59 left to cut the lead to 31-28, but it didn't  get the ball again until there were only nine seconds left. The Raiders' final  desperation pass was intercepted by Scott McMahon.  </P> <P> The win gave Rancho Santiago a 10-1 record and capped the college's most  successful season since 1962 when the Dons were 10-0.  </P> <P> Moorpark (9-2) scored on the first scrimmage play of the game when Merrill  connected with Wright on a 75-yard pass play. The Dons were forced to punt and  Moorpark scored again on a seven-yard run by Freddie Bradley.  </P> <P> The Raiders then recovered an on-side kick. Moorpark scored on a four-yard run  by Marc Monestine with 3:15 left in the quarter and led.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago set a game record with 516 yards in total offense. Wood was 25  of 39 for 307 yards and three touchdowns. STEVE KRESAL  </P></p>

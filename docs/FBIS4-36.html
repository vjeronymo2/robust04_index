			<p>SUMMARY                                Pyongyang has used this year's commemoration of President Kim Il-  song's birthday to signal ongoing interest in resuming the  dialogue with Washington on the nuclear issue.  Pyongyang media  so far have not been observed to report or comment on the arrival  of the Patriot missiles in the South.                           END SUMMARY      The most direct indication of Pyongyang's desire to resume talks  with the United States came in a 14 April KCNA report of a  meeting between North Korean officials and foreign visitors  invited for the birthday celebration, including representatives  of The Washington Times and CNN.  KCNA depicted the North Korean  delegation, which was headed by party secretary Kim Yong-sun, as  insisting that DPRK-U.S. talks "must" be resumed and as  contending that the nuclear issue is a matter to be solved  between the DPRK and the United States.  KCNA further cited the  North Koreans as affirming that there is no change in Pyongyang's  twin declared objectives of resolving the nuclear issue and  improving bilateral relations with Washington.      Rhetorical Restraint      Pyongyang's latest, albeit indirect, call for talks with the  United States was accompanied by a measure of rhetorical restraint  at commemorative birthday events. Premier Kang Song-san, keynote  speaker at the main meeting marking President Kim's 82nd birthday,  used the term "U.S. imperialists" only in reference to the Korean  war (Pyongyang radio, 14 April).  His harshest indirect attack on  Washington came in his standard charge that "the imperialists and  reactionaries" are carrying out "antisocialist and anti-DPRK  maneuvers" now -"more viciously than ever before."  The  commemorative editorial in the party paper Nodong Sinmun was even  more restrained, eschewing the term "U.S. imperialists"  altogether (Pyongyang radio, 15 April).     In the past, Pyongyang did not hesitate to use Kim Il-song's  birthday to ratchet up its war rhetoric.  For instance, last  year--in the crisis atmosphere following the Team Spirit U.S.-ROK  joint military exercise in March and Pyongyang's announcement of  withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty the same  month--Premier Kang in his keynote speech charged that "dark  clouds of nuclear war' had been created by "the U.S.  imperialists' reckless maneuvers" and  had led to "a touch-and-go  situation" (Pyongyang radio, 14 April 1993).      Treatment of South      In sharp contrast to the measure of circumspect ion shown toward  Washington, Pyongyang continued to treat Seoul in harsh tones.  Kang  in his speech accused "the flunkeyist, nation-selling Kim Yong-sam  ring, which flatters and submits to outside forces" of "recklessly"  engaging in unspecified "provocative acts" after having lost "the  ability to reason."  Similarly, in the latest attack on the South  Korean government, Nodong Sinmun on 18 April held Seoul responsible  for the current stalemate over the nuclear issue (KCNA, 18 April).  It accused the South of "stalling" DPRK-U.S. talks in a bid to  "obstruct" resolution of the nuclear issue and "accelerate"  development of its own nuclear arms while still under the U.S.  nuclear umbrella.  Pyongyang media have so far ignored Seoul's  decision to withdraw the demand for an inter-Korean exchange of  special envoys as a prerequisite to U.S.-North Korea high-level  talks.      Implications      Pyongyang media treatment of events surrounding  Kim Il-song's birthday appeared designed to convey the impression  that the regime still hopes to resolve the nuclear issue through  dialogue with Washington and that, at least for now, talks with  Seoul are not on its agenda.  Pyongyang could harden its stance  toward Washington over the deployment of the Patriot missiles.   (AUTHOR:  YIM.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Abidjan, Feb 27 (AFP)--The Togolese Government  Sunday [27 February] indirectly criticised France, Germany and  the United States for putting "pressure" on it to publish full  results of Togo's first multi-party elections and to respect the  outcome.    In a statement sent to AFP here, the government called for  the Togolese Supreme Court to be allowed to determine the  results of last Sunday's second round of polling "completely  independently, without any pressure."    After the National Electoral Commission on Wednesday refused  to publish the full count, Commission president Garba Sipohon  acknowledged all the votes had been counted but said the results  would be sent to the Supreme Court "for evaluation."    The court has until March 13 to decide the outcome; however  a  new parliament is due to be installed by Tuesday.    Two opposition parties, Action Committee for Renewal (CAR)  and Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD), claimed they won 43 of  the 81 seats.    Under the constitution, an absolute majority would entitle  them to form a new government.    The Commission, for its part, proclaimed only 76 deputies  "provisionally elected": 33 from CAR, 5 from UTD, 35 from  Togolese People's Rally (RPT, which backs President Gnassingbe  Eyadema who has ruled Togo since 1967), 2 from the pro-Eyadema  Union for Justice and Democracy (UJD), and one Centrist.    It failed to confirm the election of three CAR candidates  and  2 UTD candidates in constituencies where RPT alleged  irregularities took place.    Unless the row is settled by Tuesday, only 76 deputies will  take their seats in the new parliament.    Meanwhile the RPT has claimed to be the leading party in the  future parliament, based on the "provisional" results, and  called for "its just due in the future government."    The government in its statement Sunday called for the  constitution and electoral code to be respected "as is the  tradition in each of the states represented in the international  committee" monitoring the elections.    Officials from Burkina Faso, Egypt, France, Germany and the  United States sit on this panel.    France, Germany and the United States have said the  elections  were generally free and fair despite some irregularities and  violence. All have called on the Lome government to respect the  results.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Third and last installment of an interview with 'Abdollah </F> Nuri, a leader of Tajikistan's Islamic Movement Party, with an  unidentified JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI correspondent; place and date not  given]    [Text] [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How do you assess the West's  stances on and the role of Russia in Tajikistan's civil war?    [Nuri] Tajikistan's problem is not an ethnic, regional, or  national one. It is not related to Tajikistan alone; it is a  world problem. In other words, the war in Tajikistan does not  involve only the Kulabs and the Khojands. The center of this  war was all the Eastern and Western powers. When the first  gathering was held [not further specified], more than 70 world  correspondents came to Tajikistan and talked with them. They  told all the Islamists that despite communist pressures they had  preserved their religion and that if the expansion of Islam is  not prevented in Tajikistan, the victory of the Muslims would be  definite. Therefore, this was a plot that was hatched by the  superpowers of the world. This was a plot that was engineered  by the Zionists, executed by the United States, and implemented  by Russia. Islam Karimov told the British that if Russia and  Uzbekistan did not interfere in the Tajikistan war, an Islamic  rule would be established. In other words, he proudly said:  Since I, too, am someone who opposes Islamic regimes in the  region, I am striving to annihilate Islamic fundamentalism.  Thus, the Tajikistan problem is a world problem and the  superpowers do not want an Islamic rule to be established. I  have repeatedly said that Tajikistan is the door to Islam and  the base of infidels. If the door to Islam is opened all the  area that was formerly Muslim will turn to Islam and it will  spread to all countries, but the infidels do not want this door  to be opened. Thus, they have formed a barricade here from  which they can attack regional areas; namely Afghanistan,  Pakistan, and Iran, as well as other countries.    The extremely weak economic situation in Tajikistan has made  the communist leaders sell the country's independence.  Abdullodzhanov, chairman of the Council of Ministers, said that  we even want to adhere to Russia. Some 70 percent of  Tajikistan's budget is supplied by Russia. That country wants  to take this area to revive the former Soviet Union. Also,  there is a threat against the United States here because some  days ago Russia signed a military pact with Kuwait for the sale  of arms and thus paved the way for its presence there. The  creation of a small Russia in northern Afghanistan is not only a  threat to the people in this country but to the West as well.  The United States thinks that Russia is under its control  today. But Russia is doing what it wants, such as selling arms  to other countries. By taking Tajikistan, Russia wants to  continue its plans and gain access to warm water ports, either  through Afghanistan or Tajikistan. In this case, the world will  be placed under Russia's control. What Russia is now doing is  against U.S. policies as well.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In view of the fact that the peace talks  have reached an impasse, what plans does the Islamic Movement  have? Does it consider talks with Russia and with the Tajik  Government to be in its best interest?    [Nuri] The Islamic Movement and all its officials will not  refrain from any type of talks. In other words, they want  talks. But these talks should not be a political game. They  should be genuine talks that will benefit the nation. The  Islamic Movement wants to hold talks with Russia. Before  talking with the communist leaders of Tajikistan, we want to  hold talks with Russia because it has been the cause of many  adversities in our country and the entire world knows that 70  percent of Tajikistan's budget is supplied by Russia.  Therefore, talking with the communist leaders of Tajikistan is  meaningless. We have held more than 16 rounds of talks during  the civil war since we knew that this war was not in the  interest of the nation and it would not benefit either Islam or  the people. We tried our best to make the people understand the  truth. But it was obvious that several power-hungry people were  bent on destroying everything. The person who was responsible  for the failure of the talks was Rakhmanov, who is the leader of  Tajikistan today. When parliament was formed in Khodzhand,  Rakhmanov tried to sweet-talk the people and called for peace.  He gathered all the commanders together and made peace among  them. We decided to end the bloodshed and to let peace be  established. We had a plan that Rakhmanov did not accept.    The mujahidin commanders had told Rakhmanov that if he came  to Dushanbe he would be welcomed with flowers, but he preferred  to come with bloodshed. With his arrival in Dushanbe, murder  and plunder started. House searches began and people were  massacred. This happened because these people do not do their  own thinking. Everything depends on Russia. This is why we want  to hold talks with Russia so that we can understand its leaders'  thoughts and stances and so that they will understand us, too.    We fully believe in divine promise. We are fully confident  of the spirit of the mujahidin. Even if this war continues for  years, we will win. The communists are condemned to defeat by  the mujahidin because the communists have never been on the  front lines of the war. They bring the Muslims and the children  of Muslims to fight. It does not make any difference to them.  We have been told that the Jews are teaching their women and  children English so that they will be ready when the time comes  to flee and go to America or other places. Their children are  not sent to war so that they will not be killed. It is the  children of the people of Tajikistan--90 percent of the Tajiks  are Muslim--who go to war. There may be communist forces in  some places, but it is mainly the children of the Muslims who  are involved in the war. This is a world plot based on letting  Muslims be killed by Muslims. Nevertheless, we believe that we  can hold talks and solve problems through political means.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What percent of the Tajik people are in  the Islamic Movement and what role do Tajikistan's national and  democratic forces play in the movement?    [Nuri] When the Islamic Movement was an official party known  as the "Islamic Movement Party," it had its special members and  cadres. But when we emigrated, this movement became a general  movement of Tajikistan. In 1975 the Islamic Movement adopted an  organizational form, while before that there were dispersed  movements. When communist rule came to Tajikistan, the elders  and the 'ulema continued this movement clandestinely.    In 1975, we gathered all the people's views into one place  and prepared them for a struggle and for the expansion of Islam  and of Islamic rights. Today, we can say that all the Muslims  who are living for Islam at home or abroad are members of the  movement.    The role of the national and democratic forces in the  Islamic  Movement, and especially in northern Afghanistan, is very good.  In other words, the democratic and national forces and all the  expert forces who were employed in communist establishments and  factories are all under the umbrella of the Islamic Movement  today and are working with us. They also shoulder important  responsibilities in the movement. They believe that in  Tajikistan only Islam can solve the political, economic, and  social problems of the people and that no other group or  organization can do anything. Other organizations also support  us. Through many efforts and struggles by the Islamic Movement  in Afghanistan, which has given all it could, we have been able  to establish a coordination center in Moscow. In short, I  should say that in our current struggles all the ethnic groups,  parties, and organizations support us.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is your opinion of the human  rights groups and their lack of support for the just demands of  the Islamic Movement of Tajikistan and of the Muslims?    [Nuri] The behavior of human rights organizations toward us  is surprising. There is a UN High Commission, which should help  refugees and should not be dependent on any world policy. It  should not differentiate among refugees, whether they are  Tajiks, Uzbeks, communists, or Muslims. The UN Charter states  that a calamity-stricken refugee should receive unconditional  support.    But, unfortunately there are 40,000 refugees in Tanduz  [place  name as received]. Only 8,000 of them were assisted by the  United Nations. This assistance was stopped later on. For  example, there are refugees in Mazar-e Sharif who are under  Dostam's control. They have been assisted. But the refugees in  Emam Saheb and Tash Kurgan [place name as received], who were  helped up to a point, were taken to Bandar-e Shirkhan on the  Tajik-Afghan border to make them return to Tajikistan. They  were told that anyone who wanted assistance should go to  Bandar-e Shirkhan. Some refugees went there and were placed  under UN control. They then encouraged them to return to  Tajikistan, but without promising them security. You, too,  heard that many people who were repatriated were executed. The  Medecins Sans Frontieres Organization announced that Muslim  Tajiks in Tuz who did not give in to communism were massacred.  They were the ones who reported on the dire and restless  situation in the area. But they are still encouraging the  people to return. We cannot say that it is the UN employees who  are to blame because others are also not pursuing UN laws, but  there are between 40,000 and 41,000 refugees in Tanduz who are  not receiving any assistance.    It is as though this organization does not officially  recognize the refugees. Among their rights, which are not  recognized, are education, health, and the protection of  children. In their opinion, a needy person is someone who is  not a Muslim and someone who professes Islam is not a human  being. If a girl shoots at Husni Mubarak, the United Nations  and the correspondents of the world will report on this  extensively. But when children, women, and men are killed in  wars and when young and old die of malaria or of other diseases,  no one says anything. We have sent a letter to the UN offices  in Mazar-e Sharif and in Pakistan and to Mr. Butrus-Ghali  calling for humanitarian assistance for the refugees, but we  have not received any reply yet.    With the help of UN personnel, the water of a reservoir in  Mazar-e Sharif, which was used by refugees, was poisoned and in  one day 32 children and 200 others died. Everyone knew about  this, but nothing was done. Only the head of the refugees there  was deceived. Thus, the behavior of human rights organizations  toward the Tajik refugees has not been good until now.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What are you asking from regional  Islamic  countries?    [Nuri] As I have stated, the Tajikistan problem is not a  problem in our country alone. It is a problem that is linked to  all the Muslim countries. We should not ignore this. For  example, it has been a year since Tajiks began living under dire  conditions in Tajikistan and northern Afghanistan. There are  about 100,000 refugees in Afghanistan, some of whom do not have  shelter. These refugees have not been officially recognized by  the Afghan Government until now, and politically they are not  even considered full refugees. No Islamic country in the world  has recognized them as refugees. No reports are heard on radio  and television on these people and their problems. Let them not  help because we know that the world is under pressure by the  superpowers. Also, the Islamic countries too are being  pressured by superpowers. They cannot overtly help the jihad in  Tajikistan today.</p>

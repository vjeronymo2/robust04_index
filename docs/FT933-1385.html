			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Seaside spiders sweat it out POISONOUS purple spiders with 'an unpleasant bite' have spread along the south and east coasts of England during recent abnormally warm weather, according to a report from the Department of the Environment published yesterday. The inch-long spiders, which probably arrived in Britain concealed in fruit boats, are now common in Portsmouth and Worthing and have been spotted in Essex. Mr Rowley Snazell, zoologist at the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, a government research agency, says their bite, which causes sweating, is 'fairly potent by British standards'. Slugs, aphids, rats and pigeons also thrived in the mild winters and hot summers between 1988 and 1990, causing considerable damage to crops, the report finds. In central England, the winter of 1988-89 was the warmest since 1659. The study explores the effects on animals and plants that Britain could expect if global warming occurs, although it says there is no evidence that the warm weather was due to the emission of 'greenhouse gases'. A vision of Britain with a Mediterranean climate emerges from the report's 150 pages of dense statistics. The grape and sunflower harvests in the south of England flourished during the abnormally warm weather, and gardens bloomed weeks early. But agrochemical companies were the real winners. Sales of insecticides for agriculture and horticulture rose by more than a third in 1989 to Pounds 39.4m, according to a British Agrochemicals Association survey. To fight off the invasion of pests, farmers sprayed cereal crops an average 1.3 times, nearly double the rate in the previous year, according to Produce Studies, the Newbury-based consultancy. The period also saw severe storms, with two damaging gales early in 1990.</p>

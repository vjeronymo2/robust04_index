			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA'S JOHN SMITH CHALLENGES FRANCIS' TESTIMONY IN TORONTO  </P> <P> John Smith, the assistant UCLA track and field coach who Wednesday was  implicated in the Canadian drug hearings, said he is concerned.  </P> <P> Testimony by sprint coach Charlie Francis implied that Smith had been a  supplier of drugs to athletes.  </P> <P> Francis, disgraced sprinter Ben Johnson's coach, said that a former world  record-holder at 440 yards had given a bottle of Dianabol, an anabolic steroid,  to a prominent female coach who worked with a prominent female sprinter.  Francis was apparently referring to Smith, who held the 440 record, former  coach Pat Connolly and Evelyn Ashford, the former world record-holder at 100  meters.  </P> <P> "I, John Smith, can refute anything being said, but it's not me alone," Smith  said Thursday. "It's about two other dear friends of mine. I want to clear  their names. I'm concerned about them. They have stood against this. As long as  I've known Pat over the last 20 years, she's been anti-drug."  </P> <P> Smith said he knows Francis and has some sympathy for him in his current  predicament.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to take shots at Charlie, he has his own cross to bear," Smith  said. "(But) No. 1, I want to clear my name. I want to clear the name of my  school. I don't take steroids and I don't advocate my athletes to take them.  </P> <P> "I've never made a public statement about it, but it's been known that I would  give my athletes blood tests. When we (the Santa Monica Track Club) go to  Europe, the promoters love us. We don't have to make a deal. I train drug-free  athletes. That's a fact."  </P> <P> Smith said that the allegations were worse for him and Ashford, because they  are still active in the sport. Connolly no longer coaches. "He's messing with  my profession," Smith said. "Charlie has nothing to lose by singing his song.  Evelyn and I sit here because we are still in the sport. I'd like to meet with  him face to face and then we'd deal with it." JULIE CART  </P></p>

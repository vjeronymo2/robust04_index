			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Japan cuts discount rate by 1/2 point THE BANK of Japan cut official interest rates early today in an admission that the economy is in worse shape than it had previously conceded. The central bank's decision to cut the official discount rate (ODR) from 3.75 per cent to 3.25 per cent was immediately welcomed by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, as 'a timely and appropriate step'. The move had been awaited eagerly by the securities industry, which had feared that the Tokyo stock market would continue to fall this week after losing 3.4 per cent on Friday to close at a six-year low. Share prices opened higher this morning after the cut, with the Nikkei average up some 400 points, or 2 1/2 per cent, after an hour's trading. On the Tokyo currency market, the dollar opened at Y127.63 against a New York closing rate of Y128.1 on Friday. Central bank officials said that the rate reduction would contribute to realising stable domestic economic growth. Previously the bank had hoped that the lowering of the ODR from 4.5 per cent on April 1 would be the last cut for the year, but a quarterly forecast published last week recognised that recovery would not, as predicted, come in the autumn. After the deregulation of Japan's financial markets, the effects of an ODR cut will be more symbolic than real, although it will encourage downward movement in market rates. In recent days, the central bank had allowed market rates to fall, heightening speculation that a cut was imminent. The cut is certain to be widely interpreted as an attempt to bolster the stock market, but Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, has previously insisted that 'official interest rates are not reduced to support share prices'. He is concerned that growth is being retarded by the 'pessimistic mood' of Japanese consumers. The bank is also worried that pressure is increasing on Japanese financial institutions, which are restructuring a growing number of corporate clients exposed to the stock and property markets, and unable to trade themselves out of trouble. Japan is also under growing US pressure to meet the official 3.5 per cent growth forecast for the year to end March 1993. That target now appears out of reach, and private institutions are generally forecasting growth of little more than 2 per cent for the year. The slowdown has led to a surge in Japan's trade surplus - a record Dollars 49bn (Pounds 25bn) for the first half and still rising. The US and Japan begin a two-day review tomorrow of a pact signed in 1990 to remove 'structural impediments' to bilateral trade, and the US is certain to ask Tokyo to stimulate the economy.

			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KHALIDI ON ISRAEL AND PALESTINIANS  </P> <P> If Khalidi is a teacher of modern Middle Eastern history, he conveniently  forgets about Israel's peace treaty with Egypt. Egypt got the entire Sinai back  with its oil resources and peace with Israel as well.  </P> <P> Khalidi mentions Resolution 242, which calls "for an end to the state of war."  Why don't Khalidi and the other Arab intellectuals suggest to the other Arab  nations that peace treaties with Israel probably would lead to a withdrawal  from occupied territories?  </P> <P> Khalidi knows, of course, that Dennis Prager (Commentary, Oct. 12) is correct  in stating that the Arabs will settle for nothing less than the destruction of  Israel.  </P> <P> Articles, such as Khalidi's, are only rhetoric that will not convince  intelligent, unbiased readers.  </P> <P> MARTIN J.

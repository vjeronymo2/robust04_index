			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Will they take the money and run?: As Names deliver their responses to Lloyd's settlement offer, Richard Lapper answers outstanding questions Today is the deadline for Lloyd's Names to accept or reject the London insurance market's Pounds 900m offer of compensation to meet claims of Pounds 3.2bn stemming from recent losses. Soon after 3pm, Lloyd's should know whether enough Names - the individuals whose personal wealth supports the market - are prepared to accept the deal, thus saving Lloyd's from years of complex, time-consuming and expensive litigation, and restoring its badly tarnished reputation. The offer, announced two months ago after more than a year of acrimonious argument, allocates money to 22,921 loss makers according to their exposure to 39 syndicates (groups of Names) in 67 separate years of account; their perceived chances of success in the courts; and their determination to take legal action. As the Names' response arrives today, several questions remain: Is the offer a good deal for Names? For some. But hundreds of Names are so badly hit by their losses that even if they accept the settlement they could still face bankruptcy. Names introduced to Lloyd's by the Lime Street agency (one of dozens of companies which handle Names' affairs), face average losses of more than Pounds 2m. Even though they have been offered above-average levels of compensation, no Lime Street Name stands to receive more than Pounds 800,000. Other Names have been offered so little that they have virtually nothing to lose by legal action. Most names on syndicates involved in long-tail liability insurance - in which claims can emerge many years after the inception of the policy - and whose legal cases were assessed as weak by the Lloyd's panel which helped devise the settlement offer, have been offered less than 10p for every Pounds 1 of loss. But Names between these two extremes face a dilemma: 1,950 Feltrim Names, for example, who are suing their agents for losses of Pounds 599m, stand to receive Pounds 238m if they accept the offer, against Pounds 310m to Pounds 425m which they believe they could win through legal action. The settlement can seem attractive if the uncertainties and costs of legal action are taken into account. Although the panel regards the legal case of the Feltrim Names as strong, the courts might not agree. In addition, Names have to consider the fact that - once interest and capital gains are included - money received now will be worth more by the end of 1995, the earliest date by which any group of Names can expect a court ruling. Names must also consider a third - and potentially more important - question. Even if their cases are successful in court, will the agents they are suing for negligence have sufficient funds to meet claims? Most of the responsibility for meeting successful legal actions will fall on errors and omissions (E&amp;O) insurance policies, which cover the agents against negligence awards. But these funds are limited. According to the document which details terms of the offer, E&amp;O insurers have between Pounds 820m and Pounds 1,085m in cover. Of their cover, E&amp;O insurers have agreed to contribute about Pounds 400m to the settlement offer, supplemented by some Pounds 450m from the market's central fund - which meets claims when Names cannot pay - and Pounds 50m from the agents. The danger for Names in rejecting the settlement is that they could find themselves embarked on a 'dash for cash', with Names whose cases come to court first - such as Gooda Walker and Feltrim Names - winning the lion's share of available funds, leaving less money available to meet claims by smaller groups. Names belonging to several loss-making syndicates and the action groups organising their legal cases could find gains in one action offset by the smaller amounts obtained in others. Will Names accept? Over the past few weeks, a growing number of names have agreed to accept the deal but rejection still looks likely. Lloyd's is seeking a majority of at least 70 per cent of Names by value of the offer: Names whose offers amount to 70 per cent of Pounds 900m must accept the settlement for it to take effect. In January all but one action group voted to turn down the deal. Even when the level of compensation itself has been viewed as acceptable, Names have objected to several other features of the offer, such as the absence of protection against losses that have still to emerge on their syndicates. Names accepting the settlement have to give up legal rights in respect of the claims it covers and could find themselves legally defenceless if Lloyd's seizes their assets and property to pay off debts. However, many action group members did not participate in ballots on the offer, and a substantial minority of Names remains outside any action groups. Although most Names belonging to action groups are legally bound by the group's decisions in relation to the offer, some may choose to resign from membership if they want to accept the deal and the group does not. The Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents about half the market's active membership, has warned Names of the uncertainties of legal action. Mr Robert Saunders, of Smith &amp; Williamson, a private bank and accountancy firm which advises about 500 Names, says he has detected a 'groundswell of acceptances in the last few weeks'. What will happen if Names say no? They will be party to a string of long-running legal actions - beginning in April when the Gooda Walker case comes to court. Feltrim and Merrett Names have court dates set for October 1994 and early 1995. Agents and their E&amp;O insurers have said that they will fiercely contest all the actions, with appeals likely. Nevertheless, Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Names action group, believes his group can obtain compensation through the courts by the end of next year. Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, predicts no awards will be made until 1998. From the market's point of view, legal action and the attendant publicity would damage its image, especially in the US. However, following the arrival of institutional investors at Lloyd's the market is in a much stronger position than six months ago. Capacity - the amount of premiums that Lloyd's syndicates can accept - rose to Pounds 10.9bn this year, an increase of Pounds 2bn on 1993. Insurance rates are rising. Efficiency is increasing and profits are likely for 1993. So is Lloyd's out of the wood? Not yet. Lloyd's has two sets of problems to resolve. First, losses for 1991 and 1992 - which the market will report over the next 18 months - are forecast to reach Pounds 3bn, inflicting further damage on Names and stretching the ability of many to continue trading. The losses could deplete the market's central fund to such an extent that Lloyd's may have difficulty proving its solvency later this year. A bigger long-term problem is the potential number of cases arising from asbestosis and pollution claims in the US. Lloyd's has embarked on an ambitious plan to transfer more than Pounds 4bn, which it holds in reserves against these claims, into a reinsurance company, NewCo, to seal off the problem from the rest of the market. It is too early to say whether this effort will succeed. In the meantime, more and more syndicates will seek to 'commute' many long-tail claims, negotiating deals with policyholders to settle at less than the full potential value of the claim. So should you become a Name? You may not have the opportunity. Over the next year the move towards a fully corporate Lloyd's market - in which the liabilities of investors are limited - is likely to pick up speed. Corporate investors are likely to increase their share of the market next year and some agents are considering converting the pooled investment scheme set up for Names last year into shareholding companies with limited liability. Mr Robert Hiscox, the iconoclastic deputy chairman of Lloyd's, has questioned whether new Names, trading with old-style unlimited liability, should be permitted to join the market. 'I just don't think you should have two classes of shareholder,' he said. The implication was clear: Lloyd's is heading down the road of limited liability.</p>

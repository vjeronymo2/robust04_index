			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Leading Article: The Schneider imbroglio The fate of Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of Groupe Schneider, a leading French electrical engineering company, must be troubling many other top executives in Europe. Mr Pineau-Valencienne has spent the past 10 days in a Belgian jail, after travelling to Brussels to make an ostensibly routine statement concerning an official investigation into two of Schneider's local subsidiaries. By all accounts, he seems likely to face a long and difficult legal battle. The incident has some of the nightmare qualities of The Bonfire of Vanities, the 1980s novel about the downfall of a wealthy New York investment banker trapped by an unforgiving legal system. It has outraged the French business establishment and unleashed a wave of defensive nationalism in Belgium. Beyond that, it points to hitherto unsuspected risks in doing business across borders. If this can happen to the head of one of France's biggest companies, is anybody safe? There are obvious limits to generalising from a case in which formal charges have yet to be brought, and about which many details remain murky. It does seem clear, however, that events would not have reached this stage if Belgium's financial markets were more effectively policed. The case grew out of court actions by former minority shareholders in the two Schneider subsidiaries, alleging that the French group undervalued their stakes when it bought them out in 1992. Proper regulation would have made it more likely that such allegations could have been dealt with at the time. Shareholders' rights That Belgian minority shareholders have begun to assert their rights more aggressively is partly a reaction to the raw deal they have traditionally received. In an effort to redress the balance, they were recently allowed greater recourse to national courts. However, that decision has been criticised for calling into question the role of the Commission Bancaire and Financiere, the already weak regulatory authority. Though some regulatory reforms were introduced after the bitter battle in 1988 for control of Belgium's Societe Generale holding company, they were timid. Authorities now recognise that more needs to be done, particularly to ensure proper disclosure and equal treatment of shareholders in takeovers. The Schneider case should encourage them swiftly to set their house in order. The case also raises a second, broader, issue. The Schneider investigation is examining whether other financial and fiscal irregularities occurred at the two subsidiaries, which Mr Pineau-Valencienne chairs. However, no evidence has yet been produced that he personally ordered, or was aware of, any illegal activities. In its absence, is it right that he should be made to carry the can? Personal liability Some European legal systems already hold chief executives personally liable for certain types of corporate violations, notably of health and safety laws. Such sanctions undoubtedly concentrate minds. But they seem unduly onerous. No senior manager can be fully-informed about every aspect of his business. Still less so, when companies are increasingly diversifying globally and decentralising authority from head office to often far-flung subsidiaries. A more difficult question arises where a company's culture, or the style of the chief executive, encourage those at lower levels to cut corners or even to break the law. In such cases, statutory penalties on individual top managers might act as a deterrent. But they could just as easily lead to more energetic efforts to conceal wrongdoing in erring companies, while unnecessarily inhibiting managers in law-abiding ones. In the longer run, the most effective checks are those which companies impose on themselves: rigorous internal audit systems, codes of conduct and scrupulous monitoring by supervisory boards or independent non-executive directors. These are more likely to be encouraged by regulatory systems which require fairness and transparency in corporate dealings than by statutory sledgehammers. Whatever the outcome of the Schneider case, it should give companies and governments across Europe a powerful incentive to examine how well they match up against these objectives.</p>

This measure is aimed at "highway robbers," criminals who have  existed in the country for years.    According to a government decision, "those in possession of  hunting guns and military weapons are requested to deposit them  at the Gendarmerie, police stations, customs offices, or with  water resources and forestry officials within one month or face  coercive measures, it was learned in Bangui today. The  authorities, who did not explain the nature of the "coercive  measures," also decided to "suspend the granting of arms and  ammunition permits until further notice."    These measures concern "highway robbers" called "zaraguinas"  in CAR, who terrorize rural dwellers in several regions of the  country, notably the border area with Chad. Early this week,  eight "highway robbers" were killed by the security forces in  Bossangoa Region, 350 km north of Bangui. Another recent clash  resulted in the death of seven of them in Vagaka Region, about  1,000 km east of the capital. Some time ago, the CAR Government  gave itself three months to stop the activities of the  zaraguinas, apparently without success.</p>

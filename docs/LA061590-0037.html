			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GATES SUSPENDS OFFICER FOR RESTAURANT BRAWL  </P> <P> A Los Angeles police sergeant who was involved in a brawl last year at a  Burbank restaurant was suspended by Chief Daryl F. Gates for six months  Thursday, despite a recommendation from a police board that the officer be  fired.  </P> <P> Gates ordered Sgt. Christopher Bonilla, 32, suspended without pay immediately  from his patrol supervisor's position at the Wilshire Division.  </P> <P> Bonilla, a nine-year veteran, was among six off-duty officers who fought with a  patron and five employees at the Black Angus restaurant, 235 S. 1st St., after  a dispute over a spilled bottle of beer in the restaurant's bar, Burbank police  said.  </P> <P> Bonilla and two of the officers pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace earlier  this year and were fined $470 each.  </P> <P> A six-day Board of Rights hearing ended last week with a recommendation that  Bonilla be fired for three counts of misconduct, including drinking, making  threats and kicking a man who had been dragged out of the restaurant by the  officers.  </P> <P> A Board of Rights, made up of three high-ranking officers, can only make  recommendations on discipline and Gates is not bound to follow them. Lt. Fred  Nixon said Gates reduced the recommended penalty without comment.  </P> <P> The department took lesser disciplinary action against the five other officers.  </P></p>

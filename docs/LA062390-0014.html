			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SAYS CITY MUST ZONE AREA FOR PROJECT;  </P> <P> WARNER RIDGE: IN A SETBACK FOR COUNCILWOMAN PICUS AND SOME HOMEOWNERS, THE  COUNCIL IS ORDERED TO LET A COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROCEED IN LINE WITH THE  GENERAL PLAN.  </P> <P> In a major blow to Councilwoman Joy Picus and her homeowner allies, a Superior  Court judge Friday ordered the Los Angeles City Council to grant a developer  the zoning needed to build a commercial complex on the controversial Warner  Ridge property in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> The ruling by Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski unraveled a two-year campaign  by Picus and the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization to prevent developer  Jack Spound and Johnson Wax Development Co. from building an office project on  Warner Ridge.  </P> <P> Zebrowski gave the council 60 days to zone the property, between Pierce College  and Warner Center on De Soto Avenue, for commercial development.  </P> <P> The judge held that a council decision Jan. 24 to impose residential zoning on  the property violated a state law that requires that zoning agree with the  community plan. The plan designates Warner Ridge for commercial use.  </P> <P> "No reasonable person can seriously believe that a zoning ordinance which  prohibits all commercial uses in an area designated in the General Plan for  commercial uses is 'consistent' with the plan in any meaningful sense of the  word 'consistent,' " Zebrowski wrote.  </P> <P> In his four-page decision, the judge dealt only with the question of whether  the city violated a state law that requires plans and zoning to be in sync.  Zebrowski did not address several other legal challenges posed in the lawsuit  filed against the city by the Spound-Johnson Wax partnership.  </P> <P> Robert McMurry, attorney for the developer, said Zebrowski's ruling served to  warn that there are limits to the broad discretionary powers the council wields  in land-use matters. "While the council has great discretion, it is not  unfettered," McMurry said.  </P> <P> "It's extraordinary for the council to have taken eight to nine years of its  own planning and . . . toss it out the window," McMurry said. In its lawsuit  against the city, the Spound-Johnson Wax partnership alleges that Picus  engineered the zoning barrier in a desperate bid to appease politically potent  homeowners. "We allege that she was politically motivated," McMurry said.  </P> <P> Picus and her staff refused comment on the judge's ruling.  </P> <P> Deputy City Atty. Anthony Alperin said he was assessing the ruling and  preparing to discuss it with the council in executive session. Alperin declined  to say whether he would recommend that the city appeal the ruling.  </P> <P> "We would expect the city to appeal this," said Robert Gross, president of the  Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization. Gross also said that the organization  may consider intervening in the case to protect its interests.  </P> <P> "We're ecstatic," Spound said of Zebrowski's ruling. "All I know now is that  I'm going to do everything I can to vest my rights as soon as possible." Once a  developer's project is vested -- meaning construction has actually begun -- it  usually cannot be stopped.  </P> <P> Spound also indicated that, even after his victory, he intends to keep the  legal pressure on the city. "We're going to continue with the rest of our case,  including our case for damages," Spound said. "That's the only way to work with  guys who've been beating me on the head all this time."  </P> <P> The partnership claims it pays $330,000 per month in carrying costs on  outstanding loans on the property, now vacant.  </P> <P> Zebrowski heard oral arguments in the case Thursday. In his remarks from the  bench, the judge strongly indicated that he found the discrepancy between the  community plan designation and zoning for the property illegal. But he did not  specify whether he would order the city to bring the plan into conformity with  the zoning -- as Picus and the city wished -- or the zoning into conformity  with the plan, as the developer wanted.  </P> <P> In his ruling released Friday, Zebrowski settled that issue, warning the city  that it would be an "illegal backwards approach" for it to amend the plan to  conform with the zoning. The plan is superior to the zoning, the judge  indicated.  </P> <P> Since 1984, the community plan that includes Warner Ridge has called for  neighborhood, office and commercial development on the site.  </P> <P> Despite the community plan designation and the fact that it certified an  environmental impact report that deemed residential development on the site  financially unfeasible, the council on Jan. 24 zoned the property for  low-density residential development.  </P> <P> Although he ordered commercial zoning for Warner Ridge, Zebrowski pointedly  said his ruling did not bar the city from amending its General Plan and  switching the commercial zoning to residential zoning after it had complied  with his fiat.  </P> <P> "The court makes no ruling regarding what procedures the city may undertake  after amending the zoning ordinance to bring it into consistency," Zebrowski  said.  </P> <P> Spound and McMurry questioned whether Picus could muster the political support  needed to undo Zebrowski's ruling. To quickly amend the General Plan, which  would be one of the first tasks in restoring residential zoning to Warner  Ridge, would require the close cooperation of the Planning Department, the  Planning Commission and Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> Any one of those entities could hang up or block a proposed amendment  indefinitely.  </P> <P> The commission, for example, previously backed the Spound-Johnson Wax  commercial project. The mayor, if he chooses, can review a proposed plan  amendment for up to 30 days before referring it to the council. Likewise, the  City Council's Planning Committee must give the public 10 days notice before  taking up a plan amendment.  </P> <P> Typically, a plan amendment takes nine months to a year to be processed.  </P> <P> Zebrowski's ruling also raised questions about what happened to a motion,  introduced by Picus and approved by the council in January, 1989, to amend the  community plan to designate Warner Ridge for residential use. Because this  amendment was never finally enacted, the city's defense was weakened.  </P> <P> Asked about the fate of her proposed amendment, Picus said: "It's in the  Planning Department."  </P> <P> She said she would meet with planning officials soon "to make certain it moves  forward." The delays in getting it approved must be "due to the bureaucratic  nature of the Planning Department," she said.  </P></p>

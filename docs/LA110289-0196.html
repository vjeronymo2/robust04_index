			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: COLLEGE PARK EAST: FOCUS;  </P> <P> COLLEGE PARK EAST'S NAME STANDS TEST OF TIME  </P> <P> When it came time to name this north Seal Beach neighborhood, developers S  &amp; S (Shapell &amp; Shapell) must have been feeling a trifle whimsical. A  name like College Park East would seem to indicate the presence of, well, a  college -- something on the lines of College Park, Md., home of the University  of Maryland. But here there is no institution of higher learning closer than  Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> But the name has at least stood the test of time. The then-unincorporated area  was annexed to the city of Seal Beach in 1964, according to City Clerk Joanne  Yeo, and the first houses were built in 1966 with construction continuing  through 1973.  </P> <P> Houses in this quiet residential area are modest, and lawns are well-tended. At  times the landscaping -- including cactus, small palms, willow trees and  flowers such as roses, marigolds and Vinca -- is showier than the houses it  fronts. As Fir Avenue intersects Wisteria Street, the variety of evergreens in  evidence -- pines, Douglas firs and cedars -- gives credence to the avenue's  name.  </P> <P> City Council member and schoolteacher Frank Laszlo, one of the original  residents of the neighborhood, has lived there for 20 years.  </P> <P> "It's a very nice area . . . an affluent area, (whose residents are) doctors,  airline pilots, dentists, businessmen, attorneys, teachers," Laszlo says.  Laszlo's observations are backed by economic data. The neighborhood has a  median household income in excess of $65,000, high even by Orange County  standards. Three households in four have an annual income of $50,000 or more.  "It's a desirable location, very close to the freeway, close to Los Angeles, a  couple of miles from the beach," he adds.  </P> <P> At one point, about 50% of the residents drove to Los Angeles to work; now the  number of commuters is down to 40%. Some residents have jobs in Long Beach, and  others "are beginning to go to Orange County (to work) -- and complain about  traffic," Laszlo says.  </P> <P> "It's a good area to raise a family," he continues. "The school system, Los  Alamitos, is one of the best in the county. A lot of families have moved in  (recently) with a lot of kids." He's surprised that young families can afford  the current house prices.  </P> <P> Housing prices here are an echo of the rest of the county. A three-bedroom  house originally sold for $27,000. Homes with three to six bedrooms now fetch  $300,000 to $500,000 and up. A four-bedroom home that cost $32,000 20 years ago  would now sell for more than $350,000. A two-story structure that originally  sold for $36,000 is now worth more than $450,000.  </P> <P> Children cavort at the small playground at Shapell Park, on the corner of  Almond Avenue and Oleander Street. The children's play site at Heather Park, on  Hazelnut Avenue between Heather and Iris streets, features such amenities as  tennis courts, a children's tree house and a softball field.  </P> <P> The neighborhood's proximity to the Armed Forces Reserve Center has posed no  problems, Laszlo says. "Helicopters do fly outside the area, but citizens are  used to it and have no complaints. . . . The majority coexist with the air  station fairly well."  </P> <P> A focal point of physical and social activity, the Old Ranch Golf Country Club  and Tennis Club, lies west of the residential community proper. And the name is  no exercise in needless conceit, for it actually comprises two exclusive  private clubs, one for golf and one for tennis.  </P> <P> To join, one must be sponsored by a member and be seconded by another. The  initiation fee for a golf membership is $20,000; monthly dues are $200. Even at  those rates, there is a waiting list. "The majority of the members come from  Long Beach, Seal Beach and Huntington Beach," says Bill Elvins, manager of the  golf club.  </P> <P> It is not mandatory that a prospective member have a sponsor to join the tennis  club, according to manager Bob Litrich. The initiation fee is $600; monthly  fees vary from $85 to $100 depending on the type of membership. Some members  belong to both clubs.  </P> <P> Social memberships, when they are available (they are currently sold out),  feature the use of the clubhouse, food and beverages, and club social events.  The initiation fee and monthly dues are a more modest $125 and $65,  respectively.  </P> <P> The neighborhood has its share of individually owned condominiums between Old  Ranch Road and Lampson Avenue. Prices for condominiums were sometimes higher  than the price for houses: When houses were selling for $280,000, condominiums  were on the market for $285,000 to $290,000.  </P> <P> More than the condos' prices were controversial. Their construction stirred  trouble between residents of College Park East and developers. "Citizens wanted  the area to be a park site," Laszlo says. "The city government didn't quite  understand our position, and (we) took the vote to the people," but their  efforts to block the construction failed.  </P> <P> The misunderstanding is perhaps understandable with a look at a map. The San  Diego Freeway divides the neighborhood from the bulk of the city, giving it a  bit of a separatist mentality.  </P> <P> "College Park East is a little bit more politically aggressive (than the rest  of Seal Beach) at times. It's north of the freeway. We hope to get along a  little bit better" in the future, Laszlo says.  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1989 est.) 5,782  </P> <P> 1980-89 change: +0.8%  </P> <P> Median Age: 40.8  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> White (non-Latino), 83%; Latino, 6%; Black, 2%; Other, 9%  </P> <P> By sex and age:  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 39.8 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 41.4 years  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $22,453  </P> <P> Median household: $65,716  </P> <P> Average household: $69,408  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 4%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 24%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 35%  </P> <P> More than $75,000: 37%  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATES NARROWED TO 2 FOR DEL MAR TRACK LEASE  </P> <P> A state commission narrowed the field Thursday to a pair of finalists for a new  Del Mar Race Track lease, eliminating from consideration a partnership snubbed  by local residents for its plans to offer concerts along with horse racing.  </P> <P> After more than five hours of discussion at the Del Mar Fairgrounds, the state  Race Track Leasing Commission voted, 4-1, to scratch the Ogden-Nederlander  partnership from the competition for the 20-year lease.  </P> <P> The commission's decision left only the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, a local  outfit that has operated the track for the past two decades, and Florida horse  racing impresario John J. Brunetti as the remaining contenders.  </P> <P> At the request of the six-man leasing commission, which is composed of three  high-ranking state officials and three Del Mar Fair Board members, the  finalists will return in one month for a showdown to determine which group will  get the lucrative lease.  </P> <P> Commissioner William J. Anthony, a state general services official, abstained  from the vote, and Commissioner Jan Anton, a fair board director, dissented.  </P> <P> Leaders of the Thoroughbred Club expressed surprise at the commission's  decision to delay a final vote, but they remained confident about their  ultimate chances.  </P> <P> The big loser was the Ogden-Nederlander partnership.  </P> <P> Commissioner Jack Parnell, the state's Food and Agriculture Department  director, said the partnership's plans for an eclectic mix of up to 40 concerts  ranging from symphony performances to rock 'n' roll threatened to undermine the  state-mandated role of the Del Mar Fair Board, which operates the seaside  grounds.  </P> <P> Dozens of local residents and officials appeared before the commission to  complain about the potential impact of the concerts, contending that they would  cause problems with noise, traffic and pollution.  </P></p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Observer: Penny wise Conservative central office's efforts to reduce its estimated Pounds 15m overdraft will not be helped by gaffes such as the one visited on Sir Alistair Grant, the genial Scottish millionaire who is chairman of the Argyll supermarket group. Sir Alistair, whose company has over the past decade contributed some Pounds 250,000 to Tory coffers, was irritated earlier this year to receive a gushing letter from party HQ asking him to consider making a 'first time' donation. As an indication of the party's organisational prowess, Sir Alistair considered this less than impressive. He promptly cut the company's annual donation from Pounds 30,000 to zero. Who carries the can for the embarrassing error? Central office is understandably reticent but it is reliably understood the letter was authorised by David Sieff, the Marks and Spencer director, and until recently among the high-powered businessmen helping to run the Tories' finances. For entirely unconnected reasons, Sieff is now devoting his spare time to being chairman of the board distributing cash from the UK's new national lottery.</p>

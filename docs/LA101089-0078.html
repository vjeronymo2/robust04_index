			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PRESSLER GIVES RECITAL  </P> <P> Menahem Pressler is perhaps best known as the pianist of the Beaux Arts Trio,  but he does like getting out on his own once in a while. Sunday afternoon at  Biola University in La Mirada, the spotlight was focused solely on him in a  recital of music by Handel, Mozart and Chopin.  </P> <P> He didn't lack entirely for company, however. Pressler chose Mozart's Piano  Concerto No. 14, K. 449, as the centerpiece of his program, and four local  string players were recruited to provide accompaniment. They are best left  unnamed.  </P> <P> Mozart himself authorized this quintet version of his concerto: the parts for  oboes and horns are optional, allowing for scaled-down performances. The string  players on this occasion were sadly inadequate. Poor intonation and meager tone  were their outstanding qualities.  </P> <P> They were a mismatch for Pressler. His was a reading of warm expression and  lush tone. Melody lines were lyrically delivered with legato touch and flexible  tempos. Bass lines were ringing and forthright. Given Pressler's rich  sonorities, a full orchestra wouldn't have been a bad idea.  </P> <P> He concluded the concert in an uneven performance of the 24 Preludes, Opus 28,  by Chopin. In the slower moving Preludes, Pressler could be casually elegant,  tossing off a beautiful melody with colorful, rhetorical flourishes. At quicker  tempos, however, this casualness turned to haste. The swirling arpeggios became  a slapdash blur, and clarity of lines, of shapes, were lost in the rush.  </P> <P> Pressler opened with the Chaconne (with 20 variations) in G by Handel -- an  oddity on the piano these days, but nevertheless wonderful to hear in  Pressler's anachronistically lavish account.

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINO STEREOTYPES  </P> <P> About Scott Hays' May 14 article, "Jorge Rivero's Split-Level Career": Although  this was the standard puff piece timed to coincide with a movie release, it was  presented as one of an occasional series ("Pacific Rim Arts"); as such we would  expect it to be culturally and ethnically sensitive. The article not only  disappoints, it offends.  </P> <P> What sense does it make to say that this hulking Mexican actor's movies are  seldom shown in the United States and then go on to portray his U.S. audience  in condescending terms? Surely Rivero knows that Latino audiences here provide  his bread and butter and virtually keep the whole sadly decadent Mexican movie  industry afloat. Rivero carelessly stereotypes these fans as dishwashers and  trash truck drivers.  </P> <P> The article and its quotes from Rivero and producer Carlos Vasallo make the  inexcusable error of identifying American with Anglo, and Latino with foreign.  Vasallo contributes to selective Latino invisibility with statements like  "Americans just don't know how to pronounce Jorge."  </P> <P> Mexican nationals have much more to gain from identifying and cooperating with  U.S. Latinos than from engaging in destructive competition, stereotypes and  self-serving distinctions.  </P> <P> D. R. AYON  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

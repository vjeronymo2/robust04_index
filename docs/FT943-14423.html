			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Woolworth slices payout for quarter to 15 cents Woolworth, the troubled US retailer that last year disguised losses in its first and second quarters as profits, yesterday acknowledged the extent of its difficulties by slashing its quarterly dividend from 29 cents a share to 15 cents. It also said it was developing a cost-cutting programme to improve profits, and announced the appointment of Mr Ronald Berens, previously head of its Kinney Shoe subsidiary, to the newly-created post of executive vice-president for worldwide specialty operations. Woolworth said the dividend cut was aimed at bringing the payout level more in line with historic levels, and to help the company focus resources on its most-promising retail formats. Before the cut, the annualised dividend yield on the common stock had been 7.25 per cent at yesterday's opening price of Dollars 16. After the cut, the implied annualised yield was 3.84 per cent at the closing price of Dollars 15 5/8 . The Dollars  3/8 fall in the share price was relatively small, because the market had regarded the size of the payout as unsustainable given the company's poor financial outlook. Woolworth's difficulties are largely attributable to the decline of its general merchandise operations, and its lack of success in replacing the lost profits by switching to specialty retailing. Last year, it embarked on a restructuring programme that involved the closure of about half its US variety stores, and the disposal of its 142 Woolco stores in Canada. In this year's first quarter, however, its net losses grew from a re-stated Dollars 24m to Dollars 38m. Its decision to appoint a head of speciality retailing will be seen as an attempt to give impetus to the lacklustre performance of the worldwide specialty formats.</p>

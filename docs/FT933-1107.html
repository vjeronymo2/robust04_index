			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Flash Harrys in sober suits: The new, less charismatic breed of UK entrepreneur Eleven years ago Mr Geoff Brown, a computer programmer turned rock musician, spent Pounds 200 on computer games from the US which he started selling in his home city of Birmingham. Next month CentreGold, the company he created, will be floated on the stock market and is expected to be valued at between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m. By selling some of his shares - he refuses to disclose how many - Mr Brown will become a multi-millionaire with more than Pounds 1m in cash. He will own at least 30 per cent of the company. CentreGold, which distributes and publishes computer and video games, is not the only fast-growing UK company planning to take advantage of the buoyancy of the stock market to raise finance for expansion. In the eight months to the end of August, 95 companies were floated - compared with 82 in the whole 1992, the lowest level since 1985. Another 40-50 companies have announced they intend to go public before the end of this year. The flurry of activity is some way from equalling the heyday of the late 1980s, when a rapidly growing economy fuelled investors' appetites for untested but potentially lucrative new stocks. There is now a more sober, post-recession mood among financial institutions: there are questions about the risks involved in investing in companies whose future is at least as uncertain as that of their pre-recession counterparts. Some, such as CentreGold, are the first in their business sector to float, leaving investors with no comparable measure of their likely future performance. Mr David Nolder, corporate financier with stockbroker Smith New Court, says: 'I think you need a particularly convincing story to take to the institutions these days.' Mirroring the City's scepticism, there is also a more sober style among the entrepreneurs themselves. Rather than the high profiles adopted by some in the 1980s - epitomised, perhaps, by Sir Terence Conran, who founded the retail Storehouse group - the new generation of self-made businessmen deliberately avoids any hint of excess or flamboyance. 'I do not have nor do I intend to have a yacht in the Mediterranean,' says Mr Michael Peagram, this week voted Venturer of the Year, and head of Holliday Chemical Holdings, the chemicals group floated in March. He paid just Pounds 50,000 for a 25 per cent stake in 1985, and today his 20 per cent holding is worth Pounds 37m. 'The biggest change that it gives me is a position of influence to share my beliefs about business management.' Mr John Houlihan, head of the small companies research team at the stock brokers Hoare Govett, says recession means entrepreneurs are more pragmatic by character. 'I don't think you will find many with charisma. They have had to be boring managers coping with adversity. And when the chips are down, charisma does not actually get you very far.' Mr Brown is among the more extravagant of the new entrepreneurs. He likes fast cars, music and designer clothes. But he is hardly an extrovert. His small office is in a Birmingham industrial estate; the only luxury is a stereo system. He is relaxed about his millionaire status and says it will make no difference to his life. Most of his wealth will be in shares; the cash will be his cushion against possible hard times in the future - 'drop dead money', Mr Brown calls it. The biggest change, he says, came much earlier in his career, once it was clear that his passion for computers was turning into a lucrative business. 'Within three years from the start I was able to afford a better house and a nice car,' he says. Today, Mr Brown drives a Jaguar for work and a Mercedes sports car for fun. What about the Ferraris and Porsches he used to drive in the early days of new-found wealth? 'Oh, they are all gone,' he says. 'All those toy cars have gone.' The son of a Birmingham scaffolder, Mr Brown says his biggest indulgences have been a seven-bedroom Victorian country house and a Yamaha grand piano, both bought last year. He says his wife, who also owns her own business, has furnished their home with antiques. Wealth has, perhaps, brought a greater appreciation of quality: 'I used to think antiques were second-hand furniture,' he says. After travelling extensively as a professional keyboard player for 10 years in the 1970s, he says he is not interested in living flamboyantly: 'I have done my sex, drugs, and rock and roll.' Another stock market entrant, Mr David Jones, a Welsh miner's son who founded Sharelink, the telephone-based stockbroker which was floated in the summer, says the first draw on his new-found wealth will be ensuring financial security for his family. He has cashed in shares worth Pounds 1.8m to pay for a new house and to set up trusts for the education of his three young children. He drives a Volvo estate and a Porsche, 'which I had a long time before I had any money'. Nevertheless, Mr Jones still owns 14 per cent of Sharelink, worth Pounds 7.7m. He is not alone among entrepreneurs in refraining from taking profits when their companies come to the market. Mr David Lloyd, the tennis player who founded the sports and leisure group named after him, and Dr Chai Patel, a medical doctor turned financier, who started the nursing home company Court Cavendish, both bought more shares on flotation. 'I have a better living because I am paid a higher salary,' says Mr Lloyd, who holds 10 per cent of David Lloyd Leisure worth about Pounds 10.4m. 'But I haven't realised any cash.' Dr Patel, whose 3 per cent stake in Court Cavendish is valued at Pounds 1.3m, intends to devote part of his dividend earnings to a charity he is founding called Mustard Seed. It will support healthcare and training issues in the UK and abroad. Mr Trevor Smallwood, chairman of Badgerline, the west country bus company which plans a share flotation in November, says: 'The reason for coming to the market is the development of the company, not my bank account.' His original Pounds 30,000 stake, bought in 1986, is expected to be worth about Pounds 13m after flotation, but he intends to keep his Ford Granada car and the three-bedroom country cottage which he, his wife and three year-old son bought four years ago. 'That is probably the only change that we have had, or will have,' he says. Mr Graham Wilson, a farmer's son and accountant, borrowed at least Pounds 100,000 in 1989 and arranged other financial backing to buy Parkdean Leisure for Pounds 7m in 1989 from construction group Beazer. Parkdean, which owns seven caravan and chalet holiday parks in Scotland and East Anglia, is likely to be valued at about Pounds 15m when it comes to the market in October. After flotation, Mr Wilson expects to wipe out his debt, take a little cash, and hold a 4 per cent stake in the enlarged company. I will be comfortably off financially,' he says, but his first indulgence will be modest - a lifelong season ticket to Newcastle United football club. He intends to continue driving his second-hand company car, but may spend the 'odd weekend' playing golf, staying at the luxury Gleneagles hotel in Scotland. 'I have also become partial to Jaeger suits,' he admits. Nevertheless, 'the biggest thing has been having that cloud of debt lifted'. His image of relative thrift, and that of his counterparts, is probably shrewd in the 1990s as Britain starts to emerge from a recession which forced thousands of small businesses into receivership. Mr Houlihan, of Hoare Govett, says financial institutions are looking at the long-term stability of companies. 'Investors are now meaner and more sober than they used to be,' he says. On the other hand, the tougher environment means companies approaching flotation are already well tested. 'Anyone who came through the recession of 1990-92 had to be made of fairly stern stuff,' Mr Houlihan says. He does not believe, however, that the flamboyant entrepreneur - whose success depends on high economic growth - is dead. 'They never die, they just go into hibernation. When the climate gets overheated again, they'll be back.'</p>

In his regular  radio program "Talks From Lany," he said all the discussions  about the return of property to the Jewish communities were  sometimes "humiliating." He added he was convinced that the  nearest parliament session would pass a reasonable law providing  for the rectification of the wrongs done to "our Jewish  fellow-citizens." The issue of restitutions concerns churches,  Jewish communities and most lately also the gentry. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> BMI Grants HBO One-Month License Extension: Broadcast Music Inc. has agreed to  grant a one-month extension of its license to Home Box Office Inc. "at a  substantially higher fee."  </P> <P> The agreement came in negotiations between representatives of HBO and BMI. BMI  said that the issues raised in the lawsuit filed on Dec. 28 are still  unresolved and that unless the parties could reach agreement in January, the  litigation will continue. BMI filed suit against HBO to obtain a preliminary  injunction to prevent it from using BMI repertoire on the Home Box Office  channel after HBO's license expires Dec. 31.  </P></p>

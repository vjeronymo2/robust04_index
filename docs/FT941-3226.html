			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Road body sell-off plans criticised Plans to privatise the Transport Research Laboratory were strongly criticised yesterday by the Conservative-controlled Commons transport committee. The MPs said they would refuse to recommend the privatisation to the Commons until they received 'much more convincing' assurances about the laboratory's independence. The report is a severe blow to Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, who has said that privatisation is 'a feasible option'. The government will also be embarrassed by disclosures in the report that the committee's strong line was prompted by Mr Peter Bottomley, Conservative MP for Eltham and a former transport minister. Mr Bottomley joined the Labour minority on the seven-strong committee to amend a resolution criticising the privatisation proposals to make it clear that they lacked justification. The committee also drew the government's attention to evidence given by the Association of Chief Police Officers which suggested that privatisation would reduce safety standards on Britain's roads. Privatisation of the laboratory, which advises the Department of Transport and other customers on transport issues, was recommended by an inquiry carried out for Mr MacGregor by KPMG Corporate Finance. The inquiry said that the retention of the laboratory in the public sector 'would risk it being unable to respond adequately to changes in its market' and would present a 'considerable risk' of a cycle of cumulative decline.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (3): Special services matter now - New patterns in car rentals THE PRICE war among US rental car companies is over, at least for now. During the past year rates have been rising, and rental companies are now relying more on providing drivers with special services and unusual extras, rather than on competitive pricing, to attract customers. The main reason for the increase in rental rates is that the big three US auto manufacturers have cut back on the discounts they offer rental companies. This means they now have to pay as much as 25 per cent to 35 per cent more for their new cars. Although not all of the extra cost has been immediately passed on to the renter, it eventually will. Already, rates have been going up by significant amounts. Hertz has said that its nationwide rates this year are up about 14 per cent on a year ago, while Avis estimates its rates are between 13 per cent and 16 per cent higher than in 1992. There is some evidence, however, that rates are actually rising faster than that. In Boston, for example, the average of the daily rates for renting midsize cars charged by the big four rental companies (Avis, Alamo, Budget and Hertz) last June was Dollars 32.49. This June, the average charge has gone up to Dollars 39.98, a 23 per cent hike. To make matters worse, auto manufacturers have been reducing the number of cars they sell to rental companies, preferring instead to focus on selling to the retail market. Consequently, rental fleets are shrinking, which could leave business and other travellers facing shortages at peak times, especially at busy metropolitan airports. Additionally, the car manufacturers have changed their policy on buying back cars from rental companies. Seeking to avoid undermining their sales of new cars by flooding the retail market with almost-new ex-rental cars, the manufacturers are now agreeing to buy cars back from the rental companies after six or nine months, instead of as little as four months a year ago. This change, combined with the fact that rental companies are keeping their cars on the road longer, to offset their higher-purchase costs, means renters are not only paying more for cars now, they are also driving around older models with higher mileage and a greater risk of breakdown. Despite the higher rates and older models, renting a car in the US is still inexpensive compared with other countries, thanks to the relatively low purchase cost of cars, lower maintenance costs, cheaper petrol and, above all, intense competition between the main rental companies. While rates may be going up, competition remains strong in areas other than price - no more so than when it comes to the quality and speed of service to renters, especially business travellers. Rental companies are focusing their efforts on reducing the time it takes to provide a car to a customer who has just disembarked from a plane. Most now have efficient airport service counters, where cars can be picked up relatively quickly; but the best solution for the business traveller in a hurry is to sign up for one of the companies' special membership cards or clubs. These allow members to walk straight from the airport to their vehicle without having to queue up at a busy counter. These special memberships are less of a bonus when it comes to dropping-off rental cars at the airport, because at most big airports companies have systems that allow the renter to leave the car, pay for it, and head for the terminal, all in a few minutes. At the high end of the market, rental companies are also competing to offer business travellers special extras, such as car phones or mobile cellular phones. There has even been talk of providing renters with computerised maps to help them find their way around unfamiliar cities. The issue of providing renters with reliable directions and maps of the local area is an important one, in the wake of recent highly-publicised incidents. The Miami area, for example, has been the scene of a number of attacks on people, especially foreigners, who had rented their cars at airports but had subsequently lost their way in high-crime neighbourhoods. There is a real concern now that criminals are preying specifically on people in rental cars. To counter this threat, most US rental companies are beginning to strip their cars of number plates and other signs that identify the car as a rented vehicle. Last month, Hertz said it had embarked on a programme aimed at 'turning the rental car from one that's identifiable into one that's virtually unidentifiable'. Also, companies have stepped up warnings to customers about where they should, and should not, drive when they leave the airport; and have introduced clearer road directions for renters. Much of this advice is now available in safety brochures provided by rental companies at big city locations.</p>

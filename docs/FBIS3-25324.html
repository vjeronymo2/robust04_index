			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a statement issued today, the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo] has agreed to withdraw from Salamanga,  Maputo Province, thus satisfying a demand from the Mozambican  Government which claims it as an area under its control. For  many months the government and Renamo have been arguing over  allegations that Salamanga was occupied by Afonso Dhlakama's  movement after the General Peace Accord was signed.    With this decision, Renamo will not only be carrying out the  Supervision and Control Commission's [CSC] orders, but will also  be withdrawing men and war materiel 10 or 30 km away from  Salamanga.    Renamo said in its statement that it made this decision to  avoid confrontations and to guarantee that peace was maintained  and that war was not resumed. It said, however, that Salamanga  must be viewed as a no-man's-land and has called on the  government to observe such a status.</p>

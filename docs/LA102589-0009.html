			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOBIL INVITES THOUSANDS TO TOUR REFINERY  </P> <P> Denied the permits they need to conduct a full-scale open house, Mobil Oil  Corp. officials instead have mailed more than 20,000 letters to homes near  their Torrance refinery inviting them to tour the facility.  </P> <P> Opening with a breezy "Dear Neighbor" greeting, the letters say Mobil has set  aside two successive Saturdays -- Oct. 28 and Nov. 4 -- to sponsor a series of  hourly group tours for roughly 40 people at a time.  </P> <P> "We're anxious to share with you not only how the refinery operates, but also  the results of our extensive modernization programs," says the letter, signed  by refinery manager Wyman Robb.  </P> <P> Mobil had hoped to attract as many as 12,000 people to a festive, $200,000 open  house on Oct. 7, featuring refinery tours, informational booths, free food and  rides on a Ferris wheel and carousel.  </P> <P> But Torrance city officials, expressing concern that the crowd would not be  safe on refinery grounds, balked at the plan late last month and refused to  issue the permits Mobil needed for temporary structures, electrical wiring and  crowd control.  </P> <P> Instead, city officials offered Mobil the use of nearby Columbia Park for the  assembly, with buses leaving at regular intervals to take small groups on tours  of the refinery.  </P> <P> Mobil officials angrily rejected that idea because it would not bring people  directly to the refinery.  </P> <P> Mobil now will rely on its own buses and existing meeting areas for the tours,  which Mobil hopes will attract several hundred people each day.  </P> <P> "This may take a little longer and it may be viewed as a little more  complicated than the open house, but if this is what it takes to satisfy the  city, we will comply and this is how we're going to do it," Mobil spokesman  Barry Engelberg said.  </P> <P> Refinery officials will control the number of people on refinery grounds by  requiring reservations for a specific tour time, Engelberg said.  </P></p>

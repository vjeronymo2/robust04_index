			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUMP SITE STUDIED FOR REDEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> The BKK Corp. landfill, once one of the nation's busiest toxic dumps, may  become a city redevelopment area under a plan being considered by West Covina  officials.  </P> <P> Redevelopment officials since 1988 have been preparing an environmental impact  report on potential development at the dump site, which may be transformed into  a business park.  </P> <P> After a three-hour public hearing on the report last week, the City Council,  acting jointly as the West Covina Redevelopment Agency, postponed action until  June 25. The council and agency must approve the report before the property can  be designated for redevelopment.  </P> <P> The BKK site is the largest of eight potential redevelopment areas examined in  the environmental report. When developed, the parcels, totaling 1,119 acres,  could generate $1 million to $2 million annually in property taxes for West  Covina, city Redevelopment Project Manager Matthew Fertal said. In exchange,  the agency could offer property owners or developers financial help or other  assistance in constructing improvements, such as sewers.  </P> <P> All five residents who spoke at the joint hearing last week voiced concerns  about the proposed redevelopment designations. Action on the environmental  report was postponed to give city employees the chance to respond to the  criticisms.  </P> <P> Some speakers were troubled by the environmental legacy of the 583-acre BKK  landfill.  </P> <P> The firm ceased accepting hazardous waste in 1984, four months after 21  families in nearby homes were ordered to evacuate because of a methane gas leak  from the site. The landfill, which continues to accept 8,000 to 10,000 tons of  non-hazardous trash daily, will shut down completely in five years, BKK  President Ken Kazarian said.  </P> <P> He hopes to build a business park on parts of the property adjacent to the  landfill in a joint venture with Newport Beach-based Davis Developments, he  said. According to federal regulations, the land above and immediately  surrounding the actual dump site must remain open space, he added.  </P> <P> City Planning Director Pat Haley said preliminary plans submitted by the  partnership show the 2.3-million-square-foot business park would sit on 233  acres north and west of the landfill area. Retail use is being proposed for  about 426,000 square feet of the complex, and the rest would be put to  light-industrial use, such as research and development offices, she said.  </P> <P> If his property is designated for redevelopment, Kazarian would be able to ask  the city for financial assistance.  </P> <P> "I understand we will have project financing available that wouldn't otherwise  be available," Kazarian said, adding that he is not yet sure whether he will  request city help.  </P> <P> The redevelopment designation is one way in which the city hopes to recoup  revenue it will lose when BKK ceases operation as a dump. BKK has generated  about $3 million for the city each year in business license taxes, city  Accounting Manager Basil Panas said.  </P> <P> Residents also complained Monday that the BKK development would generate huge  increases in traffic, especially along Azusa Avenue, the city's most congested  corridor. They said the environmental report did not adequately explore ways to  solve the potential traffic woes.  </P> <P> Councilman Steve Herfert agreed. "It's going to be a zoo down there," he said.  Herfert added that he is concerned about the city's liability in paving the way  for development near a former dump.  </P> <P> In addition, resident Royall Brown, a director of the Upper San Gabriel Valley  Municipal Water District, said the report did not detail the levels of  contaminants in ground water at the site.  </P> <P> Such data would be essential to any future buyer of the land. "Any buyer of any  property of BKK ought to have (that information) available to them so they'll  know what their liabilities are," he said.  </P> <P> The state Department of Health Services is conducting a series of studies on  the landfill's environmental impact on the neighborhood, city Community  Services Manager Mike Miller said. Reports on cancer occurrences and risks are  to be released later this summer. A report analyzing birth abnormalities will  take longer to prepare, state officials said.  </P> <P> If approved, the other proposed redevelopment areas -- which include vacant  lots, surplus school property and a few homes -- would be used to build  residences, stores and offices.  </P></p>

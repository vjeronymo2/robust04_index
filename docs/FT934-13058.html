			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Newspaper staff victory overturned SIX former employees at The European newspaper, who won a court fight over wrongful dismissal two years ago, saw their victory overturned by the Court of Appeal yesterday. The six, who had been granted 'summary judgment' by the High Court in their compensation claim against the paper's former owner, Mirror Group Newspapers, were told they now faced a legal battle to establish their case. The case turned on the question of who their employer was. If it was MGN, they stood to recover full damages. However, if it was The European Ltd, a privately owned Maxwell company, the money recoverable from its insolvency assets would be less.</p>

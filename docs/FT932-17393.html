			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Support for recycling schemes THE government yesterday announced the allocation of Pounds 15m in supplementary credit approvals for recycling schemes run by local authorities in England. Mr David Maclean, environment minister, said priority had been given to schemes to collect waste oil and ozone-depleting CFCs. In a written reply, he said credit approvals had been authorised for 161 authorities covering 307 schemes, ranging from home composting projects to mini-recycling centres. Supplementary credit approvals allow local authorities to borrow for specific types of capital investment, beyond the limit set by their basic credit approval.</p>

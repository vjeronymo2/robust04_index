			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent R. Babayan; from the "Vesti" </F> newscast]    [Text] According to the approved agenda, parliamentarians  [of the Crimean Supreme Council] are to deal with two issues:  The first issue deals with the composition and structure of the  Crimean Cabinet of Ministers. The second issue deals with  giving decrees by President Meshkov the status of laws of the  Crimean Republic, but only in cases when they refer to the  issues that are not temporarily reflected in the Constitution of  the Crimean state.    Speaking to Supreme Council deputies, Yuriy Meshkov said  that  their civic duty is to approve the proposed composition and  structure of the Crimean Government as soon as possible.  Meshkov continued and warned the deputies that otherwise the  Cabinet of Ministers will be approved by a special decree of the  president. In doing so, he referred to the March opinion poll  of the population. Deputies had an extremely negative reaction  to the ultimatum-like statement by their president. In their  opinion, Yuriy Meshkov does not have the right to approve the  structure and membership of the Cabinet of Ministers by his  decree. Incidentally, parliamentarians stated that the  president's referral to the poll of the population is not  convincing, as a poll is not a referendum and consequently its  results should not be regarded as the will of the peninsula's  citizens. Crimean parliamentarians are convinced that such  behavior on the part of Yuriy Meshkov pursues only one goal--to  establish a regime of dictatorship in the Crimea.</p>

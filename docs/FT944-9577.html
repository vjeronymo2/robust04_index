			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Size the important ingredient - Johnson Matthey and Cookson's merger moves In his last annual report, Mr David Davies, Johnson Matthey chairman, put it quite plainly: 'Size is an important ingredient for a company with our ambitions. We aim to become a constituent member of the FT-SE 100.' Yesterday, the City was wondering whether sheer size was the main ingredient in its possible merger with Cookson. Such a move would push the combined group well into the top 100 UK companies with a market value of about Pounds 2.5bn and annual sales of Pounds 3.5bn. But analysts believe that, size apart, the rewards from putting the two together would be fairly modest. 'Size brings some benefits in its own right but the merger is driven more by the ambitions of the managements than anything else,' said one leading analyst. Such sceptical views were encouraged by the companies' decision not to elaborate publicly on the merger talks, news of which leaked out over the weekend. But the general reaction was mildly positive, with Johnson Matthey shares ending 10p higher at 581p while Cookson edged up 1p to 252p. The concrete benefits analysts could point to were the potential cost savings. Both companies have large London head offices costing some Pounds 10m a year, and also have some overlap in operations and research. Eliminating the duplication could generate savings of more than Pounds 20m year which would be useful, if not spectacular, in the context of current combined profits of about Pounds 200m. In at least one business area, electronic materials, a merger would also make strategic sense. Cookson is one of the world's leading manufacturers of speciality chemicals and laminates used in the production of printed circuit boards. Johnson Matthey supplies many of the same electronics manufacturers with complementary products. Electronic materials will provide more than a third of the two companies' combined profits this year and the merged group would be one of the top five suppliers in the world. There are other areas of overlap but most have been addressed already with the joint venture in ceramic colours and the sale of Johnson Matthey's jewellery materials business to Cookson. Elsewhere, the groups have little in common: Johnson Matthey is the world's biggest manufacturer of automotive catalytic converters and the leading marketer of platinum group metals; Cookson is Europe's largest maker of plastic flower pots and a world leader in dental floss. Johnson Matthey prides itself on its high level of research and development spending, more than one third of pre-tax profits last year, and sees itself very much as a high technology company. In contrast, while Cookson has sold off most of its assorted engineering businesses much of the group remains fairly mundane. 'If you go round Cookson's operations you realise that it is not as high tech as you might think from looking at the pictures in the annual report,' commented one analyst. One speculation yesterday was that the combined group might be able to contemplate larger disposals of unpromising businesses. The companies themselves are likely to argue that it will allow them to take on biggest acquisitions. Even if the two companies' shareholders buy the arguments in general there is still the ticklish question of valuation. If shares in the new combined group were to be allocated in line with the companies' respective reported profits Cookson investors would get about 57 per cent. However, it is thought that Johnson Matthey will fight for more than 43 per cent, partly on the grounds that it has more conservative accounting policies. Analysts estimate that if it were to switch to Cookson's policies on depreciation and pensions its profits would be some Pounds 7m higher. Johnson Matthey supporters also argue that it has better longer term growth prospects though this is disputed by Cookson followers who point out that Cookson's profits are currently growing faster. Mr Davies and Mr Dick Oster, Cookson's American chief executive, have got plenty to talk about.</p>

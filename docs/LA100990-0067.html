			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: SECRETARY OF STATE;  </P> <P> FLORES ACCUSES EU OF TRASHING TAXPAYER DOLLARS  </P> <P> Joan Milke Flores, Republican candidate for secretary of state, took her  campaign to a large garbage bin in a Los Angeles alley on Monday, accusing  Democratic incumbent March Fong Eu of "throwing away millions of taxpayer  dollars" by mismanaging the office.  </P> <P> Flores attacked Eu for failed or costly efforts to automate two of the office's  seven divisions and for a series of proof-reading errors on state ballot  pamphlets last June and in 1988. Flores said the problems cost more than $6  million to resolve, including $621,000 to reprint millions of corrected  pamphlets.  </P> <P> "California simply cannot afford these continuing careless mistakes," said  Flores, displaying a T-shirt created by employees of the state Office of  Printing bearing the words, "I Survived the Voter Pamflut of 1988!"  </P> <P> Leo McElroy, Eu's campaign consultant, called Flores' charges "incredible  distortions of the truth" and said some of the increased costs were beyond Eu's  control. While acknowledging the proof-reading errors, he said Eu's "good  detective work" in one of the automation projects saved the state from buying a  computer system for the Uniform Commercial Code Division that did not work.  </P> <P> "I think (Flores) failed to understand what was going on here, or interpreted  it to her own satisfaction," McElroy said.  </P> <P> With the election a month away and polls showing her running a distant second,  Flores has moved her campaign into high gear. The allegations Monday came after  a week of hard-hitting television commercials, aired in Los Angeles and  Sacramento, that accused Eu of reducing fines for campaign violations made by  her own reelection committees.  </P> <P> Flores plans to air more television ads, and her campaign is furiously raising  money from a loyal core of donors who have supported her during three terms on  the Los Angeles City Council. Despite a challenge from Eu to abide by  contribution limits under Proposition 73 that were recently ruled  unconstitutional, Flores is soliciting donations well above the limits and  hopes to top the $1-million mark in the coming weeks.  </P> <P> The assault appears to have caught Eu's attention. During much of the campaign,  the four-term incumbent largely ignored Flores' challenge, but this weekend she  hinted that she may be feeling the heat when she ventured into Flores' own back  yard for a fund-raiser.  </P> <P> "This election year, we face a particularly difficult challenge," Eu told about  400 supporters at a union hall in Wilmington, one of several communities Flores  represents at City Hall. "The opposition is well-funded and committed to  avoiding defeat."  </P></p>

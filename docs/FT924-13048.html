			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Suppliers to collieries fear 120,000 job losses THE FALL-OUT from this week's pit closure announcement spread yesterday with a warning from colliery equipment manufacturers that up to 120,000 additional jobs could quickly be lost in the wake of the British Coal decision. Coal industry suppliers expressed astonishment at the imminence of the closures which they said had thrown business plans into chaos and threatened widespread redundancy. Some companies said British Coal had already cancelled orders and was trying to stop other orders that had been despatched by suppliers. The Association of British Mining Equipment Companies said the closure decision threatened tens of thousands of jobs among its own members and within associated industries. Mr Bill Morrell, director general of Abmec, said member companies, with a combined turnover of Pounds 900m a year, were 'absolutely appalled' at the pit closures. Companies had been supplying a declining coal industry and many, as a result, had reduced their dependency on the sector. But the decision would still be catastrophic: 'It has taken our breath away,' he added. Mining equipment manufacturers around the country yesterday warned of reduced capacity and skills which would damage export opportunities. Many doubted that the remaining pits would still provide new orders as modern, state-of-the-art equipment would be shifted from closed collieries. British Coal's central stocking system meant that the company already held extensive supplies. Mr Adrian Parsons, managing director of Century Oils Group, which supplies fire-resistant hydraulic fluids and gear box lubricants to British Coal, said the prospect of a 50 per cent cut in sales next year meant certain job cuts. Mr Philip Kellett, company secretary of Morley Electrical Engineering, the West Yorkshire-based company which supplies industrial motors to British Coal, said the pit closures would have meant collapse for the company if it had not diversified into new products and markets. Mr David Hind, technical director of Senior Davis Derby, which supplies signalling and monitoring equipment to British Coal, said the workforce was 'shattered' at the decision. The company, which employed about 600 people 10 years ago, now has 170 employees. Mr Hind said the pit closures inevitably meant further job losses. He added: 'The miners who are about to lose their jobs will at least benefit from some comparatively generous redundancy payments. But people in supplier industries who are about to lose their jobs will not be so fortunate.' Mr Adrian Buckmaster, chairman and chief executive of MECO International, a Worcester-based maker of conveyor systems, said his company had already made 500 UK workers redundant since last summer. There would be no immediate job cuts but the outlook depended on investment plans for those pits which remained.</p>

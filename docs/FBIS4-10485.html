			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Interior Vice Minister Ruben Villalba  Cataldi, two Arabs presumably entered our country with the  intention of carrying out illegal actions, but one of them has  apparently already left the country.    Moreover, the National Police limited themselves to  reporting  that they are checking out the information that has been  provided by the Israeli Secret Service, through the Israeli  Embassy, indicating that Arabs had reportedly entered the  country with the objective of carrying out attacks against  Israelis.    Despite the fact that the police did not provide many  details, Villalba Cataldi stated that there is information that  two Arabs entered the country with that purpose in mind. One of  them has apparently already left the country, while the other is  being sought by the police, according to the vice minister.    Commissioner Enrique Martinetti, chief of the Intelligence  Department, stated that an investigation has already begun in  cooperation with the Migrations Department, Interpol, and  authorities of the 4th Police Zone based in Ciudad del Este, as  it is believed that the Arabs entered the country through that  city.    The Israeli Embassy has not been observed to have taken any  special measures for the security of its diplomats and officials.</p>

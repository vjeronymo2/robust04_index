			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Hoare Govett launches index tracking investment trust Hoare Govett is launching an investment trust to track its recently developed HG 1000 index, which covers the smallest 2 per cent of UK listed companies. An institutional placing of shares in the new trust, which is to be called Hoare Govett 1000, is expected to raise up to Pounds 30m. Trading in the shares starts on November 15. The trust will aim to match broadly both changes in the capital value of the index and its gross dividend yield by investing in 300 or more of the 1,000 companies which constitute the index. The largest are capitalised at just over Pounds 50m, and the smallest at under Pounds 1m. The size of the fund is limited by the lack of liquidity in the target market. 'The typical smaller company trades about once a week, and clearly considerable patience is required if a stake is to be built in smaller components of the HG 1000,' said Professors Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh, of the London Business School, in a report on the new index. The fund will be managed by Broadgate Investment Management, which already manages a trust tracking Hoare Govett's main smaller companies index. Both have an annual management charge of 1 per cent.</p>

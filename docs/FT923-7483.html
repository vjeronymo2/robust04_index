			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Ercros collapse followed cutback of funds by Kuwait THE KUWAITI government appears to have been directly responsible for triggering the collapse of Spain's biggest chemicals group, Ercros, and a credit crisis at its third largest developer, Prima Inmobilaria, by cutting short a massive transfer of funds for 1992 to the Spanish industrial and property assets of the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO). A confidential schedule of payments shows that between February 4 and June 2 this year the KIO passed nearly Dollars 700m to the Grupo Torras, its Spanish holding company. However, the transfers were not considered as fresh capital by the Kuwaiti authorities and the Finance Ministry, over-riding the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA, the KIO's governing body) decided they should be stopped or dramatically curtailed. It is understood that the KIO is increasingly responsible directly to the Finance Minister, Mr Nasser al-Rawdan, who has just published a tough 1993 budget, more than halving the 1992 deficit. The funds transferred were for a variety of capital and interest payments by Torras and its affiliates. They included Dollars 55m to the Caja Madrid savings bank on February 7, Dollars 60m to Barclays Bank on February 11, Dollars 300m to Banco Santander on February 28, Dollars 68m to Bank of America on March 25, Dollars 100m to Chase Manhattan two days later and a further Dollars 21m to Chase on April 6. The schedule of payments was agreed at a meeting in Kuwait on January 24 this year between the KIA, KIO, and the former management of Torras, whose interests include large foods, paper and property companies. This followed a pessimistic report to the KIA last December on the Spanish assets by the KIO's auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick, recommending a Dollars 1bn cash injection for Torras. The schedule reveals for the first time the scale of assistance that was being given to the KIO businesses in Spain before a new KIO president, Mr Ali-Rashaid Al-Bader, was appointed in May. Since the transfers were interrupted, Spain's biggest chemicals company, Ercros, which is 39 per cent owned by Torras, has gone into receivership and Prima, the property group 33 per cent owned by Torras, has had to negotiate a two-month moratorium on capital repayments to creditor banks.

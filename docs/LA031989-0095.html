			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Soviet Union shut down Armenia's only nuclear power plant because of an  outcry over its safety sparked by last December's earthquake, the official Tass  news agency said. The 13-year-old plant, 24 miles from the Armenian capital of  Yerevan, is the first operating nuclear station to be decommissioned in the  Soviet Union. The plant, built in the heart of a major earthquake zone, had  been expected to operate 30 years. It was designed to withstand earthquakes  measuring up to a magnitude of 9.0. The government has insisted the plant  suffered no serious damage in the Dec. 7 temblor that registered a magnitude of  6.9. The quake leveled several towns in Armenia and left 25,000 people dead.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn] </F>   [Text] Cairo this week received U.S. and German military  officials, who paid separate visits with a view to increasing  the number of countries that will participate in the Bright Star  exercises next year. General Joseph Hoare, commander of the  U.S. Central Command, arrived in Cairo on a secret visit. He  was followed by General Klaus Naumann [name as published],  German chief of staff, whose visit was announced.    AL-SHA'B has learned that the U.S. official's talks in Egypt  dealt with broadening the scope of participation in the Bright  Star maneuvers to include, in addition to Egypt and the United  States, Germany, Britain, and France. Following Egypt's  approval, the German official came to put the final touches on  what had already been agreed upon regarding his country's  participation in the maneuvers. Germany hopes to gain from  these exercises training expertise in the face of the Islamic  movements in North Africa.    According to information, Egypt's approval to increase the  number of Western states participating in the exercises was  conditional on the participation of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.  Egypt also wanted the exercise to be general and not directed  at facing any regional threat, unlike the previous Bright Star  exercises, which were directed against what was called the  Libyan threat!    Explaining the benefits that the participation of Germany,  France, Britain, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait in these exercises  could provide, the Egyptian side claimed that it would stress  the continued reliance of the Western allies on Egyptian  facilities! It will also enable Egypt to get better acquainted  with the combat methods of the advanced states and allow the  military commanders from the participating states to get  together, which could convince the United States of the  importance of Egypt's participation in safeguarding Gulf  security! This step, officials claim, will prompt the United  States to supply Egypt with its military needs.    AL-SHA'B has learned that Britain's participation in the  exercises depends on resolving the problems related to the naval  training protocol signed by Cairo and London. The British  insist that the British military personnel training on Egyptian  territory not be subject to Egyptian law and refuses reciprocal  treatment for Egyptian military on British territory.</p>

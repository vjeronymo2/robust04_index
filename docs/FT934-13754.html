			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Haemocell's new arrangements Haemocell, the maker of medical equipment, said yesterday it can now move 'towards new distribution arrangements' in the US following the termination of an exclusive marketing agreement with Stryker Corp, the medical products company. The company said all 'outstanding issues relating to the termination' of the Stryker agreement, announced in August, had been resolved. Mr David Wathen, chief executive, said he could not comment on the cost of unwinding the Stryker agreement as the Haemocell was in its close period. 'Suffice it to say we are very, very happy with the arrangements in place', he said. Haemocell dropped the exclusive arrangement with Stryker in August after sales targets were not met, Mr Trevor Wilson, operations director, said at the time.</p>

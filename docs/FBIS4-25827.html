He made a  congratulatory speech in which he said that the broad masses of  returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas Chinese, and  Overseas Chinese have the fine tradition of loving their country  and their native places, have extensive contacts overseas and  abundant information resources, and are an important force for  China's modernization. Thus, they can definitely make a big  contribution to the great undertaking of invigorating the  Chinese nation and the reunification of the motherland.    Qian Qichen said that returned Overseas Chinese, relatives  of  Overseas Chinese, and the broad masses of Overseas Chinese have  made great contributions to China's revolution and construction  during the various historical periods; they have added an epic  chapter to the annals of China's rise and prosperity and the  Chinese nation's advancement and invigoration. In the new  historical period, the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese  and relatives of Overseas Chinese are active in posts in various  trades. They have eagerly engaged in the undertakings of  reform, opening up, and socialist modernization with a great  sense of mission and a great sense of responsibility. They have  scored marked results in promoting China's economic development  and social advancement and have played an active role in the  great undertaking of reunification of the motherland. The broad  masses of Overseas Chinese are most enthusiastic about China's  opening up to the outside world, about the development of  economic and trade cooperation between China and foreign  countries, and about scientific, technological, and cultural  exchanges. They have joined hands with the peoples of the  countries in which they reside for progress and they have done a  great deal of work for the prosperity and advancement of those  countries and for the development of ties between those  countries and China. They have devoted themselves to China's  reform and construction with absolute sincerity.    He pointed out that the All-China Federation of Returned  Overseas Chinese is a people's organization under the leadership  of the CPC and belonging to the returned Overseas Chinese and  relatives of Overseas Chinese throughout the country. It is the  bridge and link through which the CPC and the Chinese Government  foster ties with the returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of  Overseas Chinese, and Overseas Chinese. In the new situation,  the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese has  heavier duties and its status and functions have become more  important. The organizations of the All- China Federation of  Returned Overseas Chinese at various levels must use Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as guidance, uphold the CPC's basic line,  closely center on economic construction when launching work,  thoroughly perform their duties, and build the All-China  Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese into a vivid and  energetic "home of the returned Overseas Chinese" which is  trusted by the broad masses of people.    Qian Qichen said that the party and the government attach  great importance to the role of returned Overseas Chinese,  relatives of Overseas Chinese, and Overseas Chinese in  revolution and construction and that they attach great  importance to Overseas Chinese work. In the new situation, the  CPC and the Chinese Government must strengthen and improve  leadership over Overseas Chinese work, give full play to the  role of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese,  and enthusiastically care for and support its work. Qian Qichen  believed that after the meeting of the representatives, a new  pattern of Overseas Chinese work, one which is characterized by  unity and bold advancement, will emerge in China.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Takao Toshikawa, INSIDE LINE chief editor: </F> "`Illusionary Agreement' Disappeared Prior to Summit Talks"]    [Text] "Misreading" by Both U.S. and Japanese  Ambassadors    A scene shown on a television relay screen -- Ambassador to  Japan W. Mondale, head dropped with hands covering his face, and  Ambassador to the United States Takakazu Kuriyama among the high  officials on both sides lined up beside both U.S.-Japanese  leaders at a joint press conference -- probably symbolically  indicated the state of the recent U.S.-Japan Summit Talks.    At any rate, if President Clinton could say, "It is better  not to make an agreement with no substance," Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa responded, "There should be no nebulous  settlement," and the U.S.-Japan economic framework negotiation  ended without agreement at the U.S.-Japan summit talks on 11  February. It was the first time in history of postwar  U.S.-Japanese relations extending over 49 years to see a  U.S.-Japan summit conference ends in collapse with flat  opposition.    The fact that the economic framework negotiations of two  preeminent economic superpowers, the United States and Japan,  ran aground in a complete deadlock means a great risk not only  for both countries, but also for the world. Why did it end up in  a state of collapse? What was behind this worst conclusion?    What first can be pointed out as a direct cause is the  "misreading" committed by both the United States and Japan. Both  sides mutually misread the other's thoughts and attitude more  than once and that was linked to a conclusion causing them  greatly to lose sight of the route to agreement. Both  ambassadors, Mondale, a figure who appeared on television  holding his head, and Kuriyama, were those among "responsible  parties."    Ambassador to Japan Mondale returned to the United States  accompanied by J. Foster, councilor of the U.S. Embassy in  Japan, on 8 February [1994] in advance of Hosokawa's visit to  the United States, and reported to President Clinton information  and feelings about the Japan side obtained from Deputy Prime  Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Shinseito  Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa with whom he had talked on the  7th, the previous day. He transmitted to the president his  judgement that "The Japan side probably will give in at the  end." No doubt this Mondale report greatly influenced the  negotiation attitude of the U.S. side.    On the other hand, when Ambassador to the U.S. Kuriyama  returned to Japan for a short time and visited Prime Minister  Hosokawa at his official residence on 1 February, he strongly  urged that a worsening of U.S.-Japan relations must absolutely  be avoided and advised that "We should make concessions since  numerical goals in the government procurement area will be  acceptable. At this time, however, high officials on the U.S.  side considered to be the Japan-reconciliation group such as  presidential aide R. Rubin (in charge of National Economic  Council or NEC) and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury R. Altman,  people with the greatest influence in the White House, had been  leaning toward abandonment of "numerical goals." The advice of  Ambassador Kuriyama, therefore, exposed his own low level of  intelligence.    The multiplication effect of these misreadings caused both  sides to make a misjudgment on agreement. However, a more  substantive cause that drove the economic framework  negotiations to collapse was the negotiation stance itself of  both the United States and Japan. While the Clinton  administration was citing "change" and the Hosokawa regime was  advocating "reform," the basic perception of both sides about  their negotiating partner remained unchanged.    In other words, the reading of the United States was that if  it initially hurled big demands and continued to exert strong  pressure, Japan ultimately would completely surrender as usual;  and the Japan side, convinced that the U.S. side would keep  pushing with no room for compromise, thought only of dodging the  other's attack.    What actually happened was that the United States was  studying concessions with basic demands at a certain stage and  Japan said "No" at the last moment.  <H5>  Victorious Mood Only at Kasumigaseki </H5>   Of course, there was neither victory nor defeat because it  collapsed without reaching agreement. Notwithstanding, as soon  as the decision was made to break it off, the tone of the media  was all a warning of "U.S. retaliation," and voices of  irritation were raised in the industrial sector such as, "Anyone  can say `No' and worsen relations. It is diplomacy to improve  relations" (major precision machinery company president).    However, Kasumigaseki was different, and bureaucrats had a  sort of victorious mood. Especially Koichiro Matsuura, deputy  minister for foreign affairs (in charge of economics), Ministry  of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister for  international affairs, Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI), and others who had crossed swords with the U.S.  side on the very front line of the economic framework  negotiations related somewhat excitedly just as the summit  conference ended that "This (having said `No') was a symbol of a  new U.S.-Japan era." Then words of merry self-praise were also  heard from among the officers at MOFA, the Ministry of Finance  (MOF), and MITI, such as "We have said `No' for the first time  in U.S.-Japan relations since the war," "This is the beginning  of a mature U.S.-Japan relationship," and "Japan has become on  par with Europe by this."    Viewing the government agency side which had continued to be  swayed by the U.S. side in previous U.S.-Japan trade relations,  it probably was a refreshing thought to have said "No" to the  United States for the first time. That is understood, but can it  not be said that the merry attitude of such joy at just saying  "No" is itself proof that U.S.-Japan relations still are  immature. Also at the same time, one feels that there is a  dangerous omen in their manner of nationalistic applause at "No"  to the United States. The danger that a "government official  led" anti-U.S., hate-U.S. mood will be fomented probably is  clear.    However, it does not seem that Prime Minister Hosokawa  himself said "No" with the intention of opening "mature, adult  relationships." In the plane that flew to Washington on 10  February, the prime minister had rehearsed his English speech  and took a nap. He hoped for the best and seemed to have thought  at worst "partial agreement" was possible.    How and where had that been misread? Before investigation of  the circumstances in detail, I would like to summarize here the  points of the U.S.-Japan economic framework negotiations.    The economic framework negotiations started based on "a  framework for a new economic partnership between the United  States and Japan" decided at Tokyo talks between [former] Prime  Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and President Clinton in July 1993, and  the Structural Impediments Initiative and individual field talks  that previously had been conducted were consolidated together  here. There are 23 structural fields that are the targets of the  discussions, but three fields of government procurement,  insurance, and auto and auto parts are considered the priority  fields.    Since September 1993, over 10 U.S.-Japan discussions had  proceeded by field with vice minister level meetings as the  axis, but "objective criteria" and "numerical goals" became the  greatest problem points among them. A U.S.-Japan agreement was  made on objective criteria as "a method to measure the degree of  Japanese market openness," but as opposed to the U.S. side which  considered this "establishment of future goals," the Japan side  thought it to be "a method measuring the current degree based on  past performance," and these opposing views became a cause of  dispute to the end. Regarding numerical goals, U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR) M. Kantor says, "We have not used those  words even once." However, the Japan side criticizes that "The  numbers which the U.S. side has brought out as objective  criteria are numerical goals themselves" and has refused to  accept them. Especially the U.S. demand that "(Japan) also  guarantee the past growth rate of 20 percent for auto parts in  the future" has become the biggest point of opposition and  became one of the major factors that caused the U.S.-Japan  summit conference to collapse.  <H5>  "Compromise Proposal" Offered </H5>   What were the actual moves at the U.S.-Japan economic  framework negotiations, and what offense and defense unfolded on  the surface and behind negotiations?    With the Hosokawa-Clinton talks on 11 February near at hand,  the discussions centering on vice minister level talks were at  the crucial moment. A government source who participated in the  negotiations says, "At the beginning of February, there were  prospects for an agreement on most of the insurance field and  government procurement, and the situation was that about 80  percent could be settled at the summit talks."    But the opposition in the auto and auto parts field became a  bottleneck and negotiations became deadlocked. On the afternoon  of 8 February, USTR Kantor gave notice that "he would like to  suspend negotiations temporarily." A dark mood spread through  the Japan side negotiation team.    However, on the evening of the 9 February [1994], Deputy  Minister Matsuura of Foreign Affairs was invited to dinner by B.  Cutter, deputy presidential aid (in charge of international  economics), who was the responsible person on the U.S. side at  the administrative level, and offered "a compromise proposal."  It was verbal. The contents of it were 1) numerical goals would  not be included, 2) macro fields, government procurement, and  insurance fields would be lumped together, and 3) auto and auto  parts would be postponed one to two months. By this, it would be  acceptable to the Japan side. Wondering "can it be true?," the  Japan side took heart.    Immediately, the Japan side tried to confirm "the Cutter  proposal," in the negotiations between Matsuura and USTR Deputy  Representative S. Bashevski (government procurement); Vice  Minister Okamatsu of International Affairs, MITI, and Under  Secretary J. Garten of Commerce (auto and auto parts); and Vice  Minister Kosuke Nakahira of International Affairs, MOF, and  Under Secretary of the Treasury L. Summers (insurance); but  there was no such feeling or a sentiment for concessions on the  U.S. side. It was strange.  <H5>  Internal Leadership Struggle on U.S. Side </H5>   Amidst this, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hata  went to Washington a bit earlier than Prime Minister Hosokawa.  The first Hata-Kantor talks began at 0730 in the morning on the  10th. At the outset, Kantor faced Hata and appealed, "Let's aim  at goals." Since Hata had received a report regarding "the  Cutter proposal" of the previous evening, he responded, "I  understand what you are saying. That's probably the thing."    However, this was a strange Zen dialogue. Hata intended to  express his resolve that "Because we accept the Cutter proposal,  let's take it down to the administrative level once on that line  before bring it to agreement." Kantor, however, took it that  Hata had shown an attitude of concession and agreed to reopening  practical level discussions. For both, it was jumping to such a  hasty conclusion that it is difficult to believe.    Such being the situation, the Hata and Kantor talks did not  proceed at all. Worried, Matsuura contacted Bashevski and asked,  "What is the matter?" The curt reply was, "The USTR attitude has  not changed at all." Furthermore, at the vice minister level  meeting in the afternoon of the same day, the U.S. side  strengthened its demands for numerical goals. At the second  Hata-Kantor talk that began at 1600, a heated argument was  exchanged concerning the meaning of "aim at goals."    There was an important move between this first and second  Hata-Kantor talks. The National Economic Council (NEC) was held  for a talk with Kantor at the White House, and President  Clinton, who had received the report of "a sense of concession  on the Japan side" from Kantor, instructed, "Let's go with the  original plan. Don't make an agreement without substance." The  foreshadowing was laid here for the breakdown of discussions.    At 1700 on the 10th, with Prime Minister Hosokawa, who had  arrived in Washington, the Japan side held "an Imperial  conference" until late at night in Blair House, the  accommodations for the prime minister. Prime Minister Hosokawa,  who was informed of the hardline attitude of the U.S. side by  Hata on this occasion, was considered to have made up his mind  on "the inevitable collapse."    After this, although the final Hata-Kantor talk was  conducted  beginning at 0100 on the 11th, it was more or less mutually to  confirm the other's intransigence and subsequently proceeded all  at once to the conclusion of the Hosokawa-Clinton talks.    The above was the scene of the finale of the U.S.-Japan  economic framework negotiations, but main point in this process  was the "illusionary Cutter proposal." That this ended in an  apparition was clearly because of an inside fight for leadership  on the U.S. side. In other words, as opposed to the  reconciliation group of Rubin, Cutter, and others who moved  toward concessions with Japan, the hardline group centered on  USTR Kantor rolled back and President Clinton gave the nod to  the hardline group.    However, the Japan side, which could not read the movements  beneath the surface on the U.S. side, believed in the "Cutter  proposal" until the next day, misread the other's attitude, and  added to that, misreadings by the U.S. side which took the  attitude of the Japan side to be "concession" complicated the  negotiation. In other words, it was a collapse which  "misreadings" by both sides invited.  <H5>  Proposal Carefully Read by Clinton </H5>   There are two very interesting facts concerning the U.S.  perception of Japan and attitude determination in the economic  framework negotiations.    One was a letter (dated 20 January) sent to President  Clinton  before the summit conference by Glen Fukushima (chief, General  Policy Division, Japan Branch Office, AT&amp;T and vice  president of  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Japan), who was thoroughly  conversant of the ins and outs of U.S.-Japan trade negotiations  as a former acting deputy USTR representative (in charge of  Japan).    It has been confirmed by the notes of the president himself  and signatures of high officials that the president carefully  scanned this Fukushima paper and also had high officials at the  White House read it.    The contents of the Fukushima paper essentially were an  analysis of the current state of the U.S.-Japan relationship,  frank criticism of the Clinton Administration's policy on Japan,  and a proposal concerning concessions to Japan as well as  strategy on Japan. For example, concerning the attitude to  which the Clinton Administration should adhere in negotiations  with Japan, he advised that they must not deal with Japanese  bureaucrats, "Premised on the power of (Japan's) central  government bureaucrats, the U.S. Government will unfortunately  take the wrong road if it pays heed to the advice of Japanese  bureaucrats whose own existence depend on maintaining the status  quo."    It is interesting to learn the places that attracted the  attention of the president in the Fukushima's letter by  President Clinton's notes and underlines. Like thus, for  example. There is the scribble "agree" at the places where it  says "The recession will continue longer than expected, but the  roots of the Japanese economy will not be harmed. They will  come back again as the strongest enemy" and "On the problem of  opening Japanese markets, the Clinton administration...does not  understand when, where, and in what degree to apply it  (pressure)." Moreover, he underlined it in 15 places such as  "Even if an agreement is made (with Japan), problems will occur  several months later due to interpretation of words."    A copy of this Fukushima paper was passed to nine high  officials in the Clinton administration such as USTR  Representative Kantor and secretary of the treasury Bentsen by  instruction of the president.    Another interesting fact is the "performance" that was  carried out at the White House directly after the U.S.-Japan  summit talks.    After the joint press conference following the summit talks,  special Washington correspondents of the Japanese media, one  from each company, were invited into the Roosevelt Room, which  is next door to the Oval Room (president's office). Tea and cake  were served, and there were three hosts to the special  correspondents: Kantor, presidential adviser D. Gargen, and S.  Bargar, deputy presidential aide in charge of the National  Security Council.    The reason for this get-together was "because we do not want  to create a misunderstanding among Asian people because of this  collapse" (Gargen), but when they got into the briefing, the  talk of the three on the White House side was in the tone that  "President Clinton emphasized that he sympathized with Prime  Minister Hosokawa" (after the summit talks), and when the two  left the East Room, the president took the arm of Prime Minister  Hosokawa. This is important." They made many comments that  emphasized the strength of the ties between Hosokawa and Clinton.    A special correspondent who participated [in the  get-together] commented that "The U.S. side is annoyed by the  attitude of Japanese bureaucrats in the recent U.S.-Japan  economic framework negotiations. So, the White House held a  performance to separate Hosokawa from the bureaucrats."  <H5>  Hosokawa and Clinton Secret Agreement Theory </H5>   Of the recent U.S.-Japan economic framework negotiations  which was complicated by misreadings on both sides, the most  disappointing issue to the president was the Japanese income tax  cut.    Having continued to press for expansion of Japanese domestic  demand, the hopes which the U.S. side had pinned upon an  economic stimulus measure through an income tax cut by the  Hosokawa cabinet was greater than imagined by Japan, and the  desire of the U.S. side was "at least 10 trillion yen" as the  tax cut amount. On this point also, it seems that the U.S. side  had obtained the feeling through the pipeline of Councilor  Foster and Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa that "If the  political reform issue were cleared, Hosokawa would undoubtedly  carry out a large tax cut."    Then, there is the "Hosokawa-Clinton secret agreement  theory"  concerning the income tax cut. According to this secret  agreement theory which has been greatly circulated by stock  market sources, if the Hosokawa regime implements a domestic  demand expansion policy of "an income tax cut on the scale of  about 7 trillion yen and a three-year period of the consumption  tax deferment," the Clinton administration would consider some  type of concession regarding numerical goals at the final stage  of economic framework negotiations. Or, there is also a theory  that the agreement with Clinton was continued acceptance of  economic framework negotiations, not numerical goals.    The Hosokawa cabinet took up tax system reform when the  political reform bill was completed, per those expectations of  the U.S. side. However, the concept of a 6 trillion yen tax cut  combined with a "national welfare tax" announced at early dawn  on 3 February encountered opposition within the coalition ruling  party and the disfavor of public opinion and was scrapped in one  day. As a result, "a single fiscal year 6 trillion yen" income  tax and residential tax cut were brought out again on 8 February  right before the U.S.-Japan summit talks.    President Clinton was disappointed by this. Since it would  have been three years before a raise in the consumption tax rate  if it had been the scrapped tax cut bill, the tax cut amount for  a three years' portion at 6 trillion yen would total 18 trillion  yen. However, it will end at 6 trillion yen with a single fiscal  year limit. The U.S. side decide that it would not serve to  expand domestic demand.    Secretary of the Treasury Bentsen, therefore, came to sound  out the MOF about "whether the 6 trillion tax cut could continue  in the second year and thereafter," but Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii only repeated the vague response that "future  issues await a consensus among the ruling party." Even at vice  minister class discussions, Vice Minister Nakahira of  International Affairs could not respond at all to the inquiries  by Under Secretary Summers of the Treasury.    The president, who had been betrayed in expectations that  "Hosokawa would make a large tax cut," explored "the possibility  of a prime minister's political decision concerning a tax cut  for a second year and thereafter" at the summit talks, but Prime  Minister Hosokawa only said, "because of the Japanese budget  compilation system and political situation, under present  conditions, I can only agree to a tax cut measure for a single  year. One high official at the White House relates that  "Hosokawa gave the president the impression that he was dancing  to the choreography of MOF bureaucrats."    The "secret agreement" on "some type of concessions in  numerical goals" was called off by this.    Ultimately, even though refusing "an agreement without  substance," President Clinton undoubtedly had tied expectations  to the attitude of the Japan side until the last moment. At the  stage directly before the summit talks, he awaited "a souvenir"  from the Japan side because it had been the old trick of the  Japan side in previous U.S.-Japan negotiations that while being  noncommittal up until the final phase of negotiations, the big  shots of Japan would fly into Washington at the last moment  carrying some "souvenir" or a nice "hidden jewel."  <H5>  "Doesn't Want To See His Face" </H5>   The U.S. side seem to have thought that the Japan side would  make similar moves again. They thought that "the U.S. visit by  Kiuchi" on 8 February "probably would be that." Akitane Kiuchi,  former ambassador to France, "set out to explore the feelings of  the U.S. side" as a special envoy of the prime minister (MOFA  source), but the U.S. side viewed it as perhaps coming with "a  souvenir" because he was specially flying in before the summit  talks. Actually, however, Special Envoy Kiuchi was completely  empty-handed.    Next, the U.S. side expectations were for the "the U.S.  visit  by Hata." Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hata was  initially scheduled to go with Prime Minister Hosokawa, but he  entered Washington a day earlier than the prime minister on 9  February. On the day before his departure, Hata had invited  Ambassador Mondale to the MOFA Iikura Kokan Building to talk.  There even was the observation circulating among U.S.-Japan  negotiations sources in Washington who welcomed Hata that "the  `souvenir' would be either a policy of enlarging the income tax  cut or concessions in the field of auto and auto parts."  However, Hata was also completely empty-handed and he did not  bring so much as a "hidden jewel."    The ones who bring the "souvenir" or "hidden jewel" are  generally influential men because of the very fact that they are  big shots, and the ones who prepare them are bureaucrats.  Therefore, if they do not know how to handle the bureaucrats,  they have no choice but to go empty-handed. So, doubts increased  on the U.S. side about the leadership ability of Prime Minister  Hosokawa.    Such being the circumstance, the Japanese side being at the  beck and call of the bureaucrats was markedly noticeable in the  recent economic framwork negotiations. With their state of  self-complacency that "we have squelched them because they have  brought out unreasonable numbers" even at the division chief  class on the administrative level, the repulsion of the U.S.  side at the excessive "bureaucratic leadership" style had  escalated. Amidst this, the communications gap between the MOF  and the Treasury Department on macro policy matters was  terrible, and Under Secretary Summers of the Treasury, who was  the responsible person for U.S. side negotiations in the  insurance field, had spoken out that "I don't want to see the  face" of Vice Minister Nakahira of Foreign Affairs, the person  responsible on the Japan side.  <H5>  High Yen Inducement Strategy in Future </H5>   The fact that "a Japan that can say no" showed itself to the  world in the recent U.S.-Japan summit talks can probably be  called a harvest in its own way. At the same time, however, it  also has angered the United States to the extent that voices  have been raised, "Why did Hosokawa especially come as far as  Washington if it was just to say `No'" (U.S. government  authority)?    Just by the fact that the United States got into a rage, the  exchange market swung to a high yen directly after the collapse  of the U.S.-Japan summit talks and leapt to $1 equals 101 yen.  It seems that lately the yen market somewhat has recovered its  composure, but full-scale invokement of U.S. "high yen  inducement strategy" will be in the future and the possibility  must be viewed of a yen rise to the "$1 equals 105 yen to 95  yen" level advocated by F. Bargsten, the director of the  Institute of International Economics (IIE), who is an  influential adviser on economic policy in the Clinton  administration.    Japan's export industry is calculated to become a minus of 1  trillion yen overall if it becomes 5 yen higher to the dollar.  However, this is strictly a macro number and viewed on the  corporate level including subcontracts and sub-subcontracts,  that damage probably will be close to a fatal blow.    In addition to that, as a retaliatory measure for the "No"  of  Japan, the United States has worked out various sanctions  against Japan. The demand to open the market for mobile  telephones was the first shot, but sanctions against Japan  centering on electrical communications instruments and the  auto-related undoubtedly will accelerate and expand in the  future.    There also has been a move to restore the Super 301 Clause  (designation and sanction of unfair trade nations) of the  General Trade Law. From the outset, President Clinton is a man  who has advocated the revival and strengthening of the Super 301  Clause since during the presidential election and together with  pressure from Congress and government circles, the restoration  of the Super 301 Clause by presidential order is a very great  possibility.    It will take time procedurally until such sanction measures  move to implementation, but it seems that the aim of the U.S.  side is to produce a "combined effect" with the high yen  strategy which has an immediate effect. There is also the  ominous view that "If the two-stage strategy of high yen and  sanctions is invoked, a Clinton Shock to rival the previous  Nixon Shock will attack Japan" (international finance source).  In any case, the compensation for having asserted "No" in  Washington will probably be a lot more pain than the politicians  and bureaucrats anticipated.  <H5>  Cost of "No" Really Is Expensive </H5>   Prime Minister Hosokawa, who found that the retaliatory  reaction of the U.S. side was unexpectedly strong, is trying  hard to put together a new open market policy along with  tendering his submission that "the U.S. Government take sensible  decisions and actions," but so long as he does not propose  anything more than the recent demands by the U.S. side, the U.S.  side would not consent. A move is now proceeding within the U.S.  Government that will cause Prime Minister Hosokawa anxiety. That  is the move toward regression by the Japan-reconciliation group  and an enlargement of the voice of the hardline group. Before  the U.S.-Japan opposition concerning the economic framework  negotiations deepened, Presidential Aide Rubin (former chairman  of Goldman Saxs), Deputy Secretary Altman (former vice chairman  of the Blackstone Group) of the Treasury, and others who have  been called "the Wall Street mafia" in the U.S. Government and  the White House because of coming from the financial sector, had  a voice as the Japan-reconciliation group. However, Altman was  angry that the Hosokawa regime broke its pledge with the United  States with the income tax cut and has left the  Japan-reconciliation group. Rising in position there is the  Japan-hardline group such as USTR Kantor and USTR Deputy  Representative Bashevski, considered the "attorney mafia" having  been attorneys, who scored in the U.S.-Japan economic framework  negotiations.    The trend of this "Wall Street mafia" versus "attorney  mafia"  greatly influenced the conclusion of the economic framework  negotiations. In the future, the hardline group probably will  also have an increased voice in the aspect of sanctions against  Japan.    Japan has been treated lightly, such as saying that in  Japan,  "They can say No...." However, as we have just found out, the  cost of "No" is really expensive. In the advanced diplomatic  nation of Great Britain, when they want to say "No," they say,  "Yes, but..." or in other words, that is right, but....</p>

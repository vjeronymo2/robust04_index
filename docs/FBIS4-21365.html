			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Erzsebet Schmuck, cochairman of the Green </F> Alternative Party, by Daniel Bodnar; place and date not given:  "The Concept of the Green Alternative: Natural Harmony"]    [Text] The Green Alternative Party [ZA] was established on  Environmental Protection Day on 5 June 1993. The creation of  this party was justified by the fact that the Hungarian Green  Party kept drifting to the right and, therefore, the  environmental and nature protection movements in Hungary  distanced themselves from this party. The fact that the  Federation of European Green Parties accepted the ZA among its  members represents an appreciation for the party's activity so  far. We interviewed Erzsebet Schmuck, cochairman of the ZA.    Bodnar: What is the goal of your party?    Schmuck: Our main goal is to send an adequate  number of deputies into Parliament and, later, also to the  self-government bodies. It is extremely important to create a  so-called green control at all legislative levels.  Unfortunately, the cause of environmental protection has been  forced into the background as against various interests in the  past four years, in spite of the fact that, earlier, the current  parliamentary parties promised something else. It is perhaps  sufficient to mention the fact that a new and modern  environmental protection law has not been submitted to  Parliament to this very day; the obsolete law legislated in 1976  is still valid in Hungary.    Bodnar: Would you give some details about your  program?    Schmuck: We have a comprehensive and complex  program, one that does not only aim at solving environmental  problems in the narrow sense of the word, but it also covers all  areas of economic and social life. For example, the fact that  we are also dealing with social issues is automatically  connected with the fact that the roots of environmental problems  are to be found in the economy itself and in the people's  lifestyle and customs. Our party is striving to discover and  treat the causes, rather than carry out symptomatic treatment.  The basic principle of our program is to recreate a harmony  between man and nature. The present and future key issue is how  we can coordinate the economic and ecological interests. An  increasing number of people and politicians find this need,  because the exploitation of natural resources is so widespread  today that is could actually become a factor hindering economic  development. The serious recession all over the world and the  serious economic problems today can also be traced to this  circle of problems.    Bodnar: Many people regard your ideas as a  utopia....    Schmuck: People should read our program published  in the Election Bulletin. Many people called us up recently and  told us that the public indeed formed the opinion about the ZA  that we were following a utopia but, after reading our program,  they support us because, in their opinion, our ideas are  realistic and offer a solution that would make survival  possible, namely to slowly find the way out of the crisis, to  build an environment-friendly economy and society. We think  that the seriousness of this problem will force everyone to move  in this direction. I am convinced that our program is realistic  and even viable.    Bodnar: How do you explain the fact that,  contrary to Western Europe, the greens failed to make themselves  properly known in Hungary?    Schmuck: This is not quite true, because a lot of  deputies got into Parliament via the Danube-movement. It is a  fact, however, that, since the change in the regime, the various  environmental protection movements have not been able to  strengthen to the extent desired by this serious problem. This  is also connected to the fact that, contrary to the promises,  the civil organizations did not get the support and  infrastructural background needed for their operation. No  matter how many volunteers there are in the environmental  protection movements, they still need minimal conditions  necessary for their activity, and they lack these conditions.  For example, only a few Hungarian environmental protection  movements have an office to work from. This is a serious  problem.    Bodnar: Which parliamentary party is close to you?    Schmuck: Our relations with the parliamentary  parties is proportional with their treatment of the  environmental issues. The ZA is a party free of ideology. We  have values close to the left, the liberals, and the  conservatives. At the same time, there are trends in all these  three directions that we reject. We are moving in a fourth  axis, and we do not belong to any main stream.    Bodnar: What election results do you count on?    Schmuck: I would like to mention the fact that  most non-parliamentary parties have very little chance of  reaching the 5-percent threshold because they lack financial  resources. However, we will definitely be able to come up with  a national list. I would also like to mention the fact that  Karoly Javor, a parliamentary deputy of the Hungarian Democratic  Forum [MDF], will run in the elections as an independent  representing the ZA. We know that our chances are minimal, but  we hope we will obtain more than 1 percent of the votes. Our  making it into parliament depends on the extent to which the  citizens vote for a so-called green future.</p>

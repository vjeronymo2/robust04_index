			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (31): Cost a crucial component - While British exporters frequently complain of overcharging, Mushtak Parker finds that competition on the continent prevents the practice / How to pick a partner For small and medium sized exporters, freight charges can often make or break a contract. Marginal savings on freight costs can also contribute to cash flow. In some export markets, such as the oil-rich Gulf the freight factor is a predominant issue. 'For lighter fuel exports, for instance, on the price per dozen CFR Dubai, an importer will argue on two or three pence per dozen, saying that his profit margin is only 2 per cent or so,' says Phillip Ballie, export manager of Ukexx Ballie which has an annual turnover of Pounds 500,000 and sells German-made time and light-sensitive printing plates to Africa, the Middle East and the West Indies. Since freight costs - especially in landlocked developing countries such as the CIS - make up almost half export earnings, according to a United Nations report, managing those costs is crucial to success as an exporter. Small exporters must decide whether to leave decisions in the hands of their forwarders or handle the freight buying themselves. Choosing the right freight forwarder is therefore imperative. A common complaint of small and medium-sized British exporters is that they are often overcharged. Some forwarders negotiate discounts with shippers and neglect to subtract the discount from the cost to exporters. At 5 per cent, this could well make the difference between winning a contract and losing it to competitors and often leads to a dispute between the exporter and the forwarder. Top exporters can always buy the best rates, but the small exporter has no such buying power and often suffers as a result. According to Mr Baillie of Ukexx, primarily a UK-based buying house for a Nigerian company, the practice of overcharging is rife. 'You could pick up a phone and speak to half a dozen agents and you will be quoted six different rates. It is a question of building up a relationship with your agent,' he says. 'Small exporters do not have the luxury of an in-house freight forwarding department, which would include a representative of a forwarding firm, which would charge the company on an agency basis,' Mr Baillie adds. The British industry's trade body, the British International Freight Association (Bifa), whose membership comprises some 60 per cent of small and medium-sized companies, acknowledges that there is a problem but blames the government at least for contributing to it. Bifa says that little support has come from government for any form of statutory regulation, whether through the bonding or licensing of forwarders. Further, underwriters have been reluctant to accept the perceived risks the forwarder is exposed to, with the result that freight forwarding has become a free for all. Some British exporters and freight forwarders rue the fact that the Office of Fair Trading has done away with the standard charges and itemised tariffs on the grounds that this represented a cartel with price-fixing. 'Because of the nature of how UK Plc operates - under market principles - the ethos is: 'Let the Buyer (of services) Beware'. Unless he is familiar with the market and understands how it works, he is vulnerable,' says Bifa's divisional manager Colin Beaumont. 'The market ethic is: 'You charge what you can get away with'. The problem is a symptom of market economics and is having a detrimental effect on small business.' Attempts are being made to halt the practice of overcharging. Through its 'New Exporter Initiative', introduced three years ago, Bifa introduced new exporters to a range of freight companies. They were advised as to what questions exporters should ask their freight forwarders, what priorities should be outlined and what freight costs exporters were likely to come up against. Exporters are given a list of accredited members, says Mr Beaumont, and the association trains staff of member companies and urges any exporter who has a complaint against a forwarder who is a member of Bifa to report it. But Bifa itself has come in for criticism from its members. 'A great deal more could have been done in the past to strengthen the image of freight forwarders,' says Mike Guinn, a regional director with the Swiss-based Kuehne &amp; Nagel (K&amp;N) and former chairman of the Bristol-based M&amp;M Services, which K&amp;N bought from the receivers earlier this year. 'Minimum standards and rates should have been introduced from the start. The industry had its own salvation in its hands. It has failed itself.' Mr Guinn concedes, however, that regulations concerning the licensing of freight companies in the UK are not as tough as those in some other EC countries. Across the channel, overcharging is almost non-existent because of the intense competition in the sector. Jean Claude de Gassart, general manager of the Federation Francaise des Organisateurs Commissionaires de Transport (FFOCT), says few complaints are made against its 2,200-strong members. 'Freight forwarding services must be paid for. If they are too expensive, then an exporter will find another freight company. There is sufficient competition to find the right forwarder at the right price,' he says. Freight officials in the Netherlands maintain that competition is so severe that overcharging is not possible. 'Exporters and importers will always complain against charges,' says Han Van Os, general manager of the Netherlands Association for Forwarding &amp; Logistics. 'Profit margins in the freight transport sector are marginal. But a freight company has to make a profit in order to survive. Dutch law allows exporters to do their own forwarding. If they are concerned about the rates then they can do it themselves for less,' he says. Licensing requirements in Britain differ greatly from those in leading countries on the continent. FFOCT's Mr De Gassart is concerned that the opening of the EC's internal frontiers has created an uneven playing field in the freight transport sector and wants to see a uniform set of EC regulations governing the industry in all member states. French forwarders are wary of differences in licensing regulations in developing EC states, which are deemed lax and which supposedly give firms from those countries a competitive edge. They also worry about competition from emerging eastern European forwarders and those from the Maghreb countries. French freight industry licensing criteria requires a company to have a manager with at least 10 year's experience and a diploma in general education, a clean record as far as fraud and tax irregularities are concerned and certain capital provisions. The regulations governing the licence to trade in Germany vary depending on what type of freight company is being set up, says Mr Reinhardt Lankes of the Bundesverband Spedition Lageri EV (BSL). Because of the strict licensing scheme in operation, the BSL - which has 5,000 members across the freight transport sector - does not have membership criteria or conditions other than the licence itself. Mr Lankes claims that the freight sector is well regulated and problems of overcharging are not common. What then is the advice to exporters when choosing a freight forwarder? Most exporters choose a freight forwarder because they either know one or have been recommended one. 'The important thing is that you trust your agent at the end of the day. I am prepared to pay for a good service. After all the agent takes care of all the documentation and certificates of origin,' says Mr Ballie of Ukexx. Bifa's Mr Beaumont believes that exporters must look around the market. They must understand what their own requirements are and should contact the association that could then help them through outlets such as exports clubs and one stop shops. 'We do feed all these networks to try to advise exporters what they need. People tend not to get advice until they have a problem,' says Mr Beaumont. Freight forwarders such as Mr Guinn of K&amp;N, on the other hand, urge exporters to try to find companies that give a personal service and those with a good local office. 'It is all about people. There are about 10 top freight forwarders in the EC and you, as an exporter, should find one you will be comfortable with.' Exporters want to cut costs and reduce the number of contractors in the supply chain. David Grant, marketing director of P&amp;O Containers Europe, whose clients include small, medium and large exporters, says the freight majors such as P&amp;O guarantee quality and service standards. He advises export firms to do their homework and to look at all the options, door-to-door type of price (inland costs, fixed rate costs, warehouse and distribution costs), efficiency and the level of service offered.</p>

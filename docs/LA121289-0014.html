			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> POLICE, BLACK LEADERS MEET OVER SHOOTING  </P> <P> Police officials in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., met with black leaders to discuss the  apparent accidental shooting of an unarmed black man by a white policeman  during a drug search. Black leaders later told reporters they were satisfied  with the way the case was being handled. Patrick Lavon Lee, 28, was shot in the  back of the head in a predominantly black neighborhood by police officer Robert  Thomas McCabe. Lee was in critical condition at Broward General Medical Center  and was not expected to recover, doctors said. The shooting was the second  involving a police officer and an unarmed suspect in South Florida since a  Miami jury last week convicted police officer William Lozano of manslaughter in  the deaths of two black men.  </P></p>

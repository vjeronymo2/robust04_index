			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The REIT Index will be reviewed approximately on a monthly basis by the CBOE staff. The CBOE may change the composition of the REIT Index at any time to reflect conditions in REIT markets. At present, all twenty-five REITs represented in the index invest a preponderance of their assets (in most cases, at least 75 percent) in real property. If a REIT that is included as a component stock becomes unrepresentative of REIT markets, the stock will be removed from the index. Whenever removal is necessary, every effort will be made to replace the removed stock with a stock that is suitably representative. In such circumstances, the CBOE will take into account the capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition of the proposed replacement stock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CBOE most likely will maintain twenty-five stocks in the index at all times. Absent prior approval by the Commission, the CBOE will not increase to more then thirty-three nor reduce to fewer than seventeen the number of stocks in the REIT Index, nor will it make any change in the composition of the index that would cause less than ninety percent of the REIT Index, by weight, to be composed of stocks that are eligible for listing as equity options under CBOE Rule 5.3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange proposes to base trading in options on the REIT Index on the full value of the index. The Exchange may list long-term index option series (``LEAPS''), as provided in CBOE Rule 24.9. The Exchange also may provide for the listing of reduced-value LEAPS, the underlying value of which will be calculated at one-tenth the REIT Index value. The current and closing index value of any such reduced-value LEAPS, after the initial computation, will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. Strike price intervals will be no less than $5.00 for every series of REIT Index options, except that reduced-value LEAPS will have stock price intervals that are no less than $2.50. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> REIT Index options will have European-style exercise and will be ``A.M.-settled index options'' within the meaning of the rules in Chapter XXIV, including CBOE Rule 24.9, which is being amended to refer specifically to REIT Index options. The proposed options will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month. Thus, the last day for trading in an expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding the expiration date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As modified in this proposed rule change, the Rules in Chapter XXIV will be applicable to REIT Index options. The REIT Index will be deemed to be ``narrow-based'' for purposes of the position limit requirements of CBOE Rule 24.4A. Ten reduced-value options will equal one full-value contract for position limit purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CBOE has the necessary systems capacity to support new series of options that would result from the introduction of REIT Index options. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general, and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to enable the listing and trading of REIT Index options subject to just and equitable principles of trade and is structured to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CBS CONSIDERS SPECIAL SERIES ON GULF CRISIS  </P> <P> CBS officials have discussed the possibility of a late-night series of specials  on the Persian Gulf crisis similar to those that led to ABC's "Nightline" 11  years ago, a CBS News spokesman said today.  </P> <P> "It's not definite at this point," spokesman Tom Goodman said.  </P> <P> Speculation about that began after anchorman Dan Rather's interview with Saddam  Hussein on Wednesday. Excerpts of the interview, conducted at midnight in  Baghdad, were incorporated into a late-night Wednesday special co-anchored by  Leslie Stahl and Charles Kuralt.  </P> <P> Rather's interview with Hussein, whose Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait sparked the  gulf crisis, was the first by a U.S. network anchorman since the crisis began.  </P> <P> Similar specials are "being considered, but we're taking it a day at a time at  this point," said Goodman, adding that one was being planned for Thursday  night, also co-anchored by Stahl and Kuralt.  </P> <P> While CBS executives have discussed the possibility of a regular late-night  news series and "anything's a possibility, I think it'd be premature to say  that it will happen," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Isosceles at Pounds 18m and flotation plans reaffirmed ISOSCELES, the leveraged buy-out vehicle for the Gateway food retail business, yesterday reaffirmed its plans for a flotation in 1995 when announcing results for the year to April 25. The group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 18m (Pounds 3.6m) but there was an attributable loss of Pounds 146.2m (Pounds 21.2m) after a Pounds 161m write-down of the value of businesses and assets the group is hoping to sell for Pounds 57.7m. This largely refers to the Herman's Sporting Goods chain in the US, the value of which was reduced by Pounds 144.8m. Isosceles published its annual report, which was given an unqualified auditors report. The previous two years' accounts had been qualified. The accounts showed that Pounds 1.9m was paid to former directors in compensation. Mr David Smith, who led the buy-out in 1989, and Ms Liz Hignell, who was finance director, left during the year. The group also wrote to shareholders detailing the refinancing agreement it signed with its bankers this week. Shareholders are to vote on the deal at a special meeting on October 8, but already holders of over 90 per cent of the shares have said they will support the resolution. Mr Ernest Sharp, chairman, said he expected to sell Wellworth, the Northern Irish food retail subsidiary, by the end of 1992 rather than floating it as it said it would in the spring. He said the group was also in talks with possible buyers for the Herman's chain, and this might be sold by the end of the current financial year. The group's results showed a fall in sales from Pounds 3.1bn to Pounds 3bn, but the fall was almost all due to the sale of some stores to Kwik Save. Operating profits also appeared to fall, from Pounds 189.3m to Pounds 187.4m. A drop in interest charges from Pounds 185.7m to Pounds 159.7m was largely due to the refinancing completed at Christmas 1990, when Pounds 222m of equity was added, Mr Bob Nellist, finance director, said. He said there was a negative swing on profits of about Pounds 30m. The sale of the stores to Kwik Save had taken out profits of Pounds 5.5m in the previous year and there were exceptional costs of Pounds 9.7m relating mainly to property write-downs and redundancies. The previous year had included Pounds 7m of foreign exchange gains which were not repeated and the group capitalised Pounds 7.4m less interest in the latest year. Mr Bob Willett, chief executive of the Gateway chain, said the group was progressing with the plan to reposition the business. 'We have the solutions, we just need some time.' See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roberto Reyes on interview with Honduran </F> President Carlos Roberto Reina by unidentified reporters at the  Government House in Tegucigalpa on 20 April -- recorded]    [Text] We have remarks by President Carlos Roberto Reina  referring to the Honduran Government's and Army's plan to modify  the 40-year-old treaty dealing with U.S. military aid for  Honduras. The president spoke about this initiative, which he  said is not official. Asked why the Armed Forces rather than  the executive branch took the initiative on this, he said the  source of the initiative does not matter. Here is President  Carlos Roberto Reina:    [Begin recording] [Reporter, in progress] ...the Honduran  Government's initiative to modify the Military Assistance Treaty  with the United States.    [Reina] Statements have been made. They are not official.  The issue is going to be discussed by Honduran Government  officials and also by the various government branches. These  agreements were implemented at a time when there was a different  situation in the world. It was the time of the Cold War and the  polarization of states and minds. It is a phase that has been  completely overcome. The new agenda is one of coming together in  favor of mankind. At the right time, in agreement with U.S.  Government representatives, we will sit down to review these  agreements and treaties, some of which are very old, dating back  40 years. In this way, we will be able to update the forms of  cooperation in all fields with the great democracy represented  by the United States of America and its excellent president, Mr.  Bill Clinton.    [Reporter] When would this take place? We spoke with the  U.S. ambassador just a few moments ago, and he said they are  ready to begin reviewing these agreements.    [Reina] If U.S. Government representatives, who are very  honorably represented by Mr. Pryce, are ready, at any time you  might hear news that we are sitting down to review the  agreements to which some protocols were added at times of great  tension in Central America and the world.    [Reporter] What would [words indistinct].    [Reina] The subject is military. These are military  agreements. Cooperation is now more directed toward human  development. That is one way of beginning to address the  problem of the military presence.    [Reporter] The question the people are most interested in is  the issue of the Palmerola military base. Will this base  continue to operate in Honduras or will the U.S. troops leave?    [Reina] We return to the same topic: the presence of that  base, which is legally Honduran. Its name is the Soto Cano  base. It is under the sponsorship of the Honduran Government.  It was established at a time of great tension for Honduras and  Central America. It is logical that we review and update the  structure of cooperation. At that time, it was believed  cooperation should be military, because tensions were so great.    We think that at present cooperation should involve other  areas, such as environment, health, education, human rights, and  drug trafficking. For example, we must not allow this scourge  known as drug trafficking to continue to hurt Honduras. In this  regard, I will say this to the ambassador and to you: We are  your ally in waging a frontal assault against scourges that  cause so much damage to humanity.    [Reporter] Mr. President, this has been interpreted as an  initiative of the military institution and not of the executive  branch, as it should be.    [Reina] A military issue is involved. They are also part of  Honduras. They are an institution, constitutionally speaking.  They took an initiative. Now is the time to resume discussions  without innuendoes and without pulling out cards from under the  table.    [Reporter] [question indistinct]    [Reina] They proposed a review. The ambassador said he  agrees, and I also fully agree. The Congress must review this.  I wonder if you recall -- if you have a good memory -- that  there was much discussion when the protocols came up. In my  opinion, those protocols should have been brought before the  National Congress, because constitutionally speaking, military  issues should be (?discussed) at the National Congress.    [Reporter] When will such a discussion take place?    [Reina] They will take place in more calm times, in times of  less confrontation and very sincere cooperation.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] U.S. ambassador that there is  a possibility that, once the Southern Command closes down, some  soldiers from that base might be transferred to the Palmerola  Base?    [Reina] I think you are moving ahead of the negotiations and  discussions. This is theoretical. This issue should be  discussed and its approval should be in keeping with the  interests of our power [nuestro poder].    [Reporter]) I would like to change the topic, Mr. President.  How does the people's constant criticisms, justified or not,  about the energy crisis facing the country harm or suffocate  your government?    [Reina] It is unfair to criticize the government for this  crisis. The government, which is only three months old, did not  create this crisis. We are trying to resolve it quickly. This  crisis is the result of mistakes made by serveral past  administrations. We will not take revenge by claiming only the  previous government made mistakes. Any lack of foresight and  problems linked to the Francisco Morazan Dam must be resolved by  this government. It is completely unfair to criticize the  government for trying to resolve these problems.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] declare an emergency over this  energy crisis, because the [words indistinct].    [Reina] I am not trying to lay blame. I am trying to say  that it is unfair to criticize us, because we are trying to find  a solution. I spoke to the minister of [word indistinct] today.  The chief of the ENEE [National Enterprise for Electric Power]  is abroad looking for aid from friendly countries. Everyone  must help resolve this crisis.    Using this as a political tool against the government is  totally unfair and absurd. We are the ones who will resolve  this problem. We did not decree an emergency. There is an  emergency because blackouts are seriously damaging the country's  economy. We want to resolve this problem as soon as possible.  This morning, I made some decisions to ensure [words  indistinct] before 10 May.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] privileged areas.    [Reina] I have fought for justice all my life. I am not  going to shy away from the problems of the Honduran people. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Briton is latest victim of Algerian extremist killings Gunmen have shot dead a Briton at a petrol station in western Algeria, the fourth foreigner killed since a militant Islamic group's deadline ordering all foreigners to leave expired last week, Reuter reports from Algiers. Mr Malcolm Vincent, 41, a oil industry computer technician, was filling his tank when two men tried to steal his car, shooting him when he resisted, the official news agency APS said. Mr Vincent, who worked for Pullman Kellogg, a contractor to the state oil group Sonatrach, was killed hours after a 67-year-old Frenchman was found shot dead near the town of Blida. Eleven foreigners have been killed in Algeria since September 21, including three French citizens, three Russians, a Colombian, a Peruvian and the Briton. Four have died since the expiry of the November 30 deadline from the fundamentalist Armed Islamic Group. No one has owned up to the last four killings; an Algerian official said he believed the attacks were the work of independent groups. In the past three months, foreigners have become caught up in the political violence in which at least 1,700 Algerians have been killed in nearly two years. The violence began after the authorities cancelled an election that the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front party was on the verge of winning. The party was later banned. A wave of foreigners including more than 2,500 French left after three French consular workers were kidnapped in October. Paris and Algiers said the kidnapping was the work of the Armed Islamic Group, which released the three with the warning to foreigners to get out. The Paris foreign ministry warned French residents 'to exercise extreme vigilance'. A ministry official said France would bolster security around French public buildings in Algeria.</p>

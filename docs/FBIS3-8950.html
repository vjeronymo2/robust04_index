When asked whether he had a clear concept of the make-up of  a  new cabinet, Moravcik answered by saying that negotiations  between individual parliamentary opposition parties were  continuing. "Maybe on Tuesday [a5 March], maybe on Wednesday we  shall know the definitive results of these talks and will be  able to specify about the composition of the government," he  said.    Moravcik was put forward as new Slovak premier by the former  opposition parties earlier this evening.    He added he would like to present President Michal Kovac  with  a list of cabinet members to appoint on Wednesday so that  parliament, which resumes its session on that day, could approve  the choices. "A quick approach like that would be desirable," he  said in view of the decision of the Meciar government to cease  its functions as of Friday.    Moravcik said he would submit details of his programme to  parliament at the subsequent session. He asserted that the new  government would concentrate particularly on the economic field.    As regards the post of foreign minister, which Moravcik  himself once held, he said he would prefer to see an experienced  diplomat in the post. He had a definite candidate in mind, but  denied it was Jan Lisuch, saying, "he already has been charged  with a position abroad."    Moravcik, who recently quit the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS) after a fruitless attempt to alter the populist  course fixed by party chairman and ex-premier Vladimir Meciar,  confirmed talks were still continuing between all the  "dissident" groups of the parties that formerly made up  Slovakia's governing coalition -- the HZDS and the Slovak  National Party (SNS) -- on the creation of some joint formation.  "It will be a new political grouping, comprising three or four  groups," he said.    The party should be established this month and should  include, besides the former Alternative of Political Realism  within the HZDS (led by Moravcik and former Vice-Premier Roman  Kovac), also a group headed by former SNS Chairman Ludovit  Cernak and the Alliance of Democrats, led by another one-time  Slovak foreign minister, Milan Knazko.    Chairman of what was the strongest opposition party, the  Democratic Left Party (SDL), Peter Weiss, stressed that the  government to be formed would be "composed for a temporary  period" until early general elections are held, in his view in  September or October. If parliament does not alter the law  shortening the electoral term, a referendum will decide on early  elections, he said. "All political parties have told President  Kovac it will be a six-month government," he said.    Weiss commented on the nomination of Moravcik as new premier  by saying the proposal received widespread support, also from  the SDL.</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley boost for Maxwell MPs MPs CAMPAIGNING on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners have been encouraged by the prospect of early publication of the report into the affair by the Securities and Investments Board (SIB). Mr Richard Page and Mr Frank Field, on behalf of the all-party group of MPs supporting the pensioners, had a 'constructive and cordial' meeting yesterday with Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. They believe that pressure from Westminster has caused the government to take a more active approach to the affair. The two MPs were pleased that Mr Lilley undertook 'willingly' to pass on to the Bank of England the concern expressed that the banks were not making enough effort to identify assets, and their view that the recent comments of Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor, had been unhelpful. Mr Page said afterwards that they had had the impression that the government expected to receive the SIB report within the next two to three weeks. They expect it to be published, enabling decisions to be taken before deadline at the end of next month when the next tranche of trusts have said they would be unable to pay pensions. The MPs told Mr Lilley that the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro), felt it had not been given proper authority because of the difficulties of marrying trust law with the financial services regime. The meeting coincided with a claim by the Maxwell pensioners' group that 6,000 Maxwell pensioners stand to lose three quarters of their monthly payments by September unless the government acts. Mr Kenneth Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group, said the government had an obligation to help pensioners because of maladministration by government departments in their oversight of Mr Robert Maxwell's activities. By June, 5,000 Maxwell company pensioners will lose half their monthly pension payments and 240 members of one Leeds-based scheme are now getting no payments whatsoever.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Leasehold law reforms may be broadened THE GOVERNMENT is urgently considering whether to broaden slightly its proposed leasehold reforms giving private-sector tenants the right to buy the properties in which they live. The change would extend the reforms to leaseholders in some properties where, for example, there are flats above a shop. At present, because the reforms do not apply to tenants of properties where more than 10 per cent of the floor space is used for non-residential purposes, there would have to be nine floors of flats above a shop before tenants of that building could benefit. The move follows pressure from Mr Dudley Fishburn, the Tory MP for Kensington, who is on the cross-party committee of MPs considering the housing and urban regeneration bill debated by the Commons as a whole at the start of this month. Mr Fishburn has put forward an amendment to the bill which would include within the reforms properties where up to 20 per cent of the floor space is not residential. The committee will have an opportunity to decide on the move tomorrow, but there are signs that Sir George Young, the housing minister, is ready to look again at the 10 per cent cut-off point. Ministers hope that the signal from Sir George will be enough to persuade Mr Fishburn not to press the matter to a vote tomorrow - if he did the government could face defeat. This sort of 'pro-tenant' proposal attracts opposition support and so poses much more of a danger to the government than the louder clamour from within the Tory party on behalf of landlords. Mr John Battle, an opposition housing spokesman, has made clear that Labour would prefer the leasehold plans to extend to properties where up to half the floor space was non-residential, but the party would be ready to support Mr Fishburn's more modest proposal to persuade the government to think again about the limit.</p>

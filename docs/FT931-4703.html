			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Vauxhall defends price structure PRICES of new cars in the UK are now lower than in several other European countries, according to a report published yesterday by Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, says, Kevin Done writes. Vauxhall has published the study, prepared by management consultants AT Kearney, in an effort to avoid action by the government to force carmakers to change some of the controversial terms of their franchise agreements with dealers. The motor industry's selective distribution system, which allows carmakers to sell vehicles through exclusive networks, has been blamed by consumer groups for making UK car prices higher than in many other parts of Europe. The investigation of car makers' pricing policies across Europe is set to intensify in the next two years, as the present 10-year 'block exemption', which allows car makers to use a selective dealer distribution system in contravention of European Community competition rules, is due to expire in mid-1995.</p>

The  regional executive of the Wuppertal branch of IG Metall  (Engineering and Metalworkers' Union) said the strikes are  focused on the towns of Aachen, Gevelsberg, Gummersbach,  Hattingen, Leverkusen, Luedenscheid, Olpe, Remscheid, and  Wuppertal.    The largest rally was in Wuppertal, where 6,400 engineering  workers marched through the streets to protest employers'  demands for a workers' pay cut. The fourth round of  negotiations ended last week without agreement on a date for  their resumption.</p>

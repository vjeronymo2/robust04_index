			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Currie tries to lure Mercedes MRS EDWINA CURRIE, the former minister, has written to Mercedes urging the German carmaker to locate its new European plant in the East Midlands. The MP for South Derbyshire told Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes chairman, that the region's infrastructure and workforce made it an 'excellent' location. Local development officials have proposed several sites for a potential plant in the county, which is already home to Toyota's European production line.</p>

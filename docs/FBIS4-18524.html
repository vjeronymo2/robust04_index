			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mats Knutson: "Industry in Harsh Attack Against </F> SDP"]    [Text] The Industry Association is attacking the Social  Democratic Party's [SDP] economic program. In so doing, the  organization is violating its principle of lying low in election  movements.    In a so far unknown letter to Social Democratic Party leader  Ingvar Carlsson, the chairman of the association Bo Rydin writes  that the Social Democrats' policy jeopardizes economic recovery  in Sweden and risks leading to higher interest rates, reduced  investment, and undermined confidence in the budget policy.    "Rydin's violent attack shows that the Industry Association  apparently is turning more and more into a propaganda organ. I  see a connection between the campaign by the Taxpayers'  Association and the attack by the Industry Association," replies  Ingvar Carlsson through his press secretary Gisela Lindstrand.    Bo Rydin is one of the absolute top people in Swedish  business and industry. Among other things, he is chairman of the  board of SCA [Swedish Cellulose Company] and Industrivarden. In  the letter to Ingvar Carlsson he criticizes point by point the  proposals that the Social Democrats presented in their shadow  budget earlier this year.  <H5>  Good Relations </H5>   With that Bo Rydin and the Industry Association are heading  into the beginning election campaign.    "We are worried about the Social Democratic proposals. This  has nothing to do with party policy but about wanting to protect  Swedish industry," says Bo Rydin.    In the letter to Ingvar Carlsson, he voices harsh criticism  of the Social Democratic proposals for raised income taxes,  raised taxation of capital, retaining personal property taxes,  and reintroducing double taxation for business profits.    He also strongly questions whether the Social Democrats'  proposal to introduce direct write-offs for machinery  investments will have any major effects.    "Normally, we lie low when it is an election year, since we  are careful to maintain good relations with both the government  and opposition," says Bo Rydin.    "But this year we will abandon our principle of being quiet,  although this could be perceived as going against the Social  Democrats. We believe that these are such important issues that  we must act."  <H5>  Has Not Received an Answer </H5>   The letter to Ingvar Carlsson is dated 24 February this  year.  Bo Rydin has not yet received an answer. Magnus Lemmel, the  managing director of the Industry Association, recently launched  an attack on the Social Democrats in a "Focal Point" article,  and the fact that Bo Rydin's letter has now been made public is  extremely irritating to Ingvar Carlsson.    "The Social Democrats were praised by the Industry  Association when we pushed through the tax reform. Now that we  are sticking with the reform, it is apparently not worth  anything," he says.    "I am prepared to take up a factual discussion with the  Industry Association both publicly and as an answer to Rydin."  <H5>  Greater Uncertainty </H5>   In his letter to Ingvar Carlsson, Bo Rydin writes that the  Social Democratic proposals would shortsightedly lead to a  further budget weakening "conservatively calculated at 10-15  billion kronor." This means greater uncertainty regarding  Sweden's capability of improving state finances and risks  leading to "renewed financial concern," in Rydin's opinion. He  writes: "The interest rate increases that could be the result  further exacerbate the government's financial situation and risk  throttling the recovery that has now begun."  <H5>  Undermines Confidence </H5>   Bo Rydin argues that "in a situation where an upturn in the  Swedish economy has been initiated, the additional incentives  that are proposed are highly dubious from a purely economic  aspect as well as from the aspect of confidence. A further  underbalancing of the budget also undermines confidence in the  long-range budget policy."    The anticipated growth effects in the Social Democratic  shadow budget are also too optimistic, says Bo Rydin. "A  10-billion-kronor larger budget deficit is expected to raise  domestic demand by not quite 40 billion kronor for the 1994/95  fiscal year, that is to say a multiplier of four, which is not  realistic," he writes.    The calculated increase in employment by 90,000 people in  the  Social Democratic proposal is primarily accounted for by  postponed layoffs in the municipal sector and incentives for  construction, Rydin says.    "In no case is it a matter of long-range, stable jobs, but  it  merely involves postponing a necessary adjustment," he writes.</p>

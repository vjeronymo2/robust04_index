			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Forte cuts dividend, sees no green shoots FORTE, the hotel and restaurants group, yesterday cut its dividend for the first time in two decades, warned that there were few signs of a business upturn and said it would be reducing US operations. Forte reported pre-tax profits for the 12 months to January 31 of Pounds 164m after exceptional items, using the FRS 3 standard. This compared with a restated Pounds 59m for 1991-92. Pre-tax profits before its share in Savoy Hotel, exceptional items and property revaluations were Pounds 72m, compared with Pounds 70m last time. Earnings per share were 14.1p (4.3p). The final dividend of 4.75p produced a total of 7.5p (9.91p). Mr Rocco Forte, chairman, said: 'We feel it prudent to set the dividend at a level which would be sustainable even if there is no upturn in trading conditions and which will provide a basis for future growth.' The group is offering shareholders the alternative of an enhanced scrip dividend with a value 50 per cent higher than the cash payout. Mr Forte said trading conditions deteriorated last year and that the situation had not improved. 'The green shoots that seem to be appearing are not appearing in our business yet,' he said. He said, however, that the group's cost reduction programme should produce improved profits even without a rapid recovery in demand. Over the past two years, total staff numbers have been reduced by 7,000 to 38,500. Forte says it is putting 15 of its US Travelodge hotels up for sale, allowing it to concentrate on the remaining motel operations, which might be floated off in 18 months' time. Mr Forte said plans to expand on the Continent would be postponed, since better deals would be available in a year's time. There were exceptional charges of Pounds 73m for reorganisation, rebranding and software. The intended disposal of the Travelodge hotels and other property losses produced an exceptional charge of Pounds 91m. The sale of the Gardner Merchant contract catering business produced an exceptional gain of Pounds 257m. A revaluation of the entire property portfolio produced a reduction in the revaluation surplus of Pounds 344m. As a result, gearing rose to 48.4 per cent. Lex, Page 18; Queens Moat, Page 21</p>

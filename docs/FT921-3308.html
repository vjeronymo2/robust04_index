			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Car tax oversight rectified THE government yesterday rectified a Budget oversight which could have proved very costly to car and motorcycle dealers. Under the proposed Special Car Tax rules dealers had been faced with the prospect of having to charge customers the new 5 per cent rate to cars and motorcycles in stock, even though they had already paid the old 10 per cent rate. The Retail Motor Industry Federation, the dealers' trade organisation, said that up to 20,000 cars at various stages in the supply pipeline could have been caught in the trap at a cost of several million pounds had ministers not intervened. Winding up the second reading debate on the Finance Bill to enact the Budget measures, Mr Francis Maude, the financial secretary to the Treasury, told the Commons that dealers would be allowed to claim refunds on all such vehicles. Customs and Excise has introduced an extra-statutory class concession to enable refunds of the tax differential to be made in respect of tax-paid stock which was held by dealers but unsold on March 10. The announcement came as Vauxhall, Ford's arch rival, responded to deep price cuts in some of Ford's cheaper car models in the immediate aftermath of the Budget. Vauxhall has declined to cut prices but said that it was adding value worth up to Pounds 850 to some of its models. Mr Bill Ebbert, Vauxhall chairman, insisted that Vauxhall's cheapest Nova small hatchback was still Pounds 600 cheaper than the equivalent Ford Fiesta in spite of the price cuts. Letters, Page 11</p>

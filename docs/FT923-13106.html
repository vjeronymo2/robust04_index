			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / World Trade News: US foments beer war over access to Canada THE beer war between the US and Canada was intensified yesterday when Washington demanded authorisation from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to retaliate against Canada for discriminating against imports of US beer. The US said it was seeking to recoup damage to US brewers of about Dollars 80m (Pounds 41.8m) a year. A US complaint against discriminatory practices by state liquor boards in Canada was upheld by a Gatt disputes panel last September. In April, following earlier US threats of retaliation, the two sides said they had reached agreement on giving US brewers easier access to the Canadian market. At the meeting of Gatt's governing council yesterday, Washington accused Canada of deliberately trying to circumvent the panel's findings. The US is particularly angry about two practices by the province of Ontario  -a beer pricing system by the monopoly state liquor board, which includes a handling charge for imported beer, and a tax rise on non-refillable containers for alcoholic drinks. Washington claims this discriminates directly against US beer, which is imported mainly in cans, while most Canadian beer is sold in refillable bottles. Earlier, the Gatt council approved a six-month extension, till end-June 1993, of Mr Arthur Dunkel's term of office as director-general.</p>

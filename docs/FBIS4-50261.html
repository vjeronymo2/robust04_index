			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 16 (AFP)--China is a foreign policy  priority for Moscow, although domestic differences exist on the  approach to certain China-related issues, a senior Russian  parliamentarian said here Monday.    Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian parliament's lower  house  emphasised the importance Moscow attaches to Sino-Russian ties,  but added that some deputies had opposing views on the questions  of border visas and applying the Chinese economic model in  Russia.    Many Russian deputies are believed to be in favour of visa  restrictions to stem the flood of people crossing the  Sino-Russian border daily. Some 2.5 million people crossed the  border last year and Moscow has expressed concern over the  number of Chinese in Russia.    While Rybkin praised China's economic success, he stressed  that Russia could not always follow the same path, especially as  it did not have the support of a similarly wealthy overseas  community. Rybkin, who is heading an 11-member parliamentary  delegation, met Monday with President Jiang Zemin and Vice  Premier Li Lanqing, with whom he discussed the planned visit to  China later this month of Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin.    After the Sino-Soviet rift that developed at the beginning  of  the 1960s, the two communist giants officially reconciled in  1989 during a visit to China by Mikhail Gorbachev.    Since Boris Yeltsin became president of Russia in 1991  following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow and Beijing  have enjoyed close military cooperation.    Rybkin also voiced hopes that Russia would be able to  participate in several large-scale construction projects in  China, including the massive Three Gorges hydro-electric dam  being built on the Yangtze River.</p>

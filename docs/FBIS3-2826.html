			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- China will put more  funds into educational undertakings to realize nine-year  compulsory education by the turn of the century, Zhu Kaixuan,  minister in charge of the State Education Commission, said here  today.    Speaking at a press conference held by the current session  of  the National People's Congress, Zhu said that the government has  basically solved the problem of wage payment delays for teachers  in most areas of the country.    But some localities are still owing teachers bonuses and  subsidies, he said.    Zhu said that the government's budgeted spending on  education  undertakings will reach 81.5 billion yuan this year, including  investment in infrastructures.    Zhu said that though the government education budget is much  higher than that for 1993, it is still "a far cry from the  actual need."    He said that the government needs the money to support the  nine-year compulsory education system, which is aimed at  enabling 85 percent of school-age children to complete nine-year  education by the end of the century.    After quoting the part of Premier Li Peng's report to the  National People's Congress (NPC), or Chinese parliament, that  urges local governments to slash expenditures on other aspects  and take every means to increase fund input in education  undertakings, Zhu said that more channels of fund raising should  be opened.    "The government has decreed that localities which owe  teachers their salaries are not allowed to buy expensive cars  and build nonproductive buildings," he said.    "Government-allocated fund accounts for two-thirds of  expenditures on education, but it should not be the only source  of funding," he said.    He said that, besides government allocation, China's  education system also relies on school-run enterprises, tuition,  donations and foundations to support its 200 million students  and 10 million teachers. The sources provide over 16.1 billion  yuan for the education system in 1992.    Asked whether an increase in tuitions will affect college  enrollment, he said that China will keep fees for college  students at an acceptable level.    Universities are now charging every student 1,000 to 1,500  yuan as tuition and miscellaneous fees annually. The charges  will go up in coming years. The government is offering  scholarships, living stipends, student loans and tuition waivers  for students.    "Under the socialist education system, we shall not let a  single student drop out of school because of economic reasons,"  he said.    As for Chinese students studying abroad, he said that the  government has adopted a policy of permitting people study  abroad, allowing them to come and go freely and encouraging  Chinese living abroad to serve the motherland in various ways.    "We can understand that some people want to stay in foreign  countries for a time or apply for the status of permanent  residents in these countries," he said.    He said that Chinese students studying abroad have always  maintained close contacts with the motherland. "They can make  contributions to their motherland's modernization drive from  abroad," he said.    China has sent 210,000 students abroad for study in the past  15 years. One-third of them, or 70,000, have returned to the  country.</p>

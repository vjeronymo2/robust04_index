			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Caterpillar accused of EC law breaches CATERPILLAR, the world's largest construction equipment group, faces European Community fines for alleged 'serious infringements' of EC competition laws by restricting parallel trading in machinery and parts. The European Commission's DG IV competition directorate claims Caterpillar has used discriminatory pricing and other means to discourage parallel trading, in which independent resellers buy machinery or parts in a low-price zone and sell in a high-price area. Caterpillar is contesting the allegations. The EC document says Brussels 'intends to require Caterpillar to put an end to these infringements'. However, no final decision has been taken, and a DG IV official said the case was still under review. The case arose from a series of complaints made to the Commission over the past few years by independent resellers, including Seymour Equipment Services of the UK, and Johannes Rosendahl of Germany. According to the EC document, the complaints were 'addressed against alleged export bans, and against refusals to supply machines and parts and measures taken to ensure that Caterpillar's dealers in their turn refuse such supply'. It says the agreements notified by Caterpillar to the EC and the general policy of the Illinois-based company and its distributors 'lead to a complete orchestration of international trade in Caterpillar's construction machinery and parts'. Parallel traders cannot obtain these goods for third states, it claims. 'If they succeed in obtaining and exporting the goods, they are blacklisted and are excluded from all trade, including trade between member states.' Caterpillar cannot be fined for any agreements it has notified to the EC, but the DG IV document says the company's 1990 guidebook, Export Parts Policy, was never notified. The prohibition on sales to end-users exporting for use outside the EC and other procedures contained in the guidebook 'go beyond the scope of the earlier notified agreements and associated letters,' says the EC. Caterpillar said yesterday it was preparing its response to the Commission's objections. 'But, based on the opinion of our legal counsel, Caterpillar believes it has strong defences to each allegation set forth in the statement of objections. In our opinion, Caterpillar's distribution practices comply with Community law.' Mr Timothy Trott, general manager of Seymour Group, said he was very pleased by the EC's stance. If confirmed, the Commission's decision would make it much easier to exploit price differences in different markets, within and outside the EC. For example, he said, there was a huge differential in Greece. 'We could buy machinery and parts in the UK, ship them to Greece and still undercut the local dealer. At the moment, we're completely barred.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Limitations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amount of business credit carryforwards and minimum tax credit allowed against the section 1374 tax are subject to the limitations described in section 38(c) and section 53(c), respectively, as modified by this paragraph. The tentative tax determined under paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;1.1374&hyph;1 is treated as the regular tax liability described in sections 38(c)(1) and 53(c)(1), and as the net income tax and net regular tax liability described in section 38(c)(1). The tentative minimum tax described in section 55(b) is determined using the rate of tax applicable to corporations and without regard to any alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit described in that section and by treating the net recognized built-in gain determined under &sect;1.1374&hyph;2, modified to take into account the adjustments of sections 56 and 58 applicable to corporations and the preferences of section 57, as the alternative minimum taxable income described in section 55(b)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. Business credit carryforward.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, X has a $500,000 business credit carryforward from a C year and Asset  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1 with a fair market value of $400,000, a basis for regular tax purposes of $95,000, and a basis for alternative minimum tax purposes of $150,000. In 1996, X has net recognized built-in gain of $305,000 from selling Asset  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1 for $400,000. Thus, X's tentative tax under paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;1.1374&hyph;1 and regular tax liability under paragraph (b) of this section is $106,750 ($400,000^$95,000=$305,000 &times; .35= $106,750, assuming a 35 percent tax rate). Also, X's tentative minimum tax determined under paragraph (b) of this section is $47,000 [$400,000^$150,000=$250,000^$15,000 ($40,000 corporate exemption amount ^$25,000 phase-out=$15,000)=$235,000 &times; .20=$47,000, assuming a 20 percent tax rate]. Thus, the business credit limitation under section 38(c) is $59,750 [$106,750^$47,000 (the greater of $47,000 or $20,438 (.25 x $81,750 ($106,750^$25,000=$81,750))) = $59,750]. As a result, X's section 1374 tax is $47,000 ($106,750^$59,750= $47,000) for 1996 and X has $440,250 ($500,000^$59,750 = $440,250) of business credit carryforwards for succeeding taxable years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. Minimum tax credit.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, Asset <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1 has a fair market value of $5,000,000, a basis for regular tax purposes of $4,000,000, and a basis for alternative minimum tax purposes of $4,750,000. Y also has a minimum tax credit of $310,000 from 1995. Y has no other assets, no net operating or capital loss carryforwards, and no business credit carryforwards. In 1996, Y's only transaction is the sale of Asset #1 for $5,000,000. Therefore, Y has net recognized built-in gain in 1996 of $1,000,000 ($5,000,000^$4,000,000=$1,000,000) and a tentative tax under paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;1.1374&hyph;1 of $350,000 ($1,000,000&times;.35=$350,000, assuming a 35 percent tax rate). Also, Y's tentative minimum tax determined under paragraph (b) of this section is $47,000 [$5,000,000^$4,750,000=$250,000^$15,000 ($40,000 corporate exemption amount ^$25,000 phase-out = $15,000) = $235,000&times;.20 = $47,000, assuming a 20 percent tax rate]. Thus, Y may use its minimum tax credit in the amount of $303,000 ($350,000^$47,000=$303,000) to offset its section 1374 tentative tax. As a result, Y's section 1374 tax is $47,000 ($350,000^$303,000=$47,000) in 1996 and Y has a minimum tax credit attributable to years for which Y was a C corporation of $7,000 ($310,000^$303,000=$7,000).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.1374&hyph;7  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Inventory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Valuation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fair market value of the inventory of an S corporation on the first day of the recognition period equals the amount that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for the inventory in a purchase of all the S corporation's assets by a buyer that expects to continue to operate the S corporation's business. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the buyer and seller are presumed not to be under any compulsion to buy or sell and to have reasonable knowledge of all relevant facts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

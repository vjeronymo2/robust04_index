			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCHUSTER TAKES A BREAK, THEN TAKES OFF  </P> <P> Laurie Schuster is on the road again.  </P> <P> But judging from her cross-country success this season, it's hard to believe  that the Occidental College junior is on the comeback trail.  </P> <P> Schuster never won a league title when she was running cross-country for Irvine  High School, nor did she win a race in two previous seasons at Occidental.  </P> <P> This year, however, Schuster was unbeaten in the Southern California  Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.  </P> <P> The difference?  </P> <P> After competing, without a break, in cross-country and track since her freshman  year in high school, Schuster nixed her Nikes last winter, sat out the track  season and turned her thoughts elsewhere.  </P> <P> She returned this fall revitalized and ran away with the SCIAC title. She never  lost in a dual meet and beat her nearest competitor at the conference  championships by 40 seconds.  </P> <P> "Every race I'm feeling stronger and stronger," Schuster said. "Last year, I  was getting burned out -- I needed that break to remember why I was running.  </P> <P> "I had been doing it for so long, I kind of forgot that I actually enjoyed it."  </P> <P> Last Saturday, Schuster endured 90-degree temperatures to place third at the  NCAA Division III West regionals at UC Santa Cruz, covering the 5,000-meter  course in 19 minutes 4 seconds. Schuster's finish qualified her for the  national championships on Saturday in Rock Island, Ill.  </P> <P> Bill Harvey, who is in his 11th season coaching cross-country at Occidental,  said Schuster always had the physical ability to run the way she has this  season. He said getting off the track helped Schuster clear a mental hurdle and  gain confidence in herself.  </P> <P> "She knows why she's out here and what she wants out of it," Harvey said. "When  you start at a young age, sometimes it just becomes a habitual activity rather  than something that you're really enjoying the way that you should.  </P> <P> "The time off helped her realize that."  </P> <P> Schuster, 20, started running in the seventh grade with her father, John, who  jogged to stay in shape. In high school, she earned all-South Coast League  recognition while competing all four years for the Irvine varsity.  </P> <P> Individual titles, however, eluded her.  </P> <P> "It just seemed like there was always someone else there that was unbeatable,"  Schuster said.  </P> <P> It was much the same case when Schuster arrived at Occidental.  </P> <P> Michelle Trimble, a three-time All-American who graduated last year, never lost  a SCIAC race in four years with the Tigers.  </P> <P> During her freshman season, Schuster ran in the shadows of Trimble and other  more experienced teammates and finished fifth at the conference championship  meet. As it turned out, that also was where Schuster peaked. Two weeks later --  on a hilly Crystal Springs course in San Mateo -- she finished 13th at the  regional championships.  </P> <P> That meet marked the beginning of a long, frustrating year for Schuster.  </P> <P> She had cramping problems throughout her sophomore season, placed seventh at  the regionals, then finished 97th in the Division III national meet in St.  Louis.  </P> <P> "I tried to force it out of myself," Schuster said of her effort, "and I just  bombed."  </P> <P> With Harvey's approval, Schuster bypassed the track season and took two terms  of karate, "getting myself completely out of shape for running."  </P> <P> Midway through last summer, Schuster saw an off-road truck race on television  at her parents' house in Danville, Calif. She watched the vehicles fly off the  bumpy terrain and decided it was time to get back on the road herself.  </P> <P> "The thought of being in a race again was all of a sudden so appealing,"  Schuster said. "My heart started beating faster and I'm like, 'Oh, I've got to  go out there and run.'  </P> <P> "Working myself back into shape was the neatest feeling. It made me go, 'This  is why I run.' "  </P> <P> Harvey hopes Schuster will maintain her new joy for running through the  upcoming track season and her final cross-country season next year.  </P> <P> "She's just now starting to blossom," Harvey said. "I think she's going to be  much better in another year because when you work in this atmosphere -- in this  frame of mind -- for a year or so, then good things really begin to happen."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEWS;  </P> <P> BIG BIRD, BARKLEY THE DOG VISIT JAPAN AND GET LOST  </P> <P> Big Bird and his friend, Barkley the Dog, are separated from their tour bus in  Tokyo -- and they don't speak Japanese. How will they get back to Sesame Street  ?  </P> <P> "Big Bird in Japan" (tonight, Channels 28 and 15 at 8 p.m.) answers this  question in a way that introduces children to Japanese culture without being  didactic about it. It also indulges in a bit of delicate, fairy-tale-style  fantasy that should engage children's imaginations without too much strain.  </P> <P> A co-production of the Children's Television Workshop and the Japanese network  Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK), this "Big Bird" was shot on several beautiful  Japanese locations by director-writer Jon Stone. It features Maiko Kawakami as  a mysterious woman who comes to the aid of the stranded Big Bird and Barkley.  </P> <P> The only problem is Kawakami's barely passable singing voice. Her solos might  make a few youngsters restless. But the simple musical score -- by Dick Lieb,  Tony Geiss and Carol Hall -- generally enhances the storytelling.  </P> <P> The picture of Japan here is strictly tourist board-approved, so much so that  children might confront their parents with a sudden demand for foreign travel.  </P> <P> So take them to Little Tokyo.

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Princeton/Newport Partners: Five indicted former officials of the  Princeton/Newport Limited Partners investment firm received encouraging news  when a federal judge dismissed three mail and wire fraud counts in a criminal  indictment pending against them in New York. The counts related to charges that  the Princeton/Newport officials had illegally agreed to hide the ownership of  blocks of Mattel stock. The judge threw out the counts, saying the government  hadn't shown that the Mattel transactions had caused anyone to lose money or  property. Dismissal of the counts leaves 65 counts pending. But a defense  lawyer claimed that the dismissal also wipes out a big portion of the pending  racketeering charge against the group.  </P></p>

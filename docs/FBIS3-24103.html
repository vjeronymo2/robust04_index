			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Lyubov Dobrota, Anatoliy Akava, Sergey </F> Nesterenko, and Vladimir Li, KAZTAG and KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA  correspondents: "Parliamentary Elections Are Over. Now We Have  To Sort Out Who Got Elected"]    [Text]  <H5>  ALMATY </H5>   The three-month-long election marathon in Kazakhstan, which  was to determine the composition of the first professional  parliament and new local representative bodies--maslikhats--has  reached the finish line. On 7 March, At exactly 0700, the doors  of more than 10,000 republic election precincts opened, almost  7,000 of them in rural settlements and at animal breeders'  winter camps. Kazakhstan citizens abroad also voted--at 14  precincts in our representations.    Almaty election precincts were crowded from the very early  morning. This confirmed once again the validity of sociological  services' forecasts: Population polls conducted on the eve of  the elections showed that at least 70 percent of the voters  intended to participate. Most of them, in answering  correspondents' questions before dropping the ballot in the box,  did not hide that they would choose progressively-minded  candidates for deputies.    Nursultan Nazarbayev and his spouse came to cast their votes  at the election precinct set up in Friendship House. The head of  the government held an impromptu press conference for local and  foreign journalists on the spot. The questions asked were mainly  one and the same, just different phraseology: What hopes does  the president pin on the new parliament?    I hope very much, he said, that a professional parliament  will work more actively than the old one, and will contribute  more to the democratization of our young sovereign state, the  advancement of economic reforms, and the reorganization of the  legal system. In order to successfully carry out this role, it  will have to adopt laws that will realistically advance  transformations in the republic and at the same time will  attract Western investors into its economy.    Journalists got no reply to the question, however, which of  the candidates for Supreme Council deputy seats did the  Nazarbayevs vote for. All I can tell you, joked the president,  is that my wife and I had no disagreement in this respect.    Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko also cast his vote in the  same precinct. In an interview by journalists he emphasized that  in any civilized country the government and the parliament are  in certain opposition to each other, and this is quite logical.  But at the same time, it is very important for the Supreme  Council to adopt laws and decrees that the government could  realistically carry out and that would be backed by financial  and material resources. Deputies should not make strictly  populist decisions.    One of the precincts was located in Kazakh Secondary School  No. 12 in the center of the capital. The stream of voters here  was such that lines quite often formed to the enclosed ballot  booths. There are quite a few young people, and this clearly  refutes certain maxims on this subject: Our youth, they say, is  apolitical.    Vice President Erik Asanbayev came to cast his vote here.  Answering correspondents' questions, he said that he believes in  the vitality of the republic's future first professional  parliament. The Supreme Council is elected on a multiparty basis  and reflects the attitudes and interests of a most diverse  social strata. This is what provides hope that the new  parliament will meet the expectations of the republic's  multinational population and will become a real and effective  representative power.    Its professional level, in the vice president's opinion,  will  be determined not just by the degree of deputies' personal  abilities--the old Supreme Soviet also had quite a few competent  specialists and scientists. The important part is that now  drafting and adopting laws becomes the only business of  parliament members.  <H5>  SHYMKENT </H5>   The elections just held have been dubbed not only the most  democratic but also the most difficult. Probably for the first  time in several decades, ballots could not be delivered to two  election precincts in the southern part of Kazakhstan--the Ugam  animal husbandry distant pastures in Kazgurtskiy Rayon, where 47  voters live, and the Taykanu precinct in Suzakskiy Rayon, with  its 380 voters. Because of weather conditions, a military  armored vehicle and an all-terrain vehicle were dispatched to  deliver ballots to Taykanu. Another spell of raging elements  kept even them from arriving at the election precinct in time.  Moreover, until the last moment there was no information on the  whereabouts of the crews. All other election precincts opened on  time on 7 March. In oblast rayons voters quite actively and, by  old habit, early in the morning went to fulfill their civic  duty. The election headquarters, set up under the oblast  administration, where all information flowed, by lunchtime  breathed a sigh of relief: The voter turnout would be  sufficient. As British observer Steve Lane noted, in Sayrama he  saw early in the morning voter activism, enthusiasm, and lines  to voting booths.    Shymkent's election precincts did not begin to buzz with  life  until 1000-1100. At that time, one could see sizable lines for  the ballots and to the voting booths. There were candidates'  observers present at practically all election precincts in the  oblast center. Most of them behaved properly, watching the  proceedings and not interfering with the process of voting.  Unfortunately, there were some unpleasant excesses. The  authorized representatives of one of the candidates grabbed a  stack of ballots and tore them up, and also opened the ballot  box on their own. There also have been instances of illegal  agitation in front of election precincts. The Procuracy is  looking into all this now.    Dutch observers did not see the elections in as favorable a  light as Mr. Steve Lane did. They saw a violation of the  democratic process in the fact that invitations had been  delivered to voters' homes. As well as in that 3,000 signatures  were required for a candidate's registration rather than only  the 10 in their country. The Dutch were also puzzled, to put it  mildly, by monotonous propaganda leaflets, which, they said, are  boring to read. There were many other comments, which will be  discussed. Now the data from rayon elections continues to flow  into the oblast electoral commission; they are sorted out and  analyzed. It is hard to tell at this point how many candidates  from which party or public movement will win parliamentary seats.    Overall, in Yuzhnyy Kazakhstan Oblast the voter turnout was  79.8 percent.  <H5>  UST-KAMENOGORSK </H5>   Literally on the eve on 7 March, in election precinct No.  38,  the registration of M. Kozlov, a candidate for Supreme Council  deputy, was overturned by a court ruling for violating the  Election Code. The ballots with his name were already in the  precincts, however. Therefore, the name of the failed candidate  had to be struck out as bulletins were issued to voters, which,  naturally, caused incomprehension and indignation. Some voters  in protest struck out all candidate names on the ballot--both  for the Supreme Council and for local bodies of representative  power.    M. Kozlov probably has himself and his team to blame for  what  happened. Having made a last-minute mistake, they gave rivals an  opening to put them out of the game, which is what the latter  did. This is a lesson that in an election campaign one cannot  relax till the very end. Nobody can count on greenhouse  conditions these days. Those times have gone irretrievably into  the past.  <H5>  AKMOLA </H5>   According to the oblast electoral commission data, 76.1  percent of the residents in the Ishim virgin lands area  participated in Supreme Council elections.    Overall, elections proceeded calmly, although there have  been  a few excesses.    "Most trouble came from observers," explained R. Koval,  chairman of the Akmolinsk Oblast electoral commission. "By  decision of the central electoral commission, the deadline for  candidates to file an application to field observers was 21  February. They did not do it in time. The deadline was extended  to 3 March. And still, many candidates scrambled only on  election day."    There were a total of 361 observers monitoring elections in  Akmolinsk Oblast, including British citizen Mr. Nigel Butler,  who has already served as an observer in Romanian, Russian, and  African states.    Having said that it is against his principles to criticize  the electoral system of another state, Nigel Butler nevertheless  noted a number of insignificant but violations nevertheless that  have been observed in the course of elections. Among them are  incidents of some voters casting ballots not just for themselves  but also for family members; filling out ballots outside the  voting booth; and the shortage of booths.    Nor was Nigel Butler satisfied with the quality of work of  local observers who, as he put it, mostly just sat at a distance  instead of watching the course of elections.  <H5>  KZYL-ORDA </H5>   The results of elections to the oblast maslikhat were  interesting and even unexpected. Of seven SNEK [expansion not  given], Kzyl-Orda residents elected six. Four seats in the  oblast maslikhat went to representatives of the Azat civic  movement, three, to members of the Socialist Party, and one, to  the Republican Party. Representatives of the People's Congress  of Kazakhstan see their two seats as a defeat.    Judging by the results, it looks like Kzyl-Orda residents do  not particularly trust parties and movements: 19 mandates went  to candidates not affiliated with any parties. This is something  for party and movement activists to contemplate.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: A COMPUTER SNAFU -- BUT NO BYTING BACK  </P> <P> Living as I do in a thoroughly computerized world, I sometimes feel as if I'm  flying through flak, always in danger of being zapped by some errant byte.  </P> <P> Computers are wonderful, until humans make them err. When human error is  compounded by a computer, the resulting snafu is almost impossible to untangle.  </P> <P> In last week's mail, my wife and I received a bill that makes us feel not only  wronged, but helpless.  </P> <P> It was a bill from a Pasadena radiology laboratory showing that I owe $231 for  X-rays of my chest (two views), cervical spine, shoulder (complete) and left  shoulder. I had no such X-rays made.  </P> <P> What is more exasperating, the bill notes that the radiologist has already  filed a claim with Medicare. "Payment will come directly to you. Balance now  due and payable."  </P> <P> So we are in the position of trying to convince the radiologist lab that I  received no such service, but, worse, we will have to return payment to  Medicare, if any is indeed forthcoming.  </P> <P> Do you know how hard it is to undo any transaction with Medicare once it has  been done?  </P> <P> Recently, my wife applied for credit with an Eastern mail-order house, only to  receive a form rejection listing a number of bad credit citations. Since our  credit is A No. 1, I called the credit agency in some anger, only to be  roadblocked by an answering machine. I would have to write, if I had any  complaint, and ask for a copy of my credit report.  </P> <P> I wrote a letter in some heat, which was of course a mistake. Credit agencies  are not moved by their subjects' anger. Through private means I finally found a  working phone number and talked to an assistant manager.  </P> <P> It turned out that my wife's record had been transgressed by a woman with a  similar name and an atrocious credit record. She had actually been assigned my  wife's social security number.  </P> <P> That was straightened out in time, and my wife was notified by the mail-order  house that she was now in good standing. It was more than embarrassing; it was  frightening. (There was one advantage: for awhile, at least, my wife had credit  with one less mail-order house.)  </P> <P> Steven W. Wright writes that he recently sent a check for 62 cents to settle an  alleged delinquency in his student loan account. The Student Loan Serving  Center, in Minneapolis, advised him that the delinquency had been extant since  May, 1987, but couldn't say whether his check had been short that amount or the  center had erred.  </P> <P> His alleged delinquency was reported to the U.S. Department of Education, which  sent a warning (with the word WARNING in 1-inch type) that if he didn't settle  up his account he would be declared in DEFAULT and "referred to the Federal  Government for further collection activity." (Not "for collection," but "for  further collection activity." Typical Department of Education gobbledygook.)  </P> <P> In sending the 62-cent check, Wright calculated the total cost (in time, phone  charges and postal charges) at $238.25.  </P> <P> Of course, the frustration of doing business with government agencies far  antedates the Computer Age.  </P> <P> Dick Pettit of Laguna Beach points out that Paul Tabori cites many examples in  his book, "The Natural Science of Stupidity" (Chilton, 1959).  </P> <P> One is about a man who applied for gasoline coupons in the war so he could get  to and from his essential war work. His application was denied and he was told  to use public transportation. He replied that the first bus left too late for  him to get to his job on time. Then he received a small number of coupons and a  letter that said: "After due consideration, your application has been allowed  and X units are attached to allow you to use your car to place of work only;  the return to your residence to be made by public transport."  </P> <P> A man who had lost a leg in the war was allowed an extra soap ration, but he  received the coupons for six months only. When he applied, in six months, for  more coupons, he was told that he could have them if he signed a certificate  that his leg was still off.  </P> <P> One wonders how we won the war.  </P></p>

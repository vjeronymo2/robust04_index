			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'TROUBLED WATERS' QUESTIONS CONTROL, DOMINANCE OF NATURE  </P> <P> Five thousand deer are starving in a Florida game preserve, their food sources  depleted by natural and man-made disasters. Should they be "thinned out" in a  controlled hunt, or "saved" in a risky relocation effort?  </P> <P> Brian Kral's "Troubled Waters," presented by the Laguna Playhouse Youth  Theatre, challenges children and adults to consider these and other questions  about humankind's control over nature. Directed by Scott Davidson, the  production closes this weekend at the Moulton Theatre.  </P> <P> Kral and Davidson both deserve credit. Kral's script is surprisingly well  balanced, treating a sensitive issue in a way that is neither shrill nor  preachy. Davidson has shown similar restraint, guiding his talented young cast  to performances that are powerful without being melodramatic. As a result,  audience members are allowed to think through the problem and reach their own  conclusions, a refreshing opportunity in an issues-oriented play.  </P> <P> According to Davidson, "Troubled Waters" was inspired by a 1982 incident in  which thousands of deer were dying of starvation after drought and floods  caused, in part, by development of the Florida Everglades. The government  ultimately approved a controlled hunt of the animals in an effort to reduce the  demand for the limited natural resources. As reported in the play, about 800  deer were killed; about 3,800 remained.  </P> <P> "Troubled Waters" follows the emotional struggle of teen-ager J.D. (played in  alternate performances by Craig Hammill and Josh Wheeler) as he tries to  determine his stand on the issue. Should he side with his older brother Micheal  (Raymond Scott and Peter Kreder), an earnest young park ranger who supports the  hunt? Or does he agree with his sister Sandra (Danielle McDermott), an  idealistic student who promotes moving the deer out of the area, even though  many of them would be endangered by the process? As the day of the hunt  approaches, the family tension mounts as J.D. tries to resolve the conflict  between his emotions and his logic.  </P> <P> Confused, J.D. turns to his friend Bet (Kari Geller and Rebekah Baker), a  tomboyish young Seminole Indian. Bet supports neither side of the argument and,  instead, shares some of the legends that speak of her ancestors' desire to  coexist with, rather than control, nature.  </P> <P> Ritualistic movements based loosely on Seminole ceremonial dances adds  authenticity to this play. A deer (Brigitte Paulicivic) and two Indian maids  (Sabrina Harper and Jillian Longnecker) provide a fluid, ever-changing backdrop  to the story. In several touching scenes, the deer becomes the central figure,  moving center stage to interact with J.D.  </P> <P> Davidson, who choreographed the moves, directed the cast in research of the  Seminole movement and chant as part of the rehearsal process.  </P> <P> All the performances in Saturday's 4 p.m. performance were good, but  12-year-old Craig Hammill was especially strong as J.D., switching easily from  a wisecracking little boy to a troubled young man. Kari Geller and Brigitte  Paulicivic, both 17, were noteworthy as Bet and the deer.  </P> <P> Next week, Davidson and his cast will carry "Troubled Waters" to West Germany  to take part in the first International Children's Theatre Festival, which runs  April 13 to 21. Although other groups from the United States are likely to  attend, the Laguna Playhouse Youth Theatre is the official U.S. representative  to the festival, which will include about 18 performance groups from Eastern  and Western Europe, the Soviet Union and the Middle East.  </P> <P> 'TROUBLED WATERS'  </P> <P> A Laguna Playhouse Youth Theatre production of Brian Kral's play.

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SERVICES, DANCING, SINGING AMONG EVENTS HONORING MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY  </P> <P> Korean dancers, a choir of singers from seven churches and a student drill team  will highlight Martin Luther King Day events in the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> The dancers and choir will appear during services Monday night titled "His  Dream Is Our Dream," sponsored by the Valley Interfaith Council, a coalition of  about 200 churches.  </P> <P> The service will start with a procession of about 40 elected officials and  clergy from various religious faiths. Rabbi Aaron Weis, who walked with King in  Alabama, will be among the speakers.  </P> <P> "What we're trying to do is get a Hispanic, Jewish, Korean, Protestant  representation out here . . . to demonstrate that it's not just a holiday for  blacks," said Barry Smedberg, executive director of the interfaith council. The  services will begin at 7:30 p.m. at St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church,  18115 Sherman Way in Reseda.  </P> <P> Also Monday, a drill team, choirs and dancers from at least 10 area schools  will perform during a five-hour tribute beginning at 10 a.m. in the Pacoima  Community Center at Glen Oaks and Van Nuys boulevards. Essays and art with the  theme "His Dream Is Our Dream" will be shown at the Youth Culture Center, next  door.  </P> <P> "When I watch the young people perform, it's like a class," said Arthur  Broadous, youth center director, who has seen the King tribute at least seven  years. "A lot of kids never sat in the back of the bus, knew what it was like  not to be able to eat in a restaurant."  </P> <P> Also Monday, a student discussion of the "unfinished business" in King's legacy  will end three hours of programming on the activist aired on KLCS-TV, Channel  58, the educational station of the Los Angeles Unified School District. The  programs begin at 10 a.m.  </P> <P> In events today Harding Street School in Sylmar will hold its 21st annual  commemoration of King, featuring a six-foot mural of the activist and 150  students singing his favorite hymns.  </P> <P> "The music is fantastic," said Susan Alves, a teacher and co-director of the  program. "We had a dress rehearsal and two teachers were crying. . . ."  Programs begin at 9 a.m. and 1:15 p.m. The school is at 13060 Harding St.  </P> <P> Other events today include reenactments of Rosa Parks' bus trip in Alabama,  where she refused to give up her seat to a white man in 1955, triggering civil  rights demonstrations.

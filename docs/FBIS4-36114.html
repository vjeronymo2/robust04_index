			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Trade Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih by Ahmad </F> 'Abd-al-Majid in Baghdad; date not given]    [Text] ['Abd-al-Majid] Turkish officials have said Ankara  is planning to open a trade route via Zakho after the 'Id  al-Adha holiday. Others said this will happen after a month.  What is your opinion?    [Salih] The Security Council resolutions do not close Iraq's  borders with neighboring states. The embargo targets our oil  exports. Iraqi merchants import foodstuffs from Turkey with  hard currency. As for barter, it is currently not allowed.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Iraq depends heavily on the Jordanian outlet  in providing some of its food requirements. What is your  assessment of the relationship between the two countries?    [Salih] The relationship between Jordan and Iraq is firm and  is advancing steadily in the interest of the two peoples. I  think there are huge prospects for expanding this relationship  once the economic blockade is lifted. This is because the links  and integration are there between the two economies. Lifting  the blockade will allow for further expansion of ties.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Jordan has expressed dissatisfaction with  the inspection of al-'Aqabah-bound commercial vessels and said  this is doing great economic harm to the country. Does this  inspection have any negative impact on the Iraq's food imports?    [Salih] We have paid extra charges. Also, the high  insurance rates imposed on some vessels and the smaller load  they carry are additional obstacles.    ['Abd-al-Majid] What is the effect of activating Iraqi ports  in the south on trade activity?    [Salih] First of all, there are no restrictions on exports  to Iraq via the ports of Umm Qasr, Khawr al-Zubayr, and  al-Basrah. Our ports are open to receive vessels if they wish  to come. Also, we have other ships laden with food supplies  from Europe, Australia, and southeast Asia. These use the  waterway from and to al-Basrah because there are no  international restrictions on it.    ['Abd-al-Majid] What about the Iraqi assets frozen in  foreign banks?    [Salih] The United States and its allies are still  practicing piracy against Iraqi assets and preventing us from  using these assets to buy food and medical supplies, contrary to  what the Security Council has allowed under Resolution 687.  This behavior has denied Iraq a chance to provide some of the  needs of the population.    Iraq had managed, under the instructions of the Security  Council Embargo Committee, to purchase $250,000 worth of  supplies before its assets were frozen again in September 1992.  These food supplies were distributed by the ration card. We  denounce the decision to prevent us from using our own frozen  assets abroad and deem it an evil decision that reflects the  disregard of the nations that control the Security Council for  the norms and charters and previous resolutions issued by the  Council.    [ 'Abd-al-Majid] There are some Arab states that have not  released the assets they have.    [Salih] There is an Arab siege imposed by the rulers who are  linked with the U.S. anti-Iraq policy. I am sure that Iraq  enjoys very wide popular support in the Arab world. We find it  strange for foreign countries to release our assets when some  Arab governments impose a siege on us. Switzerland released all  of our assets in 1991-1992, which amount to almost $125 million;  Italy also released a limited part of our assets amounting to $6  million; Austria did the same thing and released around $30  million; Canada, $3 million; Spain, around $20 million; Greece,  $13 million. So why don't the Arab countries release our assets  to enable us to buy food and medicine?    ['Abd-al-Majid] What effect will President Saddam Husayn's  chairmanship of the Cabinet -- after the recent Cabinet  reshuffle -- have on the activity of the Trade Ministry?    [Salih] President Saddam Husayn's contacts with our Ministry  have never stopped. He has always supervised its activities,  especially with regard to providing food. He has given this  question great importance. The state has been used to his  strong, decisive administration, which was a direct reason for  the progress and development achieved by the country. His  excellency's supervision of the Cabinet will energize the  ministries and give them momentum to expand their activities.  The Cabinet is in dire need of such administration under the  circumstances of the blockade, which has lasted for four years.    ['Abd-al-Majid] The Iraqi family depends on the ration card  to get its basic needs. Are you planning to increase the items  listed in this card to alleviate the citizens' suffering under  the embargo?    [Salih] On 1 June this year, President Saddam Husayn decided  to increase the vegetable oil quota for ration card holders and  civil servants shopping at the Trade Ministry markets. Every  family of six members will accordingly get 300-500 dinars in aid.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Have other states asked to be acquainted  with  the ration card system, which was previously considered by  several organizations an effective system to prevent famine? I  mean have they tried to benefit from your experience in applying  this system?    [Salih] This system has been assessed on the international  level. The ration card was considered the best method to  distribute food in the world. There is no doubt that every  country has its own experience in encountering states of  emergency. President Saddam Husayn ordered that this system be  adopted during the first week of the economic blockade on our  country. We prepared the card within two weeks and it was  applied on 1 September 1990, that is, 28 days after the start of  the embargo.    ['Abd-al-Majid] What is your assessment of the Iraqi market  following the recent cabinet reshuffle?    [Salih] It led to a noticeable decline in the price of the  dollar and foodstuffs. There is optimism that the market  situation will improve.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Will the prices of foodstuffs drop in the  future?    [Salih] What is important is that we have reaped excellent  results from leader Saddam Husayn's management of the executive  authority. This has positively reflected on the market by  reducing the prices of foodstuffs and the dollar exchange rate.  Measures have been taken to improve the situation. I think  that the Revolution Command Council decree to grant the party  organization and people's assemblies executive jurisdictions to  monitor the market was a very important new step toward  expanding the base of popular control of the economic activities  and promoting local control of market activities.    ['Abd-al-Majid] How many ships dock at al-Basrah ports with  food consignments every month?    [Salih] We usually announce the arrival of ships. However, I  think an average of four arrive every month. The importance of  this maritime activity is that Iraq has been directly linked to  the world. This has also reduced the cost of transportation,  especially with regard to our imports from southeast Asia.    ['Abd-al-Majid] In the light of some signals, can you tell  us  when the economic embargo will be lifted?    [Salih] As President Saddam Husayn has said, the embargo  will  be lifted when the wicked ones feel they are unable to undermine  the people's steadfastness and their national independent will.  Through our steadfastness and willpower, we proved that the  embargo will certainly be lifted and that its continuation is  not in the interest of the United States or others. Their aims  will not be achieved under the embargo and great harm has been  inflicted on their companies and products. During the past four  years, Iraq could have bought all sorts of commodities and paid  foreign firms not less than $60 billion. Iraq's annual oil  revenues of $16 billion used to be spent. This means the world  economy has lost opportunities to invest $60 billion to expand  the volume of exports and production and reduce unemployment.  The big powers also lost the Iraqi market.    The world realizes that the tighter the embargo gets, the  firmer the Iraqis become. As much as $100 billion could have  gone to foreign firms in the reconstruction drive after the  military aggression. Iraq has embarked on an effective effort  to expand its reliance on itself in the fields of agriculture  and industry in order to achieve self-satisfaction. This  explains its ability to confront the economic embargo.</p>

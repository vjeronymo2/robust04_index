			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 26 Apr (INA) -- Official talks between Iraq  and the UN Special Commission, which lasted three days, ended  today. A joint statement was issued on the high-level talks  held in Baghdad between Iraq and the UN Special Commission and  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA].    The statement said the talks are a continuation of the  discussions started in July 1993 in Baghdad and New York. The  statement further noted the tangible progress made since the  recent round of high-level talks in New York 14-19 March 1994.  The statement also expressed the appreciation of the Special  Commission and the IAEA for Iraq's prompt, positive response to  their demands, thus facilitating effective and active  inspection. This has also significantly contributed to  establishing long-term monitoring and verification as called for  by Security Council resolutions.    The Special Commission and the IAEA also welcomed Iraq's  commitment to continue to cooperate with them. The Special  Commission and the IAEA reiterated their commitment to Iraq's  legitimate interests pertaining to sovereignty, independence,  security, and dignity in line with the UN Charter.    The two sides also asserted their commitment to continuing  and intensifying efforts to reach their common objective, noting  that Iraq has adopted all measures stipulated in Paragraph 22 of  Resolution 687 of 1991.    In a related development, Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN  Special Commission, held a news conference, in which he reviewed  the talks he held with Iraqi officials 24-26 April. Ekeus  pointed out that great progress has been made in technical  aspects related to the implementation of Security Council  resolutions.    He praised Iraq's cooperation with UN committees, expressing  his happiness for these positive developments that were  reflected in the joint statement issued at the conclusion of the  talks today.    Answering an INA question about the substance of the report  he will submit to the Security Council this week, Ekeus said the  joint statement issued today will be an official document of the  Security Council, in addition to the nominal report that will be  presented by the Special Commission and the IAEA.    Ekeus added that the Special Commission will inform the  Security Council of the progress made thus far, pointing out  that a decision to lift the embargo is a political one and made  by the Security Council.    Ekeus further asserted that the meetings held between Iraq  and the Special Commission since last July have made tangible  progress and have enhanced mutual confidence on both sides.    Ekeus and his delegation left Baghdad following a three-day  visit to Iraq.</p>

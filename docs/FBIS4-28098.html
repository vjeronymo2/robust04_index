			<p>BFN     [Text] Sapporo, June 4 KYODO -- Japanese and Russian  maritime industries have agreed to jointly operate about 20  ferry services between Hokkaido and Sakhalin, Russia, for six  months beginning in May 1995, Transport Ministry officials said  Saturday [4 June].    The officials said the agreement was made in a shipping  meeting in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in Russia.    The ferry service will link Korsakov in Sakhalin with the  cities of Wakkanai and Otaru in Hokkaido, the northernmost part  of Japan.    Under the agreement, reached by Japan's six shipping  companies and a Sakhalin company, a 5,025-ton vessel owned by  the Russian company will be used for the regular ferry service.    The shipping industries of the two nations have had talks  since 1991, based on the Japan-Russia Maritime Agreement.</p>

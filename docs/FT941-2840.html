			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Advance by Celsius Industries Celsius Industries, the newly-privatised Swedish defence contractor, yesterday announced a SKr721m (Dollars 92m) profit after financial items for 1993, up 32 per cent from a year earlier. The group, which accounts for around 50 per cent of the Swedish defence industry, benefited from rationalisation, its purchase of CelsiusTech and a strong contribution from Safe Partners, the accommodation rig company in which it holds 40 per cent. A dividend of SKr6.50 per share is proposed. The operating result improved by SKr322m to SKr348m as sales grew to SKr11.6bn from SKr10.5bn. Lower interest rates meant the group's financial income dropped to SKr373m from SKr519m. Orders rose by SKr4.5bn to SKr11.6bn during the year to take the group's order book at the year-end to SKr25.6bn. CelsiusTech, which was bought from Nobel Industries early last year, made a first time contribution of SKr135m. Kockums, the submarine unit, saw a slight weakening of its result to SKr209m from SKr221m. Most disappointing was the performance of Bofors, the weapons systems division, where profits halved to SKr112m from SKr220m. The unit was hit by lower sales and redundancy costs.</p>

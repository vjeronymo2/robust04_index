			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The man who would make kings - A campaign to sell royalty to the Brazilians Helio Bloch is a kingmaker. Not, he hastens to explain, in the metaphorical sense used for US political consultants with presidents to sell, but with a real throne in his sights. Next Wednesday Brazilians will vote in a plebiscite on whether to restore the monarchy. Bloch, from the Rio-based Meet advertising agency, is in charge of mustering the support of those disenchanted with the 104-year-old republic. 'It's the first time this century that anyone has tried to sell a real king,' he says. The plebiscite, in which Brazilians must also vote on whether to change the current presidential system to a parliamentary model, is breathing life into Brazil's recession-hit advertising industry, with three leading agencies masterminding campaigns. Every night for the last two months monarchists, presidentialists and parliamentarians have been trying to sell their wares in a fixed 20-minute slot of free airtime to Brazil's 85m voters. The task for their creators is more challenging than most advertising campaigns, even of a political nature, because they are not marketing a product but a concept, one that is hard to grasp by a largely uneducated population. Bloch explains: 'This is very different to traditional political campaigns where one is simply selling a new face or new platform for a party already established in the public mind. In the UK, for example, John Major could be sold as the new face of Conservatism without having to explain what being a Conservative means. I'm having to sell a whole new idea.' Although latest polls show the monarchists registering only 17 per cent of the vote, Bloch is confident. His main selling point is the success of monarchy in modern world, using Spain and Japan as examples. Brazil's history also plays an important part in Bloch's attempts to 'establish the credentials of monarchy'. 'Brazilians have a very good image of the last Emperor Dom Pedro II,' he says. 'He paid his own bills, the country had total liberty of speech and was very advanced with amongst the world's first railways and telephone systems.' Bloch's third weapon is what he calls the 'collective subconscious'. He explains: 'Everything good in Brazil is royal, thus Pele is known as king of football, Roberto Carlos (a top singer) is the king of music and Xuxa (the leading children's presenter) is the queen of children.' With less than Dollars 1m (Pounds 662,000) at his disposal, Bloch elected to spend most of the money on short commercials, concentrating on these three points. Under the slogan 'Help Brazil recover its majesty', recurring themes in these commercials are the absence of inflation and corruption during Brazil's 67-year-period as a monarchy compared with today's rapid inflation and rampant bribery. Despite Bloch's well-acclaimed campaign, the republicans are far ahead. Surprisingly, support for presidentialism has not been dented by the corruption scandal which led to the impeachment of President Fernando Collor. Sergio Amado from Denison, the Sao Paulo-based agency running the campaign, uses the national anthem and footage of important mass protests of the past to come over as the more patriotic choice. He uses the Collor scandal as a benefit of the system: 'We decided we must confront the issue so we used the theme 'You the people elected him and you the people took him away'.' With more than Dollars 5m to spend, Amado hopes to get seven out of 10 votes, partly through attacks on the other systems, attacking the monarchy for slavery and blaming the disastrous experience of parliamentarianism in 1962-63 - when the country had three prime ministers in one year - for the subsequent military coup. The big loser is parliamentarianism with a didactic campaign involving too many talking heads trying to explain the concept of parliamentarism and division of powers to a largely illiterate population. So desperate are the parliamentarians that they are offering voters the chance of another referendum after five years.</p>

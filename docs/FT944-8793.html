			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Pensions body wants saving to be compulsory The National Association of Pension Funds, the trade body for pension providers, is proposing that the government makes saving for retirement compulsory for employers and workers. The association, at its annual autumn meeting in London yesterday, said it would call on government to allow employers to make membership of an occupational pension scheme a condition of employment, provided the scheme meets certain criteria. In addition, employees not in a suitable occupational pension scheme, and their employers, should be required to contribute 10 per cent of pay between them to an approved money purchase arrangement. Although there may be increased costs with this arrangement, they would be offset by removal of the obligation to make other contributions to the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. The association, which has launched a review of retirement provision, proposes a gradual phasing out of Serps while protecting the scheme for people over the age of 50. Self-employed people should be required to contribute 10 per cent of net relevant earnings to an approved money purchase arrangement, and all pension arrangements should increase each year in line with the retail price index or 5 per cent, whichever is less. In 1986 laws banning compulsory occupational scheme membership took effect. The present government has taken a hard line against compulsory pensions saying saving should be a matter for individual choice. The association is also proposing the introduction of an element of means-testing into the basic state pension, which should be increased each year in line with wages, not prices, which rise more slowly. Those whose incomes are above a certain level would have their state pension reduced by a set percentage, while those whose incomes fall below a certain level would have annual increases above the average. Separately, the association said a poll of its members showed the 'overwhelming majority' now believe that executive directors' rolling contracts should last no longer than 12 months. Mr Geoff Lindey, chairman of the organisation's investment committee, said: 'We will make it known there is a strong feeling among our members that three-year rolling contracts are not appropriate. Furthermore, we will encourage our members to exercise their right as shareholders to vote accordingly.'</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Observer: Buck catches up It's the tortoise-and-hare story in reverse. Last November, Observer reported that farmers were hopping mad with slow and ponderous British Rail, accusing it of neglecting to control the rabbits which breed on railway embankments and raid the crops in neighbouring fields. BR's response has been to stone-wall by arguing that there can be no civil claim against it for the actions of wild animals, while hedging the question of liability under the Pests Act by insisting that any compensation awards it makes for the crop-damage are merely ex-gratia payments. It now looks like being overtaken by the bunnies with the aid of the Country Landowners' Association, which is mustering members to put a stop to BR's buck-passing. In particular, a High Court action is being filed by Major Michael Smallwood, who farms at Honeybourne, Worcestershire, for breach of the Pests Act.</p>

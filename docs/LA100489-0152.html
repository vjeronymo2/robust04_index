			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 12,000 MORE BEGIN EXODUS TO THE WEST;  </P> <P> CZECHS APPLAUD AS E. GERMANS LEAVE COMMUNIST 'POVERTY'  </P> <P> Up to 12,000 more East Germans began leaving this city for West Germany today  and were applauded by about 1,000 Czechoslovaks who gathered to watch them  depart.  </P> <P> The first of 10 special East German trains left here after a delay of nearly 24  hours, caused by more people crowding stations in East Germany in the hope of  hitching a ride to the West.  </P> <P> As the East Germans boarded buses sent from East Germany to take them to the  railway station, about 1,000 Czechoslovaks clapped repeatedly. The departing  refugees waved and made the V-for-victory sign.  </P> <P> "Here we see the poverty of communism," Charter 77 human rights group member  Daniel Kummerman told Reuters as thousands got into the buses. "It is sinking  in."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, 18 disgruntled East Germans trying to get to the West sought refuge  in the U.S. Embassy in East Berlin. An embassy spokesman said American and East  German diplomats were discussing the next move.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Problem 'Resolved'  </P> <P> A Czechoslovak government spokesman, Marcel Jansen, said the train shuttle that  had been expected to start Tuesday had been delayed by people crowding stations  in East Germany and blocking tracks in the hope of hitching a ride.  </P> <P> "The problem has been resolved," Jansen said, without giving any details.  </P> <P> Travelers arriving at Hof, on the border of the two Germanys, had reported  large numbers of mainly young people at stations along the route of the  Prague-bound train.  </P> <P> "In Plauen, 20 miles north of (Hof), the train station is said to be totally  occupied by young people," a West German railway spokesman said.  </P> <P> East German church sources reported that police cleared and sealed off the main  station in Dresden, near the Czechoslovak border, after up to 3,000 people  swarmed over it and blocked the tracks.  </P> <P> West German television, widely viewed in the East, repeatedly showed an  interview in which a previous train jumper described how he did it and  announced the trains' probable route -- that used by previous refugee specials  last week.  </P> <P> Tow trucks began removing hundreds of East German cars abandoned in Prague by  those at the embassy, and the state news agency CTK said Prague will hold talks  with East Berlin on how to dispose of them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Visa-Free Travel  </P> <P> East Germany has agreed to allow all its citizens who had come to  Czechoslovakia to proceed to the West.  </P> <P> Several thousand of them arrived at the Prague mission overnight, the last to  take advantage of visa-free travel to Czechoslovakia that East Berlin  terminated Tuesday to halt the exodus.  </P> <P> The number of new arrivals slowed today, a sign that the suspension of  visa-free travel is having its effect.  </P> <P> Police in riot gear patrolled a park at the back of the embassy during the  night, but officers did not block access to the front.  </P> <P> Plainclothes officers attacked hundreds of East Germans on Tuesday as they  scaled the fence into the embassy's rear garden. Ten were hurt, one seriously.  </P></p>

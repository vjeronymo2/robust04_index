			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- Former U.S. President  Jimmy Carter flew into Seoul Monday in a prelude to his visit to  North Korea, with the possibility of his mediation in the  nuclear crisis gaining widespread attention.    Carter is visiting the two Koreas as head of his private  peace center. He meets with South Korean Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu and President Kim Yong-sam before passing through the  heavily fortified truce village of Panmunjom into the North  Wednesday [15 June].    He is expected to meet North Korean leader Kim Il-song, who  is reportedly waiting for Carter to deliver a message to U.S.  President Bill Clinton on his proposal for defusing the current  nuclear tensions.    The former president will return to Seoul June 18 via  Panmunjom and hold a press conference before heading back to the  United States the same day.    Carter goes to Pyongyang as the U.N. Security Council  prepares to circulate a U.S.-drafted resolution seeking punitive  sanctions against the communist state for reneging on nuclear  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

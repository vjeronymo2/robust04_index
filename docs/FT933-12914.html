			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / UN will not ease sanctions against Iraq THE United Nations Security Council yesterday agreed that full-scale sanctions must remain in force against Iraq, regardless of reported progress on the issue of eliminating the country's weapons of mass destruction. However, Britain's Sir David Hannay, the Council president, emphasised that the decision was not 'judgmental' in advance of a report members were due to receive today from Mr Rolf Ekeus, a senior UN official. Mr Ekeus completed negotiations with Baghdad this week on a weapons inspection programme. Iraq agreed to long-term monitoring after provoking a crisis by refusing surveillance cameras at two missile sites. The change in approach was related to an attempt by President Saddam Hussein to have sanctions lifted. The imposition of sanctions is reported to have caused serious shortages of food and medicines and fuelled soaring prices. Sir David termed Mr Ekeus's success 'extremely welcome' but he added that what the Council wanted from Iraq were 'deeds not words'. Mr Saddam has a record of broken promises that have repeatedly brought Iraq into confrontation with the UN, only to see him back off under the threat of possible military action. Talks between Iraq and the UN on a limited resumption of Iraqi oil exports remained suspended last night as officials still awaited an announcement by Baghdad on the return of its negotiating team to New York. Sir David made it clear in remarks to reporters that an eventual deal would not result in the automatic release of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn) worth of Iraqi oil approved by the Council nearly two years ago. This would require a new resolution on the basis of a report by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general, and a determination whether Iraq had complied with all relevant conditions. Much of the proceeds of the proposed limited sale, which would continue for six months and involve about 550,000 b/d, would be spent on food, medicines and other humanitarian needs. Although both the UN and the Iraqis have been tight-lipped about the negotiations, it is widely believed that UN monitoring may be an obstacle for Baghdad. Reuter adds from London: Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, yesterday promised British support for a new international campaign to free Kuwaitis still held in Iraq after the Gulf war and warned Baghdad the west had not ruled out the use of force. He said Iraq's 'persistent failure' to account for missing Kuwaitis and other nationals held since the 1991 war to eject Iraq from Kuwait would be raised at the UN Security Council review of sanctions.</p>

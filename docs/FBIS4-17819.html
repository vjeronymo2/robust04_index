			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Anatoliy Lopata, chief of staff of </F> the Ukrainian Army, by Michel Rosten in Brussels; date not  given: "General Anatoliy Lopata Optimistic About Black Sea  Agreement"]    [Text] General Anatoliy Lopata, chief of staff of the  Ukrainian Army, made a stopover in Brussels (he will visit NATO  this Tuesday [26 April]) on his return from the United States,  where he was received at the Pentagon. The question of his  country's denuclearization was discussed as was the dispute over  the Black Sea Fleet. Following an idea by Defense Minister  General Vitaliy Radetsky, he sounded out the Americans on the  proposal of "bringing a third party into the discussions to  encourage the conclusion" of the negotiations. But, on Saturday  [23 April], according to the Russian press agency INTERFAX,  President Kravchuk, in agreement with Moscow, stated on  Ukrainian radio that the question of the fleet should be solved  without the intervention of a "third party."    [Rosten] How do you explain the fact that your president  took  that position?    [Lopata] I think our president's stance is that this is a  bilateral problem. He probably thinks we should use all  diplomatic means and adopt the most rational approaches for the  division of the fleet. And it is only when all the possible  solutions have been rejected that we should resort to the  mediation of a third party. (The Netherlands has been approached  -- LA LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note).    [Rosten] What kind of relations can Ukraine still maintain  with President Meshkov, who is openly expressing his opposition  to the presence of the Ukrainian fleet in Crimean ports?    [Lopata] The positions here are clear. Crimean President  Meshkov is pursuing a policy which is not that of Ukraine but  that of Russia. He is violating Ukrainian laws. The presence  of the Ukrainian Army and the creation of a Ukrainian fleet in  Crimea have no justification in Mr. Meshkov's mind. I think  that his opinions do not reflect our approach to ensuring the  state's defense.    [Rosten] Several agreements have already been reached at the  highest level on the division of the Black Sea Fleet. None has  been respected. Why?    [Lopata] Russia does not see any problem in dividing the  Black Sea Fleet. Over the past two years, it has stressed that  it was prepared to divide this fleet and even to ensure that  Ukraine could form its own fleet but provided the whole  infrastructure -- and hence the bases -- remains Russia's  property. That approach to settling the question cannot satisfy  Ukraine. As a state, it has its viewpoint both on the division  of the fleet and on that of the naval forces in the existing  bases. Ukraine would like the agreements on the division of the  fleet and the leasing of part of the infrastructure to the  Russian Federation to be decided in a civilized way, respecting  its interests and specifying the timing of the leasing of bases  by the Russian fleet. What is now being proposed to Ukraine is  unacceptable. A compromise is necessary and I think it will be  found.    [Rosten] But the Russians also want to safeguard their  interests...    [Lopata] If there was an amiable settlement, Ukraine would  benefit from good prospects for the creation of its own naval  forces on the basis of the division of the whole Soviet fleet,  in whose creation it actively participated. Compared with the  whole of this fleet, it is obvious that the Black Sea Fleet is  merely an insignificant part. Ukraine could therefore have  claims on the whole fleet of the former USSR but because it  understands Russia's strategic problems in the region of the  Black Sea basin and the Mediterranean basin, it has accepted the  principle of a division of all the Black Sea vessels. With  regard to its share, in other words around 200 ships, Ukraine  has the opportunity to decide which ships should form part of  its own naval force... It might suggest that Russia should buy  those it does not need. As for the form of cooperation, it  could take different on forms: Instead of handing over ships,  it could involve handing over weapons or other equipment vital  to the Ukrainian fleet. We have agreed with Russia on this  approach. It is the division of the infrastruture which is  causing a great problem in our relations. Russia wants to  remain in these bases forever.    [Rosten] You are on your way home from the United States  where you discussed the problem of the denuclearization of  Ukraine. Will the new Parliament be more successful in settling  this than the previous one?    [Lopata] Ukraine is meticulously implementing the agreements  on the transfer of nuclear warheads to Russia. So far, it has  transferred three convoys of weapons of this type in exchange  for which it has received a convoy of nuclear fuel.    [Rosten] The Russian press has launched a campaign against  Ukraine, accusing it of storing chemical and biological weapons.  What is your answer to these accusations?    [Lopata] I can only say this: There are no such weapons on  Ukrainian territory. All the weapons which belonged to the  chemical or biological sector were transported out of Ukrainian  territory before the creation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.    [Rosten] Is the general dispute between Kiev and Moscow not  likely to degenerate in the military sphere?    [Lopata] The problem of relations between Ukraine and Russia  -- two states with equal rights -- must obviously be solved at  the level of diplomatic relations. If, in these relations, the  armed forces of one or other state make their voice heard, we  must pay attention to it. But that voice must have limits that  prohibit the use of arms. What happened in Odessa is pure  provocation, but Kiev and Moscow have managed to control that  incident, which they do not want to see repeated.</p>

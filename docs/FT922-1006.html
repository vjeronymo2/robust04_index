			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (3): The importance of image - Glasgow puts a brave face on recession RECESSION has cast a pall of uncertainty over Glasgow, and yet in strictly relative terms the city is suffering less from the downturn than many others. The recession came late to Glasgow, as it did to the rest of Scotland. Unemployment in Glasgow was still falling just over a year ago when it was rising fast in southern Britain, and at that time the city's commercial property market was only beginning to experience a downturn. Even now unemployment is only 1.5 per cent higher than in October 1990. The good news, however, is purely relative because overall unemployment in Glasgow is high at 15.5 per cent, with male unemployment at 21.6 per cent and the rate of joblessness in some areas running at 30 per cent or more. Much of Glasgow is still doing reasonably well, but the improvement of recent years has not brought unemployment down to a level most people would consider acceptable. The continuing recession is having a depressing effect on morale. Mr Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of the Glasgow Development Agency, says the task of medium term development is made more difficult by the stodgy economic climate. 'You go along to a company to offer assistance with improving the skills of its workforce and you find employees being made redundant almost while you are speaking to them.' But the emphasis on Glasgow's long term recovery and the initiatives being taken to accomplish it sometimes distract attention from the fact that the city is a fundamentally vibrant place. Although its population is now less than 700,000 and slowly dropping, it is the centre of services for an area of more than 2.5m people, and Scotland's largest consumer market. Being a centre of service industries may not have the prestige that Glasgow once enjoyed as a big manufacturing centre, but manufacturing in the city has been in decline since the second world war. Even 10 years ago some 100,000 people were employed in manufacturing in Glasgow while now the number is 55,000. Yet some of the survivors of that industrial holocaust are doing well. There are now only two shipyards on the Clyde but both have virtually full order books. Kvaerner Govan, the Norwegian-owned merchant ship building yard, last year won orders worth Pounds 300m for four chemical tankers and with other ships under construction has a full order book until 1995. Across the Clyde, Yarrow, part of GEC, earlier his year won a Pounds 400m contract to build three frigates for the Ministry of Defence. At Cathcart, Weir Group, which had to be rescued from impending collapse in 1981, is virtually unaffected by recession as one of the world's leading pump manufacturers and is making rising and substantial profits. However other engineering companies are doing less well: Barr &amp; Stroud, an offshoot of Pilkington which makes optical equipment for defence, has halved its workforce to under 1,000 in the past two years. The Rolls-Royce components plant at Hillington has shed 750 jobs in the past year. Glasgow is also a centre of food and drink processing, with a large biscuit-making plant of United Biscuits and several whisky operations, including important parts of United Distillers and the headquarters of Whyte &amp; Mackay, as well as textile makers including Coats Viyella. Both the GDA and the district council are anxious to attract new manufacturers to Glasgow. However, they accept that manufacturing companies are primarily attracted to the nearby new towns of East Kilbride and Cumbernauld rather than Glasgow. Nevertheless, a joint effort is being made by the GDA and the district council to create factories on appealing sites with private sector help and lure medium-sized manufacturing operations to the city. The prime objective, however, is on expanding the service industries of the city. Glasgow firms provide professional services such as legal work, accountancy, advertising and public relations. Glasgow is a second tier financial centre. Its branch of the International Stock Exchange has the only remaining trading floor in Britain and Glasgow is the headquarters of Allied Provincial, a chain of provincial stockbrokers which operate all over Britain. The fund management company Murray Johnstone has more than Pounds 3.4bn under management. The Clydesdale Bank which has its headquarters in the city has been reviving steadily since 1987 when Midland Bank sold it to National Australia Bank. However it recently shed 700 jobs at its head office, bringing staff numbers there down to 2,400, as part of an efficiency programme to take full advantage of automation. Last year, Glasgow became home to one of the FT 100 companies when Scottish Power, formerly the South of Scotland Electricity Board, was privatised. It too has been shedding staff as efficiencies are made. Another significant development on the corporate front was the recent buyout by its management of George Outram, publishers of The Herald, the west of Scotland's leading daily newspaper, and the Glasgow Evening Times. Outram was sold for Pounds 74m by Lonrho and is now called Caledonian Newspaper Publishing. Glasgow is the centre of the Scottish media industry and the home of Scottish Television, a quoted company, which pulled off a coup by successfully bidding only Pounds 2,000 to retain its franchise. For several years the Scottish Development Agency and its successor, the GDA, have worked with the private sector to improve office accommodation in the centre of the city and attract companies needing a Scottish headquarters, or even fully fledged head offices. Some 18 organisations established offices in Glasgow between 1986 and 1991, promising a total of 7,300 jobs. These included BP Exploration's headquarters for northern Europe (600 jobs moving from southeast England), a British Airways tele-sales office (creating 350 posts) and two offices of the Department of Social Security (creating a total of 900 jobs). However, 2,000 of the 7,300 promised jobs were in the Census Office for the processing of the 1991 census of Britain; the luring of this office to Glasgow was a considerable coup for the city, but the jobs are naturally temporary, and numbers employed are now falling. Worse, BP Exploration said this month that it was moving its Glasgow operation to Aberdeen over the next year or so, at a cost to Glasgow of 350 jobs. The process of attracting incoming companies to Glasgow is now virtually stalled by the recession and many of the jobs that have been created are for women, so the policy has little direct effect on the high male unemployment. Glasgow has shown its customary energy in promoting itself as a tourist destination based largely on the attractions of its cultural resources and events. In 1990, 3m visitors came to Glasgow, the year it was European City of Culture, a venture which created a positive net economic return to the regional economy of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 14m. Progress is thus being made but the high level of male unemployment is shorthand for misery and frustration on the periphery of the city which the enriching of the centre can only partially cure. Professor Alan MacGregor of Glasgow University has a sober conclusion on Glasgow's economic progress in the past few years. 'There has not been a recovery in Glasgow's position, but the city has created a positive image that is a base for recovery,' he says. 'What you can say is that we're in better shape than we were before to move forward if the economy improves.'</p>

"The agreement is the result of close consultation and  coordination between South Korea and the international  community," said a Foreign Ministry official.    The DPRK agreed to allow the IAEA to conduct inspections on  all seven reported nuclear facilities at a working-level contact  in Vienna Tuesday.    But the question of inspecting two unreported nuclear  facilities is still pending, presumably for the two sides to  discuss later, according to reports reaching here Wednesday.    The two sides reached the agreement after two months of  see-saw negotiations to resume inspections which was stalled  since February last year.    The South Korean official said that since the agreement  "leaves unsettled the question of special inspections of two  major suspected sites, the international community will continue  its efforts to resolve this matter."    The IAEA is expected to send a team of inspectors to  Pyongyang before February 21, the date on which the IAEA  convenes a board of governors meeting.    Meanwhile, the DPRK and the United States reportedly resumed  working level meeting in New York Tuesday to negotiate follow-up  measures on IAEA inspections.</p>

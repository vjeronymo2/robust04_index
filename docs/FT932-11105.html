			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Sanctions bite hard on hungry Iraqis: Border closure is an attempt to halt economic collapse DRESSED in black robes, Shia women from Iraq sit on the pavement in the Jordanian capital, Amman, selling illegally imported cigarettes. Twenty, 30, sometimes 40 women line up in groups on al-Hashimi Street, in front of the main taxi rank and in view of King Hussein's palace, to earn a few extra pennies for their hungry families in Baghdad. Squeezed by nearly three years of sanctions against Iraq, the women say they have had no choice but to make the 14-hour drive by taxi from Baghdad to Amman every fortnight or so for their families to survive. Yesterday the taxis were halted. The Baghdad authorities closed the border in what was described as a temporary measure so they could withdraw the 25 Iraqi dinar banknote. With inflation rampant in Iraq, the notes, printed in Switzerland before the Gulf war, circulate widely outside the country and are valued more highly than the locally printed currency issued since. Iraqi holders of the ID25 notes were given a week to exchange them. The border closure, to be kept in place until Monday, is a sign of Baghdad's desperation to regain control over its collapsed economy. 'There is no work in Iraq, the rationing system is not enough to live on and prices are too high,' says one of the women, who did not wish to give her name. An estimated 1,000-2,000 Iraqis travel between Jordan and Iraq each day. Already this week the Baghdad government has announced stiff duties on foreign travel. A fee of ID15,000 (around JD180, or Pounds 163, on the Amman black market) is to be charged to Iraqi citizens, with the exception of diplomats and students, on leaving the country. The measures indicate that the Iraqi authorities may be losing their economic battle. Living conditions of the population, in particular the people in the northern governates and the Shias, continue to deteriorate. United Nations officials and foreign diplomats privately predict instability in the country unless the economy recovers soon. Market prices of basic necessities have increased by more than half in the past three months and prices for all foodstuffs remain many times higher than before the UN sanctions were enforced in August 1990 after the invasion of Kuwait. The price of wheat is 72 times higher than in July 1989, rice 45 times, cooking oil 32, lentils 88, milk 68, sugar 59 and tea 60 times. In addition to this hyperinflation, the purchasing power of the population has been drastically reduced. The average minimum monthly wage is ID150, rising to an average ID400 for civil servants, but Iraqis claim that at least ID1,000 a month is required to feed a small family. Mass starvation is avoided by the Iraqi government's monthly rationing system, which was increased by 20 per cent this spring. UN officials in Baghdad point out that this is not enough to prevent severe malnutrition among the poorest. According to a UN report on the humanitarian needs of Iraq, the monthly ration quotas of flour (9kg), rice and oil (1.75kg each) and sugar (1.5kg) provide only 68 per cent of minimum energy requirements. Although the distribution of subsidies is effective in most areas, northern governates such as Mosul and Kirkuk are reported to receive only 6 to 10 per cent of their ration entitlements. In view of this, the report estimates that nearly 1.7m Iraqis, from a population of around 18m, need food aid for an extended period. Iraqi travellers to Amman say that those in the former middle class now have two or more daily jobs and are forced to sell personal assets and family treasures to survive. But many are unable to cope. There has been an unprecedented rise in the number of destitutes and unemployed. According to the UN report, Iraq's ministry of labour and social affairs has registered 450,000 destitute persons whose monthly income is less than ID50. A further 263,000 have applied to be included.</p>

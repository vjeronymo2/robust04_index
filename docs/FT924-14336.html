			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Standard bid hints refuted TALK that a predator might be stalking Standard Chartered gave a rationale for a sharp rise in the shares but was largely discounted by many senior analysts. The shares had fallen 45p since the end of September and were beginning to look cheap when a well-timed piece of research from BZW, gave them a fillip earlier in the week. The initial rally received a further boost yesterday with the return of speculation that the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) was poised to bid - Standard shares jumped almost 20p before settling with the market to close 12 better at 493p on reasonable turnover of 2.8m shares. However, analysts said Standard was treating the speculation with caution and they argued that DBS had strong links with the government of Singapore which was unlikely to approve hostile bids for a UK bank. They added that the DBS balance sheet was not strong enough for a bid of this size. Standard has a stock market value of over Pounds 1bn. Owners volatile The rollercoaster ride in the shares of Owners Abroad continued unabated yesterday as rumours refused to fade over the prospects for an imminent takeover bid. Some in the market complained that the proxy 'takeover situation' was creating a false market in the shares as traders were forced to extend the trading range of the shares to 10p at one stage to discourage the speculation. However, City talk continued to point to LTU, the German group admitting yesterday that talks had taken place with Owners. The most favoured option being touted in the market has LTU buying a stake in the UK's second biggest tour operator, thus discouraging the attention of Airtours, ranked number three in the industry, and thought to be the unamed company which Owners said had approached it three weeks ago. Airtours has refused to comment on the situation. Owners shares, which opened at 69 1/2 , touched 82 1/2 at one stage before retreating to close 3 1/2 up on the day at 73p. Turnover was a hefty 7.1m. Airtours dropped a penny to 236p. Trafalgar active Trafalgar House had a busy session as Hongkong Land's tender offer for 15 per cent to add to the 14.9 per cent acquired last week drew to a close with dealers predicting certain failure for the Far Eastern group. The ordinary shares eased a penny to 85 1/2 p, the tender offer being at 85p, while the 'A' class shares also softened a penny to 82 1/2 p, just ahead of the offer price of 82p. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which recently became joint broker to Trafalgar, was reported to have been a keen player throughout the session, sending turnover soaring to 7m shares. One observer predicted HK Land was unlikely to gain more than a handful of shares for its tender offer with the talk of changes in the top of the management of the company cited as reasons for the reluctance of investors to sell. A series of downgrades in Tate and Lyle knocked the shares as the company held meetings with selected broking houses. Nomura, Cazenove and Panmure Gordon snipped their forecasts, although Nomura insisted that the new figures reflected a change in accounting policy by the group and that trading remained sound. The shares fell 6 to 341p. Profit-taking continued in Unilever, the shares retreating 6 to 1025p. Life insurer Legal &amp; General recovered from some rough handling earlier in the week and closed 14 better at 347p. The shares also received some support from a short-term buy recommendation from Kleinwort Benson. Textiles group Lamont Holdings plunged 65 to 238p. Jokes about possible associations with the chancellor of the exchequer abounded but the reality was a 44 per cent slide in interim profits to Pounds 2.18m. The slide was largely prompted by problems in the groups Shaw Carpets arm and led to general reductions in forecasts. SG Warburg has slashed its estimate for the full year to Pounds 6.75m. At the time of a rights issue in April the market was looking for around Pounds 11m. Speciality chemicals group Laporte rose 8 to 561p, helped by a buy note from BZW. The house argues that worries over the company's quality of earnings, cash generation and medium term prospects have been overdone. New subscriber figures from Vodafone indicated that the cellular telephone group had won a hefty 8,300 new customers in September. The shares added 3 to 339p. The oil majors were among the poorest performers in the Footsie. Worries about the international chemicals business, highlighted by a recent cautious presentation by Shell Chemicals, triggered persistent US selling, which lowered BP 3 1/2 to 214 1/2 p, on good turnover of 9.9m and Shell 3 to 519p on 4.4m traded. Small exploration company Clyde Petroleum jumped sharply after securities house Hoare Govett argued that the shares were heavily undervalued. Clyde had said that development of the Gryphon oil field in the North Sea, in which it has a 35 per cent stake, was being speeded up. As a result, Hoare argued that the group's shares should be valued at 60p each to put the Clyde on a par with its peers in the sector. Clyde lifted 5 1/2 to 38p. British Gas improved 2 1/2 to 251p with one house suggesting that the regulators might relax some constraints. Meanwhile, Lasmo slipped 1 1/2 p on a County NatWest sell recommendation. Barclays Bank saw heavy two-way turnover of 9.7m shares boosted by an agency cross of 1m at 346p a share. Observers said debate over the security of the dividend was prompting interest. British Steel, which has been under pressure in recent months, moved up 2 1/2 to 62 1/2 p on good turnover of 8.2m shares. The market responded to a buy note issued by Japanese-owned stockbroker Nomura, which said Steel will benefit from sustained devaluation of sterling. A bout of profit-taking and a profit forecast downgrade from Panmure Gordon depressed Forte, the shares shedding 5 to 154p. Big turnover for a second day in Queens Moat Houses, yesterday reaching 8.4m, left the shares a half-penny off at 35p. A large agency cross in Great Portland, with 2m shares thought to have been traded at 98p, left the stock 2 lighter at 101p. Consideration of Bowater following a three-day company visit by analysts led to a fall in the share price, which was marked down by 20 to 820p on very thin turnover. Analysts said they had no complaints about the company but the share price was 'well up with events'. Paper manufacturer Arjo Wiggins Appleton continued easier following a recent forecast downgrade. Yesterday the shares were held back by a large agency cross at 154 1/2 p and closed 2 off at 154p on turnover of 6.3m. Hints from government ministers that the Sunday trading laws may be reformed gave a lift to a number of stores stocks, among which Kingfisher advanced 8 to 508p and Dixons put on 7 to 209p. Airports group BAA moved ahead 11 to 721p after Kleinwort Benson reiterated its buy recommendation. Mr Peter Bergius at the securities house said the the earnings outlook for the company was encouraging being both a defensive and early cycle stock. International trader and Toyota distributor Inchcape jumped 7 to 488p after broker Robert Fleming upgraded profit expectations. Among engineering stock, Smiths Industries were wanted and gained 6 to close at 323p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (48).

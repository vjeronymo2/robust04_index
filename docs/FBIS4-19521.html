			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "fl": "Austria's Economy Is Recovering"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- Austria's economy is recovering again.  The international upswing is also affecting the domestic  economy. The Economic Research Institute (Wifo) predicts an  increase in the GNP by 2 percent in real terms, while the  Institute for Higher Studies (IHS) is more cautious and  forecasts a 1.6-percent increase.    "We were in a position to clearly revise our predictions  upward," Wifo head Helmut Kramer stated. "The upswing has  become stronger and should continue in 1995." Wifo expects an  increase of 3 percent and the IHS a growth of 2.4 percent for  1995.    Private consumption, exports, and investments support the  upswing. The German economy, which is lagging slightly behind,  is a factor of insecurity, which might have an impact on  Austria's tourism. "The weak economic situation and declining  air fares might make other destinations more attractive," IHS  head Bernhard Felderer pointed out.    Both institutes based their predictions on Austria's  membership in the European Union [EU]. According to Kramer, no  calculations were made for a different scenario but "it would  certainly have a negative impact on the investment climate."  Yet one should not expect too much from the "integration  effect" because Austria has already been integrated to a large  extent. A disintegration effect, however, would have a much  stronger impact.    The opportunities for Austria are good: At a rising  utilization of the capacities, prices will decline.    According to Wifo, the economic growth should be sufficient  to stabilize the situation in the labor market. Yet the  reduction of jobs in the industry will continue. Approximately  10,000 industrial workers might lose their jobs this year and  another 4,000 next year. The unemployment rate is expected to  remain largely unchanged because more employment and jobs will  be available.    A decline of prices resulting from membership in the EU  might  cause the increase in the consumer price index to drop to below  3 percent. "A 2.8-percent increase is quite possible," Kramer  believes and foresees another decline to 2.2 percent for 1995.  The IHS predicts an increase of consumer price index by 3.1  percent for 1994 and a 2.8-percent rise for 1995.</p>

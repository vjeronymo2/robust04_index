			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'LIGHT' LEANS HEAVILY ON SHALLOW SATIRE  </P> <P> Shirley MacLaine plays a sexy grandma in "Waiting for the Light" (selected  theaters) -- actually, a sexy grand-aunt -- and it's a mark of the movie's  confused attack that it keeps waving her at the audience like a piquant flag.  </P> <P> Slinking through the movie's make-believe all-American small town, she's the  snake in the grass: perusing trashy paperbacks and tabloids, decked out in  hooker's shades, rainbow-colored tart's clothes, and bodices cut so low that  her bosom threatens to pop out at the camera.  </P> <P> The affect isn't distasteful -- MacLaine is still a cinematic eyeful -- but  it's definitely exploitative. In her brilliant, touching "Postcards From the  Edge" turn as the show-biz mom, she wasn't afraid to look dazzling in one  scene, faded in another. Here, as salty old Aunt Zena -- house eccentric of an  urban brood that inherits a small-town diner and becomes involved in a phony  religious miracle -- she is apparently expected to be dazzling and grotesque  all at the same time.  </P> <P> The movie tries to have it both ways too: tart one moment, gooey the next. It's  both fairy tale and satire: a rib-nudging fable about a kid's prank, instigated  by Zena, that convinces the credulous townsfolk that angels are visiting their  community. The deception snowballs. Dewy-eyed pilgrims descend on Buckley in  polite hordes, candles are lit in the now-sacred grove, the diner's business  booms, cynical newsmen snoop, and even world history gets into the act. The  whole escalating charade occurs during the Cuban missile crisis, which allows a  dubious "dove of peace" angle to get dragged in.  </P> <P> This idea isn't very original. It suggests movies like "Nothing Sacred" and  Billy Wilder's newspaper hoax drama "Ace in the Hole" -- and, most of all, it  suggests the episode in Fellini's "La Dolce Vita" where provincial children  faked a sighting of the Virgin Mary and turned their village into a kind of  Carnival of Lourdes.  </P> <P> But Fellini and Wilder were scornful of the frauds they portrayed. Here,  writer-director Christopher Monger seems to be spoofing small-town American  religious fervor and, not so subtly, playing up to it. At first, Aunt Zena and  the kids are portrayed as cutely sadistic pranksters and con artists set loose  in the provinces, with hapless, nose-crinkling mom Teri Garr as their  exasperated boss. Gradually Monger all but spray-paints love and good will all  over his creaky fable. The satire, which tended to limp along anyway -- Monger  has Frank Capra's intentions, but not his pacing -- is gutted. Its beneficent  replacement is unconvincing.  </P> <P> Monger, a Welshman, has little sense of what American small towns and  townspeople are like. His Buckley, Wash., seems to have sprung full-blown from  a movie never-never land where one-liners sprout up like plastic tulips, dreams  come true in dollops of sticky sunshine and the citizenry act like moonstruck  boobs.  </P> <P> But, despite the erratic writing and clunky direction, there are some visual  and musical coups: MacLaine's amusingly blowzy routines, the credit montage  over "Jesus Hits Like an Atom Bomb," numerous felicities in Gabriel Beristain's  ("Caravaggio") cinematography and an incongruously fine score by Michael Storey  ("Another Country"). It's all for naught. "Waiting for the Light" (rated PG,  despite innuendo) ends up as high-concept comedy with a cracked veneer of  sincerity. Craftily, it tries to spoof the Almighty, while also bringing him in  as a partner on the job.  </P> <P> 'WAITING FOR THE LIGHT'  </P> <P> An Epic Production/Sarlui/Diamant presentation of an Edward R. Pressman  production. Producers Caldecott Chubb and Ron Bozman. Director-script  Christopher Monger. Camera Gabriel Beristain. Music Michael Storey. Editor Eva  Gardos. Production design Phil Peters. Costumes Isabelle Van Soest Chubb. With  Shirley MacLaine, Teri Garr, Clancy Brown, Vincent Schiavelli, John Bedford  Lloyd, Colin Baumgartner, Hillary Wolf.  </P> <P> Running time: 1 hour, 34 minutes.  </P> <P> MPAA rating: PG (Some sexual innuendo.).  </P></p>

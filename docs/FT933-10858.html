			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Cross-party unity on unemployment urged MR David Hunt, employment secretary, has called for a national consensus between the main political parties on a strategy for tackling long-term unemployment. Mr Hunt, a standard-bearer of the left in the Tory party, said at the weekend: 'It has now become such an intractable problem that we must find a way of involving people from across the whole political spectrum. If you can get a general agreement, it allows you to move away from stale arguments about resources.' About a third of the 2.9m unemployed have been out of work for more than a year, and the proportion is likely to rise even if unemployment as a whole continues to fall. Mr Hunt said he had received indications from many people 'across the political and industrial spectrum' that they would be ready to work with the government. He would not name individuals, but he has a close rapport with both Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who is chairman of the Commons' social security committee, and Mr John Monks, general secretary-elect of the Trades Union Congress. Mr Hunt has just returned from a short tour of the US, where he was promoting inward investment in the UK and looking at workfare schemes, which require the unemployed to work for their benefit. He said he had 'reservations' about the element of compulsion in such schemes and pointed out that the US has a very different, and generally less generous, benefit system. But he also noted that it was the Democrats, and not the Republicans, who were now considering introducing a national workfare scheme. 'I think President Clinton's friends in the Labour party should take note of that,' he said. Mr Hunt also reached agreement on funding a joint study of how the US economy has produced so many new jobs over the past few years. 'Europe has a lot to learn from the US experience, but it seems that there is no clear idea in the US as to why they have been so successful,' he said. The Labour Party does not share Mr Hunt's enthusiasm for the highly deregulated US labour market, where more than two-thirds of all employees can be fired at will. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's employment spokesman, yesterday said that low employment protection and low wages in Britain had not solved the unemployment problem.</p>

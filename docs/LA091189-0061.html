			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 92-YEAR-OLD ITALIAN BEGINS MT. EVEREST CLIMB  </P> <P> A 92-year-old Italian explorer started to climb Mt. Everest on Sunday, Milan  University said. He is the oldest mountaineer to attempt to scale the world's  highest peak.  </P> <P> Back in 1954, Prof. Ardito Desio was the first to reach the top of the only  slightly lower K-2 mountain in Kashmir, which is 28,250 feet high.  </P> <P> "Every time I come back to city life I want to flee, to find a way out among  simple people," he told colleagues at Milan University before leaving Italy.  </P> <P> The university's secretariat, which was in contact with Desio's base, said he  is leading a 45-person scientific expedition up 29,028-feet Everest.  </P> <P> Asked by the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera whether the climb would not  jeopardize his health, Desio retorted:  </P> <P> "I'm in perfectly good health, and a huge enthusiasm is pushing me on. If the  weather turns bad, no problem -- I'll travel back down again to Katmandu (in  Nepal)."  </P></p>

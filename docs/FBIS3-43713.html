And we have with us this morning Mrs. Patricia de  Lille who is a member of the Executive Committee of that  organization. And we are going to be opening the phone lines  later on and we'll give you the number. Good morning Mrs. de  Lille.    [De Lille] Good morning, David.    [Hall-Green] Many people would say that in the light of the  way that things are going with the break down of apartheid and  the general improvement in our society and the steps that have  been taken, that the PAC is being more militant than necessary.  What would be your answer to that allegation?    [De Lille] Well, if the truth means that we are militant,  then that is correct, because we've always and consistently  propagated the truth to our people. We have not tried to divert  the attention from the main problems facing our country. And if  people say we are militant because of that it's because we  propagate the truth.    [Hall-Green] But what I'm saying is that you are said to be  more militant than is actually necessary, the steps that you're  taking.    [De Lille] Well, you know I don't know how they measure it,  what criteria they use to say that we are more militant. But I  accept that there is a perception that the PAC is more militant.  This is being created by the media, by the electronic media, the  printed media and so on. Our members, because they are young  and vibrant, and because they are angry, they are frustrated,  the only way of showing their feelings is by action, because  they've got no democratically elected representatives in  Parliament that they can use to air their grievances.    [Hinds]Patricia, on that note, what is your view about  the violence taking place in the townships? How do you feel  about it?    [De Lille]Every person who gets killed today in our  country, every person who dies at the hands of violence -- it is  unacceptable to the PAC. We feel that not enough is being done  to end the violence. The time has come to stop pointing fingers  as to who is responsible for the violence. We must say the  violence must stop. At the moment one organization blames the  other and that has been the trend over the last three years.    [Hall-Green] What about attacks such as that on the  Heidelberg tavern in Cape Town?    [De Lille] The Heidelberg attack in Cape Town -- the police  are still busy with their investigations, thereafter I suppose  they will charge people. After they have charged them  officially they will then have to appear in a court of law, and  it's only then that we can comment and say who is responsible  and who is guilty in that particular case. At the moment it's  all sub judice and investigations are still going on.    [Hall-Green] Does the PAC disassociate themselves entirely  from that attack on the Heidelberg?    [De Lille] The PAC, our deputy president Johnson Mlambo, has  disassociated the PAC from the attack on New Year's Eve. I  personally had condemned all violence throughout the country  irrespective of whether it's in Cape Town, in Natal, or in the  PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area.    [Hall-Green] What about control or not controlling the  military wing APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army]?    [De Lille] That is more than a question of controlling or  not  controlling, that is again something that's being... [pauses] a  perception which is being carried in the media. We have no  control over APLA. APLA is the military wing of the PAC. They  are accountable to the mother body, the PAC as much as the  political leadership of the PAC is accountable to the mother  body.    [Hinds]You mentioned just now that violence is  unacceptable, but has the PAC ever adopted that view and  discouraged violence in the black townships?    [De Lille] The PAC is not involved in the internecine  violence in our townships. The PAC has in the past, and we are  still trying to act as a mediator between the various parties.  I challenge anybody in the country to point out where the PAC  is actually responsible for violence within the townships. The  violence itself is not acceptable to all of us in the country.  If there are other means of achieving your political objectives  that should have first priority before thinking of taking up a  gun, being intolerant and eliminate your political opponent.    [Hall-Green] We're going to open the phone line. If you  would like to phone in with a specific question for Mrs.  Patricia de Lille please do so from now, and the telephone  number is the same from wherever you are phoning in the country.  [passage omitted]    [Hall-Green] Mrs. de Lille, what's the story now with  Tanzania? We read that the Tanzanian Government are banning any  political activity of the PAC in exile in Tanzania. What is  actually the story. There seems to be quite a bit of  contradiction in the reports.    [De Lille] Well, as far as I know, David, that we did  receive  a note from the Tanzanian Government. This is a diplomatic  issue which we want to confirm that we did receive such a  letter, and the PAC will attend to that in due course.    [Hall-Green] But does it seem likely that it's going to  severely curtail the operations of the organization?    [De Lille] I must first of all say the Tanzanian Government  is one of the few governments in the continent which has always  shone out amongst the others as far as assistance and support  for the liberation movements are concerned. It's very unlikely  that they will just all of a sudden stop that support for the  liberation movements. So once we have more clarity about the  content of the letter the PAC will respond.    [Hall-Green] As we move further and further into the  so-called new South Africa, it would seem that physical monetary  support -- financial support -- for the PAC is diminishing. Is  this going to mean that the organization is going to have to  change its identity from that of a liberation organization to  become more of a conventional political party in order to  survive?    [De Lille] Let me first say that we've never in the PAC  relied solely on international funding...    [Hall-Green, interrupting] But you've had considerable  support.    [De Lille] Yes, we've had support from them, but at the same  time we've also cultivated a culture of self-reliance among our  people. So we are quite well placed to continue with our self-  reliance program. It will most probably affect the PAC  adversely to an extent only. As far as the question whether we  are going to contest the election as a liberation movement or as  a political party, we have to register as a political party to  contest the elections, and we will do so very, very soon.    [Hinds] We have our first caller on the line. It's Joe from  Cape Town. Good morning.    [Joe] Good morning lady, good morning Mrs. de Lille. I would  just like to ask one question. Why is it that the media is  making a fuss of the Heidelberg tavern, and let's go back  quickly to the Amy Biehl case. They made a fuss about the Amy  Biehl case when they, the regime -- the illegitimate regime --  have killed a 13-year-old boy, Sam Siphuwo, in Guguletu the  world did not cry out. If you can just tell me why is it that  the media don't see the one side of the story, but they see the  other side of the story?    [De Lille] I think partly that question needs to be put to  the media, but I must agree with you that there is a hypocrisy  in the way of response by the media on various issues. And I  hope that now that we are moving to a free and fair election, we  are moving to a stage whereby we want to level the playing  fields effectively amongst the political parties. So this kind  of reaction by the media must come to an end. But the question  is best put to the media themselves.    [Hall-Green] And the next caller Robbie Roberts. Good  morning to you, Sir.    [Roberts] My question to Patricia de Lille is would she be  willing to go to the United States and tell the Americans that  they must give all land back to the Indians, and do the same in  Australia, go to Australia and tell them they must give the land  back to the aborigines, and in all other places that were  colonized a couple of hundred centuries ago, because she's often  said that all land must be given back to the blacks. First of  all, the land never belonged to them -- there was nobody here.  And I would just like to know if she would be willing to go and  campaign for those kind of things to happen in America and  Australia and if that happens. I'm sure the whites here won't  mind giving all the land back.    [De Lille] Mr. Roberts, I think you have to study your  history books, and history books not written by the African  people of this country but by people who came here in 1652.  This country has been colonized, that is a fact of life.  There's nobody that can dispute it. And what we've  consistently said in the PAC was to call for the return of the  land to the original owners. There's no such thing that there  was nobody. When Jan van Riebeeck first put foot here on this  continent, he was received very well. In fact, his whole boat  was supplied with fresh produce and he could sail further. So  for you to say there was nobody here is absolutely incorrect.  I'll advise you to study your history books written by the  people of this country. Thank you. [passage omitted]    [Hall-Green] Mrs. de Lille, before our next question comes  through, let's just get further clarification on this business  of APLA. I think many people find it very difficult to believe  that the military wing of an organization can operate apparently  independently and with absolute impunity and not be controlled  by the mother organization.    [De Lille] No David, that is not correct. I know it's a  perception, and I want to deal with those perceptions. It is  not correct to say that. The PAC as early as June of 1993 has  accepted the principle of mutual cessation of hostilities. You  must understand that if you are in a war situation there must be  two parties involved. We have then said further that we are  prepared to discuss the implementation of that principle, and  that agreement that we have with the regime. And at the moment  that meetings [as heard] cannot take place because for one  reason or the other they find some excuses not to meet with the  PAC. And we went further to say that while the talks are in  progress then we will place a moratorium so there won't be  attacks from both sides. But we are not making war against  ourselves. The war out there is between two parties, and I  think that the other side of the parties that are involved in  the war -- they are not looked at. They have been responsible  for, I mean [changes thought]. The security forces in this  country have been responsible for many killings. We have lost  more than 10,000 African people since 1990.    [Hall-Green] But now are you going to be prepared to say  right now as you sit there that the PAC at this stage does not  know whether or not the St. James Church massacre or the  Heidelberg tavern were perpetrated by people belonging to APLA?    [De Lille] It is not only the PAC that did not know. It is  the whole country.    [Hall-Green] You're saying you don't know. The PAC does not  know?    [De Lille, interrupting] The whole country, David, until  such  time a person has been charged and tried in a court of law, then  we can for sure say. At the moment the police are still busy  with investigations in the St. James attack, the Heidelberg  attack and they must still conclude their investigation.    [Hall-Green] So you don't know whether those were your  people  or not?    [De Lille] We don't know if our people are guilty, but we do  know that certain people have been arrested as suspects in this  case and they are members of the PAC. [passage omitted]    [Hinds]Regarding the forthcoming election in April,  where does the PAC stand regarding participation?    [De Lille]The PAC's congress recently in Umtata in  December last year decided that the PAC is to take part in the  election, and we are busy preparing for that.    [Hinds]Let's talk to (Philip Mphahlela) of  Johannesburg.Please go ahead.    [Mphahlela] I would like to ask De Lille why [pauses] When  they started the story they said that the PAC is too militant.  Really, most of the people are disappointed because after they  killed that school girl in Guguletu or Khayelitsha there was  toyi-toying [protest dancing] at court every now and then. Is  it not to the disappointment of most of the people when this  happened? Why couldn't they apologize to the family publicly  because it is the young PAC's who have done this. Thank you.    [De Lille] Again Philip, your information is not correct.  Again your information is based on what has been so far  projected in the media. Legal investigations are still even  continuing as far as that is concerned. Nobody so far has been  found guilty and sentenced for the particular crimes you are  referring to. So it is premature to say that we are responsible  for those attacks. Thank you.    [Hall-Green] Is this not another indication of ignorance of  what certain elements operating under the banner of the PAC are  actually up to?    [De Lille] It's deliberate ignorance on the part of those  who  want to discredit the PAC. It's a deliberate attempt on the  part of those people who want to demonize the PAC. As far as we  are concerned there is no deliberate attempt by the PAC to say  look, we are not responsible or we are responsible. It is other  people who have a problem. We don't have a problem.    [Hall-Green] You have a problem of bad publicity at the  moment, rightly or wrongly, and whoever is generating this, you  allege that the media are reporting inaccurately and that there  is some kind of campaign, but you do have the problem of bad  publicity. You have a bad press.    [De Lille] Well, the PAC, David, you must understand, has  not  been built by the media and we will not be destroyed by the  media. But people that we represent are the 75 percent  functionately [as heard] illiterate people in this country who  don't even have access to a newspaper, who don't even have  access to a TV, and they hardly come to hear about all these bad  things they are saying about the PAC. Of course the liberal  press have got their own interest. They must print news that  their backers would like to see in the newspapers, and we can't  intervene. They still have the right to print what they want to  print. [Hinds] (Bongani Linde) from Orlando east. [Linde]  Good morning. I would like to speak to the lady from the PAC.    [Hinds] Please go ahead.    [Linde] I'm not a member of the PAC, but I would like to say  to you Madam, all the African people here are behind you. We  are definitely supporting the PAC, but the only thing we are  totally opposed is bloodshed which we do not know as yet whether  it comes from the PAC leadership. But all I would like to say  is continue with the struggle, take it forward, and please stop  theorizing a lot and start becoming practical and getting  straight to the people on the ground and mobilizing us. Thank  you.    [De Lille] Thank you Bongani.    [Hinds] It seems like the violence is an issue all over.  Would you be addressing that pertinently?    [De Lille] As I've said in the past, we've made attempts and  we are still making attempts. Our members are caught in the  cross fire of the internecine violence between Inkatha and the  ANC in the townships and in Natal. We have on several occasions  offered our services, our good officers, of our president to  mediate between the two parties. We only received a favorable  response from Inkatha and we are still pursuing that, although  the ANC has turned our offer down for our president to mediate.    [Hall-Green] Why do you think they have turned your offer  down?    [De Lille] They have accused us of being opportunists. I  don't think you can be opportunist if you're concerned about the  dying and the killing of African people, and they have never  really come out with a clear answer except to say we are  opportunists.    [Hall-Green] Next caller on the line is Brenda Wardle from  Sandown in the Transvaal -- in Sandton. Good morning Brenda.    [Wardle] Good morning. Patricia, don't APLA, your armed  wing, embark on these violent attacks now -- here I'm referring  to those for which they are responsible -- as a means of  struggle or actually as a token of disrespect for human lives.  Now I ask this because of the toyi-toying [protest dancing]  that took place outside the courtroom during the Amy Biehl  murder trial, and does the PAC actually realize that there are  some blacks who want to mislead our people into deeper  oppression, for example the Buthelezis and some white people who  are genuinely devoted to the struggle for example, the Joe  Slovos of this world. South Africa is basically not just  divided into good blacks and bad settlers, and I hope that you  people will realize that. Thank you very much.    [De Lille] Brenda, may I just say that if you know the  history of the PAC and the history of the liberation movement,  in the early 60's when there were no other channels open for  them to pursue a peaceful change in this country, out of  desperation and out of concern of getting the liberation and the  freedom of our people, the movements resorted to the armed  struggle. We in the PAC has [as heard] always believed that  there's no ways that anybody can dictate to us what methods to  use to free ourselves. The desperation and the dying and the  maiming of our people calls for anything that, you know, you can  use to free our people. We have, as the PAC, accepted the line  of negotiations and we've not said that negotiations will be the  only form of struggle that will bring liberation to this  country. We've not made a revolution at the World Trade Center.  But rather the various forms of struggle complement each other,  and when they realize that there is a possibility that we might  overthrow the existing regime through the ballot box, we then  agreed to mutual cessation of hostilities early in June already.  Thank you.    [Hinds]From Bloemfontein, another caller. Mrs. Blom,  good morning.    [Blom]Good morning. I have a question for Mrs. de  Lille. I remember a meeting she had with Dr. Allan Boesak in  the Cape where she said among others: The white people have  taken our country. Now we are just wondering, could she tell us  what her origins are. Is she not also, in quotation marks, a  settler? Thank you very much.    [De Lille]What I said in Cape Town was quite correct,  but all I can tell you is that I am a example of colonialism  because my surname is of French origin, but if no French had  come to this country then where does the surname come from?  Many of our people have German surnames, have Spanish surnames.  Now where do those surnames come from? It is proof that at one  stage or another in our history there were people who did not  have their roots in Africa. Thank you.    [Hall-Green] You know, I think that many people's obvious  question in their minds and on their lips sitting at home  watching this right now is: If it were not for the so-called  settlers, that large general grouping that you make, what would  have become of this country? Would this country be the country  that it is today? Is it not to all of our advantage ultimately  in the long run that there were settlers, that there was the  know-how brought in from the northern hemisphere to create the  South Africa of today? We certainly wouldn't have been here  today had it not been for settlers.    [De Lille] I totally disagree with you David on this one.  After all the people who used their hands, the workers of this  land, it is them who are responsible for building up this  country, it is them who...    [Hall-Green, interrupting] In conjunction surely with the  settlers.    [De Lille] In conjunction, but in most cases they were in a  supervising position. Even today just go down the street and  you find a white person sitting in a truck, just sitting the  whole day, and you find eight or nine African people slaving it  away. But at the end of the day the rewards for the African  people and the rewards for the white person who is sitting the  whole day -- the contrast, the difference is so big. So it's  incorrect to say that you can come with your knowledge, but if  you came with knowledge, you still had to have programs and you  still had to have hands for the programs to be implemented. So  it's not fair to say that because you came with knowledge, it's  because of the knowledge.    [Hinds]But that's a situation which is fast changing  surely. Do you admit that?    [De Lille] I cannot. The changes you refer to [pauses] the  people who we represent, to them changes mean having a house, a  roof over their heads, that they have access to job  opportunities, and so on. And the so-called changes that you  are referring to are at the moment -- they are not being felt by  the ordinary person in the street. We are still looking for the  so- called new South Africa. We do not know where it is. We  are trying to find it. We are still looking for the cemetery  where they bury apartheid and you cannot find it. I am talking  on behalf of the ordinary man and woman in the street, the  so-called changes we still have to see. [passage omitted]    [Hall-Green] That's about it for this particular discussion,  and we say our thanks to Patricia de Lille. Before you go, I  want to ask you please once more to answer us a yes or no answer  regarding the knowledge that the PAC has of the actions of APLA.  Can you say that you do not know that APLA is in fact operating  completely independently of the mother organization?    [De Lille] Let me say David, I'm under no obligation to say  yes or no because the answer is not that simple. I was at pains  earlier on to explain what is the situation. It seems then that  you have accepted like many other people in the country a trial  in the media. We've been sentenced and found guilty...    [Hall-Green, interrupting] Personally I have a totally open  mind on this, that's why I asked you the question.    [De Lille] You know, it's not as simple like that. I'm under  no obligation to answer that, thank you.    [Hall-Green] Thank you Patricia de Lille, thank you for  being  with us this morning.</p>

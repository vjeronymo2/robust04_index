			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Obtaining Further Employment Authorization <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With Salvadoran DED ending,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ABC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  class members may obtain further employment authorization based on a ``pending'' asylum application. Special procedures apply to class members who seek work authorization under the agreement. Class members seeking employment authorization must identify themselves as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ABC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  class members. They must have an asylum application on file or must file a completed asylum application (Form I&hyph;589) with Form I&hyph;765, Application for Employment Authorization. Eligible class members who apply for employment authorization under this agreement are not subject to the ``non-frivolous'' standard required under 8 CFR 208.7(a). Form I&hyph;765, with or without an asylum application as appropriate, must be filed directly with the service center having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence for asylum-related applications. However, if the original asylum application was filed with an immigration judge in exclusion or deportation proceedings, applications for employment authorization and asylum should be filed at the appropriate local INS office until directed otherwise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class members generally must pay the employment authorization application fee, currently seventy dollars ($70). However, when an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> initial <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  application for employment authorization is filed based on an asylum application which is found to satisfy the non-frivolous test, such an initial employment authorization application can be filed and approved without payment of the filing fee under the general asylum regulations now in effect. Also, eligible class members who can demonstrate that they fall within the poverty guidelines at 45 CFR 1060.2 will not be required to pay the fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, new asylum applications are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> required <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  only from those who have  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> never <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  filed for asylum before. All other class members may choose to rely on any asylum application filed previously. Class members may supplement a previously filed or newly filed asylum officer. Applicants who must have continuous documentation of employment authorization should apply as early as possible with the appropriate service center or local office. It is not necessary to wait until the planned  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ABC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices are sent or until the class member's individual  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ABC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice is received. Such an application for employment authorization must be based on an asylum application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Doris Meissner, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30088 Filed 12&hyph;2&hyph;94; 1:17 pm] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;10&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

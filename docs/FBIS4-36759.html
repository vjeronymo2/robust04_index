			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Shim'on Schiffer] </F>   [Excerpts] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has asked Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to grant financial aid to the Palestinian  autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, which is in dire  economic straits.    This request is included in one of 'Arafat's three letters  to  Rabin.    Officials in the prime minister's bureau have said that in  consultations held on the formulation of a reply to 'Arafat's  missives, Rabin ruled that Israel cannot help the PLO, either  directly or indirectly.    A senior political source said yesterday that at a time when  Israel lacks the necessary funds to help the Histadrut labor  federation's sick fund, it cannot show generosity toward the  PLO. At the same time, Rabin intends to formulate his reply in a  positive spirit. [passage omitted]    In the letters 'Arafat sent to Rabin, the PLO chairman  proposes, among other things, to begin discussions as soon as  possible on the early empowerment of the autonomy institutions  throughout the rest of the West Bank. Rabin intends to accede  to this request, and contacts will soon be held between PLO  officials and Israeli political figures in a bid to organize  talks on this issue.    As reported yesterday in YEDI'OT AHARONOT, 'Arafat proposed  that he and Rabin speak directly to one another and stressed the  importance of establishing a "hot line" between them.    'Arafat also demanded that Rabin reaffirm Israel's  commitment  to preserve the status of Palestinian institutions in East  Jerusalem. [passage omitted]</p>

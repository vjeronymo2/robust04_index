			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Guardian of tradition: A battle for Britain's oldest Sunday title Few conspiracies succeed in the newspaper industry. Those involved cannot help gossiping or boasting, the scheme leaks and is stifled before birth. But a conspiracy involving a small number of senior journalists at the Observer may have played a significant part in saving the paper, by steering its idiosyncratic proprietor Mr Tiny Rowland, joint chief executive of Lonrho, away from the embrace of Mr Andreas Whittam Smith of The Independent and The Independent on Sunday and into the arms of The Guardian. The group of journalists, fearful that the paper could be merged with The Independent on Sunday, and lose its separate identity, have been talking secretly to Guardian executives for many months. Twice last year, in May and October, there were handshake agreements on a sale to The Guardian, apparently with the knowledge and acquiescence of Mr Rowland. On both occasions Tiny changed his mind and the deal was off. The group moved fast last week when it looked as if Newspaper Publishing, publisher of The Independent and its Sunday sister, was getting close to a possible deal. Unlike The Guardian, it was able to offer a slice of equity as well as cash. A deliberately exaggerated version of events was leaked to the Evening Standard, which led its front page with the story last Friday, saying the Observer was in its death throes and that a sale to The Independent was close. Members of parliament were encouraged by Observer journalists to join the debate last weekend, condemning any deal which would involve Britain's oldest Sunday newspaper disappearing after nearly 202 years. The Financial Times inadvertently played a role in the outcome. Mr Rowland, it is believed, was furious after three executives from The Independent were allowed into the FT printing plant last Saturday to see the Observer being printed. The Observer is printed under a contract on the FT's presses in London's Docklands which runs until January 1995. But perhaps the most telling weapon used by Observer journalists was a letter to Mr Rowland thanking him for all his efforts to sustain the paper through its years of losses, but asking whether he wanted to go down in history as the man who killed the Observer. It seems to have hit its target. Although Mr Rowland no longer had the power or even perhaps the dermination to prevent other Lonrho shareholders, such as Mr Dieter Bock, pushing ahead with a sale, he did have the influence to help determine who the buyer should be. Mr Bock is joint chief executive of Lonrho and its largest shareholder. Newspaper Publishing was told early yesterday that negotiations had been broken off and that there would be an announcement later in the day. Talks between Newspaper Publishing had failed to reach agreement on Wednesday. Mr Whittam Smith said yesterday that he had never intended to close down the Observer. There would have been, he insisted, a 'genuine union' involving the staffs of both newspapers. However, Mr Donald Trelford, editor of the Observer for 18 years, was applauded when he told his journalists at 10.30am yesterday that Lonrho had received an offer from The Guardian and Manchester Evening News 'which it finds acceptable'. The offer, in effect an agreement subject to contract, will be put to the Observer board on Tuesday and is likely to be accepted. Neither side would disclose the terms, but it is believed to be worth about Pounds 25m. The deal is bad news for Newspaper Publishing. A merger could have created a 'non-right-wing' title with a circulation of about 750,000 which not only would have been profitable but which might have challenged the dominance of The Sunday Times for the first time in many years. Newspaper Publishing yesterday announced pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 341,000 for the six months to March. It believes if it can be profitable in a recession it can do even better in a recovery. A Guardian-owned Observer is likely to increase competition in the broadsheet Sunday market, which has been static or gently declining over the past few years. Few details of the new Observer could be confirmed yesterday, although Mr Peter Preston, Guardian editor, told his staff that the paper would have a 'more distinct voice' than that of being merely The Guardian on Sunday. Observer staff believe The Guardian will take on 60 to 65 of its 80 journalists and that there will continue to be a separate advertising department. The key question now is whether there is room for four broadsheet Sunday newspapers. Senior Newspaper Publishing executives believe there is, particularly now the market has been rising for the past two months. Mr Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times with a circulation of up to 1.26m in recent weeks, says the battle between the Observer and The Independent on Sunday has to be resolved before he faces a significant challenge. In a reference to Scottish football teams, Mr Neil said yesterday: 'Brechin City have to play Raith Rovers for the right to play Glasgow Rangers.' The Sunday Times editor says he has many plans, including publication of the Thatcher memoirs, to make his paper more impregnable before any big circulation assault comes. Newspaper consultant Mr Harold Lind said yesterday he was surprised that The Guardian had not decided to wait until an Independent-Lonrho deal was turned down by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Then, Mr Lind said, the Observer could have been picked up for a knockdown price. Competition between the Observer and The Independent on Sunday was now going to be like the western front during the first world war. 'One more push and we'll win by Christmas is their hope. Let's see which Christmas,' Mr Lind said. But in the Observer's Marco Polo building in Battersea last night there were many happy journalists - some prepared to pay tribute to Mr Trelford for keeping many of the Observer traditions alive; above all for keeping the paper alive until it could find a new home.</p>

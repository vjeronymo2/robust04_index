			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Sharp jump in M4 hints at improved confidence A sharp jump in bank lending and in M4, the government's broadest measure of the money supply, yesterday gave a tentative indication that companies and consumers may have become sufficiently confident to start borrowing in earnest. According to the Bank of England, M4 rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent between October and November. In the 12 months to November M4 increased 4.5 per cent, up from an annual rate of 3.9 per cent in October but still well within the government's monitoring range of 3 per cent to 9 per cent. Part of the rise in M4 came from a higher-than-expected public sector borrowing requirement in November. There was also a jump in sterling lending to the M4 private sector, which consists of UK residents other than banks, building societies and the public sector. Such lending was Pounds 4.5bn, compared with Pounds 1.8bn in October. This figure was surprisingly strong and seemed to indicated a surge in lending by foreign banks. Figures from the British Bankers' Association, which cover lending by the main British banking groups, showed a rise in sterling lending to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 1.14bn in November from Pounds 633m in October. Even allowing for lending by building societies, that means about Pounds 2bn of lending by other, mainly foreign, banks. Mr Tim Sweeney, director-general of the BBA, pointed out that consumers had increased their borrowing by nearly Pounds 1bn in the past six months, compared with less than Pounds 100m in the previous half year. He said: 'Although this might reflect growing consumer confidence the turnround coincides with the initial impact of increased fiscal tightening and may represent an increased need to borrow.' The Bank of England revised its estimate of annual growth in M0, the narrow measure of money supply, from 7.1 per cent to 7 per cent.</p>

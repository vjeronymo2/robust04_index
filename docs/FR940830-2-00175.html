In these watersheds, sediment serves as a contaminant reservoir from which fish and bottom dwelling organisms can accumulate toxic compounds and pass them up the food chain. Sediment contaminants can be passed to larger fish, birds, and mammals until they accumulate to levels that may be toxic to humans. Toxic chemicals in sediment come from discharges of industrial waste and sewage; stormwater runoff from waste dumps, city streets and farms, and air pollutants contained in rainwater. The magnitude of the toxics problem in the United States is evidenced in more than 1,200 State advisories that have been issued against consuming fish that have accumulated toxic bioaccumulative contaminants from sediment and other sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More than ten Federal statutes provide authority to many EPA program offices to address the problem of contaminated sediment. This has resulted in fragmented, and in some cases duplicative, efforts to complete the necessary research, technology development, and pollution control activities required to effectively manage contaminated sediment. Often it has been difficult for EPA programs to agree upon the fundamental question of whether sediment at a particular site poses ecological or human health risks. EPA's proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy was developed to streamline decision-making within and among the Agency's program offices by promoting and ensuring: the use of consistent sediment assessment practices, consistent consideration of risks posed by contaminated sediment, the use of consistent approaches to management of contaminated sediment risks, and the wise use of scarce resources for research and technology development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Goals of the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy describes actions that the Agency will take to accomplish the following four strategic goals: (1) Prevent further sediment contamination that may cause unacceptable ecological or human health risks; (2) When practical, clean up existing sediment contamination that adversely affects the Nation's waterbodies or their uses, or that causes other significant effects on human health or the environment; (3) Ensure that sediment dredging and dredged material disposal continue to be managed in an environmentally sound manner; (4) develop and consistently apply methodologies for analyzing contaminated sediments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> What the Strategy Does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy is comprised of six component sections: assessment, prevention, remediation, dredged material management, research, and outreach. In each section, EPA describes actions that the Agency will take to accomplish the four broad strategic goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

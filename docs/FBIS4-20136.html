			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["hig"-signed report: "Convincing People by Creating Jobs"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 26 Apr -- The European trade unions are  calling for a public and private investment program in Europe to  curb unemployment. At the same time, an active labor market  policy should open up new opportunities -- particularly through  qualification programs. This was demanded by the chairman of  the metal workers trade union, Klaus Zwickel, at an employment  forum in Bonn, which was jointly organized by the European  Commission, the German Trade Union Federation, and the  Hans-Boeckler Foundation. "Europe must convince people by  creating jobs," Zwickel demanded. This is the best publicity for  the European Union [EU]. Currently, there are 20 million  unemployed [11 percent] in the EU.    Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission,  used the event to emphatically support the Commission's  proposals for the promotion of employment (white paper). The  white paper is no attempt to change the balance of power in  Europe, Delors stressed. Brussels does not want any additional  authority. He warned against relaxing efforts to eliminate the  structural causes of unemployment in view of the economic  recovery. Delors called for a reversal of the logic of the  current employment policy: Active expenditure promoting  employment must be given priority. Unemployment benefits must  only be granted as a last resort by the employment offices.  According to Delors, new jobs will primarily be created in the  sphere of social services, in the leisure and environmental  industry, and in the media. However, these must not be "jobs a  la McDonald," Zwickel demanded. The creation of future-oriented  jobs in the industry and services on the basis of social  benefits must be promoted. The reduction of unemployment must  not be achieved through further deregulation and by cutting  wages, as planned by Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt.  Zwickel also criticized "obvious deficits" concerning the  social laws of the EU. Hardly any progress has been achieved in  the collective representation of the employees. He expressed  the hope that the Commission, the Council, and the European  Parliament will not make it easier for the employers at the  European level to prevent social regulations as is the case at  the national level. The employment target must be clearly  stipulated in the economic policy of the EU. So far, neither  the instruments nor the institutions for an active European  employment policy exist. The commission's white paper is merely  an initial step to fill the dangerous gap in the employment  policy.    Delors promised that he will try to ensure that the trade  unions are granted adequate representation in the EU. This is  necessary for Europe's social cohesion. It is important for the  social partners to prove soon that they are responsible partners  without whose cooperation nothing can be achieved. There can be  no economic development without a social dimension, he stressed.</p>

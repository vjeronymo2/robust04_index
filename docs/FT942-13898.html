			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Helical Bar net assets increase 81% Helical Bar, the property investment and development company run by Mr Michael Slade, yesterday announced an 81 per cent increase in net assets and a Pounds 110m property development programme. The asset valuation of 299p a share, fully diluted, exceeded brokers' expectations, and the shares rose 17p to 348p. Pre-tax profits for the year to January 31 rose 12 per cent to Pounds 6.58m (Pounds 5.88m), although this reflected the Pounds 7.2m fall in interest payments, from lower interest rates and the reduction of debt, due to a Pounds 20m convertible preference share issue. Net borrowings amounted to Pounds 80m at the year end, representing gearing of 95 per cent. Profits after tax and preference dividends fell to Pounds 4.39m (Pounds 4.73m), but a recommended final dividend of 3.3p makes an increased total of 5.8p (4.8p) for the year. After three years of disposals and the write-down of property valuations, Helical moved back into the property market last spring, and invested Pounds 60m in properties and development sites during the year. The company upwardly revalued its investment portfolio by Pounds 14m, after suffering Pounds 3.3m in write-downs in 1992-93. It also carries an estimated Pounds 3m surplus on its trading properties, but this is not included in its asset valuation. Helical's overall strategy is to achieve rental income comfortably above interest and administration costs, and add spice through its development and trading activities. In 1993-94, these costs amounted to Pounds 7.4m, compared with gross rental profits of Pounds 12.1m.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News in Brief: Amcoal WEAKER export markets caused earnings at Amcoal, the coal arm of the Anglo American group, to fall slightly to R121.8m (Dollars 36.16m), from R122.7m previously, in the six months to the end of September 1993, writes Philip Gawith. Sales rose to 22.85m tonnes from 20.74m in the same period in 1992, due to higher exports and increased sales to the electricity utility Escom. Earnings per share before abnormal items fell to 484 cents from 487 cents and the dividend was maintained at 150 cents.</p>

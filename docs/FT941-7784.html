			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Thorn US cleared of improper practices Thorn EMI was largely cleared yesterday of improper practices at its American rental subsidiary in an investigation carried out by former US Senator Warren Rudman. Mr Rudman said that although some of the allegations in a Wall Street Journal article last September were true, they were unrepresentative. The vast majority of customers of the Rent-A-Center subsidiary were satisfied with their treatment. 'We are sure that some misconduct occurs, but it is pretty isolated, it's not pervasive and it's not company policy,' Mr Rudman said. He had made some recommendations to the company on improving its training. Mr Rudman said it was true, as alleged in the article, that a Rent-A-Center franchisee entered a customer's home with former Hell's Angels. The same franchisee, who had now left the company, had put superglue on customers' locks. An allegation that a late-paying customer had been forced into a van and made to carry heavy goods was incorrect. The customer was a friend of the employee and had helped him voluntarily, although this was against company rules. Mr Rudman said he had found no evidence of employees demanding sexual favours from customers, as alleged. He found 91 per cent of customers said they were treated with respect. Of those whose payments were late, 91 per cent said the company tried to help them find a solution. Mr Rudman said he had recommended the company improve its procedures in three ways, although he stressed that abuses were not widespread. It should strengthen its rules preventing employees from entering customers' homes where no adult was present. Employees needed better training on liability damage waiver agreements. These allow customers to stop payment if goods are stolen or damaged but, unlike insurance, do not provide for their replacement. He said a small number of employees were selling waiver agreements as insurance. Some customers thought they were receiving new goods when they were getting used products. The company needed to provide clearer explanations, he said. Details and results, Page 24</p>

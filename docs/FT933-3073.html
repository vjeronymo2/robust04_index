			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Delta plunges Shares of electrical engineering company Delta plunged as brokers cut full-year profits expectations after the group announced interim figures well below market forecasts. The stock lost 8 per cent of its value, finishing 43 down at 511p, after the company reported a 6 per cent decline in profits to Pounds 29.1m. The figures were accompanied by a gloomy chairman's statement, in which he warned that 'the UK recovery as far as manufacturing is concerned remains more anaemic than many observers suggest, and activity in continental Europe has yet to see the benefit of progressive interest-rate reductions'. Analysts downgraded full-year profits forecasts and the range is now Pounds 60m to Pounds 62m, having been Pounds 68m to Pounds 70m.</p>

This was revealed by Army  General Abilio Kamalata Numa, chief of the general staff of the  northern front, in an interview with the Voice of the Resistance  of the Black Cockerel and TERRA ANGOLANA newspaper. According  to Genertal Numa, Luanda is carrying out a full military  offensive, totally disrespecting the Lusaka peace talks. It  wants to capture positions under the control of the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in the  provinces of Zaire, Uige, Bengo, and Cuanza Norte.    General Numa said the Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] relies on the assistance of  mercenaries from different nationalities, including Portuguese  marines stationed in Cabinda Province. He said MPLA-PT warships  cruise along the Cabinda-Luanda corridor weekly, carrying lethal  materiel.    However, Commander Kamalata Numa reaffirmed UNITA's desire  to  continue to find peace through dialogue, but stressed that the  Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola will henceforth not  tolerate any kind of provocation. He said UNITA was carrying  out all kinds of defensive measures to defend the strategic city  of Soyo. In conclusion, General Numa stressed that UNITA will  not be held responsible for damage to oil installations in the  event of an attack on Soyo.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Hungary places 51% of plastics processor HUNGARY'S State Property Agency yesterday announced that it had placed 51 per cent of Pannonplast, the state-owned plastics processor, with UK and US investors. Details of the transaction were not disclosed by the privatisation agency, but the purchasers are believed to include emerging markets funds. The placement, arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank, clears the way for another tranche to be offered to the public and floated on the Budapest Stock Exchange next year. Some of the shares will be offered on concessionary terms under the small investor share-buying programme decided upon last week by the Hungarian cabinet. Pannonplast was among eight companies named as candidates for the first wave of sales from next January under the new privatisation scheme. Over five years, Hungary's conservative government intends to sell state shareholdings worth Ft100bn (Dollars 1.03bn) in 70 companies on concessionary terms to small investors in an effort to broaden share ownership and privatisation. Every adult Hungarian paying a Ft2,000 entrance fee will be entitled to a Ft100,000 interest-free credit facility which can be used to subscribe to the public offerings. The Pannonplast announcement comes three years after the company's privatisation was originally announced as part of Hungary's failed first privatisation programme. An IPO scheduled for July 1991 had to be postponed because of the rapid deterioration of the economy following the collapse of the Comecon east European trading bloc. The SPA said that a subsequent restructuring had reduced debt levels and improved operating profitability, allowing the current private placement. A recent revival in the Budapest stock market has also improved the investment environment.</p>

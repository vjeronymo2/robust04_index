			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: British Gas in joint venture with Tenneco BRITISH GAS has agreed with Tenneco Gas, the gas arm of the US industrial company, to develop joint gas transport projects in South America, writes Deborah Hargreaves. The agreement follows the company's move last week to set up a new subsidiary, British Gas Sudamerica, to provide services to the gas, water, telecommunications and electricity companies in South America. Mr Mike Fulwood, British Gas general manager for the US and Latin America, said the companies were looking at a number of opportunities. Last December a consortium headed by British Gas won a controlling share in MetroGas, the distribution company in Argentina. The company is hoping to use its experience in MetroGas as a base for moving into other gas projects. British Gas said it would drill its first well in the Black Sea in July after it won licences to explore for oil and gas in Bulgaria.</p>

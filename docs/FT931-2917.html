			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Support for Control refinancing SHAREHOLDERS in Control Securities, the property and leisure group in refinancing talks with its banks, creditors and bondholders, yesterday gave the board unanimous support to continue negotiations. At a special meeting called to consider what steps to take to rectify a fall in net assets, Mr Sydney Robin, chairman, told shareholders that if they did not support the board the company's creditors and lenders were unlikely to continue to do so. Asked what the group's chances of survival were, Mr Robin said that a few weeks ago he had thought them to be 60:40 against but now felt they had swung to 60:40 in favour. Mr John Kerslake, finance director, said 'it is evenly balanced but we remain cautiously optimistic'. Mr Robin told shareholders that the group was looking carefully at its public house estate and planned to sell those which were 'not relevant to the company's future'. The Belhaven Brewery could also be sold if an offer in the best interests of shareholders was received. Mr Kerslake said that sale memoranda were being prepared on a number of the assets. The timetable for completion of the refinancing was still unclear. However, Mr Robin said that the property valuation carried out as at December 31 1992 had been prepared for the purposes of producing listing particulars for a relisting of the shares, which have been suspended since October 1991. This valuation would only be good for that purpose until June 30, so the company aimed to complete the restructuring before then.</p>

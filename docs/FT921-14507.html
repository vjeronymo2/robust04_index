			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Barbour Index rides the recession with 5% rise THE recession in the construction industry has failed to dent profits growth at Barbour Index, the specialist information supplier. On turnover ahead from Pounds 6.94m to Pounds 7.17m, the pre-tax line for the half year to end-October rose some 5 per cent to Pounds 2.78m (Pounds 2.66m). The shares rose 12p to 191p. 'The recession is still with us, it just means we have to work a lot harder and be a good deal smarter' said Mr Jack Dunn, appointed chief executive in a revamped management structure. This has seen the group split from two to four operating divisions: the renowned and weighty compendium - 'you could build buildings with it' Mr Dunn said - used as a reference manual by the construction industry; the telephone enquiry service, the microfile, used by quantity surveyors and architects; and the health and safety division, which was doing 'bloody well' according to Mr Dunn. The interim dividend goes up from 2.2p to 2.4p, payable from earnings of 11.1p (10.5p) per share.</p>

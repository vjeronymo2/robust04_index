			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- A 53-year-old deputy  to the National People's Congress (NPC) attracts attention for  his manner, alertness, busy schedule and unique clothing style  in the Heilongjiang provincial delegation of NPC deputies who  are here attending the ongoing NPC session.    The deputy is You Yuzhuo. Clad in a green side-buttoned coat  with black cloud-pattern neckband, he attends meetings by day,  and reads documents, writes suggestions or prepares speeches by  night.    You is the only representative of Hezhen nationality, one of  the smallest ethnic groups in China.    All the 55 minority nationalities in China have their own  deputies to the NPC, who add up to 439 among a total of 2,980.    The Hui people, who scatter throughout the country and rank  second only to Zhuang in terms of population, have 66 deputies,  taking the first place; and 29 ethnic groups with small  populations each have one deputy.    At a recent discussion on Premier Li Peng's government work  report, you was the first to speak. He said, "the government  work report says reform and opening up is a driving force for  development. Changes of the Hezhen nationality in recent years  have borne this out."    Hezhen has always been the smallest ethnic group in China.  Mainly inhabiting banks of the Heilongjiang, Songhua and Usuri  rivers in northeast China, Hezhen people used to live on  fishing, dwelled in cellars and were clad in fish skin.    When New China was founded in 1949, Hezhen stood at the  brink  of extinction with a population of only 300. Though Hezhen  people still engage in fisheries, modern fishing gears and motor  boats have replaced fish forks. In addition, some Hezhens  engage in farming and industries. Its population has jumped to  over 4,000.    "The biggest change is a wider horizon for the Hezhen  people,  brought about by reform and the open policy," You noted.    "Hezhens did not know what market was in the past. Today,  they have opened shops and hotels and even set up a  Hezhen-cuisine restaurant in Russia," he added.    You was the first teacher of Hezhen nationality and now  serves as the principal of a rural primary school. His talks  show that he is not only familiar with his people and home town,  but also has a good understanding of state affairs.    Asked how he gets all the information he needs as a deputy,  he said he subscribes to a dozen newspapers and magazines and  keeps watching TV news programs of both central and local TV  stations. Moreover, the general office of the NPC Standing  Committee and relevant departments of Heilongjiang Province and  Tongjiang City mail him documents, draft laws and decrees and  decisions of standing committees of people's congresses at  various levels.    Since he was elected deputy to NPC last year, You have  participated in three inspection tours. He is known for his  "bold airing of views."    When the local township government withheld teachers' wages  for four months last year, You reported the case to the city  government, which solved the problem soon.    Just before coming to Beijing to attend the current NPC  session, you solicited opinions in local villages, townships and  Tongjiang City. He plans to put forward suggestions on  constructing local railways and improving educational conditions  for Hezhen people.    As a teacher, You regards education as the hope for his  people. His wife, three daughters, and two sons-in-law are also  teachers.</p>

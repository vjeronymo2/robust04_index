			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Unsettled again by currency factors TURBULENCE in global curr-ency markets re-emerged as an unsettling factor for UK equities yesterday. Dollar stocks fell out of favour as the US currency faced pressure throughout Europe and turmoil among ERM currencies dented London's newfound confidence. On the corporate front, nerves were jolted by a heavy loss and a halved share price at British Aerospace, until very recently an FT-SE Index constituent and a core stock in many institutional portfolios. Equities opened lower but were then driven ahead by early gains in the stock index futures sector. The Footsie managed to regain the 2,600 hurdle before the pace slackened in the futures market and share prices were left to react to the adverse factors lurking in the background. The stock market became badly unsettled by the latest indications of potentially destructive pressures inside the European exchange rate mechanism. While sterling benefited from the switch of selling pressure towards the French franc, few equity strategists were prepared to speculate on the longer term implications for UK stocks of a break-up in the European currency framework. Dealers identified distinct signs of fear in the market. The setback among dollar stocks, as the US currency challenged its low against the yen, was increased by bearish reviews of the pharmaceutical stock sector by a large US securities house. Some leading drug shares, which led the market advance last week, have now lost most of the gains which greeted sterling's departure from the ERM. The Footsie reversed its gain to stand 18.2 down at 2,567.8 at worst, but was helped later by a rally in the pound. With confidence in further cuts in UK base rates still holding firm, equities recovered to leave a final Footsie reading of 2,580.5, a net loss for the day of 5.5. Seaq volume slipped to 735.4m shares from Tuesday's 987.9m. Tuesday's retail volume remained high, at Pounds 2bn, reflecting block share sales. The attention was concentrated yesterday on a handful of stocks, including Amstrad, the computer manufacturer, which was traded heavily after the chairman suggested he might take the company into the private sector. The combined turnover for Amstrad and British Aerospace made up nearly 5 per cent of the day's total of equity shares traded. Weakness in dollar-orientated equities was offset by continued demand for the domestic retail stocks, which would be beneficiaries from the further cuts in UK base rates expected before Christmas. Bank shares also extended recent gains on the view that lower interest rates will lighten their heavy burden of bad debts. However, there was no improvement for the construction sector, which had to weather another dividend reduction, this time from Costain. The good rally in share prices yesterday afternoon appeared to underline the market's overall confidence that the investment outlook has changed for the better and that domestic interest rates are on the way down.</p>

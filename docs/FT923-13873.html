			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: SIB details 'inadequacies' of Imro THE Securities and Investments Board announced its action yesterday over the report from Imro on its regulation of two Maxwell companies. The report covers Imro's relations with Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM) and London and Bishopsgate International Investment Management plc (LBI), both Imro members, and Maxwell Central and East European Partners, an applicant for membership. In the report, Imro accepts that its supervision of those companies fell short of the standards that should be achieved by a financial services regulator. Imro acknowledges that: Its approach to monitoring was too mechanistic; Its analysis of information was insufficiently critical; It failed to recognise the potential risks associated with the companies, and to give proper weight to the risks that were identified; It was unduly ready to rely on the good faith and professionalism of those with whom it dealt; Its monitoring activity was insufficiently alert and responsive to information available to it; and Its response to the crisis after Robert Maxwell's death was inadequate. SIB's response SIB recognises that in many respects Imro has shown itself to be a committed and effective regulator and that it has taken a conscientious approach to evaluating its own performance. But the report discloses serious weaknesses in Imro, and SIB draws certain more severe conclusions from the report than does Imro. The SIB board has had to decide whether Imro's failings are so fundamental that its recognition should be withdrawn, or whether its recognition should be retained based on appropriate strengthening. The board unanimously believes it should be the latter. Imro's report indicates that it was the recipient at key points of incomplete and inaccurate information from persons in positions of responsibility in the firms concerned, and did not benefit from any whistle-blowing. The affair nevertheless provides a salutary reminder for all Financial Services Act regulators that the day-to-day operational activity of regulation - authorisation, reviewing returns by regulated firms, monitoring visits, dealing with queries - requires a continuous high alertness to any indicators that cast doubt on fitness and properness (honesty, competence, solvency), a willingness to probe until satisfied that the full picture is known and understood, an alertness to information in the public domain (including in the media), and an application of a spirit of critical inquiry in relation to assurances or information given. SIB believes that Imro's monitoring failures in this case reveal a more general lack of market awareness and scepticism in dealing with information about transactions and in monitoring returns. SIB views that with particular concern. Imro concludes that its admissions procedures for BIM and LBI were adequately thorough and properly followed, and that BIM and LBI were properly admitted. While SIB agrees that the decisions to admit to membership were properly taken, SIB nevertheless considers that the thoroughness of Imro's admission arrangements needs further scrutiny. In addition, SIB believes that the report indicates that Imro's ability to react effectively to situations of investor risk and its rules on the handling of the private interests of board members need to be strengthened. Imro's report considers whether its regulation of BIM would have been different if BIM had been an ordinary member rather than a member subject to Imro's special Occupational Pensions Scheme regime (under which a number of Imro's general requirements are disapplied). Imro concludes that was not material to its admission of BIM. The report also concludes that it was not material to its monitoring of BIM except to the extent that, had BIM been an ordinary member, Imro might have received additional and earlier information relating to accounts and audit. SIB's conclusion is that the fact that BIM was subject to that special regime was not a material factor in Imro's performance of its regulatory responsibilities in relation to BIM. SIB and Imro had agreed that in parallel with its review of its regulation of BIM, Imro should conduct a separate review of the OPS regime. Imro completed the review and issued a consultative document in May 1992. SIB's monitoring SIB has, since Imro was recognised in 1988, been required to exercise continuing oversight of Imro's exercise of its functions under the Financial Services Act. SIB has taken a carefully considered decision that the exercise of that supervisory role should not entail detailed tracking of a recognised body's handling of its relations with each member. Rather, SIB has placed heavy reliance on individual self-regulatory organisation's supervision of day-to-day work; on reviewing with each SRO an annual assessment by the SRO's board of the SRO's discharge of its regulatory responsibilities; and on SIB's day-to-day contacts with the SRO both on cases and on policy. That has been the approach with all the recognised bodies for which SIB is responsible. SIB must now reconsider whether that way of carrying out its supervisory role is appropriate. Actions in hand Action is being taken at three levels: by Imro itself, by SIB working with Imro, and by the SIB board. First, as far as Imro's actions are concerned, Imro has announced that its chairman Mr George Nissen has resigned. His successor will be announced as soon as possible; in the meantime the board of Imro is being chaired on an interim basis by Mr Charles Nunneley. Imro also has in hand recruitment of a successor to its chief executive, Mr John Morgan. Imro has also put in hand organisational change and has decided to strengthen its monitoring resources. SIB has also requested the board to produce proposals for strengthening: The experience, skills mix and organisation of its monitoring staff. That will involve Imro members being prepared to provide greater practitioner input into Imro'swork. Its arrangements for dealing promptly and effectively with situations of potential and actual investor risk. Its rules on board members' interests. Second, SIB is to review urgently: Imro's admission procedures and practices, to ensure that its current arrangements are satisfactory. Imro's approach to monitoring its members, to ensure that the lessons of this particular case are applied generally. Third, the report makes clear that there was a shortfall in regulatory standards at Imro that SIB had not identified. The SIB board has asked its chairman to re-examine how it carries out its own regulatory responsibilities and to ensure that the significance of lessons learnt in the affair is taken into account in carrying out its duties to ensure that the regulators whom it supervises meet their recognition responsibilities on a continuing basis. The re-examination will have regard to considerations both of investor protection and efficiency. Wider issues For its part, SIB will be pursuing in particular: (i) Custody of Assets: SIB is to conduct, with the SROs and in consultation with interested parties, a review of the supervision of the custody of investor assets. The review will take into account not just the Maxwell affair but such other factors as practical experience since safe custody requirements for authorised firms came into force in 1988, the increasing use by investment firms of nominees, the development of stock lending and the introduction of Taurus. (It should be noted that the provision of custody or nominees services as such is not an authorisable activity under the Financial Services Act.) (ii) Accountants and Regulators: SIB will review with SROs and the accountancy bodies relations between auditors and regulators, in particular the mechanisms by which auditors may pass critical or relevant information direct to regulators and the operation of s109 of the FSA. SIB will also wish to consider similar issues in relation to other professions. (iii) Inter-Regulator Communications: SIB will review with other supervisory authorities whether the arrangements and practices for the communication among them of information relevant to investment business regulation work as effectively as they could.</p>

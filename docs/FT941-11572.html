			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Blockbuster ahead 71% in fourth quarter Blockbuster Entertainment, the video rental chain which has agreed to merge with cable television group Viacom, yesterday reported a 71 per cent increase in fourth-quarter net income. It made Dollars 81.3m, or 34 cents a share, compared with Dollars 47.6m, or 23 cents, in the same period of last year. Revenues were up 66 per cent at Dollars 724m. Same-store revenues for company-owned video outlets in operation for more than a year increased 5.5 per cent in the quarter and 9.2 per cent in the year. Blockbuster is being taken over by Viacom as part of the cable company's Dollars 10bn bid to buy Paramount Commun-ications, the film and publishing group, in a five-month battle pitting it against rival bidder QVC Network. However, the Viacom-Blockbuster deal is not contingent on Viacom winning the Paramount battle. Mr Wayne Huizenga, chairman of Blockbuster, said the company expected its merger with Viacom to be completed in the second quarter. For the full year, the group reported net income of Dollars 243m, or Dollars 1.10 a share, up 64 per cent from the Dollars 148.3m, or 76 cents, reported in 1992. Revenues totalled Dollars 2.2bn, up 69 per cent. Systemwide revenues - revenues generated by the company and franchise owned stores - rose 49 per cent in the fourth quarter to Dollars 891m and 47 per cent in the year, to Dollars 2.9bn. Mr Huizenga said that during the quarter the company's home video and music retail operations, along with its programming and distribution businesses, posted strong gains in both revenue and operating income.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (12): Inside the black and white market FINANCIAL ENTERPRISE IN SOUTH AFRICA SINCE 1950 edited by Stuart Jones Macmillan Pounds 45, 316 pages A STROLL around the streets of central Johannesburg confirms one of the most enduring truths - and cliches - about South Africa: the extent to which First and Third Worlds exist alongside each other. At the heart of the town lies Bank City, the new corporate headquarters of First National Bank (formerly Barclays), spanning four blocks and breaking new ground in corporate machismo. All around it, however, are thousands of black street hawkers, selling their small wares - tobacco, sweets, fruit - for cash, and operating beyond the sophisticated systems which banks like First National offer. Stuart Jones's book, consisting of 12 essays, is a competent exposition of how this well-developed financial infrastructure evolved over the past 40 years. It includes monetary and fiscal policy overviews, a look at the growth of indigenous institutions such as the Afrikaans bank Volkskas, the development of oil, merchant banking and hire purchase sectors, and a look at the growth of the stock exchange. Although Jones himself contributes in an accessible and interesting fashion, some of the other contributions are rather stolid and certainly only of specialist interest. And while the book warrants a place on the shelves of committed South Africa watchers, its utility would have been enhanced, given the rapid pace of transition underway, had some effort been made to synthesise the past and the future. There are, for example, pregnant hints of disapproval about the controversial subject of concentration of control on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, but no attempt is made to analyse the cogency of arguments about pyramids and concentration, and to predict how this important issue will develop. Long lead times have also left the book curiously dated in parts. Thus the chapter about monetary policy, for example, was completed before Dr Chris Stals stook over as governor nearly three years ago. His single-minded fight against inflation, and the political freedom he has been given to pursue this difficult task, have arguably been the main economic features of the recent past. You would not know it from this book. Likewise, the chapter about the Development Bank of South Africa strikes the wrong note by concentrating on its apartheid origins and close links with government. Jones neglects the remarkable evolution of the past few years whereby the bank has developed a considerable reputation as a source of non-partisan developmental expertise, to the extent that the African National Congress (ANC) has used it as a source of input in developing economic policy. This new orientation was recently illustrated by the way in which the nomination of ex-Finance Minister Mr Barend du Plessis as chairman of the bank was scuppered through both internal and external pressure. The book was also completed too soon to take adequate account of the important Deposit Taking Institutions (DTI) Act passed early last year which put banks and building societies on to the same legislative footing and brought South Africa into line with international capital adequacy requirements. This precipitated major rationalisation in the banking sector, leading to the formation of ABSA, the country's largest banking group. A related, curious omission is the decision not to write about the massive growth of the life offices movement in South Africa during the 19802, when their ability to provide real returns in an inflationary environment saw a huge shift in savings flows towards them. Both on grounds of innovation and influence - the manner in which they manage their huge funds is already a point of political contention - this sector deserved attention.</p>

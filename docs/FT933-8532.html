			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Motoring: Saab, solid and spirited WHEN General Motors rode to Saab's financial rescue, some enthusiasts feared the worst. Future Saabs, they thought, would be Opels or Vauxhalls in disguise. They can set their minds at rest. The new Saab 900 might have been built on a modified GM platform (the modern equivalent of a chassis), and one version has the British-made V6 engine that powers up-market Vauxhall Cavaliers. But the 900 looks, feels and goes like a proper Saab - because it is. At the moment, there is only one body: a five-door hatchback. And while officially-leaked photographs had made the new 900 look remarkably like an old one with the corners rounded off, in the metal it has an altogether sleeker, more elegant shape. There are no overtones of the old 99 from which the original 900 was evolved in 1978, and which could still be seen. Three-door hatchbacks and a convertible will follow in the first half of next year. Although mainland European sales start later this month, the new 900 will not make its British debut until the London Motor Show, which opens on October 21. Prices will be announced shortly before. Saab says that, in left-hand drive markets, the new 900 will be only 1 or 2 per cent dearer than the old one. The company claims that when equipment levels are taken into consideration as well, it will be up to 14 per cent cheaper than potential rivals such as the Audi 80, BMW 3-Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. An inspired guess puts the cheapest two-litre 900 at around Pounds 14,750. Engines are a two-litre, 133 brake horsepower; 2.3-litre, 150 bhp; and a turbo-charged two-litre (available next spring) developing 185 bhp. All are multi-valved; the 2.3-litre and two-litre turbo have twin balance shafts. The 2.5-litre V6, which Saab engineers tailored to meet their requirements, puts out 170 bhp. A Saab-developed five-speed gearbox is standard, while a four-speed automatic with normal, sports and winter driving modes is an optional extra. The manual-only 900 turbo will be offered with a newly-developed Saab Sensonic automatic clutch system. You change gear normally but electronic controls operate the clutch for starting and shifting. Once you get the knack, it works well. The price premium will probably be about half that for a conventional torque converter type of automatic. Fuel consumption will be at least as good as that of a manual transmission car. I tried two Sensonic-equipped turbo 900s in Sweden last week, with a two-pedal V6 in between. Sensonic is fussy about which gear you select. Unlike some earlier kinds of semi-automatic (like that of the Wankel-engined NSU Ro80 of 25 years ago), it cannot be left in, say, third gear while you creep along in a motorway tailback. It insists you pick first or second. I liked it well enough as a half-way house but suspect most business drivers will choose fully-automatic transmission in a non-turbo four-cylinder or a V6 (it will not be available in the turbo). Putting Sensonic in the 900 Turbo is really testing the market. But Saab engineers see more potential in systems like it, perhaps with gear-shifting controlled by buttons on the steering wheel, than in torque converter automatics. If a lot of Turbo buyers go for Sensonic, it could eventually be offered on other 900s. While retaining Saab's traditional sporty feel, the new 900s are, above all, refined and smooth-riding performers. The entry model two-litre and the 2.3-litre version were ultra-quiet on smooth-surfaced roads, and tyre noise was minimal on rough-textured ones. As always, the extra cornering grip of the squatter, wider tyres of the higher performers has a trade-off; more noise on coarse surfaces and the odd thump caused by potholes. Sweden's draconian speed limits, and a generally adult attitude toward cars, discourage fast driving. So, having tasted rather than tested the new range, my main impression is of rock-solid construction matched by spirited handling and courtly manners on occasionally rain-swept roads. All 900s have driver-side air bags, ABS brakes and power steering; buyers in this class now expect nothing less. Other features are a 'black panel' switch which lets a driver choose a speedometer-only display for night driving, and full lap/diagonal seatbelts for all five occupants. Traditionalists will be pleased to know that the ignition switch is still on the floor near the gear lever, which is locked in reverse when the key is withdrawn. Saab never will be a big player in the executive car market because, in world terms, it is a small producer, making fewer than 100,000 units a year. In a full year, about 45,000 of these will be 900s, the rest 9000s. Saab expects some substitution from 9000 owners but the bigger car will still take 45 per cent of its business. There will not be a 900 estate car and a diesel-engined version is some years off. 'We are aware of the surge in diesel sales but we can't do everything at once,' said product development director Sig-Gran Larsson. 'When we do offer a diesel Saab - and we are looking at various engines - you can be sure it will a Saab first, a diesel second.' BMW followed the same policy of allowing no compromises in refinement and performance when making diesel cars. The result is that 25 per cent of all BMW 5-Series cars are now the smoothest and most vigorous turbo-diesels on the market.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / People: Customised high-flyer FLYING high at Customs and Excise is Michael Eland who, at the tender age of 39, becomes a Commissioner, one of the board which directs the work of the department. Eland, who is currently in charge of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Division, will head a new central directorate bringing together the present Single Market and Budget and Central Units, a new Economics and Statistics Division, and the Tariff and Statistical Office. After reading jurisprudence at Trinity College, Oxford, Eland joined Customs and Excise in 1975 as a fast-stream trainee and has held various posts within the department. Identified early as a man going to the top, he spent seven years during the 1980s in the Cabinet Office, including a spell in the Cabinet Secretariat. He was private secretary to Lord Whitelaw when he was Lord President of the Council 1987-88. Smart money is on Valerie Strachan, one of the two deputy chairmen, to succeed the present chairman Sir Brian Unwin who could well return to the Treasury at some time in the next year. Eland would then be hotly fancied to follow Strachan into the top seat.</p>

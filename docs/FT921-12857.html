			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Italian court bars UK arbitration MARC RICH &amp; CO AG v SOCIETA ITALIANA IMPIANTI Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Neill, Lord Justice Woolf and Lord Justice Scott): December 19 1991 SUBMISSION to the jurisdiction of the courts of a foreign country by the lodging of a defence covers the whole proceedings, including earlier interlocutory orders and decisions. Accordingly, an earlier decision as to the non-existence of an arbitration agreement is a decision of a competent court binding on a party who submits to the jurisdiction at a later stage, and bars him from asserting in the UK that the claim should go to arbitration. The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the plaintiff, Marc Rich &amp; Co AG, from Mr Justice Hobhouse's dismissal of its application for an interim injunction to restrain the defendant, Societa Italiana Impianti PA, from pursuing an action in Genoa pending appointment of an arbitrator. LORD JUSTICE NEILL said Marc Rich was Swiss. Impianti was Italian. In 1987 Impianti sold a cargo of oil to Marc Rich. The contract for sale was negotiated in Italy. Following the sale Marc Rich alleged that the cargo was contaminated, and contended that the contract incorporated an English law London arbitration clause. On February 29 1988 Marc Rich appointed an arbitrator. Meanwhile, on February 18, Impianti had issued proceedings in Genoa seeking a declaration of non-liability. On May 20 Marc Rich issued an originating summons in the Commercial Court in London seeking appointment of an arbitrator pursuant to section 10(3) of the Arbitration Act 1950. It obtained leave to serve out of the jurisdiction. Impianti applied to set aside leave, contending that the contract did not contain an arbitration clause and that the dispute should be resolved in Italy. Mr Justice Hirst dismissed the application. He held that the 1968 Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention did not apply; that the putative law of the contract was English; and that it was a proper case for leave. Impianti appealed. The Court of Appeal referred questions on the interpretation of Article 1 of the Convention to the European Court. Meanwhile, Marc Rich had taken steps to contest jurisdiction in Genoa. On October 4 1988 it lodged a defence document pleading lack of jurisdiction, but, in the event of recognition of jurisdiction, claiming compensation for loss. On January 25 1991 the Corte di Cassazione in Rome rejected a plea by Marc Rich that the Genoa proceedings be stayed on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. It held there was no arbitration agreement and that the only jurisdiction was Italy where the contract had been formed. On May 14 Marc Rich lodged a further pleading in Genoa, contesting Impianti's non-liability claim. On June 4 and July 2 it introduced documentary evidence. On April 25 the European Court gave its judgment on the question referred by the Court of Appeal. Article 1(4) of the Convention provided 'the Convention shall not apply to . . . (4) arbitration'. The first question referred was whether the article 1(4) exception extended to litigation as to the initial existence of an arbitration agreement. In paragraph 22 of its judgment the Court said Impianti contended that the article 1(4) exclusion did not extend to such disputes. Further contentions were set out in paragraphs 23, 24 and 25. In the first sentence of paragraph 26 the Court said 'those interpretations cannot be accepted'. In paragraph 29 it said the exclusion extended to litigation pending before a national court concerning appointment of an arbitrator, even if existence of an arbitration agreement was a preliminary issue in that litigation. Those paragraphs were not easy to interpret. The Court appeared in the first sentence of paragraph 26 to reject the paragraph 22 contention. On the other hand, paragraph 29 was capable of meaning that the exclusion covered section 10(3) cases. In the light of the European Court's answer, the appeal from Mr Justice Hirst's judgment was dismissed. On October 29 Marc Rich sought an injunction to restrain Impianti from taking further steps in Genoa until final award in the arbitration. Mr Justice Hobhouse concluded on the balance of convenience that it would not be appropriate to grant an interim injunction after Marc Rich had apparently voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the Italian court. He refused the application. Marc Rich now appealed. On the appeal the question, not argued below, was whether the Rome decision was binding as to the existence of the arbitration agreement. If so, the basis for the summons and relief disappeared. Article 26 of the Convention provided that a judgment given in a contracting state should be recognised in other contracting states. Section 32(1) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 provided that an overseas judgment should not be recognised in the UK if the proceedings were brought in the overseas court (a) contrary to agreement and (b) without the agreement of the person against whom judgment was given, 'and (c) that person did not . . . submit to the jurisdiction of that court'. Section 32(4)(a) provided that nothing in subsection (1) should affect recognition in the UK of a judgment 'which is required to be recognised or enforced there under the 1968 Convention'. Section 33(1) provided that a person against whom judgment was given should not be treated as having submitted to the jurisdiction only because he appeared to contest jurisdiction, or to ask for a stay on the ground that the dispute should be submitted to arbitration. Impianti contended that the Rome judgment was the judgment of a competent court, and that Marc Rich had submitted to the jurisdiction by lodging the first defence in October 1988, or by lodging the second defence in May 1991 and the documents in June and July. Accordingly, it was argued, all the elements of an issue estoppel were present - final judgment on the merits by a competent court between the same parties on the same issues. Marc Rich said the Rome court was not a competent court in that the defence was not a submission to the jurisdiction. In the alternative Impianti said the judgment had to be recognised under the Convention and, in the light of section 32(4)(a), section 32(1) did not apply. If one considered the form of the question sent to the European Court of Justice and the argument recorded in paragraph 22 of the judgment, the European judgment did not provide any clear authority for the proposition that the Rome judgment was one to which section 32(4)(a) applied. It was unnecessary to express any final view on the question. The case would not be decided on the basis of section 32(4)(a). The question was whether Marc Rich submitted to the jurisdiction of Italian courts at a time and in a manner which prevented it from relying on section 32 because of non-fulfilment of condition (1)(c). Section 33 should not be construed too narrowly. It might not have been necessary for Marc Rich to lodge an alternative defence on the merits on October 1988, but the pleading made it abundantly clear that the primary purpose of the document was to challenge the jurisdiction. It was assumed that the first defence did not amount to a submission. The second defence, lodged in May 1991, was another matter. It was a plain and unequivocal submission to the jurisdiction of the Italian court to deal with the merits of the claim. Marc Rich was seeking rejection of Impianti's claim. The matter was put beyond doubt by the lodging of documents. Once Marc Rich had submitted to the jurisdiction to try the merits of the case, that submission covered the whole proceedings. It could no longer dispute earlier interlocutory orders, nor challenge the validity or competence of any earlier decision in the proceedings. It followed that the Rome judgment was the judgment of a competent court. Marc Rich must be regarded as having submitted to the jurisdiction. The condition in section 32(1)(c) could not be satisfied. Marc Rich was bound by the decision that the contract did not contain an arbitration agreement. The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed. For Marc Rich: Iain Milligan QC (Clyde &amp; Co). For Impianti: Peter Gross (Ince &amp; Co).</p>

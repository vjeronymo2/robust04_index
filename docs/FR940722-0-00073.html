			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One State commented that the requirement in paragraph (a) that ``the State shall not use any PL funds for grant or subgrant administration'' is too restrictive and should be changed to permit a reasonable amount for administration. Another State commented that under the ISTEA, a State DOT's role in administering and participating in MPO planning activities funded with PL funds has increased significantly and that there should be a provision which permits the State DOT to retain a certain percentage of PL funds for its costs in administering and participating in PL funded programs. Another State commented: that the cost for grant administration historically has been included as part of the funding package of the MPO planning work program; that this new provision may unfairly restrict the use of PL funds to only direct program activity and not permit the State or MPO to use PL funds for organization administration costs; and that by not allowing the use of PL funds for grant or subgrant administration, the FHWA will be placing an unfair economic burden on the various parties concerned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These comments imply a misunderstanding of both the legislation and regulation. Before responding to these comments, a distinction needs to be made between ``grant or subgrant administration'' and ``general planning process administrative activities.'' ``Grant or subgrant administration'' includes activities such as processing or preparing PL grant agreements between the FHWA and the State, subgrant agreements between the State and the MPOs, fiscal documents, progress reports, and audits. ``General planning process administrative activities'' may include conducting MPO meetings, preparation of planning work programs, and salaries of an MPO executive director and other administrative support staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The legislation has always specified that PL funds are to be made available  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> to the MPOs <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by the State. The FHWA historically has interpreted this to mean that a State cannot unilaterally retain PL funds for any purpose; all PL funds must be made available to the MPOs. If an individual MPO chooses to include activities (e.g., development of a long range plan, traffic counting) to be performed with its PL funds by the State for the MPO in its work program, it may do so. If the required State PL fund distribution formula, developed in consultation with the MPOs, allows for State retainage of PL funds, it may be approved by the FHWA if the retained funds will be used by the State for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> technical activities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in support of metropolitan planning or for making discretionary subgrants to MPOs for special studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In no instance may PL funds (either in an MPO's work program or retained under an approved formula) be used by a State for PL fund ``grant or subgrant administration'' as indicated in subparagraph (a). Such State grant or subgrant administrative activities are eligible for SPR funding. ``General planning process administrative activities'' performed by MPOs are eligible for PL funds. Such general administrative activities performed by a State for an MPO are eligible for SPR funds and would be eligible for PL funds if included in the MPO's work program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One State commented that it would be concerned if the regulation is administratively construed to require a specific formula for distribution, or require reconsideration of its policy on PL funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement that funds be distributed by a State by a formula that considers specific factors has existed since the enactment of the PL funding in 1973. The ISTEA added the additional factor of attainment of the national ambient air quality standards. In developing the formula, the State must consult with the MPOs and must consider the legislatively mandated factors, but all of the factors do not need to be included in the formula. In accordance with paragraph (f), any formula that does not meet these requirements must be brought into conformance as soon as possible, but not later than in time for distribution of PL funds apportioned to the State for the first Federal fiscal year beginning after the effective date of the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 420.111&blank;Work Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section includes requirements for State and subrecipient work programs that serve as the application for FHWA planning and research funds. References to 23 CFR part 450 and subpart B of this part are cited for additional information on metropolitan area unified planning work programs and RD&amp;T work programs, respectively. Except for correcting citations to 23 CFR part 450 and changing the first word in paragraph (a) from ``expenditure'' to ``proposed use,'' this section is unchanged from the NPRM. The work program in essence is a statement of work that identifies the proposed use of the funds; expenditure of the funds is documented in the financial and progress reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that the requirement to submit work program documents creates duplicate paperwork for agencies. The commenter stated that the same information is available in work plans for individual studies, and, if FHWA review of individual study work plans is no longer required, submission of a work program is not appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A work program has always been required for both planning and RD&amp;T activities. The work program is the ``grant application'' for FHWA planning and research funds and is necessary for the FHWA to determine if the proposed work is eligible. A work program may consist of a listing of proposed studies and activities and other appropriate information, such as cost of the activity and performing agency, with sufficient description for the FHWA to determine eligibility of the work. ``Work plans'' that included details on need, purpose, approach, etc., for individual RD&amp;T studies are no longer required. Therefore, there is no duplication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One State commented that while a biennial work program is allowed, it requires a projection of available Federal funds which may be difficult to make on a biennial basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

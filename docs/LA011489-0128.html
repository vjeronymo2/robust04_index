			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RELUCTANT PENELOPE PLUCKED FROM BLAZE  </P> <P> As rescues go, it was not the most dramatic. And rookie Police Officer Roy  Griffith had to drag Penelope, the springer spaniel, by her collar out of the  burning home in Orange on Friday morning.  </P> <P> He had some help from a Southern California Edison Co. meter reader and a park  ranger. Both reached the blaze in the 2100 block of Cleveland Street before the  Fire Department.  </P> <P> But that probably didn't matter much to Peggy and Donald George, whose beloved  pet had survived the 11 a.m. fire that destroyed their entire roof, forcing  them to find other lodgings.  </P> <P> The blaze caused an estimated $140,000 damage, Battalion Chief Doug Flaherty  said, and firefighter Dean Crockett suffered a burned wrist fighting the  flames.  </P> <P> Only Penelope was home when an electrical short behind a clothes dryer  apparently triggered the fire, Griffith said.  </P> <P> "Originally, it started growling at me," the 27-year-old officer said of the  reluctant pooch. "But after I latched onto (her) collar and grabbed (her)  outside, (she) was glad to see daylight.  </P> <P> "To be honest with you, we didn't think of confronting the dog; we figured when  we opened the front door the dog would just run out," Griffith said. "But she  wasn't going out on her own."  </P></p>

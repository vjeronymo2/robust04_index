Prime Minister Rabin last night spoke on the phone with  Presidents Clinton and Mubarak mainly on how to secure the  continuation of the peace talks. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht  reports:    [Begin Hecht recording] In Jerusalem, the Hebron massacre is  being compared with the deadly mortar shell in the Sarajevo  marketplace. Jerusalem hopes the shock, here just as there, will  make the parties realize that there is no other way but to join  in an effort to complete the negotiations as quickly as possible.    The comparison with Sarajevo was mentioned more than once in  the discussion the prime minister held last night with U.S.  President Clinton, who called after midnight. He reiterated his  personal commitment to the success of the peace process.  Egypt's President Mubarak also called the prime minister and  updated him on Yasir 'Arafat's difficulties in dealing with his  fellow PLO leaders.    The way to bring the PLO back to the negotiating table also  goes through Moscow. The Russian foreign minister last night  spoke to Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and promised his help.  Kozyrev also spoke to Yasir 'Arafat.    This, therefore, is the message Jerusalem delivered to Tunis  through Washington, Cairo, and Moscow: Do not be silly; do not  let terrorism win. We are also having a hard time with our  excited opposition. We have always distinguished between  handling terror and making the effort to bring peace. The prime  minister knows that the resolutions the cabinet will pass this  morning should cushion 'Arafat's way back to the talks.    Following recommendations from the attorney general, Rabin  will present the ministers with several ideas, such as imposing  travel restrictions on Kakh activists, disarming extreme  settlers, and deporting the hard core of the settlers from  Hebron. Rabin will brief the ministers about the imminent  release of Palestinian prisoners. He has not yet accepted the  idea of setting up a state commission of inquiry. This is  public relations, the prime minister said, this is no real  answer. [end recording]    Last night, Prime Minister Rabin met with 70 foreign  ambassadors in Israel, including the U.S. and Russian  ambassadors. In the meeting, Rabin for the first time revealed  that the negotiations will resume in Washington on 2 March.  Sheli Yehimovich reports:    [Begin Yehimovich recording] We, the prime minister told the  ambassadors, immediately accepted the U.S. invitation to come to  Washington and resume the talks there on 2 March. We do not  have any information regarding the PLO response, and we expect  developments in the coming week. I understand the shock the  Palestinians are in. After all, they were the victims, but I  expect them to follow our example. We also suffered casualties  of terror acts, yet we made a distinction between this and the  political process. I expect the Palestinians not to create a  linkage or conditioning between this incident and the political  process.    The ambassadors only asked a few questions: Did the  assailant have personal motives, or was he a member of an  ideological group? The prime minister said: There is no proof  that the act was part of an organized activity. As far as we  know, this dreadful and mad act was perpetrated by a single  individual.    Will Israel make more compromises? the ambassadors asked.  Israel will do everything to speed up the process, Rabin said.  We are very close to concluding an agreement on the security  issues, but there are several macroeconomic problems. This is  not a question of making compromises, he said. We are  committed to the Declaration of Principles. Both sides must  make compromises in negotiations. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DONATED TOY MEANS ADMISSION TO PARK  </P> <P> Visitors who donate a new or used toy between 4 and 5 p.m. today at the San  Diego Wild Animal Park will get in free.  </P> <P> The toy drive for needy children is part of a national campaign sponsored by  Mattel Toys, said company spokeswoman Della Perry. It "encourages children to  help other, less fortunate children by donating their favorite toys," she said.  </P> <P> Children who visit the Mattel booth there can also make Christmas cards for  children who will be hospitalized during the holidays, Perry said.  </P> <P> The toys will go to Children's Hospital and the Hillcrest Receiving Home.  </P> <P> Holiday festivities are planned for 3 to 6 p.m. today at the park. The toy  drive coincides with the park's second annual Nairobi Festival of Lights. More  than 85,000 lights will be lit in the park's African village in celebration of  the holiday season.  </P></p>

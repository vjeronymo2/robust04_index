			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Benefit turns sour for Bronfman managers THE business empire con-trolled by Toronto's Bronfman family is scrambling to unravel an executive compensation scheme which held the promise of rich rewards, but has turned into a debilitating burden for hundreds of managers. The scheme was based on the premise that managers perform best when they are substantial shareholders in their companies. But plunging share prices of many Bronfman companies have left the executives at best uncertain about the future value of their portfolios, and at worst facing possible financial ruin. Noranda, the Bronfman-controlled resources group, last Monday allowed 50 managers to sell 1.6m shares they owned under the compensation scheme. The proceeds, totalling CDollars 30m (USDollars 23.8m), have been used to repay company loans used to finance the share purchases. Mr Courtney Pratt, senior vice-president at Noranda, said yesterday the sales were allowed 'to deal with the uncertainty and risk which a number of people felt about the future'. Compensation packages at Bronfman-controlled companies have typically comprised relatively low salaries, but have required managers to buy large parcels of shares financed by corporate loans. The expectation was that they would reap hefty capital gains as share prices rose. Interest on the loans would be paid out of dividends. According to estimates by the Toronto Globe &amp; Mail, employees have borrowed at least CDollars 250m from companies in the Bronfman orbit over the past decade. Some have also taken out large bank loans. The Noranda managers are among the luckier ones. They sold their shares at CDollars 20.25 each. The biggest parcel was bought in 1987 at CDollars 18, and most have made a small profit. The strains in other Bronfman companies were evident however, in last week's revelation by Hees International Bancorp, the group's merchant banking arm, that it lent CDollars 5.2m to seven senior executives last year to help them refinance bank loans used to acquire shares. Several other Bronfman holding companies, including Edper Enterprises, Brascan and Trilon Financial, have made similar advances. Without the loans, the executives, who include the Bronfmans' chief strategist, Mr Jack Cockwell, would either have had to put up extra collateral or begin selling their stock. The most intractable problem is at Royal Trustco, the financial services group whose operations are being sold to Royal Bank of Canada. A condition of the deal is that RT must find a way to 'unfetter' 175 managers encumbered by share-purchase loans. RT's share price has plummeted from a peak of almost CDollars 36 in 1986 to 49 cents. Mr Pratt said the extent of most of the loans 'is well beyond the capacity of virtually anyone to repay'. But any bail-out is complicated by Canadian tax rules, which do not allow a capital loss to be offset against a taxable benefit.</p>

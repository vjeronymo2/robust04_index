			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Government Minister Marcelo Santos with </F> unidentified reporters at the Government Palace in Quito;  broadcast in progress; all reporters' questions are indistinct  -- live]    [Summary from poor reception] "...I hope that in the next  few days -- as I have already announced [words indistinct] in  other sectors of the Ecuadoran community -- none of those [word  indistinct] or demonstrations will generate violence. Such was  the case today, because there was none of that anywhere in the  country. I think the public force has displayed a temperate  attitude in controlling demonstrations, but I also think that  there have been regrettable and condemnable (?acts) executed  probably by agitators, extremists, and people who [passage  indistinct] that prompted the Workers Front to declare a  national strike."    Through you, I want to thank the country for its behavior. I  want to thank the large number of Ecuadoreans who, as I saw on  television, did everything possible to go to work in the early  hours. "That is what Ecuador needs; that is what the government  demands from the Ecuadoran people; that is what the government  does to benefit the Ecuadoran people: work."    Our efforts are directed at finding ways to develop the  country. "To achieve this, sometimes we must take on the  responsibility of adopting harsh, drastic measures." However,  most Ecuadoreans today showed their willingness to work. The  transportation workers went to work in large numbers early today  while there were still no demonstrations on the streets.    As of now, there are virtually no demonstrations. According  to information furnished by the Police, at least 50 percent of  the transportation vehicles are circulating. If you have  different information, we could estimate an average and reach an  agreement about this. I am not claiming that this was the case  throughout the day. "There were times when there were obviously  no means of transportation on the streets, but now, if you go  out into the streets, you will see that there is increasingly  more traffic circulating."    "That is good, because it will allow those who found it  difficult to get to work this morning to return home more  easily." I want to tell the country that the government is  pleased. It is thankful to the Ecuadoran citizens for their  behavior. There have been no tragic developments in the form of  violence, loss of life, or major destruction.    These types of actions, no matter how legitimate they might  be, are not the best way to achieve goals because they actually  cause irreversible losses for the country. "What the country  loses in one day of paralysis cannot be recovered by redoubling  efforts over the following days. The loss remains."    Genuine opposition in a genuine democracy is not  destructive,  it is not negative. Opposition is a basic, significant element  that is inherent to the democratic system. It is unacceptable,  however, when it is accompanied by a negative position, a  position closed to reasoning or dialogue, much less to a violent  position.    The government has the serious responsibility of managing  the  country. Our society has had a sick economy. "We have had to  adopt measures directed at making the Ecuadoran economy healthy  again. This will benefit everyone. We think we have a qualified  economic team." We have been attacked for certain reasons and  from various fronts. The sectors that have attacked us,  however, admit that we are handling economic policy correctly.    After lowering inflation to less than 30 percent in a year  and six months when the previous government could not do it in  four years, we have rights. "We have managed to lower interest  rates, and we have maintained a stable exchange rate. We have  the right to tell the country that our economic performance is  adequate, that it is well directed, and that we will maintain it  as long as we do not reach the clear conclusion that it is not  working well, that it must be changed or readjusted."    I received a report about half and hour ago. As for  detainees, the Police force reports that 17 adults and 16 minors  were arrested in Quito, and (?two) were arrested in Puerto  Viejo. There were no other arrests. "These persons will  obviously be turned over to the proper authorities to see that  they are tried in keeping with their accountability." As for  violence, several people have been injured by stones.    As for the complaints filed before the Tribunal of  Constitutional Guarantees, the government presented its position  through legal channels. We think that the sole measure adopted  by the government -- because we cannot talk about measures --  was to increase gasoline prices. This measure was in keeping  with current regulations and in keeping with the hydrocarbons  law that was reformed days ago.    "We think that this was done legally and technically. We  think this measure will solve the most serious budget problems  that were facing the Ecuadoran state and seriously affecting the  economy. With the awareness that things are being done  correctly and hoping that they will yield results, the  government is neither inclined nor has it any reason to think of  backing down or withdrawing this measure.    "You mentioned possible subsequent acts, uprisings with  unpredictable consequences, but I dare say that today's strike  gives us an idea of what future actions could entail. We have  held talks with the FUT [United Workers Front], and despite  today's developments, we are willing to continue meeting with  its leaders to discuss certain points that were touched upon  during a meeting with the president of the Republic last week,  and even to discuss overall aspects of the handling and  development of our governmental policy and the FUT's actions,  presence, and responsibility in the development of national  life."    Obviously, we have the same willingness toward the Indians.  I have read about an Indian mobilization scheduled for Tuesday  and Wednesday of next week. It is said that there will be no  violence; that the mobilization will be limited to certain  actions on the streets and highways.    The National Transit Council two days ago adopted a measure  for Ecuadoran families that is much more constructive than any  salary compensation. It refrained from increasing  transportation fares. Instead, it increased subsidies to promote  the modernization and development of transportation laws. This  is a very important social measure. "All the effects that the  national government plans to achieve through the correct  application of the economic policy, which will be facilitated by  the decision made last week, constitute a social policy, because  it is directed mainly at ensuring that the state has the  resources it needs to create jobs through public projects and to  meet Ecuadoreans' education, health, and social welfare needs."    "The subsidy is not granted to transportation workers but to  the population. The transportation workers are paid so the  population will not have to pay higher fares. Consider what an  increase of 50 sucres in urban transportation means to each  person and each family over the course of a week or a month."  The government cannot promise that there will be any measure  regarding the salaries to neutralize the effects of the action  taken last week.    It is easy to say we will give compensation, but that is  irresponsible. We must look at the overall picture, we must  look at the interrelationship between economic and social  aspects. This should never be neglected.</p>

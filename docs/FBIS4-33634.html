			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jaime Guerrero from the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Only 50 percent of the recommendations issued by the  National Human Rights Committee [CNDH] are in compliance. In  light of this situation, President Salinas set a 30-day deadline  for the government and organizations to comply with the  recommendations. Here is a report by Jaime Guerrero:    [Begin recording] [Guerrero] The leading problem the CNDH  faces is that of partial compliance with its recommendations,  but a statement issued today at Los Pinos presidential residence  could be interpreted as a warning. The federal government might  apply sanctions against those who do not fully comply with CNDH  recommendations.    Several governors might be among those penalized. Jorge  Madrazo has submitted his report. Madrazo said that during the  past four years, the CNDH issued 796 recommendations, of which  51 percent were in partial compliance. As a result, a 30-day  deadline was established for state governments and organizations  to comply with CNDH recommendations. President Salinas has said  the law will be applied to its fullest extent.    [Salinas] I urge state governors to join this national  effort  with a greater enthusiasm, and I urge the CNDH president to  disclose, under a strict time limit, a new public report on the  results of compliance with the recommendations. The last  results have been referred here as negligent noncompliance.    [Guerrero] During the past year, the CNDH received  approximately 9,000 complaints, of which human rights violations  in prisons, abuse of authority, and arbitrary arrests head the  list. Torture reportedly ranks 10th on the long list of  violations nationwide.    [Madrazo] In the fight against torture, we have not had the  resolute support of all governors or all judges.

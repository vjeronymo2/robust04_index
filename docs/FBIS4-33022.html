			<p>BFN     [Text] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said today  that the world is moving toward an era of expanded markets and  communities, adding that this is the moment for the awakening of  the Americas. Peres, who arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota for an  official two-day visit to Colombia, met with President Cesar  Gaviria for 40 minutes. Peres congratulated Gaviria for being  elected OAS secretary general, a position that the outgoing  Colombian president will fill in September in replacement of  Brazilian Joao Baena Soares.    The former Labor Party leader, whose first Latin American  tour also includes Mexico and Chile, said his visit to Colombia  is the result of the fortunate rapprochement that began in  December with Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio's  visit to Israel.</p>

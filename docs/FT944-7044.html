			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Mr Major's dreadful week: The self-destructive habit of the UK's Conservative party casts doubt on its will to govern The government finds itself trapped in a political world where a statement of the obvious becomes an extraordinary cabinet suicide pact; where behind every cock-up lurks a dark conspiracy. Rightwing plotters tour the lobbies of Westminster collecting names in support of a leadership challenge. A Tory deputy chairman finds his private gloom about the party's electoral prospects splashed across the front pages of the newspapers. A vice-chairman is obliged to resign after penning a xenophobic attack on Britain's European partners. Yes, Mr John Major has had another dreadful week. So the next few days will provide yet another of those all-too-familiar tests of the prime minister's authority. On Monday he faces a confidence vote on legislation to increase Britain's contributions to Brussels. By Wednesday morning he will know whether one of his enemies - possibly Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor - has mustered the requisite 34 nominations to mount a formal challenge for the party leadership. The odds are that Mr Major will win Monday's vote with room to spare. The re-election on Thursday of the loyalist Sir Marcus Fox as chairman of the backbench 1922 committee applied a brake on the Tories' slide into anarchy. The broad hint yesterday from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that the government would offer a referendum before joining a single European currency will provide a line of retreat for the softer rebels. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will follow by opening Monday's Commons debate with a promise of a clampdown on European Union fraud. The Eurosceptics will be assured that the Treasury's receipts from the imposition of value-added tax on domestic fuel will not line the pockets of crooked Italian wine producers. Even if a dozen irreconcilables were to ignore such overtures and risk expulsion from the parliamentary party, the votes of Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionists would save the government. The betting on whether there will be a leadership contest is also on Mr Major's side, but less certainly. A week ago, the notion seemed far-fetched. Plenty of his backbenchers would be happy to see Mr Major depart 10 Downing Street. But not enough were ready to attach their names publicly to a formal challenge. Now the mood, if not yet the cold arithmetic, has changed. Mr Major's cabinet colleagues admit a contest is possible. Mr Lamont is said to be ready to exact his revenge for his dismissal as chancellor 18 months ago. No challenger would defeat Mr Major. But he might fatally wound him. Logic dictates the threat will come to nothing, and the odds are still against. But logic is a scarce commodity these days on the Tory backbenches. Amid this hysteria, next Tuesday's Budget has been all but forgotten. It might well pre-empt a leadership contest. Mr Clarke does not have a bag of populist tricks to dispense to the panickers on the backbenches. But the signs are that he will delight the rightwing with deeper spending cuts than predicted. He will also publish projections for public borrowing that offer the chance - if not the certainty - of income tax cuts before the general election. Mr Clarke, described this week by one rightwing Tory as 'dodgy on Europe but otherwise the best chancellor since the war', is assured of another jump in his personal rating. Mr Major needs him, but must also envy his chancellor's natural authority. When the prime minister said 10 days ago that he would not tolerate a rebellion by his party's Eurosceptics over Britain's increased contribution to the Brussels budget, the conventional wisdom backed his judgment. By making the vote an issue of confidence, he would avoid a repeat of the trench warfare that nearly destroyed the government over the Maastricht treaty. He would win quickly and decisively. This time no one could resurrect the accusation of weakness. That was the theory. But once again the prime minister and his cabinet colleagues - the suggestion of an immediate showdown came first from Mr Hurd and was backed strongly by Mr Clarke - underestimated the party's malcontents. Mr Major has a House of Commons majority of 14, likely to fall to 13 after next month's Dudley by-election. There are up to twice that number of Conservative MPs whose central ambition is to oust him this side of the next general election. If their efforts lead to defeat at the election, they are prepared to countenance it. Not all the putative rebels over Europe are driven by personal animosity. Sir Teddy Taylor, the MP for Southend, has honourably opposed Brussels for as long as anyone can remember. Some are motivated by the conviction that the next few years mark Britain's last chance to break away from an emerging European superstate. Mr William Cash is widely regarded as a bore but he is a sincere one. Others represent the curious relics of postwar chauvinism who tend to prop up their local saloon bar before tucking into a traditional Sunday lunch. Like Mr Patrick Nicolls, the Tory vice-chairman forced to resign after an outburst in his local newspaper, they see Germany as a nation of warmongers and France as a nation of collaborators. But for a determined clique of irreconcilables, Europe provides the most fertile ground on which to prosecute their assault on Mr Major's premiership. They despise him. Their ambition is to depose him. For them, plotting in the Commons corridors has become a way of life. It was their enmity that forced Mr Major into the position of demanding that everyone around the cabinet table sign up publicly to the threat that the govern would resign if Monday's vote was lost. There could be no question, as some of the malcontents were suggesting, of a defeat leading to nothing more than Mr Major's replacement in 10 Downing Street by Mr Clarke or Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary. Mr Clarke made the point first in a typically frank briefing for political journalists. The full cabinet had backed the financing deal negotiated by the prime minister in Edinburgh two years ago. If it could not get such an international accord through the Commons it could not remain in power. No member of the cabinet honourably could seek to avoid an election by dumping Mr Major. Even the rightwing members of the cabinet who grumbled initially about the strategy admitted that it was a statement of the constitutionally obvious. But in the present atmosphere, it was inevitable the decision would be portrayed as a collective suicide pact. The irreconcilables - who are not noted for their consistency and who have for so long criticised Mr Major as a weak leader - now accused him of 'bullying' his party. It may be that the prime minister will never be able to reassert real authority; that after 15 years in office, the Conservative party has become ungovernable. As it staggers from one mishap to another, many within the administration have begun to admit such doubts. The mood in the country will be the critical determinant. The malcontents feed off the insecurity of the less committed majority on the Tory backbenches. They in turn are driven by fear of losing their seats. The government has been 20 or more points behind in the opinion polls for two years. No past administration has ever made up so much lost ground. Maybe, the waverers say to themselves, a new leader (and it would be Mr Clarke or Mr Heseltine, not Mr Lamont) might just turn it around. The scale of that task was outlined in the confidential memorandum prepared by Mr John Maples, the Tory deputy chairman, and first published in the FT at the start of the week. This included the observation that large pay awards cause 'real offence' to disillusioned Conservative voters. With painfully exquisite timing, the leak of the document coincided with the announcement that Mr Cedric Brown, the chief executive of the privatised monopoly British Gas, had been awarded a Pounds 205,000 a year annual pay increase. Save for his indiscreet language, Mr Maples' broader political assessment contained few suprises. Voters are fed up with the government and it will take more than a litany of populist promises from Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, to restore the Conservatives' reputation as the party of law and order. Flooding the hospitals with highly-paid accountants has not enhanced the party's efforts to appear a faithful guardian of the health service. Nor would anyone who has watched the party's clumsy attempts to destabilise Mr Tony Blair, the newly-elected Labour leader, have been taken aback by Mr Maples' judgment that he poses a threat to the Conservatives' grip on the centre ground. But it was the memorandum's frank admission that the economic recovery is not delivering a political upturn that struck the most worrying chord with nervous Tory MPs. They should have realised that virtue does not guarantee electoral success. The combination of steady growth and low inflation is not enough for most families to wipe out the costs of the recession and of the biggest tax increases since the second world war. For the average Tory voter, living standards, as Mr Maples admits, have been falling not rising. On Tuesday, Mr Clarke will assure them that the tide is beginning to turn. Virtue eventually will put money in people's pockets. If the party keeps its nerve, a fifth election victory is still possible. By this time next week, the present storm, like so many before it, might well have abated, giving Mr Major once again the breathing space to begin rebuilding his government's fortunes. But as the weeks and months go by, it becomes harder and harder to see how that will be possible before an election due in, at most, 2 1/2 years. It is too early to be certain the position is irrecoverable. But one thing is clear. The Conservative party must decide whether it really wants any longer to govern Britain.</p>

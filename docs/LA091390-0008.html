			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER THE CHURCH AND CELIBACY  </P> <P> Re: Jane Redmont's column "What Constitutes a Whole Person?" Commentary, Sept.  7) concerning celibacy in the Roman Catholic Church. It is obvious that Redmont  fails to understand the whole truth of Catholicism.  </P> <P> What was to me most disturbing was the lie that "The Roman Catholic Church has  developed a culture of concealment and secrecy around these (heterosexual and  homosexual) relationships (among priests) that breeds stress, lies and  heartbreak."  </P> <P> What is at issue here is commitment. When a priest vows celibacy, he disavows  intimate relationships with anyone but Christ. Just as in marriage, our vows to  our spouse disavow intimate relationships with anyone but our spouse.  </P> <P> The recent scandal of Atlanta Archbishop Eugene Marino shows only that there  are priests who break their vows, just as there are people who are unfaithful  to their spouses. This does not constitute changing Roman Catholic doctrine any  more than infidelity among married couples constitutes the abolition of the  sacrament and institution of marriage.  </P> <P> DAVID L. DUNTON  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

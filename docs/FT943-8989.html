			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A louse in the garden of Eden - Californian wine Until recently, the Napa Valley in northern California has seemed the wine region closest to heaven. On a previous visit there, I seriously thought the reason I was never troubled by a fly, wasp or mosquito was that insects did not dare interfere in this perfect little bucolic kingdom of mammon. How wrong I was. Today in the valley, and in much of Sonoma, its long-overshadowed neighbour, the wine industry's financial viability - already coming under severe scrutiny - has been gravely prejudiced by the activities of two tiny insects. The phylloxera louse, which threatened to destroy Europe's vineyards 100 years ago, has been steadily munching its way through thousands of acres of northern California vineyard, while leaf hoppers, or sharpshooters, have been busy transmitting the dreaded Pierce's disease, for which there is no known cure. The phylloxera-struck vineyards are being painstakingly ripped out, no matter how young - and the usual productive life cycle of a vineyard is at least 30 years - so that this beautiful wine valley, once a verdant sprawl in high summer, is today a patchwork of plots which tell their own story. Some owners just cannot summon up the cash or the will to renovate affected vineyards, and their decrepit vines stare balefully at visitor and resident alike, a constant reminder of the economic pressures which have squeezed so much of the glamour out of the northern California wine scene in the past few years. Many have taken a deep breath and are replanting millions of vines each year so that the symbol of the era has come to be not vines but the open-bottomed milk cartons which are put around each tender new plant to protect it from frosts and predators. (There is surely a market opportunity there for a more aesthetically acceptable substitute.) And then there are those few growers lucky or clever enough to have avoided the rootstock that has succumbed to phylloxera. But Californians are nothing if not optimistic. The official line is that this vineyard devastation is a blessing in disguise. The enforced replanting, they point out, is allowing them to improve, much earlier than anticipated, their vineyard and vine design, and to choose more suitable grape varieties for each site. Such spirit. So what are they choosing to plant? Rich Kunde is California's most influential vine nurseryman and, luckily for the rest of us, a keen record keeper of the vines he grafts, three years ahead of their being able to produce wine. Well Chardonnay, the wine world's darling, would be expected to be increasing its domination of California's vignoble, but Chardonnay grape prices have been falling and, last year, Chardonnay cuttings were only just more popular than Kunde's most sought-after red wine variety. For some years now this has been not the expected Cabernet Sauvignon but the softer Merlot - Cabernet without the pain. Cabernet Sauvignon comes a poor third and there is clear evidence of a new-found pride in California's 'own' Zinfandel, both in prices paid and area planted. Red wine varieties have at long last become more popular than white, largely thanks to their association with lower risks of heart disease. The tonic factor. But the really hot item is a white variety, Viognier. Although fewer than 200 acres were in production in time for the 1993 vintage, Kunde supplied almost as much of this obscure north Rhone white grape variety this year as he did of either Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Noir, two of the state's proven vine variety classics. California Viogniers tend to have more substance than their counterparts in the south of France, which has also fallen victim to Viognier mania. The most notable example of this weight is Calera's 1993, made from vines planted in the relatively prehistoric early 1980s and notching up a hefty 14.5 per cent alcohol. Kunde's own-label Viognier is, hardly surprisingly, considerably lighter, while Joseph Phelps's would probably be the ideal choice for those seeking a Condrieu substitute. Red Rhone varieties have been equally popular. You can still charge a Dollars 10 premium on any bottle carrying the magic words Syrah or Mourvedre, and new Rhonish bottlings are sprouting up all over the state, helped by California's considerable acreage of Grenache, and the discovery that the ancient vines for long despised as Mataro are in fact none other than Bandol's own Mourvedre. Jade Mountain's examples are impressively exuberant, and Bonny Doon's (also imported into the UK by Morris &amp; Verdin of London SW1) would be worth buying for the labels alone. But it looks as though California's vineyards for the next three decades will reflect not just the current vogue for Rhone varieties, but also the coming trend in favour of all things Italian. Sangiovese cuttings were in huge demand this spring, and California's first attempt at the variety disappeared off the shelves as soon it arrived. The best example I have tasted is Villa Ragazzi, one of the many annoying California wines made in tiny, almost uncommercial quantities - in this case by Mondavi's winemaker Charles Thomas, from fruit grown by the Rodeno family, associated with St Supery winery and a Napa law firm. And the influential Robert Mondavi is said to be getting in on the Italian act (as well it might, considering its origins), with the trend-setting release next year of varietal whites labelled Tocai Friulano and Malvasia Bianca. Elsewhere, Ivan Tamas has even managed to make a creditable, full-flavoured varietal Trebbiano, a variety that is regarded as a ubiquitous embarrassment in central Italy. It seems as though California's big re-plant may be being dictated less by detailed site analysis and more, as usual, by the great god fashion.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cash shortage limits jute council projects THE INTERNATIONAL Jute Council, hamstrung by a lack of funds, could launch only two projects at its recent meeting in Dhaka. These were for the promotion of jute goods in Japan and the use of enzyme and microbiological process for upgrading low grade jute and jute cuttings. According to a study by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, the consumption of jute goods in Japan, considered the most lucrative market for the fibre, has been declining by more than 4 per cent a year since 1973. The shrinkage in the demand for rice bags and carpet-backing cloth in Japan has hit in almost equal measure India, Bangladesh, Thailand and China. There has, however, been a marginal increase in the demand for jute yarn in Japan. The jute council shares the view of exporting countries that the demand for jute goods in environment-conscious Japan could be given a boost through effective market promotion measures. Japan itself has agreed to underwrite the greater part of the market development expenditure. The enzyme project holds great promise for all jute producing countries, as inferior quality jute constitutes nearly 30 per cent of total fibre production. It has been established on a pilot scale at two jute mills in Bangladesh that enzymic treatment leads to a significant improvement in fibre quality. The project is to be financed by Canadian and French lines of credit. Concern has been expressed at the council, however, about the poor funding prospects for projects that have already been appraised by its committee on projects. Among the more important projects crying out for funding are those concerning the development of jute-based packaging, diversified uses for jute blended fabrics, an improved spinning process, the introduction of high speed rapier looms, and the promotion of jute goods in the US, Australia and New Zealand. Work on some existing projects has also slowed down considerably for want of funds.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: 30% rise in house sales for Persimmon - Shares advance as uncovered dividend held despite halving of profits to Pounds 10.2m MR DUNCAN Davidson, chairman of Persimmon, the York-based housebuilder, said that since the new year the group's house sales had jumped 30 per cent compared with the same period in 1992. This further confirmation of a revival in the UK housing market, together with the fact that group did not announce a rights issue with its results for 1992, sent the shares 5p higher to 240p. The group also announced it was maintaining its final dividend at 5.8p making an unchanged total of 8.6p. This was despite a drop in earnings per share from 16.8p to 7.3p, pre-tax profits having been halved at Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 22.3m). Persimmon plans to increase its output from 2,340 homes last year, up from 2,324, to 4,000 homes a year by the mid-1990s, making it one of Britain's five largest housebuilders. Mr Davidson said that it would be in the best interests of shareholders to finance this expansion from cash flow, improved margins and increased borrowings, although, he could not rule out a rights issue at some stage in the future. Net debt of Pounds 33m (Pounds 32m) at the end of last year was equivalent to gearing of 26 per cent. Interest payable rose from Pounds 2.58m to Pounds 4.1m. Persimmon said that profits last year would have been higher but for a Pounds 3.1m provision against some of the group's development sites. If provisions were excluded the dividend was covered 1.23 times it said. Mr Davidson said that the company had sold 1,318 houses during the first two months of this year, compared with 1,028 in the corresponding period last year. However, he remained cautious of talking about a revival in the housing market. 'We have seen these sort of gains before only for rises to peter out. Let us hope we are looking at a more sustained increase this time.' COMMENT Persimmon, anticipating a revival in house sales, increased the number of sites from which it sells by more than a quarter during the past 18 months. A delay in recovery meant that it was carrying additional overheads last year while net operating margins, before provisions, shrank from 16 per cent to just 9 per cent. The group therefore needs to increase volume sales. Only then will it be able to start reducing sales incentives and recover some of its lost margin. Improvement in margins is likely to be slow and is not expected to occur until later in the second half, provided the current sales improvement is maintained. The intention to increase gearing rather than raise new equity to support expansion is to be applauded however. Sales of 2,850 homes this year should provide pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 16m putting the group on prospective p/e of more than 20. Any improvement is already in the price.</p>

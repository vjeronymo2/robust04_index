			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Company insolvency down by 15% Company insolvencies in England and Wales fell 15 per cent last year, providing further evidence that economic recovery is under way, the British Chambers of Commerce said yesterday. Total company insolvencies in 1993 were 20,825 on a seasonally adjusted basis, a fall of 15 per cent on 1992. Individual insolvencies fell by 0.4 per cent to 36,645. In the fourth quarter the number of company insolvencies fell by 9 per cent to 4,634 compared to the previous quarter, and the lowest figure since the fourth quarter of 1990. The number of individual insolvencies was down by 7 per cent to 8,513 on the previous quarter. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that the fall in insolvencies was good for the confidence of both employees and consumers. 'It will staunch the decline in capacity and will continue to ease the burden of bad debt on business,' he said. 'While insolvencies are still at a higher level than pre-recession, the improvement has been clear and steady for over a year and looks set to continue.' For 1993 the number of company insolvencies stood at 2.3 per cent of active companies and 2 per cent of registered companies. Of the insolvencies 8,361 were compulsory liquidations, while 12,464 were creditors' voluntary liquidations. In Scotland the number of insolvencies fell to 107 in the fourth quarter according to provisional figures that were not seasonally adjusted. On the same basis Scottish insolvencies for 1993 amounted to 551 compared with 670 in 1992. The number of individual insolvencies in Scotland fell to 411 in the fourth quarter (again on provisional non-seasonably adjusted figures), compared with 404 in the third quarter, itself the lowest figure since the third quarter of 1988.</p>

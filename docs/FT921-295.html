			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (12): Confident about the future - Profile: Krka pharmaceuticals IT is a good thing that Krka's balance sheet does not depend on sales of snails. The war, and the breakdown of the transport and distribution network throughout most parts of the former Yugoslavia, have meant that Krka has not been able to obtain snails from the republic of Serbia. Luckily, snails, which are exported by Krka to France, make up a tiny fraction of the exports of a company which is Slovenia's largest ,manufacturer of pharmaceuticals. The pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and tough business, as Mr Joze Colaric, director of Krka's export division, is the first to admit. The collapse of the communist system throughout the countries of eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), or former Soviet Union, has opened up opportunities for western companies. But Mr Colaric reckons that Krka is in a strong position to maintain, and expand its markets in this region because of its experience and presence in this part of Europe for several years. Exports of pharmaceutical products account for 3.6 per cent of Slovenia's exports. In the first nine months of last year, Krka's exports to eastern Europe increased by 18 per cent to 78 per cent, compared to the same period in 1990. In particular, exports to Poland in 1991 totalled Dollars 30m, an increase of Dollars 19.3m. Krka's turnover in 1991 amounted to Dollars 280m, of which Dollars 120m was earned from exports to eastern Europe, and Dollars 14m earned from exports to western markets. 'We export ready-made drugs to eastern Europe and the CIS, and raw materials to western countries,' explains Mr Colaric. 'Our strengths are in exporting finished products to eastern Europe. We know these markets inside out,' he says. Closer to home, Krka realises that it cannot ignore the market in the former Yugoslavia. Sales to the Yugoslav market fell by 20 per cent in 1991 and are expected to fall by an additional 5 per cent. This is hardly surprising, given the war, the disruption in the monetary and financial system, and the poor relations between Slovenia and Serbia, which opposed Slovenia's declaration of independence on June 25. Indeed, Krka lost one of its recently-built factories in Surljig, in the republic of Serbia, after the local workforce took over control of the plant. Despite the problems, Mr Colaric is optimistic about Krka's future relations with the former Yugoslavia. 'Outstanding payments owed by Serbia to Krka amount to Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m,' he said. 'But we are still supplying Serbia. The republic pays us with sugar, soya beans, starch and copper. Serbia is strong in raw materials.' Krka is fortunate in the sense that 70 per cent of its raw materials for pharmaceutical products are manufactured in Slovenia. Inevitably, as economic reforms in Slovenia progress, and financial discipline is introduced in a banking and accounting system which was extremely lax, companies such as Krka will have to think hard about ownership structures. At the moment, the company is socially-owned, which means that the workforce, not the state or private individuals, can decide about its future. 'We are interested in foreign partners, but we want to have a controlling interest in the company,' said Mr Colaric. Krka is in need of capital. Its long-term debts total Dollars 1m and its commercial debts - to suppliers - amount to Dollars 12m. But because its reputation among western pharmaceutical companies is high - companies such as Wellcome and Sandoz have extended licences to Krka - and because Krka has an attractive network of spas throughout Slovenia which account for 10 per cent of its annual turnover, Mr Colaric believes the company is in a strong negotiating position. 'We know the region (of eastern Europe), we know the markets, our labour costs are low, and we have a highly-skilled work force. We are confident about the future,' he adds.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Germany set for week of protests and stoppages Germany is bracing for strikes and demonstrations in the engineering sector this week as the unions step up their fight over pay and benefits. Workers in several factories briefly downed tools on Saturday foreshadowing what the unions hope will be a wave of action throughout western Germany. The IG Metall union has set a two-week deadline for employers to make a 'serious' wage offer, after which formal strikes would be unavoidable. In the first phase of pay talks regional employers' groups refused to discuss IG Metall proposals for between 5.5 per cent and 6 per cent more pay. Although the union has said it would accept less in return for job guarantees or promises of fewer redundancies, the employers are understood to be seeking further concessions, including reductions in holiday pay and changes to the basic agreement. IG Metall has said it will call warning strikes - usually stoppages of up to an hour or more - in selected companies starting today. Although they represent the lowest step on the escalation ladder, such strikes can be severely disruptive, interrupting just-in-time deliveries to other companies, for example. Asea Brown Boveri, one of Germany's biggest engineering concerns, warned last week that it could not be blackmailed by strike threats. The Swiss-based multinational could move production to other bases, even in eastern Europe, at short notice, according to Mr Eberhard von Koerber, head of ABB's German operations. Whether the work came back to Germany later was another question, he told journalists in Baden-Baden. Mr Dieter Kirchner, head of the Gesamtmetall engineering employers' association, told Bild am Sonntag newspaper yesterday that even the unions conceded that 10 per cent of companies in the sector would go bankrupt in a strike. However, industry executives are confident that serious conflict will be avoided because they doubt union members have the heart for a struggle. The automotive and mechanical engineering industries alone shed 240,000 jobs last year. Many large companies have also negotiated in-house deals, diluting the traditional national pattern of agreements, but often incorporating measures to protect jobs.</p>

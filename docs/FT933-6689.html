			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Arts: Much ado about glamour - Cinema MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING (PG) Kenneth Branagh IN THE LINE OF FIRE (15) Wolfgang Petersen LE SAMOURAI (PG) Jean-Pierre Melville BENNY'S VIDEO (18) Michael Haneke A funny thing happened to Kenneth Branagh's Benedick and Emma Thompson's Beatrice on the way to Messina, Sicily, the setting for Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing. They were waylaid in Tuscany - much prettier - and decided to film there. William Shakespeare, technical adviser emeritus, murmured grudging approval from the grave; parched southern plains were replaced by vine-clad northern hills; and signed-up Hollywood stars Denzel Washington (Don Pedro), Keanu Reeves (Don John) and Michael Keaton (Dogberry) could be made to feel at home in Italy's answer to California's Napa Valley. Much Ado About Nothing is a travesty, but oh what a lovely one. Having found Branagh's Henry V near-unsittable-through as an essay in penurious perversity - all that Olivier pageantry expelled, all those Olivier-dumped conspiracy scenes shoved back in - I find myself all for perversity when it is as glamorous as this. Filmed in eternal sunshine in the Villa Somewhere-or-other, the Bard's darkest comedy is shaken about like glittering gold foil. Even the melodrama scintillates. Poor Hero (Kate Beckinsale), framed for infidelity by wicked Don John (Keanu Reeves in black leather trousers) and spurned by fiance Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard), takes the only course a young gel could in those days (the days of convoluted Shakespearean subplots) and pretends to have died. But played for serio-comedy by Branagh's mixed-race thespians, even this ancillary tale takes on a loopy splendour. We are so colourfully discombobulated by the anything-goes casting - Don Pedro a black American, Claudio a white American and Hero's father a true Brit (Richard Briers) - that our minds home in on what seems by comparison the darkly steadfast reality of the story. As for Benedick and Beatrice, there is little scope for improvement. Producer-director-star-adaptor Kenneth Branagh, after a talent search the length and breadth of his living room, cast Emma Thompson as the haughty love-spurning lady. The Oscar-fresh actress repays the kindness with a delicious performance: it manages like fine wine to be at once rich, intoxicating and amused at its own presumption. Branagh himself, bearded, busy, bemused, his doughy face improved by baking in the sun, tosses the lines about with as happy a comic dexterity as he juggles with an anachronous deck-chair. The Americans span a gamut from the excellent (Washington) via the adequate (Leonard) to the awful (Keaton's hoarse-voiced Dogberry, Irishing away like Barry Fitzgerald with laryngitis). But this film is, in the best sense, a party. All who come are served; even the odd bore lends variety (provided he is odd enough); and if, dear reader, you feel there can be no final excuse for turning a Shakespearean play into a star-studded Tuscan travelogue, I suggest that you go to see the film and get mugged by its magic as I did. ***** The two greatest landscapes in American cinema are Monument Valley and Clint Eastwood's face. That scorched, beaten-leather physiognomy is back again in In The Line Of Fire. It fronts a plot more catchpenny than the majestic Unforgiven - guns, chases, psychos, Presidential assassination bids - but just as astonishing for its further revelation of Clint the icon. He now resembles some photogravure from the old West, fissured with facial fault-lines and landmarked with craters and ridges, who has been inexplicably spirited to new Washington. The Eastwood voice goes with the Eastwood face: a cracked, caressing whisper sandpapered by eternity. This man surely spent his life standing at the edge of deserts, his features sculpted by the sandstorms, his voice by the dehydrating winds? But no: he has spent his life on the Californian coast where the only deserts are inside film producers' brains. In The Line Of Fire is medium-good Clint fare. That is to say, it has an idiotic plot redeemed by the action set-pieces, the one-line wisecracks and Eastwood himself. He is a White House-attached Secret Service veteran who longs to redeem his lapse back in 1963 when he failed to stop the bullet that killed JFK. (Note the dawn of the Failed Presidential Security-Man movie: see also Kevin Costner in The Bodyguard, haunted by the bullet that passed him to hit Reagan). John Malkovich, with cupid lips and psychotic purr, is the would-be assassin of the new President, and JM and our hero spend much of the movie exchanging verbal venom down a telephone line. This allows us to watch Eastwood silently reacting to Malkovich's voice-off taunts and to savour the star's parchment-textured phiz writing palimpsests of silent emotion onto the screen. Later the film erupts into the streets and becomes far less scenic. After Clint the Movie here is Hollywood the Puppet-Show. Everyone chases everyone else down alleys, over rooftops and into assassination-ready VIP banquets where the screams of the guests lie in wait with the silver-covered entrees. Germany's Wolfgang Petersen (The Never Ending Story, The Boat) joins the new generation of Hollywood action directors drafted from Europe. Like Paul 'RoboCop' Verhoeven and Renny 'Cliffhanger' Harlin, he has a mechanistic efficiency in action sequences and a Nordic delight in knife-twisting in scenes of emotional stress or suspense. Would an American director, apart from honest Clint himself in Unforgiven, portray Eastwood as quite such a racked Grunewald presence? Or encourage the scene where our hero breaks down in tears at the memory of that day in Dallas? After this, Eastwood looks as if he could go straight into the histrionic heavyweight ring and give us Buchner or Strindberg. ***** Eastwood, like all iconic screen heroes, started impassive. So did France's Alain Delon. We see him young in Jean-Pierre Melville's reissued thriller Le Samourai (1967) where our (anti)hero is a walking mannequin in trenchcoat, black hat and charismatic scowl. Delon imparts a perverse, unyielding glamour to this plot about a gunman, a girl (Nathalie Delon), another girl (Cathy Rodier) and a police inspector (Francois Perier, fiendish, funny), all playing existential cat and mouse as if they have just read Conrad's The Secret Agent in French. Delon kills for hire; he keeps a caged budgerigar; he steals cars; he wears secret smirk. These are all anti-social activities, but they are rendered magnetic - nay more, mystical, profound, inviting - by that strange ability movie stars have to make 'Keep Out' signs read like 'Come In'. As in Eastwood's movie, nothing measures up to the central presence. Jean-Pierre Melville is a modish name in cinephile circles and still deserves respect for films like Les Enfants Terribles and L'Armee Des Ombres. But Le Samourai is the fag end of first-generation French film noir: a shadowy, blue-hazed teaser that twists and twirls its little plot of betrayal and counter-betrayal amid sets and costumes that themselves betray the incongruous dawn of 1960s hedonism. ***** Benny's Video, by Austrian film-maker Michael Haneke, has an impassive criminal for our own times. A boy with a bedroomful of video equipment 'motivelessly' kills a young girl: on camera, with a slaughterhouse gun, to the accompaniment of her screams. His parents later see the offending video and are shocked rigid. But they try to sweep away the evidence for Sonny's sake. Then, weeks later, Sonny thinks, 'What a perfect opportunity to sweep them away.' This bleak, mordant, Ian McEwan-ish story is spun out to 105 minutes: a length at which it starts to seem less like a darkly ingenious fable than a single meretricious idea surrounded by quantities of narrative cladding. Wait for Benny's Video the video, and be prepared to use the fast-forward.</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO MAN DIES DURING BLAZE  </P> <P> A 66-year-old San Fernando man died Sunday during a fire that authorities  believe was started by a cigarette.  </P> <P> The victim, who was not identified, apparently had been smoking and either fell  asleep or had lapsed into unconsciousness while sitting in a chair in his  living room, said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo. It was  unclear whether the victim, who suffered from diabetes, had died as a result of  the fire, Acevedo said.  </P> <P> No one else was inside the house, in the 1100 block of West Griffith Street,  when the fire broke out shortly after noon.  </P> <P> It took 12 firefighters about 15 minutes to extinguish the blaze, Acevedo said.  </P> <P> No other injuries were reported. Damage to the house and its contents was  estimated at $55,000.  </P> <P> Acevedo said an autopsy will be performed on the victim to determine the cause  of his death.  </P></p>

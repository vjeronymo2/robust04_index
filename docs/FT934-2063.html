			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Saddam to free two westerners Iraqi President Saddam Hussein yesterday ordered a Frenchman and German to be released from prison where they were both serving eight-year sentences for entering the country illegally from Kuwait, Reuter reports from Baghdad. The order to free Mr Jean-Luc Barierre and Mr Kai Sondermann followed visits to Iraq by two French members of parliament and a senior German politician. Last week Iraq freed three Britons after a personal appeal by former British prime minister Sir Edward Heath, who on returning to London urged resumed diplomatic ties with Iraq. But Ms Roselyne Bachelot, one of the French MPs who helped secure freedom for her compatriot held out little hope for automatic improvement in ties between France and Iraq.</p>

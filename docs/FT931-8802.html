			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Arts: Out of step - Television 'Would you trust the dancing?' This was the question George Balanchine asked a TV director when discussions were under way about recording some of his ballets. Balanchine was concerned with preserving his choreography's identity for television, and 'trusting the dancing' is a central problem for anyone who transfers stage work to the screen. The cases are all too numerous of choreographer's intentions traduced by oh-so-clever camera work. A variety of dance programmes on television during recent months - some recordings; some work specially conceived for the medium - have shown that TV often does not trust dance. (That it perpetuates a great deal of mediocre choreography and feeble performance is another, equally serious, matter.) Two fine directors of TV dance - Derek Bailey, Colin Nears - invariably provide scrupulous accounts of the choreography with which they are entrusted. Bailey's skill was very welcome in his recording of MacMillan's Winter Dreams on BBC2 at Christmas. Faced with a stage text which was a web of incident linking actuality and memory, he collaborated with MacMillan, and succeeded in preserving the poignant moods we knew from stage performance well and good. But to 'trust the dancing' is also to respect it in the context of history and of society, and the American series Dancing, which is currently clogging BBC 2 on Sunday evenings, is a horrid example of how not to present and explain dance on television. Dancing has such obvious and worthy intentions  -its message, oh dear, concerns 'the importance of dance in world culture'  -that adverse comment seems like mocking the afflicted. Afflicted the series sadly is: by uncertain vision, by tedious disquisitions from chattering heads, by historical inadequacy, and by a strand of what I take to be 'political correctness', so that the duller and more inconsiderable its social and ethnic concerns, the more unquestioning its acceptance of the material. (It is possible to know too much about shimmying posteriors in the Cook Islands, and about West African ritual.) Even to my willing gaze, the programmes are prodigiously earnest; to the less-than-dedicated, they must seem a festival of tedium. There have been visually exciting and informative sequences. The Japanese material was strong: impossible not to enjoy the hieratic splendour of the Gagaku ceremony, or the great Kabuki performers Tamasaburo and Ennosuke. Their art responds to the camera - the close study of Tamasaburo's onnagata playing, femininity concentrated to its most potent essence, was magnificent  -and they spoke revealingly about their craft. Fascinating, too, a section in the first programme about young Indian men in Birmingham who have revived bhangra dance, and have discovered in it cultural roots and the means of joyous wedding celebration. But we must set against these the footage - the mileage - about Brazilian and African dance, infinitely worthy, and flatter than Holland. How can movement so vivid in life, and so responsive to life, be made so dreary in the cause of information? With a certain naivete the programme-makers decided to define 'dancing' on their own arbitrary and sometimes questionable terms. Military ceremonial was 'choreography', as was a religious procession. Historical antecedents were sketchily evoked: comment about the court ballet of the 17th century was less than serious; discussion about the Christian religious dance tradition would have been better excised, so feeble was it. Faced with a subject vastly too large even for an eight-part series - and for what must have been a massive budget - the makers opted for something between the Readers' Digest and a bluffers' guide to ethnology. Dancing fails because it has no single controlling idea of what is meant by its title, no central and inspiring spokesman. The golden example of an extended arts series is Kenneth Clark's Civilisation. It remains a memorably valuable display of popular education because of Lord Clark himself. He persuaded us of the passion he felt for art in many forms, and his scholarship, so lightly worn, was a delight shared with his viewers. Enthusiasm is contagious on the small screen. Today, obsessive gardeners, manic cooks, are the Ancient Mariners of the box, holding us with a glittering eye. There have been moments in dancing when a voice, clear and authoritative, has won through: I thought Sheila Walker, an anthropologist from Texas, spoke with exemplary directness about American/African culture. But for the most part the commentary, read by Miranda Richardson, is a laundry-list of pieties. Scripts are carefully crafted from safe remarks - there seems neither desire nor time to be anything other than bland - interspersed with babble from 'authorities'. Too often their views have rung with special pleading; on occasion they have been inexact enough to make an aficionado wince. The programmes have lacked style as well as intellectual rigour. There have been too many of those generalisations which, by their need to inform on basic terms, tie history in granny-knots. (Relics of my former mess-deck vocabulary surfaced when we were told that Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty is 16. Petipa, whose creation she was, gave her age as 20). In a programme which offered an uneasy juxtaposition between classical ballet and Kabuki drama, the statement that ballet had 'retained an essential character for 300 years' set the jaw agape. One could equally question beliefs that were voiced on the value of a young dancer in the role of Aurora because 'it helps the character'. It takes a ballerina much of her career to learn how to dance the part. The linking of Petersburg classicism with Kabuki seemed gratuitous, and exasperatingly clever in the closing sequence which zipped with fine insensitivity between Beauty and Tokyo while the band played Tchaikovsky-ishly on. As the weeks have gone by, the series has taken on the air of being assembled in committee by anthropologists and sociologists. Editorial choices have looked odd, at times wilful, and fatally quaint. There is little point in showing newly-fashioned Baroque dances - they lack historical credibility - or in stressing the work of Katherine Dunham, interesting as it was in its time, while ignoring much of Spanish dance, and whisking through twentieth century ballet as if on the big dipper. The programme on American modern dance matched good spoken sense - Twyla Tharp, haranguing the camera, had vigorous opinions that should have made viewers realise that dancing is a lively art - with revealing film. But this was a rarity. On March 7, the final programme, introduced by the opera director Peter Sellars - hair by Stan Laurel - will be devoted to the 1990 Pacific Rim festival of 'Dancing in one World'. I find it the apotheosis of everything that is well-intentioned, woolly-minded and depressing about this series, as cohorts of dancers hop, skip and jump in the cause of ethnic bonhomie. That television can excite the viewer by exploring the communicative power of dancing was seen in a brave programme last summer. In The Far End of the Garden for BBC 2, Ross McGibbon, a Royal Ballet dancer turned director, looked at the choreographer Jonathan Burrows. McGibbon provided a sharp-eyed portrait of Burrows and his awkward, heart-tearing movement. He trusted the dance, and we understood its nature. Dancing, alas, has merely clouded the issue.</p>

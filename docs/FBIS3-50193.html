"This is the first  major step towards settling the matter. By this proposal,  Russia admits in principle its obligations, offering a specific  scheme for their payment," Deputy Prime Minister Valentin  Karabashev said after the meeting.    The Russians offer a translation of the transferable rubles  balance into U.S. dollars using a definite factor and payment  over five years after a five-year grace period, and rescheduling  of debts denominated in the clearing equivalent of the U.S.  dollar. The cabinet accepted all these proposals in principle  but mandated Mr. Karabashev to insist on an immediate start of  payments on the transferable ruble debt even if it would have to  be rescheduled over a longer period. These arrangements do not  involve the Bulgarian hard-currency debts to Russian banks, as  they are subject to the negotiations with Bulgaria's London Club  creditors, Mr. Karabashev specified. He hopes the negotiations  with the Russians will start as soon as possible but the exact  date has yet to be set. Mr. Karabashev said that the debts in  question amount to about 670 million transferable rubles and  $500 million U.S. (in clearing equivalent). Still, these are  not the final figures as some Bulgarian debts to Russia in  national currencies are yet to be deducted from these amounts  and the balances will be translated using a factor which has to  be negotiated.

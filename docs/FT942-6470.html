			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / The Markets: Coffee takes a well-earned break - Commodity Market Report There is an enforced break today from the heat and hysteria that has held sway in commodity markets during the past few weeks. Public holidays in the UK and the US will give traders a chance for a breather, and the investment funds whose money has been mainly responsible for the surge in commodity prices will be given an opportunity to consider where they go from here. Traders and analysts are split about the immediate prospects for the star performer, coffee, whose July futures price jumped on the London Commodities Exchange from Dollars 1,100 a tonne in February to a seven-year peak of Dollars 2,348 last week, before falling back to close at Dollars 2,004 on Friday. While most agree that coffee's rise is underpinned by a tightness in supplies, New York traders seem more confident than those in London that the price can find renewed strength this week. One event likely to take some heat out of the metals market is the Metal Bulletin copper conference, starting on Wednesday in Vancouver, which usually attracts many of the world's top traders. Copper has been leading other metals up or down on the London Metal Exchange but attention this week will also focus on nickel because the present labour contracts at Inco's metals complex at Sudbury, Ontario, end tomorrow. Inco is the world's second-biggest nickel producer (after Norilsk in Russia) and Sudbury produces about 110,000 tonnes of the metal, mainly used in stainless and special steels production. Inco's management delivered its proposals on Friday and unions and employees have been discussing them over the weekend. Some weeks ago a ballot gave union leaders a mandate to call a strike. The market last week seemed to sense that there would be no industrial action as the three-month LME nickel price, which started with a rise of Dollars 286.50 a tonne on Monday, fell steadily to close on Friday Dollars 45 down compared with the previous week at Dollars 6,427.50.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Drivers oppose road fee scheme THE GOVERNMENT faces severe public hostility to its plans to impose an extra charge on motorists for the use of motorways, the results of an opinion poll published today show. The poll suggests that 86 per cent of motorists are opposed to the idea of paying an extra charge. Later this month the government is due to publish a green paper on its plans for using motorway and trunk road charges as a means of funding its road-building programme. The government seems likely to suggest that drivers wishing to use motorways should be required to pay an annual supplementary licence fee. The poll of 1,079 motorists was carried out for the Royal Automobile Club by Research Surveys of Great Britain in March. It shows that 37 per cent of motorists say they will use motorways less often if charges are introduced.</p>

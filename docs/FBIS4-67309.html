			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jumma Khan: "Drug Money is Being Invested in </F> National Commerce and Industry"]    [Text] According to the latest news Pakistan, Afghanistan,  and India are the first, second, and third countries  respectively in drug production, abuse, and smuggling in the  whole world.    Mr. Giorgio Giacomelli, executive director of the UN  International Drug Control Program, is visiting Pakistan these  days. He addressed a press conference in the UN drug control  office in Karachi on Thursday and presented some facts and  figures on which one cannot but express remorse.    Mr. Giacomelli said that the number of drug addicts in the  world was three million. Half of them live in Pakistan! Pakistan  is not a very important drug producer, but drug abuse has  reached dangerous proportions here. According to Mr.  Giacomelli's records Pakistan produces 150 ton heroin and opium  annually. In Afghanistan, this amount has reached between 1,000  to 3000 tons. About 50,000 acres of land is used for growing  drug crops in Afghanistan. He explained that this was due to the  war raging in Afghanistan for about a decade. The United States  could not implement its drug control program because of it. This  has led to an increase in drug production, abuse, and smuggling  in Afghanistan.    The UN facts and figures have their own place, and we have  analyzed this problem more than once in this column. It is  surprising that an organization like the United Nations bases  its conclusions only on the magic of numbers. Why doesn't it  discuss the activities that give birth to these numbers? For  example, I had explained in detail in this column how the  production, use, and smuggling of drugs was on the rise in  Pakistan, and also that it was an extension of the increasing  production in Afghanistan. The war and civil war over two  decades in Afghanistan had opened the Afghan border for free  movement of the Mujaheddin. This helped drug dealers to  successfully transfer their business to Pakistan. Since the  United States had no objection to it at that time, this business  continued to flourish. Now that the U.S. interests in  Afghanistan have been served, it is continuously expressing its  dissatisfaction over Pakistan's increasing drug trade. At that  time when Pakistan had formed a blind policy on Afghanistan, did  not the United States know of the frightening outcome of this  trade? You can imagine how explosive this situation is by the  fact that when Pakistani government decided to limit the  movement on Afghanistan-Pakistan border and to close the border,  a situation was created that the government had to reverse its  decision. It is not difficult to estimate how long the hand of  the drug mafia is. Abduction of foreigners and government  officials is a common occurrence in Balochistan, Sarhad, and  Sindh.    The people of Balochistan, Sarhad, and Sindh are hostages of  the drug mafia. Terrorism and abductions are part of the same  story. It is deplorable that the law enforcement agencies know  these facts and, instead of taking action against the drug mafia  or making the Pakistan-Afghanistan border safer, they are taking  action against the peaceful citizens. This is not a secret that  no one is aware of.    At one time, Afghan citizens came to India for business, and  they were still viewed with suspicion. At present, a lot of  Afghans have Pakistani passports or identity cards and are  giving a bad name to Pakistan all over the world. This has  brought Pakistan to the top of the list of nations involved in  drug smuggling. Is it not the responsibility of these  organizations to record the fact that Pakistan got this curse  during the war while protecting U.S. interests in Afghanistan  without regard to the country and its people being destroyed?    A U.S. deputy secretary of state recently lamented that drug  money has penetrated Pakistani politics. However, this situation  was created by the U.S. government. Mr. Giacomelli states that  40 percent of Pakistan's GDP is drug money. This can be fatal to  any economy. He said that commerce and industry in Pakistan were  going into the hands of drug smugglers, therefore, Pakistani  government should be alert about them. He emphasized the need  for law enforcement and said that law enforcement agencies must  be made more effective.    The effectiveness of law enforcement agencies is contingent  upon their diligence. There is no guarantee that they will not  be effected by the "glamour." In the present situation of our  law enforcement agencies, any legal action will be useless. But,  what does Mr. Giacomelli know!    Mr. Giacomelli knows that 25 percent of Pakistan's raw  material production last year was from drug money, and this had  doubled to 50 percent in one year.    Still, Mr. Giacomelli does not want to debate the "why" of  this situation. Perhaps, he does not want to raise this issue on  purpose. However, it cannot be left alone.    We have to first determine which people of which group have  what benefits associated with this business. Until this basic  fact is determined, no drug program can be successful. This  subject is extremely difficult, but we have to discuss it one  day.    Mr. Giacomelli informed us that the United Nations and its  agency is planning to start a program in cooperation with Iran  and Pakistan to reduce drug production in South Asia and to stop  drug smuggling from this region to the West. This program will  cost three million dollars. Iran will contribute $20 million  while the United Nations and Pakistan will contribute $5 million  each.    Mr. Giacomelli while explaining details of his meetings with  the prime minister and the president said that Pakistan was very  troubled by this drug situation and is willing to cooperate with  the United Nations. However, he said that if Pakistan's  industry, commerce, and politics were fully controlled by the  drug Mafia, there will be extremely dangerous results and  Pakistan's economy will be destroyed.    If we look at our national politics in the context of drugs,  do we not see the bitter fact that youthful, strong, and active  forces of our society have been made helpless and innocent  people who are being left at the mercy of the drug mafia? No  village or city is safe from the terrorists. Is it not pathetic  that the forces that can stand firm against the drug mafia are  being pushed forcibly against the wall? The forces that can be  used against the anti-social elements, terrorists, and drug  dealers, are being murdered by the hands of those who are  supposed to enforce laws. The question is: Who has invested in  what part of this trade? Why are these operations and fake  campaigns of the drug enforcement agencies so aberrant.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHARTS, VIGO LIFT CSUN WITH KEY HOME RUNS  </P> <P> Just as Cal State Northridge was about to be enveloped by darkness and its own  error-prone play Friday, Scott Sharts, Denny Vigo and a soon-to-be beleaguered  relief ace named Jamy Villa reduced the game of baseball to its basics.  </P> <P> The result was an unlikely 10-9 victory for CSUN over California Collegiate  Athletic Assn. foe Cal State Dominguez Hills.  </P> <P> Villa, Dominguez Hills' hard-throwing closer, faced Sharts, CSUN's Sultan of  Swat, with one on, two out, and the Toros clinging to a two-run lead in the  bottom of the ninth inning.  </P> <P> Then George Wing, Dominguez Hills' coach, sauntered to the mound. Keep the ball  in on his hands, Wing told his ace right-hander. Nothing out over the plate.  </P> <P> The count went to three balls and two strikes and Villa did exactly what he was  told not to do: He threw a fastball over the outside portion of the plate.  </P> <P> It was last seen sailing over the fence in right center field -- Sharts' third  home run in three hours. It ties the score.  </P> <P> Up stepped Vigo, CSUN's other Matador of Muscle, as Northridge Coach Bill  Kernen offered a tip for his sophomore slugger as the sun dipped under the  horizon.  </P> <P> Kernen, fearing that the umpire was about to suspend the game because of  darkness, wanted to make sure the previous two runs would count. Swing for the  fence, he told Vigo. If you strike out, we're tied and we can start all over  another day. And if you hit it . . .  </P> <P> Vigo soon addressed that possibility, blasting a full-count fastball high over  the left-field fence to keep CSUN undefeated in three CCAA games, 8-5 overall.  </P> <P> "Really, we dodged a bullet," Kernen said. "We made a baserunning error, we  threw the ball around on defense and we didn't throw strikes.  </P> <P> "But we did hit the ball well."  </P> <P> Indeed. Northridge punched out 14 hits, including five home runs -- a  school-record-tying three by Sharts and two by Vigo -- against a trio of Toro  pitchers.  </P> <P> Vigo's game-winner -- his fourth homer in three games -- afforded the Matadors  an opportunity to forget, at least temporarily, three errors, seven walks, and  a base-running blunder by Greg Shockey that almost cost them the game.  </P> <P> Shockey led off the bottom of the ninth with a single, advanced to second when  Eric Johnson walked, then was caught in a rundown when he failed to break for  third on a hit-and-run play.  </P> <P> Reliever Todd Denhart pitched a rather shaky 4 2/3 innings to pick up his  second victory. Denhart allowed three runs, two earned, on six hits, and he  walked one and struck out six after replacing starter Monte Jones.  </P> <P> Northridge led, 6-3, after four innings, scoring twice in the first, twice in  the third -- on back-to-back homers by Sharts and Vigo -- and two more in the  fourth on a two-run blast by Sharts, who would finish with four hits and six  runs batted in.  </P> <P> Dominguez (6-4-1, 0-1) took the lead with a four-run fifth inning, then added  two more in the seventh. CSUN pushed over an unearned run in the seventh.  </P></p>

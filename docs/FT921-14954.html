			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Russia and Ukraine settle row over control of Black Sea fleet RUSSIA and Ukraine have patched up their quarrel over control of the Black Sea fleet of the former Soviet navy, but overall control of the military remains uncertain, and other republics are preparing to take over military units on their territories. The Russian side appears to have come off best in the weekend talks with Ukrainian representatives in Kiev. The military, supported by Russia, had argued that the fleet was strategic, and as such belonged under central command. Members of the Commonwealth of Independent States agreed that Moscow should have control of strategic forces at a meeting in Minsk in December 30. The agreement reached at the weekend gives an unspecified part of the fleet to Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said after the meeting that ships capable of carrying nuclear weapons - estimated to be 70 per cent of the Black Sea fleet's 45 warships and 300 smaller craft - would remain under central command. Mr Vladimir Grynov, deputy leader of the Ukrainian parliament, was quoted as saying: 'The Black Sea fleet is not worth the stability of relations between Russia and the Ukraine'. The two states together make up more than two-thirds of the population of the former Soviet Union. An official communique issued yesterday did not mention the strong nationalist claims which prompted the dispute and which could still lead to further hard bargaining. The statement said a section of the fleet would form part of the armed forces Ukraine is setting up. Those forces will be separate from the commonwealth force. Ukraine had previously demanded control of the whole Black Sea fleet, based at the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol, under a carve-up of former Soviet armed forces. The statement said an expert commission would meet within a week, and until then 'the sides will refrain from any unilateral action on issues which are being examined'. The agreement seems likely to satisfy the increasingly bellicose generals and admirals, but may run into difficulties in Ukraine, where Russian moves are seen increasingly as the flexing of imperial muscle. In Belarus, the third and smallest of the Slav republics, the parliament agreed on Saturday to subordinate all army units to Belarussian control, and to require from them an oath of allegiance. Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, parliamentary chairman, said Russia was trying to force the troops in Belarus to sign an oath of allegiance to Russia. Russian president Boris Yeltsin last week signed a decree making an oath of allegiance to Russia obligatory for all serving personnel. Other states have reacted with alarm to this move. A weekend report in the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta said Mr Yeltsin was about to decree that Russia would command all former Soviet forces until the Commonwealth agreed a common line on defence, an event that currently seems unlikely.

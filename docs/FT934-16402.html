			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Liffe in discussions over listing for Euroyen LIFFE, the London Inter-national Financial Futures and Options Exchange, is exploring the possibility of listing a Euroyen futures contract in order to extend its range of short-term interest rate contracts. Liffe is in discussions with the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange (Tiffe) the possibility of listing Tiffe's Euroyen futures contract, rather than developing its own product. Liffe already has a link with the Tokyo stock exchange which allows it to list the TSE's Japanese government bond futures contract. Mr Roger Barton, managing director of business development at Liffe, said preliminary research had suggested that several members of Liffe see the need for a Euroyen contract. 'A substantial number (of members) think we should list a contract which is linked into Tiffe,' he said, stressing this would provide members with a product that could be traded in the European time zone. However, some traders see little need for Liffe to list a Euroyen contract, given that the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (Simex) already lists a Euroyen contract that can be traded during the early part of the European day. The Simex Euroyen contract is similar to Tiffe's product, but not as heavily traded. Mr Barton said the average daily volume for Tiffe's Euroyen contract is about 83,000 contracts, compared with about 12,000 for the Simex. The OM Stockholm and OMLX exchange in London traded 2.49m contracts in September, down from August's 2.83m but a rise of more than 50 per cent compared with September last year, Reuter reports. The exchanges said the rise this year was fuelled by growth in Swedish bond and interest rate futures.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 8 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran President  Carlos Roberto Reina said today that the alleged plot to  assassinate him, hatched by fellow Honduran Luis Hernandez Sosa  in complicity with three Nicaraguans, is "a case of gangsterism  and drug trafficking."    Speaking briefly with reporters in the city of San Pedro  Sula  in northern Honduras, Reina pointed out that the conspirators  initially intended to set a factory on fire but later thought it  "a better deal to assassinate the president." "A white book is  going to be opened to outline in detail everything that has  happened in this case and the people will be informed," the  Honduran president said.    Reina reiterated that this is a case of "gangsters or drug  traffickers who came to Honduras to burn down a paint factory  and then perpetrate a kidnapping, but it occurred to them that  it might be a better deal to kill the Honduran president."    Reina's statements corroborated local media reports to the  effect that Hernandez Sosa, who yesterday surrendered to the  authorities accompanied by human rights leaders, is involved in  drug trafficking. Hernandez Sosa, 30, was turned over to the  police in Tegucigalpa, who were unaware of his whereabouts,  after appearing in court escorted by members of the (government)  National Human Rights Ombudsmanship.    The alleged conspirator, who is being held in a special cell  at the National Penitentiary and under strict surveillance by  Army troops, pointed out: "It is stupid to think that I wanted  to murder the president." In a brief message he sent to the  media today, Hernandez Sosa requested that his family be  informed that he is well, has faith in God, and will emerge  unblemished from this case.    The newspaper LA PRENSA reported today that Hernandez Sosa  allegedly hatched the plot against the president to "slip away"  from a group of alleged drug traffickers to whom he owed money.  According to this report, Hernandez put the plan together with  an unspecified quantity of money given to him by cocaine  addicts, who were now demanding their money.    A government source today told ACAN-EFE that there is proof  of Hernandez Sosa's drug trafficking activities, which will help  resolve the alleged plot against President Reina, about which  the Honduran authorities were notified on 13 March by the  Nicaraguan Government.    Meanwhile, two of the three Nicaraguans implicated in the  plot have been arrested by the Nicaraguan police, who have not  made any disclosures regarding the depth of their involvement in  the plot. The detainees are Luis Rene Quintero, who alerted the  Nicaraguan authorities to the plot and helped thwart it, and  Santiago Rivas who has denied any involvement. Meanwhile, Roger  Arguello's whereabouts are unknown.    Honduran Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso Discua said  last Wednesday that the investigation of the plot has been  "dashed" because of the information that has been leaked by the  press.    Certain opposition politicians have not dismissed the  possibility that the alleged plot against Reina is a "smoke  screen" to distract the people's attention from the country's  economic problems.</p>

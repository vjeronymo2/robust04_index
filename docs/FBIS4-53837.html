			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Lambastes Kim Yong-sam Group's Suppression </F> of Hanchongnyon" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam fascist  clique have defined the South Korean Federation of General  Student Councils (Hanchongnyon), the patriotic vanguard of the  South Korean students, as "an organization benefiting the enemy"  and threw a police dragnet to arrest its chairman and the  chairman of its national reunification committee. This is a  premeditated fascist offensive to lacerate with the bayonet  Hanchongnyon and students that are taking the lead in the  movement for independence, democracy and reunification.    NODONG SINMUN says this in a commentary today.    Noting that Hanchongnyon resolved to build itself up more  solidly and invigorate the movement for independence, democracy  and reunification at the second-term inauguration of  Hanchongnyon, the paper says: This deserves a praise by nation,  not suppression.    The analyst continues:    The Kim Yong-sam group's repressive offensive against  Hanchongnyon is part of its persistent moves to destroy  Hanchongnyon.    The Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors are scheming to block  the  action of the pro-reunification democratic forces and ensure the  security of their power by getting rid of Hanchongnyon, the  vanguard of the movement for independence against the United  States, for democracy against fascism and for national  reunification.    Their repressive offensive against Hanchongnyon will add to  their crimes.    The Kim Yong-sam group must promptly stop the fascist  suppression of Hanchongnyon and students and step down from  power.</p>

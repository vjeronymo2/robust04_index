			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE POWER OUTAGE BLAMED ON WORK CREW  </P> <P> Operator error was identified this week as the cause of a line failure that  left the entire city of Glendale without electricity for more than an hour  Friday.  </P> <P> Ed Freudenburg, spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,  said Tuesday that an inquiry concluded that a mistake was made by a two-man  crew testing one of the two lines that carry electricity to Glendale through  the Air Way substation near San Fernando Road.  </P> <P> The precise nature of the mistake was still unknown.  </P> <P> Freudenburg said it had not been determined whether the error was due to a  failure in communication, poor judgment or a deficiency in procedures.  </P> <P> "We are looking at what procedures they followed or did not follow and whether  our procedures are correct," he said.  </P> <P> Electricity purchased by Glendale from suppliers outside the area comes to the  city over DWP lines. The connection is made by two 230,000-volt lines in the  Air Way substation, either capable of carrying the entire load.  </P> <P> Controls for the circuit-breaking equipment for the two lines are in one  location, said Marcy Lopez, a system engineer. Lopez said the two workers had  one line turned off for testing when they inadvertently opened a relay  controlling the other line, which stopped the flow of electricity.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At their conference in Kiev the Russian and  Ukrainian Unions of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs adopted a  joint appeal to their presidents, parliaments and governments,  expressing grave concern over the continuing destruction of  economic ties between the two countries. According to the  authors of the appeal, the reason for this lies in the  complicated settlements and unjustified customs restrictions  between Russia and Ukraine, which lead to stopping, completely  or partially, work at the plants and factories producing  consumer goods and the essential types of industrial products.    The industrialists and entrepreneurs urged the leaders of  their countries to create appropriate conditions for economic  integration between Russia and Ukraine and dismantle all the  barriers artificially put on the road of cooperation. In their  view the first steps in this direction could be to open  affiliations of Ukrainian banks in Russia and Russian in  Ukraine, establish preferential regime in bilateral trade, lift  the demand for advance payments and set up joint industrial and  financial groups.    The appeal was signed by the leaders of the Russian and  Ukrainian Unions of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Arkady  Volsky and Leonid Kuchma. Kuchma is a candidate for  presidential elections in Ukraine planned for 26 June.</p>

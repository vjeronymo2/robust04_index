			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Letter: Mines - private sector alternative, figures 'misleading', efficient but too costly Sir, You reported ('The UK Economy: PM 'regrets anguish' of unemployed', October 17) Mr Major's statement, in relation to coal closures, that 'stocks are increasing by more than 1m tonnes every month, and as a result of that we have been spending Pounds 100m a month of taxpayers' money to keep the pits open'. This latter figure has been used repeatedly by Mr Heseltine as his 'unanswerable case' for the closures. What does it mean? The 31 pits' operating loss over the last year totalled some Pounds 9m (figures for individual pits are given in my report, The Economic Costs of the Pit Closure Programme). The government's figure for subsidy, some 100 times larger, must be the total costs of production of these pits (roughly 2.5m tonnes a month at Pounds 40 a tonne). For this to represent taxpayers' subsidy it would have to be the case that the coal they produce was valueless. The prime minister says that stocks are increasing by more than 1m tonnes a month; indeed in the three months April-July total coal stocks rose by more than 1.5m tonnes a month (Energy Trends, September 1992, table 6). But there is a strong seasonal element in this, shown by a rise over the whole year to July of just over 0.5m tonnes a month. That this represents something like the underlying rate is confirmed by BC's own stock-building (that is, excluding the much more seasonally sensitive stocks at power stations etc) of 0.6m tonnes a month over the five months to end-September. This represents only one quarter of the output of the 31 threatened pits. So three-quarters of their output has up till now found a market at the going BC price. Nor is the part of the output of the 31 pits which has been stockpiled valueless. Around half of the stockpiling can be attributed to rising net imports of coal (some 300,000 tonnes a month higher in the second quarter of 1992 than a year earlier), and there is a case for valuing additions to stocks at the world price (say Pounds 30 a tonne). Such a valuation of stocks would only imply a loss for (and thus subsidy to) the pits under threat of around Pounds 9m a month. Even if the government's statement is referring to the financing of the whole value of the stock-building (in which case it should be made clear that it does not mean subsidising operating losses) then the figure would be some Pounds 25m a month. It is widely accepted that the economic effects of pit closure have to be assessed by balancing any operating subsidy involved against the exchequer costs of closures - some Pounds 110m a month in the first year (including redundancy payments) and Pounds 50m on a continuing basis (unemployment benefit, lost taxation, etc). But the main point here is that the government has produced only totally misleading figures for the current financial position of the pits to justify its policy.

			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Turkey braced for summer of discontent TURKEY'S 40,000 municipal workers are to strike from tomorrow, bringing cities to a standstill in the first test of the fragile consensus between labour unions and the coalition government. With wage negotiations deadlocked for 100,000 workers in public sector enterprises, and civil servants protesting against their pay award, Turkey is braced for a summer of industrial unrest. Labour unrest could prove a stumbling block to the two-party coalition's pledge to lift the restrictive union laws inherited after the 1980 military coup. The budget is already under pressure, and the cabinet appears divided whether to meet its promises or stick to its inflation targets and risk alienating a key political constituency for both the conservative True Path Party and the Social Democratic Populists. Last weekend, Mrs Tansu Ciller, chief economics minister, revived her plan for wage indexation, linking wage increases to the inflation rate, which is running at 70 per cent. Union leaders quickly rejected the plan. 'She's trying to put a freeze on wages,' says Mr Sevket Yilmaz, head of Turk-Is, the main union confederation. Mrs Ciller criticised the recent award to civil servants, a 30 per cent increase over six months which is estimated to add a third to the government's budget deficit. The recent award for the 500,000 civil servants is estimated to have cost the treasury an additional TL9,000bn (Dollars 1.3bn), compared with a targeted budget deficit of TL32,000bn. Agricultural workers were awarded an 86 per cent wage rise. It is unclear how the government proposes to finance the increase. The unions' case is that wages fell badly behind during the 1980s. The average daily wage is around Dollars 3 in state industries. Unions are trying to extend the social security net to compensate for low wages. Mr Yilmaz says he has the support of Mr Mehmet Mogultay, the SHP labour minister, who has proposed a job security bill requiring an employer to seek court approval before he can make people redundant. This could disrupt the government's privatisation programme. Turkey plans to raise TL5,500bn through sales of state assets in 1992. Bids were submitted last week for 11 state cement companies, a sale expected to raise Dollars 350-Dollars 400m. Freedom to restructure the labour force is an important incentive for the many foreign concerns showing interest in Turkey's state asset sales. Overmanning is seen as the main reason for the losses of the 220 state enterprises, which in 1991 came to an estimated TL13,000bn.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico dips and rallies Mexican stocks ended slightly down yesterday after a mixed session dominated by profit-taking and a technical rebound. Traders attributed the erratic session to two periods of profit-taking split by a technical rally. The market's volatility, they added, was enhanced because of mixed expectations for movements in key interest rates in today's central bank auction. Analysts are split as to whether the bellwether 28-day Cetes, or Treasury Bill, will see a slight fall or minor rise from last week's 15.80 per cent rate. Traders said profit-taking was so pronounced that the market's bellwether stock Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) was not the usual driving force behind the market's overall movement. Telmex shares closed higher. The IPC index lost a net 8.94 at 2,594.96, following a decline of 1.5 per cent on Monday and a rise of almost 8 per cent over the course of last week. Yesterday's turnover was a moderate 1.23bn new pesos. Telmex 'L' series shares - those available to foreign investors - were up 4 centavos at 10.74 new pesos.</p>

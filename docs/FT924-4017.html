			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: TGWU will cut cash for Labour THE Transport and General Workers Union, the largest union affiliated to Labour, has increased financial and political pressure on the party by announcing a phased reduction in the number of members it intends to affiliate. The TGWU, one of the historic pillars of the Labour party and which sponsors 38 Labour MPs, said it would cut the number of affiliated members from 1.07m to 750,000 by 1994. That will reduce the amount Labour receives from the union from Pounds 1.67m this year, excluding additional election expenses, to Pounds 1.35m by 1994, even taking account of an increase in the affiliation fee per member from Pounds 1.60 to Pounds 1.80. Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, said that the money would be diverted to other political ends, in particular to supporting local councillors and campaigning in Europe. He denied that the cut stemmed from irritation with the political direction of the Labour party. But the union's leadership has been openly dismayed by the post-election debate about loosening the links between the unions and the party, and the TGWU's action is bound to be seen as a mark of disapproval. It will also serve as a reminder of how financially dependent on the big unions Labour remains. Although the unions provide only about 60 per cent of the party's Pounds 9m-plus annual running costs, they also provide almost all election expenditure, nearly Pounds 8m at the last election. In addition to its basic affiliation fee, the TGWU probably spent more than Pounds 1m over the past two years on Labour's election fund. The cut in funds will not be welcomed by Labour, but some of the money may be covered by a rise in affiliation fees when the three main public-service unions merge to form Unison next year. Although the TGWU last year suffered a Pounds 12m deficit on its general fund, it is expected to be back in surplus by as much as Pounds 3m this year. Mr Morris emphasised that it was strategic rather than financial necessity that had led to the shift of funds away from Labour. He also pointed out that Labour-loyalist leaders such as Mr Jack Jones and Mr Ron Todd had cut affiliation by even larger amounts as a result of falling membership. Pressure for the wholesale removal of trade unionists from the process of selecting or deselecting MPs is to be stepped up by a rightwing Labour party grouping headed by a former leading union official, Ivo Dawnay adds. The Labour First group, chaired by Mr Brian Nicholson, a former TGWU chairman, yesterday said it was launching a nationwide campaign for a simple one-member-one-vote selection system entitled 'OMOV Now'.</p>

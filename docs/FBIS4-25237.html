			<p>BFN     [Text] Regarding it as a major matter in stabilizing the  overall situation and in promoting social and economic  development, women's federations at all levels in the province  have paid attention to the reemployment of laid-off female  workers in urban areas over the past two years. These  federations have also extensively launched the activity of  "encouraging women to pioneer new undertakings," and achieved  remarkable results. According to initial figures, some 100,000  laid-off female workers in the province have thus far returned  to their production posts with the help of women's federations,  and these women once more have hope. Huang Qizao, vice president  of the All-China Women's Federation, highly appraised the work  of women's federations at all levels in the province.    Liaoning is a major industrial province, employing 4.2  million female workers. While reform in employment, personnel,  and income distribution systems continuously deepened, the  competition resulted in 420,000 female workers losing their jobs  for a variety of practical and historical reasons. Experiencing  difficulties in making ends meet, some of these women lost their  mental balance and become a hot social problem. Faced with this  new contradiction, women's federations at all levels in the  province marked the appropriate rehiring of laid-off female  workers as the focal point of the activity to "encourage women  to make contributions" in an effort to share the burdens of the  state and resolve problems for the people.    Professional training was strengthened among the laid-off  female workers to enable them to master skills and regain jobs.  Based on the reality that most laid-off female workers lack  competitiveness, skills, and ability, women's federations at all  levels have arranged for such women to study, change their  concepts on choosing jobs, and enhance their sense of  competition while utilizing women's organizations and fronts to  launch diverse forms of training classes for such women, thus  laying a foundation for their reemployment. According to initial  figures, women's federations at all levels in the province as  well as various female workers organizations have sponsored some  200 training classes on specialized skills, and some 900,000  women have attended these classes.    Sources in various fields have been pooled together to  provide more employment opportunities for the laid-off female  workers. Women's federations at all levels in the province have  fully exploited their advantages to coordinate trade unions,  industrial and commercial departments, scientific and  technological units, and individuals associations to help the  laid-off female workers meet their pressing needs. Female  workers organizations under trade unions of various levels have  launched the activity of "serving as economic matchmakers" and  helped enterprises work out plans for developing the tertiary  industrial businesses that suit women. The women's federation  in Fushun's Xinfu District has set foot in relevant units and  enterprises on numerous occasions to seek jobs for 300 laid-off  female workers.    Economic entities and serve-the-people networks have been  set up to help locate jobs for laid-off female workers. Women's  federations at all levels in the province have vigorously  initiated economic entities to place a large number of laid-off  female workers. So far, the 2,900 economic entities initiated  by women's federations at various levels have placed 30,000  laid-off female workers. The 46 enterprises subordinate to the  Mulan Corporation initiated by the Shenyang City Women's  Federation have provided jobs for nearly 2,000 laid-off women.  The Shenyang City Women's Federation has stipulated that all  economic entities and enterprises run by women's federations  should locate jobs for a fixed number of laid-off female  workers, and a new department has been set up to handle these  affairs. In addition, women's federations in various districts  and neighborhoods have run 16,000 serve-the-people networks,  such as food and groceries centers, child-care centers, and  snack corners, and some 50,000 laid-off female workers have been  employed.    Employment agencies have been set up to provide timely help  for laid-off female workers. Women's federations at all levels  in the province have set up a dozen women's employment agencies.  By introducing such work opportunities as housekeeping, home  teachers, and hourly employment as household servants, these  employment agencies have found new jobs for over 1,000 laid-off  female workers.    After regaining employment, female workers who were once  unemployed have become more skillful and more competitive, thus  becoming effective forces in developing the economy. More than  20,000 laid-off female workers in Fushun city have found their  new positions in the handicraft and knitting trades. Zhang  Shiqin, a laid-off female worker of the Fushun Chemical  Industrial Plant, initiated the Liaodong Synthetic Waterproof  Materials Plant together with a veteran plant director. Within  five years, this plant had paid 1 million yuan in tax to the  state, and its products filled the gaps in Fushun's building  materials trade. Additionally, this plant provided jobs for 200  laid-off female workers. On the "8 March Women's Day" this  year, Zhang Shiqin was appraised as the "outstanding woman of  the province in the reform period."    On 11 May, the provincial women's federation held an  on-the-spot meeting to exchange experiences in launching the  activity of pioneering new undertakings and promoting stability  and to further develop the work concerning the reemployment of  laid-off female workers. Huang Qizao, vice president of the  All-China Women's Federation and first secretary of the  Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, and Hua Fuzhou,  secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's  Federation, attended and gave speeches at the meeting to guide  responsible persons of women's federations in Tianjin, Shanxi,  Changchun, Harbin, and Chongqing. Wang Huaiyuan, Zhang  Guoguang, Xu Wencai, and Chen Suzhi, leaders of Liaoning  Province and Shenyang city, also attended and spoke at this  meeting.</p>

			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / The Lisbon Summit: Opting-out gains respectability THE FUTURE of the Maastricht Treaty may be in doubt. But for precisely that reason, a Maastricht syndrome is already shaping the way the European Community does business. There is a general and over-arching debate about 'subsidiarity' - trying to separate what the EC should be responsible for and what member states should keep. The working time directive is the prime example of how uncertainty over the EC's future is already bending legislation plans, and introducing the sort of 'opt-outs' pioneered at December's Maastricht summit. Late Wednesday night this controversial draft law came within a whisker of being the first practical example of how the EC moves forward while its members go at different speeds, via routes different enough to obscure the actual direction. What was agreed exemplified the increasingly touted 'Europe a la carte,' or 'variable geometry,' through which countries pick and choose the policies they feel comfortable with. Alone among its partners, the UK had steadfastly opposed this EC proposal to put a uniform 48-hour limit on the working week. Nevertheless, after intensive negotiations between the UK, France and Germany, designed to accommodate the different political needs of these three largest member states, the 'British problem' was solved. Only an ostensibly technical disagreement between the French and Germans postponed full consensus. The solution shows how the new system works. Britain will be able to postpone the 48-hour week for initially ten years, after when there will be an EC 'review' which legally, at least, does not prejudice the outcome. This is as far away as one can get from a 'derogation', or time limited exemption, towards an 'opt-out', without actually arriving. 'A masterpiece of draftsmanship,' said one senior Irish diplomat with more than a hint of a smile. It is also an instance of the multi-speed Europe foreshadowed at Maastricht, mainly through the UK's opt-out there from its partners' plans to develop EC social policy. The need for a show of EC unity, if not consensus, on the eve of today's Lisbon summit of Community leaders and following the Danish rejection of Maastricht, drove the 11th-hour negotiations on the directive. For the UK, equally important was the preservation of the government's intention of operating in "the heart of Europe' - and securing its strengthening alliance with Germany. When push came to shove, however, it was Germany which three times interceded to ensure the UK would not be outvoted, and France which picked up the ball to negotiate the final compromise with Britain. Both France and Germany were anxious to protect Britain's Tory government from its Euro-sceptic supporters, who see labour market deregulation as a Thatcherite shibboleth. Yet France, after pulling on board the UK, then decided to hold up final agreement. Paris, facing a referendum on Maastricht, fears that a directive which appears to dilute social provisions could invite attack from the mainly Communist left, which is hostile to the treaty, according to a senior EC official. Denmark's rejection of Maastricht has led to more than usually acidulous devotion to national concerns in EC decision-making. For the moment this mostly favours the big countries on whom the treaty's future depends. But, as the sort of legal arabesques, procedural fudges, and vigorously prosecuted special pleading evidenced in the working-time directive become more acceptable, Europe a la carte collects credentials. This is just the sort of loosening wanted by the UK, which takes over the EC presidency next week.</p>

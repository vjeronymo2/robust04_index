			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Credit Local will begin sell-offs THE French government's privatisation programme yesterday rolled into action with the announcement of plans to raise up to FFr5bn (Pounds 590m) from the sale of a 30 per cent stake in Credit Local de France, a bank specialising in local authority loans. Meanwhile Societe Generale, the French bank which was privatised by the last centre-right government, disclosed that it intends to participate in the new round of share sales by increasing its holding in a number of privatised companies including the Rhone-Poulenc chemicals group and Assurances Generales de France, the insurance group. Mr Marc Vienot, chairman, said Societe Generale planned to play the roles of 'adviser, vendor and investor' in the forthcoming share sales. His comments followed an appeal by the new government for private sector companies to act as noyaux durs, long-term investors, in the newly privatised state concerns. Societe Generale, which also yesterday announced that net profits were likely to be static for the second successive year at FFr3.3bn in 1993, last month took a stake in Total, the oil company, as part of a consortium of noyaux durs. The Credit Local share sale will be the first of the new government's privatisation issues. The news of the issue followed shortly after Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, on Wednesday unveiled details of his plans to sell off 21 public sector companies including Banque Nationale de Paris and the Renault motor group. Credit Local, which was partially privatised by the old socialist government, was not on the Alphandery list as its privatisation was already authorised under French law. But the sale of its shares, scheduled to take place before the end of June, will be an important test of the stock market's reaction to privatisations. Credit Local, which was created in 1987 by the last conservative administration in a review of local authority funding, has emerged unscathed from the recent problems of the French banking industry. It recently reported an 11 per cent rise in net profits from FFr1.07bn in 1991 to FFr1.19bn in 1992 on consolidated net banking income up 10 per cent to FFr2.8bn. Details, Page 26</p>

Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DRAMA DEAN EXITS YALE'S STAGE  </P> <P> Lloyd Richards, the outgoing dean of the Yale School of Drama, was inducted  into the Theater Hall of Fame in ceremonies at Broadway's Gershwin Theater  today as the school announced a nationwide search for his successor. Richards  has been in the job since 1979 but now wants more time to pursue other aspects  of the theater, including acting. He said his responsibilities at Yale have  forced him to pass up directing opportunities in England and in the Soviet  Union as well as offers to act and direct films.  </P></p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Regalian Regalian Properties, which specialises in converting office and industrial buildings into apartments, said yesterday that it had sold two developments to east Asian investors during the last six months and was close to concluding negotiations on a third. In the half year to September 30, Regalian made pre-tax profits of Pounds 799,000 against losses of Pounds 869,000. Turnover fell from Pounds 50.1m to Pounds 16.3m as the company neared the end of its disposal programme of mass-market homes. Mr Bob Perdeaux, finance director, said the remaining portfolio would be sold by the end of the financial year. Net debt has been reduced from Pounds 13m to Pounds 2m as a result of disposals and interest charges fell from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 168,000 in the period. Administration expenses were reduced to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 1.5m). Earnings per share were 0.68p against losses of 0.74p. Proceeds on the sale of the two developments in London's West End were not included in yesterday's figures because Regalian does not recognise profit of disposals until completion. Mr David Goldstone, chairman, said that the interest of east Asian buyers in individual properties and whole developments was encouraging. 'The buoyancy of the central London market and the very keen interest on the part of international purchasers bodes well for the future,' he said. Regalian has two joint venture developments with the Sincere Group of Hong Kong, including the conversion of a former office block on the south bank of the River Thames, opposite the Tate Gallery, into apartments. It is also converting warehouses in Camden Town and Docklands and a former hospital in Oxfordshire. Mr Goldstone said the company still had unused credit lines and its relationships with joint venture partners would allow it to undertake substantial projects. Earlier this year Regalian made an unsuccessful bid of almost Pounds 20m for the former Royal Brompton Hospital in central London.</p>

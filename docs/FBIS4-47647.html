			<p>SUMMARY                                         After Russian President Boris Yeltsin's retreat under pressure  from the legislature, the Defense Ministry finally acceded to  legislative demands and cancelled joint U.S.-Russian military  exercises--at least temporarily.  Russian press commentary on the  issue divided along political lines, with communist and  nationalist papers opposing the exercises and reformist  newspapers favoring them.  The usually pro-Yeltsin Izvestiya  criticized Yeltsin's handling of the issue.                                       END SUMMARY     The Russian Defense Ministry, bowing to political pressure,  informed the State Duma on 19 May that it had "postponed" joint  U.S.-Russian exercises--originally scheduled for July at the  Totsk training area in the Urals--in line with President  Yeltsin's 26 April recommendation that it reconsider the  expediency of holding them.  Moscow radio (19 May) reported that  the ministry announcement "particularly noted" that Yeltsin  "agrees" with the Duma position that the exercises needed to be  "cancelled."  Segodnya reported the same day, however, that the  ministry planned to hold new talks--set for June--with Pentagon  officials on possibly rescheduling the exercises for a later  date.     The postponement followed intense political lobbying from  hardliners and nationalists in the legislature, the press, and  local organizations near the training range, which began  gathering steam in March (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 26 March; Interfax,  18 April; Selskaya Zhizn, 13 May) as publicity about the  exercises began to surface.  The Duma, which had not been  consulted before the public announcement of the exercises,  expressed "doubts" about their desirability (Sovetskaya Rossiya,  15 April; ITAR-TASS, 20 April) and, on 22 April, sent a  resolution to Yeltsin asking that he reconsider the decision to  hold the exercises "with due account for the Russian social-  political situation" and "the framework of civic peace in Russia"  (ITAR-TASS, 26 April).  Faced with such an implicit threat to  social stability on the eve of signing the Civic Accord agreement  with the Duma, Yeltsin retreated somewhat and referred the matter  back to the Defense Ministry for further study "with due regard"  for the "stance" of the parliament and "comments" made "by the  general public" (ITAR-TASS, 26 April).     A Military Counterattack     Senior military officials appeared reluctant to take Yeltsin's  hint and staged a last-ditch effort to salvage the exercises.  In  a campaign spearheaded by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev,  military leaders defended the military and political value of the  exercises, played down their cost and size, and dismissed  detractors as military incompetents:     -- Grachev, who signed a memorandum arranging for joint exercises  during his U.S. trip in September 1993 (Moscow TV, 9 September  1993) may have felt his prestige was on the line.  He insisted  repeatedly at news conferences that the exercises were "vital"  for the sake of peace and friendship and to erase the "enemy  image" and "really move" toward U.S.-Russian partnership (Moscow  radio, 6 and 11 May).  Asking rhetorically what was "wrong" with  young Americans and Russians having contact and learning about  each other, he complained bitterly about the "rumpus" and  "hullabaloo" in the Duma, as well as the "stir" in the government  and Security Council, noting that when the agreement was signed a  year ago "everyone remained silent."   He stressed that the  planned maneuvers were "peacekeeping"--not "war" --exercises, and  that if Russia really respected those "for whose sake we are  engaging in peacekeeping activities," then the exercises should  be held.     -- Echoing Grachev, Colonel General Vladimir Semenov, Ground  Forces Commander-in-Chief, emphasized that the objective of the  exercises was to practice peacekeeping skills and that, in any  event, the exercises were extremely limited in scope.  Extolling  U.S. expertise in such operations, he stressed that the Americans  would demonstrate such techniques as separating feuding sides and  dealing with refugee and other humanitarian problems--a clear  allusion to peacekeeping problems faced by the Russian military  in former Soviet republics.  Semenov also pointed out that the  Americans had initially offered to conduct the exercises in the  United States, but that the Russians had refused on the grounds  of cost (Obshchaya Gazeta, 6-12 May).     -- Russian General Staff chief Mikhail Kolesnikov expressed  regret at the "heated debate" in the Duma, and complained that  public opinion is being "deliberately provoked" by people who "do  not know" or "pretend not to know" what "command and staff"  exercises are.  Emphasizing the small-scale nature of the  exercises, he pointed out that "not a single American tank" would  be on the Totsk training ground (Interfax, 4 May; Segodnya, 6  May).     Splits in the Parliament     Yeltsin's waffling stance also sparked further disagreement among  parliamentary reformers and hardliners with some in each group  drawing parallels between the exercises and the NATO Partnership  for Peace plan and, depending upon their political orientation,  either viewed them as another example of the West trying to take  advantage of Russia, or as essential for cementing U.S.-Russian  relations:     -- Insisting that the exercises should be continued, Chairman of  the Duma's defense committee and Russia's Choice member Sergey  Yushenkov berated Yeltsin for heeding the Duma's objections to  the exercises.  He called Yeltsin's decision a "return to the  Cold War" and linked it to Russia's delay in joining the  Partnership for Peace plan.  He contended that a decision on the  exercises was "the exclusive prerogative of the executive" and  that the President's stand "testifies to the weakness of the  executive power and its poorly-considered actions" (ITAR-TASS, 27  April).     -- In a more measured argument, Federation Council Chairman  Vladimir Shumeyko observed that politicians should "react calmly"  to the military's efforts to enhance combat readiness, including  joint exercises with other countries.  Countering those who were  "indignant" about "Yankee feet" on Russian soil, he retorted that  in this case, "an ally, not an aggressor, was stepping on our  soil" (ITAR-TASS, 28 April).     -- One of the deputy chairmen of Yushenkov's committee, Liberal  Democrat Yevgeniy Loginov, opposed the exercises, insisting that  they had no "practical value."  He claimed, moreover, that the  majority of the Duma also opposed planned joint U.S.-Russian  naval exercises.  Alluding to 1992 U.S. media stories about  possible Pentagon plans, including one that allegedly posited  Russia as a likely adversary, Loginov said that it would be  "nonsense" to hold joint exercises with a state that held such  views (ITAR-TASS, 27 April).     -- Chairman of the Federation Council's defense committee Pyotr  Shirshov protested that Russia "cannot be made into a training  ground for the American Army."  He linked his opposition with  that of his stance on Partnership for Peace, which he termed a  "danger for Russia," arguing that by participating in that plan  the Russian Army "becomes transparent to the North Atlantic bloc"  (ITAR-TASS, 13 May).     Media Reaction     Media commentary on the U.S.-Russian joint exercises has  predictably divided along political lines.  The anti-West  communist and nationalist press strongly condemned the exercises  as dangerous to Russia's security, while the reformist press,  including the Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda,  supported them:     -- In a strident front-page article in the ultranationalist  Zavtra (the former Den), Major General Viktor Filatov, formerly  editor of the Military-Historical Journal, called the exercises a  "fool's dream coming true" in which the "[U.S.] stars-and-stripes  will be flying over Eurasia without firing a single shot."  He  further charged that the exercises were part of a conspiracy  aimed at Beijing and run by an American-dominated "world  government," using NATO as a battering ram (No.12, March 1994).     -- The pro-communist newspaper Pravda ran a series of front-page  anti-exercise articles starting in March.  Retired General Viktor  Chudov charged in a long diatribe that the exercises were  designed to dampen "reunification sentiments" in former Soviet  republics and to inspire "separatists and nationalists" to  "vigorous activity."  He berated the Defense Ministry's "top  brass" for engaging in such exercises instead of carrying out its  own war games designed to repel potential aggression "by a  coalition of nuclear powers" (16 March).  A week later, an  article on peacekeeping costs gave short shrift to a statement by  Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev that  Russia intended to borrow and learn from U.S. peacekeeping  experiences, asking sarcastically if the Russian military  intended to emulate U.S. military operations in Panama, Grenada,  and the Persian Gulf (23 March).     -- The Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda published a  long, extremely upbeat interview with Colonel General Eduard  Vorobyev, first deputy commander-in-chief of the Ground Forces,  who described the size and scope of the exercises (5 March).  In  addition, following the Chudov article in Pravda, Krasnaya Zvezda  published a strongly-worded rebuttal on its front page, charging  that the Pravda article was filled with a "series of gross  distortions" and written by an author who "does not have true  information on the exercises."  The Krasnaya Zvezda article ended  by claiming that the exercises "should make a real contribution  to the cause of international cooperation in the settling of  conflicts in trouble spots" (18 March).     -- The usually pro-Yeltsin newspaper Izvestiya, in an article  titled "The President Will Be Making A Mistake If He Cancels the  Russian-U.S. Exercise," called holding the exercises "a matter of  honor" and lambasted the "absurd charges" against them made by  "politicians of a very clear-cut orientation"--a clear reference  to Yeltsin's opposition.  Contending that there were situations  "when compromise becomes spinelessness," the article charged that  "unpredictable to-ing and fro-ing, whatever the reason,"inflicts  "very severe blows on the unconsolidated authority of a Russia  which, appropriately or not, likes to call itself great" (28  April).     Outlook     Yeltsin's pressure on the military to accommodate the Duma's  demands to cancel the joint exercises suggests that he feels a  need to yield to nationalist forces in Russia on at least some  agreements with the West in order to try to salvage others.  His  apparent weakness in yielding to the Duma's pressure is likely to  embolden his opponents to continue to attack him and his  supporters over his policy of cooperative relations with the West  as well.  Moreover, the military's effort to proceed with the  exercises despite Yeltsin's backtracking suggests that leading  officers are concerned the yielding on this issue may jupordize  future military-to-military relations with the West.

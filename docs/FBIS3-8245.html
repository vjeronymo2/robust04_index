			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The leader of the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF] parliamentary group [Ferenc Kulin] does not consider it  probable that the government will start any sort of inquiry into  the dismissals of radio staff for it has no right to do so.  Levente Sukosd reports from Ferenc Kulin's press briefing.    [Begin recording] [Kulin] We consider and have to consider  this endeavor on the part of the vice president as being totally  obvious, since we in the Cultural Committee in 1991 were the  ones who very resolutely requested and demanded from the then  presidents of radio and television the implementation of a  radical cut in staff.    [Sukosd] The list of names published today was a surprise  for  Kulin, he did not know the content of it until today, he said.  He considers that this was not a politically motivated  decision. [passage omitted] Kulin said that he believes [radio  vice president] Laszlo Csucs could if necessary also convince  public opinion that he has only dismissed editors who violated  the radio's ethical code. Parliament is unable to deal with the  matter properly until the media bill is adopted, however the  parties' consensus would be needed for this. [passage omitted]    The government and the government party are not responsible  for the situation, said Kulin. The dismissal of the vice  president, according to the law on appointments adopted in 1990,  can only be initiated by the employer, that is the prime  minister. According to Ferenc Kulin's information, Prime  Minister Peter Boross does not intend to take this measure.  [passage omitted]    Because of the dismissals at the radio, the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ] has appealed to Prime Minister Peter Boross to  initiate the release of Laszlo Csucs and Gabor Nahlik, vice  presidents of radio and television respectively. Ivan Peto,  party chairman, gave an interview in Nyiregyhaza to Miklos Nagy.    [Begin recording] [Peto] The manner of the dismissals, that  is that they are released from work with immediate effect and  that they are not allowed to work during the period of notice,  makes it perfectly unequivocal that these are not austerity  measures. The government wants to silence the still existing  multi-colored voice of radio. The fact is that the Government  wants to make a propaganda institution out of the radio, as has  already been done to television. [passage omitted] [end  recording]    [Announcer] According to the deputy chairman of the  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the radio dismissals  threaten the functioning of the institution. Edit Schranz  reports.    [Schranz] Fidesz Deputy Chairman Tamas Deutsch does not  believe that one can sincerely talk of rationalization in  connection with the dismissals at Hungarian radio. At a news  briefing, Deutsch said the following: Laszlo Csucs has been in  office, vested with full presidental power, for a year. If he  believes that radio staff have to be made redundant for economic  reasons, just when the government submits the new version of the  Media Bill, which is to regulate the operation of radio, then  something is not right; either that the vice president is  competent in what he is doing, or that there is no political  cleansing behind the dismissals. You can hear Tamas Deutsch:    [Begin Deutsch recording] The political intent behind the  decisions is unacceptable for me. I am very sad because  Hungarian radio's capability of functioning may be endangered,  and just in a special period, in the midst of the election  campaign. This measure has a particularly unfavorable and  negative effect on the election campaign. But it also has a  direct effect: Since it is a step which becomes a political  scandal and a political stumbling block, it will obviously  divert the election campaign, possibly for weeks, from the path  -- which is normal to my mind -- of parties talking about their  programs. The whole affair which is taking place at television  and radio -- now especially at radio -- does influence the  elections. However, politicians of the governing parties: do not  entertain hopes! The past four years will not be forgotten.  This in itself will not significantly increase the chances of  the government parties. [end recording]    [Announcer] The Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP] considers  the  dismissal of leading radio staff, en masse and for an outright  political reason, to be an open attack against democracy and  press freedom. Kata Peli Nagy reports on the HSP's stance.    [Nagy] The leadership of the HSP is calling on Laszlo Csucs  to revoke his decision. Party Chairman Gyula Horn today rang  the radio vice chairman to get information on the backdrop to  the dismissals. In Horn's view, the individuals in question have  always served independent broadcasting. According to the HSP,  the vice president's measure unfavorably influences the  elections. They are afraid that radio, similarly with  television, will become a mouthpiece of the Government. In the  HSP's opinion, the Government is also responsible for the  situation which has emerged, since everything happened with the  support of the Cabinet. Yesterday they even provided money for  the dismissals.    What will the HSP do in this situation? Gyula Horn said the  following:    [Begin Horn recording] If this decision is not revoked, and  the HSP enters Government as a result of the elections, the HSP  will immediately take steps to reinstate these generally  esteemed experts in their position. [end recording]    [Announcer] The Presidium of the National Association of  Hungarian Journalists [MUOSZ] has received the news about the  radio dismissals with indignation. MUOSZ agrees with there  being a review of the radio's financial situation and with the  absolutely necessary redundancies. However, the MUOSZ cannot  accept the radio leadership sacking people for an outright  political reason; by doing so it makes the provision of  multifaceted and objective information impossible. These  dismissals, which are unprecedented in the profession and which  are happening just before the elections, threaten democracy to  an extent which cannot be indifferent to anybody, the MUOSZ  statement says.</p>

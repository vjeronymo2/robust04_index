			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Fernando Mota Martinez] </F>   [Excerpts] Banking systems, unlike stock exchanges, are  instruments easily used to advantage by those helping drug  traffickers to purify the sinister origins of the money accrued  from drugs.    Theoretically, in their capacity as objects, they lack  intentions; and, by the same token, they are not blameworthy for  being used. [passage omitted]    In stock market institutions, cash funds never appear, and  there is always a correlation between those participating in the  supply and demand. Moreover, it should be recalled that all the  commodity firms operating on the Mexican Stock Exchange make  their living (who would believe it?) from the trading of a mere  25 stock shares.    The market is so slim that it is virtually impossible not to  know who has carried out transactions.    If there is any doubt of my claim, it would be worthwhile  reading the statements that I quote here:    "Money laundering is an illegal activity that cannot be  achieved through the stock market system, because the  transactions carried out in it are documented with certified  checks, and not through the handling of cash." This was the  assertion made by Rodolfo Leon Leon, ex-president and founder of  the Mexican Academy of Stock Exchange and Financial Markets Law  (on 28 January of this year).    The same thing does not hold true in the banking  establishments.    One of the reasons for the occurrence of this illicit  activity is that there are not sufficient numbers of trained  personnel to maintain permanent contact with the clientele.    Banking services will (or should) always be personal but, as  a result of computerization, clients have been reduced to a  numerical symbol with which the banks, in many cases, never even  deal. Rather, they are served, though not known, by those  assigned to conduct account opening procedures. This task, on  behalf of the actual money launderers, can be performed by  anyone who allows himself to be used as a tool of the drug  traffickers. [passage omitted]    Added to the lack of personal acquaintance is the high  degree  of rotation among executives in bank branches.    No one lasts long in one location now, because the bank  owners or directors move the employees like chess pieces;  something which, furthermore, confirms that the absence of  individual attention occurs first within the banks themselves.    Apart from the fact that many bank workers never become  acquainted with the general director, they do not even know the  regional director.    Those officials are gods whose presence is reserved for  ostentatious functions.    Branch managers are shifted with unusual speed, bringing  negative consequences for the banks' clients.    As if that were not enough, many bank branches have been  eliminated, because they were located too close to one another.  In some instances this was due to lack of planning and, in  others, it resulted from mergers (or strategic alliances, as  they are now called), also made in a disorderly fashion.    Unfortunately, this is not all.    The meager, inadequate salaries, almost token in some cases,  earned by bank personnel, previously considered a privileged  sector in labor circles, are another negative factor leading to  the possibility of the banking system's being used extensively  to launder money.    These are some of the reasons that the attorney general of  the republic, Diego Valades, informed EXCELSIOR (Friday, 18  February, page 5, first section) that, through a mutual  agreement with the Finance and Public Credit Secretariat, and  respecting bank secrecy, an effort is being made to uncover  money laundering transactions. In this endeavor the authorities  have the strong cooperation of the bank employees affiliated  with the National Federation of Bank Workers Unions (Fenasib).  Its secretary general, Enrique Aguilar Borrego, reiterated to a  capital newspaper, on 10 January, that "it is fitting to make a  careful revision of bank workers' pay, because it is possible  that they may succumb to temptation that would eventually foster  criminal activities."    Two comments regarding this position on the part of the  attorney general:    One of them pertains to the Mexican Association of Banks  because, despite the public expression of the government's  concern, the bankers have said nothing, whereas the bank workers  certainly have done so.    The other is related to the fact that Oscar Gonzalez,  director of legal affairs for the Office of the Attorney General  of the Republic, declared on 26 January: "A study is being made  on devising a new law that would prevent money laundering in  Mexico, and the termination of bank secrecy has not been  precluded as one of the measures for eliminating this  phenomenon."    That public servant claimed: "The Finance and Public Credit  Secretariat, the Foreign Relations Secretariat, and the Office  of the Attorney General of the Republic are already working on  the plan for regulations containing fiscal revisions to cope  with this problem."    He added to this comment the fact that there is insufficient  surveillance in Mexico on the part of the National Banking  Commission, remarking that the complete situation would be  ascertained.    In other words: there is a real possibility, and it is a  reality, that the banking system may prove to be an immense  money launderer.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Japanese win HK contract A JAPANESE consortium has been awarded a HKDollars 1.6bn (Pounds 123m) contract for airport-related infrastructure in Hong Kong, in spite of the continued deadlock between Britain and China in approving financing for the entire airport project. Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong), leading a consortium including Maeda, Yokogawa Bridge and Hitachi Zosen, submitted the lowest bid for the Kap Shui Mun bridge and Ma Wan viaduct project. It is a combined rail and road structure which will ultimately link Chek Lap Kok airport on Lantau Island to the mainland via the world's second longest suspension bridge, the Tsing Ma bridge, which is being constructed by a consortium led by Trafalgar House of the UK. The Japanese tender is for a fixed price and compares with the government's estimate of HKDollars 1.8bn for the project. Announcement of the award coincided with a press conference held by the Chinese side of the Sino-British Airport Committee in which it complained about the spiralling costs of the entire HKDollars 163bn project. Chinese concerns, focusing on the margin between 1991 costs and current figures for the airport project, were dismissed by Hong Kong government officials as unproductive. But the arguments underline the tense reception Governor Chris Patten is likely to receive when he arrives in Beijing on Wednesday.</p>

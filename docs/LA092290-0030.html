			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SORT THROUGH 700 CALLS, EYE POSSIBLE SUSPECTS IN SERIAL KILLINGS;  </P> <P> MANHUNT: INVESTIGATORS TRY TO TRACK DOWN SOLID LEADS FROM MORE THAN 700 TIPS,  BUT SO FAR NO ONE HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN FOR QUESTIONING.  </P> <P> San Diego police said Friday they have several suspects under surveillance in  the slayings of five women in the Clairemont-University City area but have  brought none in for questioning.  </P> <P> Police also revealed that a man who admitted to the killings agreed to turn  himself in Thursday in Balboa Park. Police waited one hour but the man never  appeared.  </P> <P> Officials also have received a letter from someone claiming to be the killer  but police have dismissed it as the work of a prankster.  </P> <P> The new information came during the department's daily press briefings, which  began Monday.  </P> <P> Police have mounted the city's largest murder investigation to try to find a  man they believe has killed five women since January.  </P> <P> Since Sept. 13, when the last two women were found stabbed to death in  University City, 19 investigators have been assigned full-time to the case and  more might be added.  </P> <P> Homicide Capt. Dick Toneck, one of three police spokesmen assigned to the task  force investigating the murders, said Friday that police "have a number of  people under surveillance" but would not say on what basis, by what method, or  for how long.  </P> <P> "We can't get into tactics as far as surveillance," he said. "I can tell you my  concern and the department's concern is that this person will hit again,  period. If he was to quit and never do it again, it would be the greatest thing  that ever happened."  </P> <P> Toneck also reluctantly confirmed a report that a man claiming to be the serial  killer called a local television station Thursday and said he would surrender  to police at 4 p.m. in Balboa Park. Toneck said police waited in the park until  5 p.m. and then gave up.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, he said, someone wrote the department to accept  responsibility for the murders.  </P> <P> Toneck said police believe both claims to be the work of one person. He said  that publicity about the letter and the promised Balboa Park rendezvous will  only encourage others to do the same.  </P> <P> "My fear is that this kind of information, when it gets out, will wind up  causing us to go out to every place in San Diego to deal with these kinds of  people," he said. "It would cause unnecessary work for us. It's someone who  wants to cause problems for this investigation."  </P> <P> Police are swamped with 700 tips from people offering information about the  killer, Toneck said. He said law enforcement officials are slowly working their  way through the leads and trying to get back to tipsters but that hundreds  remain unanswered.  </P> <P> "We're inundated with calls, which is fine, we'll take them," he said. "We're  going to try to make phone calls back to some of the leads to make people aware  we're following them. We're asking the public to be patient with us."  </P> <P> Police are looking for a black or dark-skinned man, age 14 to 23, with short  hair, a medium build, and between 5-foot-7 and 5-foot-10. Many have claimed to  have seen the man, who police believe has fatally stabbed four brunette women  between the ages of 18 and 21 and one of the victim's mothers, always between 8  a.m. and 1 p.m.  </P> <P> The killings have raised a furor in Clairemont, the site of three slayings, and  in University City, where two have occurred. Women are so panic-stricken that  they are keeping baseball bats under their beds, checking closets and buying  door and window locks.  </P> <P> Because some of the victims have been reported by police to have showered just  before the killings, many women are avoiding morning or midday showers.  </P> <P> Some have hidden their kitchen knives. In all but one of the cases, women have  been stabbed with knives from inside their homes.  </P> <P> "What I would like to see the public do is to try and remain calm and to try  and feel safe in their own homes," Toneck said. "As time goes by (without  another killing), people will feel better."  </P> <P> The killings occurred in January, February, April and last week. Investigators  said there is no way from the irregular pattern to determine when, if, or where  the serial killer will strike again.  </P> <P> Toneck said Friday that the task force has decided not to send investigators to  Gainseville, Fla., where four young women and one man have been stabbed to  death near the University of Florida campus since August. He said the task  force has decided that the San Diego and Florida cases are not linked.  </P></p>

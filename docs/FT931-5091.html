			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Letter: Sellafield discharge actually very small Sir, Bronwen Maddox reports ('Sellafield has second leak', February 26) that British Nuclear Fuels discharged more than seven times the usual weekly amount of radioactive iodine at the Sellafield nuclear site during the week ending February 13. To the layman this would appear to be a huge amount. But the radioactive impact of this release on the most exposed member of the public living near the site is equivalent to that which would take place during a 15-minute flight on a passenger aircraft. The fact that we have such sophisticated measuring devices at Sellafield which can detect such minute amounts should, in itself, be reassuring to the public. Unfortunately, detecting discharges which result in such small dosages requires detailed analysis. That inevitably means a delay between the actual release and its detection. That is why there is a delay in the reporting of such incidents. J R S Guinness chairman, British Nuclear Fuels, Risley, Warrington, Cheshire WA3 6AS</p>

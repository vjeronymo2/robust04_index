			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Texas orange and grapefruit marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year apply to all assessable citrus fruit handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets of expenses are prepared by the TVCC, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the TVCC are handlers and producers of Texas oranges and grapefruit. They are familiar with the TVCC's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The TVCC's budget is formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment rate recommended by the TVCC is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments of oranges and grapefruit. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient income to pay the TVCC's expected expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The TVCC met on May 10, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $1,141,944 and an assessment rate of $0.16 per 7/10 bushel carton for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year. In comparison, the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year expense amount was $984,319, which is $157,625 less than the recommended $1,141,944 for this season and the assessment rate was $0.15, which is $0.01 less than that recommended for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessment income for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year is expected to amount to $960,000 based upon estimated fresh domestic shipments of 6 million cartons of oranges and grapefruit. This, in addition to a withdrawal of $181,944 from the TVCC's reserve fund, should be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. In comparison, the assessment income for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year was estimated at $825,000 based upon anticipated fresh domestic shipments of 5.5 million cartons of oranges and grapefruit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funds in the reserve at the end of the fiscal year, estimated at $276,468, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major expense categories for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year include $132,444 for shared administrative expenses with the South Texas Onion and Melon Committees, $650,000 for advertising, compared to $723,425 for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year, and $174,000 for the Mexican Fruit Fly support program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The expenses and assessment rates were authorized by an interim final rule issued on July 28, 1994, and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [59 FR 39415, August 3, 1994]. A 30-day comment period was provided for interested persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committed met again on June 30, 1994, and unanimously recommended to increase expenses from $1,141,944 to 1,153,944, which is an increase of $12,000 from previously authorized amount. The increase is necessary for funding of one-third of the cost of a Texas Citrus Tree Inventory Survey. No change was recommended to the assessment rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee met once again on October 11, 1994, unanimously recommended an additional increase in expenses of $7,300. The Committee recommended this additional increase to fund a post harvest project. This will bring the total recommended expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year to $1,161,244. Once again no change in the assessment rate was recommended. The additional funding needed for these increases will be taken from the Committee's reserve fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing orders covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year for the programs began on August 1, 1994. The marketing orders require that the rates of assessment for the fiscal year apply to all assessable oranges and grapefruit handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committees at public meetings and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as an interim final rule. No comments were received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action, with appropriate changes, as a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 906  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grapefruit, Marketing agreements, Oranges, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7 CFR Part 906 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 906_ORANGES AND GRAPEFRUIT GROWN IN LOWER RIO GRANDE VALLEY IN TEXAS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Telecoms curbs may be eased The US House of Representatives yesterday passed two bills that could ease curbs on Bell local phone companies and open competition in cable TV, telecoms equipment manufacturing and long-distance telephone services. The Senate has so far done little to move the bills forward but congressional aides said the overwhelming House vote made it more likely the Senate would vote - by October - on the legislation, which some see as the most extensive changes to US telecoms in 60 years. The bills would rewrite not only the 1934 Communications Act, but also the 1984 court decree which broke the American Telephone and Telegraph monopoly into a single long-distance company, AT&amp;T, and seven regional telephone companies known as Baby Bells. The Bell companies provide more than three quarters of US local phone lines, and are prohibited under the 1984 decree, designed to prevent them abusing their dominant market position, from offering most other telecoms services outside their home area. Under the bills passed yesterday, the Bell companies would be immediately allowed to offer 'incidental services' such as voice mail across the boundaries of their local exchanges, and to ask state regulators for permission to offer long-distance telephone services within that state. They could be allowed to expand progressively over the next five years into other long-distance markets.</p>

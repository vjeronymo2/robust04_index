			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Stewart M. Thompson, chief of the ICL </F> representative office in Russia and the CIS, by Zhanna  Khidiyatullina; place and date not given: "ICL Is Together With  the Government of Tatarstan"]    [Text] ICL is the first large Western company that  has resolved to make a major investment in the economy of  Tatarstan. It is a computer company with the second largest  volume of profits in the world. ICL was formed in 1968 by a  merger of several companies. However, it became truly  competitive and came to possess state-of-the-art technologies 12  years ago when a contract was signed with the Japanese company  Fujitsu, which now owns 80 percent of ICL stock. The company  employs 24,000 people in 80 countries of the world. ICL consists  of 26 autonomous divisions or production facilities which  operate under general leadership on an integrated plan,  implementing a common strategy.    A correspondent of the TATAR-INFORM information agency  asked Stewart M. Thompson, chief of the ICL representative  office in Russia and the CIS, to discuss prospects for  cooperation between ICL and Tatarstan.    [Khidiyatullina] When talks began in Tatarstan last year  about transforming the ICL-KPOVS joint venture into a  joint-stock company with the participation of the Government of  Tatarstan, this news surprised many people. Whose initiative was  it?    [Thompson] Our joint venture feels quite confident in Kazan.  As recently as a year ago we were not planning any radical  changes. The initiative in organizing the new joint-stock  company belongs to the government of your republic. However,  ICL's management showed understanding for the government's  desire to participate in the profits of an enterprise located in  Tatarstan. As far as I know, your government already has such  business experience.    [Khidiyatullina] Indeed, the Republic of Tatarstan Cabinet  of  Ministers acted a few years ago as cofounder of the first  Tatarstan-Turkish joint venture, Taturos. However, in that  instance it made its contribution to statutory capital in the  form of crude oil.    [Thompson] Apparently the same will occur in our case. The  proportions of investment will change so as to take into account  the interests of your republic in the distribution of eventual  profits. You must pardon me for being unable to give precise  numbers before the meeting of the board, which will most likely  be held within a few days. Only after this will it be possible  to schedule the date for signing the principal contract.    [Khidiyatullina] It may be surmised that business contacts  will not be restricted to the framework of the joint-stock  company....    [Thompson] Of course not. They are much broader than that  even now. In the fall of this year we will mark the 25th  anniversary of operations in the market of CIS countries and  Russia. Much has been accomplished during this time. Our  computers and banking and retail trade equipment are installed  not only in Russia. The large oil enterprises of Tatarstan, the  Administration of Kazan, and the Government of the Republic of  Tatarstan have been able to duly appreciate the advantages of  working with our computers and programming.    [Khidiyatullina] Why are you convinced of the advantages of  ICL products?    [Thompson] Last year ICL was perhaps the only large computer  company to make a profit. Of course, it was less than  expected--only $4 billion, increased sales notwithstanding. This  is a general problem. Nonetheless, it can be understood that  close linkage to progressive developments by the specialists of  the Japanese company Fujitsu made it possible for ICL to not  only make a spurt in technical development but also to sharply  reduce production outlays.    One does not have to be a specialist to understand that the  superior quality of the company's products was complemented by  the ability to reduce prices. Owing to the development of  so-called "open systems," we help enterprises to ensure  communications and management of production processes with  finely developed programs while using the previously purchased  computers of various companies. In the process, we not only  deliver, install, and provide training for specialists but also  stand ready to provide assistance in the continuous upgrading of  programs. As early as 1985 ICL understood that the development  of services is the future of computer companies. All our  advantages are based on the growing volume of services.    [Khidiyatullina] It is a pity that despite a respectable  duration of operations on the market of Russia, the ICL brand is  not as widely known as the names of not only other large  companies but also small companies. In Tatarstan, you are  likewise little known.    [Thompson] It is hard to disagree with that. However, ICL is  now mounting an extensive advertising campaign in your country.  An invitation to a group of journalists from Russia and  Tatarstan to visit London has become one of the programs. We  hope that you will be able to tell your readers in detail about  the ICL corporation.    [Khidiyatullina] Many people believe that for companies such  as yours Tatarstan is of interest primarily as a cheap labor  market.    [Thompson] Each company is mindful of its profits. Nobody  will strive for higher costs. For example, it is important to  select the location for the construction of a production  facility correctly. However, you must really perceive that,  according to assessments by the leading economists of the world,  the territories of North America and Central and Eastern Europe  will have the decisive role in profit generation. The objective  of any company, ICL included, is not just to produce but also to  sell. This is why Russia and Tatarstan are primarily our  business partners and a market for product sales.</p>

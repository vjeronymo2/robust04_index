			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Polemical Notes" by Anatoliy Dokuchayev of KRASNAYA </F> ZVEZDA: "Military Reform: Truth and Fantasies"]    [Text] Recently the Russian Army and its leadership have  found themselves the subject, so to speak, of very biased press  attention. Analysts, political scientists, journalists, and  sometimes simply hacks who like to speak out about anything have  been conducting a targeted critical "bombardment." The thrust  of the media salvoes is that the situation in the Army is quite  appalling, and the reforms are not progressing at all.    Why are they not progressing? Unfortunately, it is difficult  to obtain an answer to this question even after careful study of  the many critical articles relating in one degree or another to  this problem. Perhaps some of the plans are not being  fulfilled? Is the Blueprint for the Organizational Development  of the Armed Forces elaborated by the Defense Ministry not being  implemented? Or maybe political scientists' forecasts have not  been borne out and some of them are feeling aggrieved?  Questions, questions, questions.... And here is another one.  Is the situation really so bad in our country with regard to  military organizational development?    Even a cursory analysis of what has been done over the last  two years (the Russian Army is a little over 2 years old)  refutes this. As does the end result -- the Russian Armed  Forces, despite many extremely painful problems, are  combat-capable and on the whole ensure the fulfillment of the  tasks confronting them. No, I am not talking about the  assessment which the president made in his message to the  Federal Assembly at the start of this year, although that is  important in itself. I am talking about something else. About  the actual combat readiness of units and formations. At the  time of writing Russian battalions were performing peacemaking  functions in Yugoslavia in accordance with international  pledges. Units of the 201st Motorized Rifle Division were taking  part in protecting and defending the Tajik-Afghan border, and  our subunits were between the warring sides in the Dniester  region, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia. There are 16,000 Russian  servicemen in "trouble spots." And they are dealing with them.    The results of the winter training period attest that other  units and formations of the General-Purpose Forces, which are  being qualitatively transformed, are also combat-capable. The  Mobile Forces which are being created as a new Armed Forces'  interbranch operational-strategic formation are giving them a  new face. Practical steps have already been taken today. Work  to bring up to strength the units and formations that, when  necessary, will be transferred from region to region and to  provide them with arms and materiel has been started in the  Airborne and Ground Forces, the Air Defense Forces, the Air  Forces, and the Navy.    But what has not been done? Perhaps some important fruitful  ideas have not been implemented?    A few years ago the General Staff began work on a new table  of organization structure for the Armed Forces -- a subject  about which a great deal has been and is being said. This is  already coming into being. The troops of the North Caucasus and  Leningrad Military Districts have already been partly switched  to a corps/brigade structure. If there is anything to be said  here, it is merely to ask whether we are not being too swift to  abandon combined arms army formations and formations of the  division type. After all, in certain spheres divisions are  simply irreplaceable, as experience shows. They have greater  firepower than brigades and can conduct combat operations for  several days. In short, what had long been advocated is being  put into effect.    Other "drastic" reformers reduce all innovative work  exclusively to switching the Army to a professional footing.  Here too there are real shifts --the contract method of  manpower acquisition is now a permanent feature in the Russian  Army. As is well known, over 160,000 professionals are now  serving as soldiers and sergeants, and another 150,000 contract  personnel will be recruited in 1994, including over 14,000 women.    We have looked at just a few aspects of military reform, but  even they graphically demonstrate that the reforms in the Army,  for all the difficulties and contradictions, are nevertheless  making clear progress. At any rate the pace of reform in the  Army is in no way lagging behind the reforms in society in  general. On the contrary, many spheres of military reform are  being retarded precisely by the fact that the appropriate  economic, political, and legal preconditions have still not been  created and that the potential of the state, which is in  profound crisis, is unfortunately extremely limited.    So why then are there such harsh assessments? Why do some  newspapers often paint such a negative picture of the Army? Why  are the honor and dignity of Russian officers often nonchalantly  sullied?    Analysis of many articles devoted to military reform in  civilian publications automatically suggests that the reform  itself and the problems of the Armed Forces are a matter of  indifference to the authors. They are something like auxiliary  material for some totally different purposes.    For instance, take the following quite common thesis: A  civilian should be appointed as soon as possible to the post of  defense minister, otherwise there will be no reform. The  arguments here consist of allusions to Western experience, and  also contentions regarding the need for civilian control over  the Armed Forces.    There is no question that civilian control is an important  problem. But is is far more serious and far broader than simply  the question of whether the minister has epaulets or not.  Epaulets are rather a formality. In certain conditions a  civilian could develop into a dictator, while a general's rank  is certainly no obstacle to democratic attitudes and openness to  society. Incidentally, that same Western experience provides  much confirmation that military men often make very strong  democratic politicians....    Clearly, it is more accurate to speak not of civilian but of  political control over the Armed Forces. This includes  presidential control, parliamentary control, collaboration  between Army structures and various social organizations, and  much else besides. This whole system has already taken shape in  many respects today and is continuing to emerge.    And as for epaulets... Well, there probably will come a time  when a civilian occupies the post of defense minister in our  country, as in the United States or the FRG, although I  personally am opposed to this -- Russia has its own traditions.  But is this the most urgent question today? For the sake of  purely formal changes is it possible to disregard both, so to  speak, the mentality of our military, who will scarcely find it  easy to accept simply "some guy in a suit coat," and the clear  absence of the preconditions for this in the political sphere  itself? Have we not already suffered a lot of grief as a result  of incompetence? Do we have plenty of readymade, full-fledged  civilian candidates for defense minister? Remember how the  notorious Galina Starovoytova was suggested quite seriously as  minister. Imagine what the situation with regard to our Army  and our defenses would be today if that had happened?    Political interests are usually what lies behind this. As  they do behind other proposals for the drastic reform of the  Defense Ministry and the Army in general. For instance, what is  the worth of the maxim that a structure, in other words the  Army, cannot reform itself, but military reform today has been  left in the hands of the military.    Excuse me, but what is the point in airing a false premise  in  the newspapers and then chewing it over? The Army is indeed not  reforming itself. Evidence? Certainly. Was it the military  department that elaborated and adopted the laws by which people  in uniform are guided today? And what about the military  doctrine? Many state structures worked on it, beginning with the  country's Security Council. Take the Blueprint for the  Organizational Development of the Armed Forces. It was approved  by the President. Or the recruitment of contract personnel.  This has been and is being carried out on the basis of the  edicts of the head of state and depends on the funding allocated  by the government. Perhaps the military ratify the defense  budget? That is not the case. The general military regulations  are also the President's prerogative. A big scandal recently  erupted in the press about the new uniform -- apparently the  military are wearing illegal uniform that has not been approved.  An investigation was made. It turns out that the uniform is  legal. Furthermore, it had long been planned with the aim of  simplifying certain elements, making it cheaper, and making it  more modern and attractive.    In short, military reform involves active participation by  the president, parliament, government, Security Council, other  state structures, and even...social organizations. Even the  church is taking part in it. Yes, it is true that the  leadership of the Armed Forces and military specialists and  scientists play a great role in elaborating and implementing all  the legal acts, programs, and blueprints. But how could that be  otherwise? We cannot involve generals from abroad.    Anyhow, what is so bad about the military implementing  military reforms? The main thing is that they introduce  innovations that benefit the country's defenses and give the  Army a modern face, the face of the army of a democratic state.  Incidentally, all our Russian reforms in the defense sphere  have been associated with the names of military figures.  Milyutin's reforms. Rediger's reforms. Frunze's reforms.    It transpires that the military are not the point. It is  just that every drastic proposal for the drastic reform of the  Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces as a whole and every maxim  aired in the press, I repeat, often stems from political  interests and nothing more.    I think even the authors of these and similar "fantasies"  are  perfectly well aware of the shakiness of their positions and  scarcely seriously expect anyone to be guided by their  conclusions. They are probably pursuing a different aim: to  weaken from time to time the military leadership's position in  resolving state questions -- at the time when the military  budget is being adopted, for instance. Or at a time when the  political situation is deteriorating and there is social  tension. If this is so, and I believe that this is precisely  the case, then such articles are actually attempts to throw a  monkey wrench in the works of the reforms that the "reformers"  are ostensibly advocating.    Other experts, analysts, and journalists choose a "subtler"  angle of attack on the Army -- the real reform of the Armed  Forces, regarding it as "fundamentally incorrect," "destructive  of the homeland's Army," and so on.    The target of the attacks is primarily the Mobile Forces,  though only yesterday the process of their creation was loudly  welcomed by everyone without exception. Today the tone is  different. Already some people have proclaimed: "Mobile  Forces? Are they designed to perform gendarme functions?"  Others seek simpler grounds for criticism -- our Defense  Minister is from the Airborne Forces, so he personally is  championing expansion of the Airborne Forces. The criticism is  bald, so to speak, and for some reason the authors do not bother  with even the most modest analysis. What prompted the Armed  Forces leadership to create them? What principle forms their  foundation? Detailed answers to just these questions would  allow the reader to draw his own conclusions. But no, what is  the point of analysis, let alone serious analysis. But the  truth is as follows.    Russia cannot afford to keep large troop groupings in all  the  strategic operational salients, and anyhow there is no need for  this. What appear to be most dangerous to the state today are  local conflicts, rather than large-scale war. But Russia (and  it is capable of doing this) if necessary has to place a  reliable barrier in the way of aggression from any direction.  The principle of mobile defense which forms the basis for the  creation of the troop groupings is called upon to play its main  role here -- it presupposes the existence of small but quite  powerful forces ready for operational use wherever a real threat  to the country's security arises. Incidentally, the USSR's  military-political leadership, which adhered to the principle of  reasonable sufficiency for defense, would have been bound in  time to arrive at a similar principle for the structuring of  defenses. This is less burdensome for the state, and it is  effective so far as defense is concerned.    The Mobile Forces also come under attack from a different  direction -- it is claimed that they are being established to  the detriment of the development of other branches of the Armed  Forces, for instance, the Navy. There has been a whole series  of articles in the mass media claiming that the present military  leadership is virtually deliberately destroying the Navy.  Articles of various calibers -- ranging from claims that there  is only one nuclear submarine on alert duty in the Russian Navy  to articles attempting to encapsulate everything negative  relating to our Navy.    What is the situation in reality? First a detail. At his 6  May briefing General of the Army Pavel Grachev disclosed some  sensational news -- each day 50 Russian submarines and surface  ships are on alert duty and combat service at sea. But for some  reason the mass media chose not to mention this. Now a few  words about the state of affairs in the Navy. The situation  today is indeed complex, but this is clearly not because of the  creation of the Mobile Forces, it stems from the entire course  of military organizational development in our state in recent  decades. The main efforts in the Soviet Union were concentrated  on building warships, while the development of the  infrastructure for their basing, support, and repair lagged  behind. By 1992, that is, by the start of the creation of the  Russian Armed Forces, about two-thirds of ships were in the  final stage of their lifetime and in practice there was no  system for basing large surface ships and heavy  aircraft-carrying cruisers. Problems of repair and scrapping  came to the fore. It takes sizable financial resources to solve  them. But the Navy, like the other branches of the Armed  Forces, unfortunately only receives a pittance.    If anyone is sounding the alarm about the state of affairs  in  the Navy it is the Defense Ministry leadership and the Navy  command. There is some progress. Last year over 100 voyages  were carried out. It is planned to achieve this level this  year. It should be noted that alert duty and combat service at  sea are carried out in accordance with the new system of views  regarding the organizational development and use of the Navy --  a system whose elaboration was affected by the substantial  change in the geopolitical situation.    There is a great deal of speculation today over the reform  of  the Air Defense Troops. Some analysts have even hastened to  declare that this branch of the Armed Forces too is being  destroyed by the Defense Ministry leadership, disbanded, and so  forth. What is the actual situation? All five existing  branches of the Armed Forces, including the Air Defense Troops,  are remaining until the year 2000. But it is also true that the  theoretical basis for the further development of the branches of  the Armed Forces is being improved today, and certain concepts  are being verified in the course of large-scale strategic  exercises involving troops. The facilities that needed to  receive air defense cover are also being reviewed. The Air  Defense Troops will be reduced to the optimum level by removing  surface-to-air missile systems from secondary defended  installations.    There are also difficulties in the organizational  development  of the Russian Air Forces, and this too is giving some of our  "supporters" grounds for attacking the Army. But organizational  development is under way.... The complex process of the  redeployment of units on Russian territory that is now nearing  completion is being carried out simultaneously with profound  reform. The organizational structure of the Air Force is  changing. Two new aviation commands have appeared -- front-line  aviation, and also the reserve and cadre training. New aviation  groupings have been set up in the northwest, west, and southwest  salients. Two air armies have "sprung up" in theaters that were  not equipped from the aviation viewpoint. At the same time the  total number of aviation formations has decreased from 15 to  nine. Overall, the strength of the Air Force has decreased by 20  percent.    There is progress in another sphere -- the military  technical  sphere. Today aviation regiments are being rearmed with more  modern equipment, which certainly gladdens everyone who cares  about our Army.    On the whole the Russian Air Force, in the assessment of the  Defense Ministry leadership, for instance, is capable of  resolving the tasks that constitute its mission in collaboration  with other branches of the Armed Forces. And this assessment is  not a mere inference by our high-ranking generals. It is based  on the results of the series of major exercises held in  1993-1994 involving the use of aviation units, the in-flight  refueling of large numbers of aircraft, the launch of highly  accurate aviation missiles, and the control of Air Force forces  and systems from airborne control centers.    Of course, dozens of unsolved problems in the Air Force  could  be mentioned. For instance, the flying time of pilots of  fighter and ground-attack aircraft remains a bottleneck. There  are many reasons for this -- the lack of airfield facilities,  the shortage of fuel, and so forth. At the same time, as the  experience of exercises shows, Russian pilots are capable of  delivering highly accurate strikes, including from cloud cover.    I would also like to mention the following point. Some  experts are worried and others, as the esteemed reader will have  realized, angered by the fact that the branches of the Armed  Forces are being reduced. But not all of them feel this way.  There are many analysts who immediately say: "The Army is big,  but it is not being downsized," "the military do not know the  strength of the Armed Forces," "it is time to start cutting the  Army," and so on in a similar vein.    What can I say about this? As the Defense Ministry  leadership has repeatedly stated, a planned reduction in the  strength of the Armed Forces is being carried out today -- in  1993 alone it was cut by more than 260,000 men. Sometimes you  hear the figure: There are 3 million military in the country.  Specialists are aware that this figure relates not only to the  Army, but also to other "power" structures. Sometimes military  leaders themselves give the Army's strength without explaining  whether this is the authorized strength, the roll call strength,  or the actual strength. Some commentators see no difference  between these. And so you get comments like: "The military do  not know the strength of the Armed Forces."    Since we are talking about reductions, I will note that not  everything is simple here. First of all, sharp reductions are  an overly expensive pleasure for the state. Furthermore, this  process entails the solution of many other problems, the most  acute of them being housing. Over 77,000 servicemen discharged  into the reserve do not have a roof over their heads today. It  is also necessary to decide how big the reductions should be.  The former Supreme Soviet legislatively defined the strength of  the Armed Forces as 1.5 million men. At the time  parliamentarians explained that they were proceeding from  "generally accepted" norms: The armies in the developed  countries, they said, are usually no more than 1 percent of the  country's population. Foreign experience, it has to be said,  should be taken into account. But does this formal percentage  take account of Russia's specific features, its geopolitical  position, the length of its borders, the density of its  population? Calculations by General Staff specialists show  that, even with implementation of the principles of mobile  defenses, the strength of the Army should be around 2 million  men. This strength will make it possible to create troop  groupings capable of responding adequately to any increase in  the military threat in a particular region by transferring  mobile components there.    ...Yes, the reforms are proceeding with difficulty,  sometimes  painfully, but painstaking daily work to improve the Army is  continuing. In the immediate future, during 1994 and 1995, it  is planned to complete the formation of the Armed Forces and to  create the basis for their profound transformation. In  particular, it is planned to create the Mobile Forces, to  continue the creation of troop (force) groupings and the  military infrastructure, and to complete the withdrawal of  troops to Russia's territory. The plans also include a further  switch to the mixed principle of manpower acquisition for units  and formations and the transition from a predominantly army- and  division-based forces structure to a corps and brigade  structure. Full-scale comprehensive studies will be carried out  to substantiate the strength, combat composition, and structure  of the Armed Forces for the period after 1995.    A remark by General of the Army Grachev that is often quoted  is: "We have succeeded in halting the sharp decline in combat  readiness and military discipline among the troops.  Servicemen's morale makes it possible to resolve the set  tasks." It is quoted and presented ironically: What an  achievement -- it has proved possible to halt the sharp decline  in combat readiness. Yes, this is an achievement, and a great  one, as is recognized by everyone who is very familiar with the  former and the present state of affairs among the troops and who  knows the constant shortage of funds and the masses of other  extremely complex problems. Incidentally, today it is time to  say to the military leadership: Don't spur on the reforms so  sharply, this is all too complex and difficult a job.    Look at the Blueprint for the Organizational Development of  the Armed Forces (an unclassified document), and you will see,  dear reader, the face of our Army by 1995 and the year 2000, a  modern face. The main aim is to create qualitatively new Armed  Forces according with the demands of the present  military-political situation in the world and the real extent of  the military danger to Russia. But the implementation of any  provision of the blueprint requires not merely efforts on the  part of the Armed Forces military leadership and the entire  officer corps, but also efforts by the whole state and society.  And here straightaway is a line from the blueprint --  "reforming the structure of the Armed Forces."    What does reforming the structure of the Armed Forces mean?  It is not a matter of shuffling a deck of cards. It is not a  matter of drawing a new diagram. It is not a matter of drawing  up a new document. It is a terribly complex and difficult job  spanning many years and an extremely costly measure. Finally,  it is the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in uniform  and of those who work in the defense sphere.    The first stage -- the elaboration of the blueprint itself  --  is not easy in itself, although for some reason certain analysts  and critics do not think so and constantly bandy about words  like "I believe" and "I see the structure of the Armed Forces as  follows." Certainly, everybody is entitled to have and to  express their own viewpoint. But anyone who is concerned for  their reputation and respectability should, in my view, put a  period after the words "I believe." This is not merely  superficial, it is very superficial.    The options for the structure of the Armed Forces that have  been elaborated today by the Defense Ministry's main military  scientific centers (I emphasize, not by individuals but by  collectives of military professionals such as, for instance, the  General Staff Military Academy) are not being implemented  straight away but are being verified at various command staff  games, exercises, training sessions, and so forth. For any  error in this sphere could entail the breakdown of the existing  defensive system, the expenditure of trillions of the people's  rubles, and disruption to the lives of hundreds of thousands of  people in uniform.    Of course, if you are not concerned about the country's  security, if you are not cost-conscious, and if you portray  people in uniform as mere cogs and chess pieces, in theory you  can announce very striking changes in the Army every month and  report that "considerable heights have been scaled in the course  of military reform." But only adventurists could venture to do  such things.    And why is nobody considering the following question: Is it  possible at all to reform the Army, such a complex mechanism,  when you have no money in your pocket? Of course not, if you  regard the enhancement of the combat readiness and combat  capability of units and formations as the main aim of the  military reform. So why is it precisely the people who shout  loudest about the absence of reforms in the Army who are voting  in parliament today against granting the Armed Forces not only  any money to carry out those reforms but even against providing,  so to speak, a "subsistence income"? All the indications are  that mercenary political calculations are the driving force  here: "The worse the situation in the Army is, the more  unstable society is. And therefore the better chance I have in  the question of power."    Let us return once again to the question of contract  personnel. In itself the number of contract personnel will not  increase combat readiness. Why is that? Quality in the human  resources and morale on the part of the volunteers are also  needed. And these components depend directly on her majesty the  economy, on funding, and on the state's potential to allocate  it. In 1993 the state earmarked 6 billion rubles for the  recruitment of professionals. Just as much is needed this year.  But it is not just a matter of money.    Do the respected critics of military reforms in the Army  know  that the most important thing for those who work with contract  personnel is to look them in the eye sometimes. Why? The Army  (the state) sometimes cannot deliver on its commitments. And  the reasons for this are well known. In some regions  professionals do not receive their wages for two or three  months. Only peanuts are allocated for the leasing of housing.  The list of problems could be continued. And so...I am afraid  we may lose those who have already joined the combat ranks and  who are willingly going to serve in "godforsaken spots" and  "trouble spots."    Give us the money, officers of the General Staff and the  commands of the branches of the Armed Forces say, and we will do  the job, we will recruit precisely half the personnel on  contract today rather than in the year 2000 as planned. But  unfortunately, respected critics and analysts, unfortunately....  At present only 25 percent of servicemen are professionals.    What about research and development, modern types of  equipment and arms, and the infrastructure.... All this also  requires colossal funding, like the entire military reform,  assuming, I repeat, that its main aim is deemed to be to  increase the Armed Forces' combat readiness rather than destroy  them.    Certainly analysis of the progress of the military reform  must proceed on the broadest scale. Certainly the successful  advance of military reform is helped by objective critical  articles. But the authors of various opinions (especially those  who "reform" absolutely everything as they see fit -- one can  only marvel at their flights of fantasy) should also remember  the following point -- unfair criticism demoralizes people in  uniform who are honestly and selflessly serving the homeland,  our Russia, and is a painful blow to military reform. And  unscrupulous speculation is doubly harmful.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> EAST, WEST GERMANY TO MERGE SOCCER LEAGUES, FIELD ONE TEAM  </P> <P> Soccer officials from East and West Germany agreed today to merge their leagues  and form a joint national team next year.  </P> <P> The decision, announced by West German Soccer Federation spokesman Wolfgang  Niersbach, means that one German team will compete in the 1992 Olympics and  European Championship.  </P> <P> In 1994, one German team will defend the World Cup title West Germany won in  Italy earlier this month.  </P> <P> East German soccer players will be eligible for the joint national team  beginning in 1991, Niersbach said. He said East German teams will withdraw  immediately from European international competitions but that club teams will  not withdraw until the 1990-91 European Cups finish next spring.  </P> <P> Starting with the 1991-92 season, the West German first division will be  expanded to 20 clubs to include the top two East German teams this season. The  second division will accept six East German clubs.  </P> <P> The soccer union was moved forward by one year to reflect the quickening pace  of political unification that is expected to be completed in December. Earlier  plans had called for the soccer merger to come in 1992.  </P></p>

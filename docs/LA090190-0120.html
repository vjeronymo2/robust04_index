It  said investigators were reviewing allegations that plant officials knowingly  concealed leaking pipes at a Golden can plant that tainted at least two and as  many as five underground springs with the toxic chemical solvent TCA in the  1970s and early 1980s. The brewery released details of the pollution in  February, along with a five-year, $1 million clean-up program.  </P></p>

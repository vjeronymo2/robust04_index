			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Turkey to buy US helicopters UNITED TECHNOLOGIES of the US has won a long-running battle to supply helicopters to the Turkish armed forces, with the issue of a letter of intent yesterday for co-production of its Sikorsky Black Hawk, a deal worth Dollars 855m (Pounds 483m). More than two years after the initial tender, Turkey's Defence Industry Executive Committee, headed by Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, announced Sikorsky had been selected to negotiate terms for the joint manufacture of 50 S-70 A multi-purpose Black Hawks, with a further 25 sold for immediate delivery. Agusta of Italy and a French-German consortium of Aerospatiale and Messerschmitt-Bolkow Blohm were also in competition. However Sikorsky won vital support from the US Export Import Bank which is to provide export credit guarantees for 80 per cent of the contract. US officials say Eximbank has offered Dollars 1.3bn in support of the Sikorsky bid. US officials say the long-term nature of the co-production deal paves the way for an additional supply of 75 helicopters. The Sikorsky contract, originally for 200 helicopters, was tendered six times, before being scaled back because of budgetary considerations. The deal is one of several contracts under consideration as Turkey enhances its rapid reaction capability in its eight-year struggle with Kurdish separatists along its borders with Iran and Iraq. Turkey is likely to delay its long-standing ambition of full customs union with the European Community set for 1996, in a bid to protect key domestic industries, according to a senior government official. Professor Emre Gonensay, the prime minister's key economic adviser, said in an interview with the Financial Times that Turkey was on line to eliminate tariffs and introduce a common external tariff but that Ankara would negotiate to extend import protection for 'some sectors' beyond the 1996 deadline. This is the first admission that Turkey is considering rescheduling the phased elimination of tariff barriers under a 1963 association agreement with Brussels, which is the first step to full accession to Community membership. More than half Turkey's trade is with the EC.</p>

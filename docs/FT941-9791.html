			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / International Company News: KOP lifts estimates of deficit Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, said it would report a larger loss for 1993 than previously estimated. The warning follows a decision to take an extra FM900m (Dollars 158.7m) in provisions for credit losses, in keeping with a change in accounting policy. KOP said its result would still be 'significantly better' than in 1992, when its deficit reached FM3.7bn, but it indicated it would no longer meet its target of halving the year-earlier figure. It still aimed to return to the black next year. The bank, which will announce its preliminary figures on Tuesday, said it was taking the extra provision 'to prepare for future risks arising mainly from developments in the Finnish trade and construction sectors'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Unmanned auxiliary power facilities, transformer stations, water treatment and pollution abatement facilities, and other utility installations that serve the PES but are not integral, the loss of which would not create an immediate secondary hazard. These do not need barricades. However, unmanned auxiliary power generating or converting facilities supplying power exclusively to the explosives storage area and security fence lighting may be located as close as fire distance from explosives facilities (50 feet for fire resistant structures and 100 feet for non-fire resistant structures). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Dunnage preparation and similar support structures housing non-explosives operations, if used only by PES employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Service magazines that are a part of operating lines. Distances are based on the quantity/type of ammunition or explosives in the service magazine(s), not in the operating building. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Exposures as indicated in paragraph (b) of this section, if blast suppression, structure hardening, and so forth, provides comparable protection for the personnel and equipment involved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) At sites exposed to potential blast overpressure of 3.5 psi (0.24 bars) occurring at 18W <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1/3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (see column 4, Appendix B to Subpart F and Appendix C to Subpart F of this part), the following facilities or operations are permitted: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Construction workers in the vicinity of ammunition production areas, waterfront areas where ammunition is being handled, or areas for loading explosives onto aircraft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Surveillance, maintenance, and inspection buildings; and labor-intensive operations closely related to PES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Comfort, safety, and convenience buildings exclusively supporting PES, including lunchrooms, motor pools, area offices, auxiliary fire stations, transportation dispatch points, and shipping and receiving buildings (not magazine area loading docks). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Operations and training functions manned or attended only by personnel operating the PES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Parking lots for privately owned vehicles belonging to personnel at the PES. See &sect;184.33. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Service magazines that are part of operating lines. Distances are based on quantity/type of ammunition or explosives in the service magazine(s), not in the operating building. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Container stuffing and unstuffing operations that are routine support of PES. This applies to main support functions set aside for support of manufacturing operations. Container stuffing and unstuffing in magazine areas are permitted at intermagazine distances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) At sites exposed to potential blast overpressure of 2.3 psi (0.16 bars) occurring at 24W <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1/3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (see column 8, Appendix A to Subpart F of this part), the following facilities or operations are permitted: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Public traffic routes for NEW under 100,000 pounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Personnel exposed to remotely controlled operations. NOTE: Personnel at control stations less than 24W <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1/3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  from the PES, though provided with blast-attenuating and fragment-defeating shields, shall not be exposed to overpressure greater than 2.3 psi (0.16 bars). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Open-air recreation facilities exposed to PES containing NEW of up to 100,000 pounds, such as baseball diamonds, volleyball courts, and so forth, used by personnel assigned to the facility, where structures are not involved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) At sites exposed to potential blast overpressure of 1.7 psi (0.1 bars) occurring at 30W <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1/3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the following facilities or operations are permitted: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Public traffic routes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Private vehicle parking in administrative areas. Minimum fragment distance should be applied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) At sites exposed to potential blast overpressure of 1.2&hyph;0.90 psi (0.08&hyph;0.06 bars) occurring at 40W <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1/3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to 50W <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1/3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (see column 5, Appendix A, to Subpart F of this part), the following facilities or operations are permitted: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Inhabited buildings; administration and housing areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Plant boundaries and magazines servicing the establishment in general (see &sect;184.45(j)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Athletic fields and other recreation areas when structures are present. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Flight line passenger service facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Utilities providing power to most of an establishment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Storehouses and shops having strategically or intrinsically valuable contents which shall not be jeopardized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Functions which, if momentarily out of action, would cause an immediate secondary hazard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.44  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Ammunition and explosives facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section identifies the types, general specifications, and siting requirements of various magazines for ammunition, explosives, and other dangerous materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Barricades and earth cover for magazines_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both constructed barricades and undisturbed earth can protect ammunition and explosives, structures, and operations against high-velocity, low-angle fragments, although the barricades may be destroyed in the process. Further, barricades provide limited protection against blast in their immediate vicinity, provide no protection against high-angle fragments, and are ineffective in reducing the blast pressure in the far field (inhabited building or public traffic route distance). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Barricade requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Protection is considered effective when barricades meet the following minimum requirements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The slope of a barricade will not be steeper than 2/3 (rise/run). To reduce erosion and facilitate maintenance operations, future constructions should have a slope of 1/2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The earth barricade shall consist of material described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Barricade height and length shall be determined as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Heights.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Establish a reference point at the top of the far edge of one of the two stacks that the barricade is to separate. If the tops of the stacks are at different elevations, this reference point shall be on the lower stack. Draw a line from the reference point to the top of he other stack. Draw a second line from the reference point to form a 2 degree angle above the first line. To limit barricade height, each should be as close as possible to the stack that served as the reference point. See Appendices A and B of this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lengths.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The length of the barricade shall be determined as shown in Appendix C of this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

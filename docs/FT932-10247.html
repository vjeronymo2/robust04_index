			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Letter: Fossil fuel levy should not be replaced by VAT Sir, David Newbery makes two rash assertions in an otherwise excellent commentary on the workings of the electricity supply industry and the Fossil Fuel Levy ('Fossil fuel levy fails efficiency test', May 6.) The first is to say that 'the obvious solution is to replace the FFL with VAT.' Why? The construction of nuclear power stations was a strategic decision concerning the diversity of supply and it was reaffirmed by successive governments. It was therefore not a mistake. If this decision now requires revenue to support it then surely this should be raised through the general burden of taxation rather than falling on the hapless purchaser of electricity. This leads to his second assertion: that lower product prices would result from a switch to VAT on electricity. This is unlikely to happen in the present circumstances with margins tight or non-existent, and UK manufacturers paying more for their electricity than those of any other EC country except Germany and Italy. The more likely prospect is that manufacturers would give a huge sigh of relief as an uncompetitive cost component was removed. In short the saving would not be passed on. The FFL is a device to raise (not recover) revenue. It is manifestly wrong and as, David Newbery remarks, a distortion; industry would be well rid of it. Unfortunately, to remove its effect to taxation would tend to attack one of the government's sacred cows of not appearing to raise taxes and is therefore not politically correct.

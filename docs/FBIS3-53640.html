			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin outside the </F> Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem on 16 January -- recorded]    [Text] [Rabin] I would not like to draw conclusions  merely on the basis of a news conference.    [Sukenik] But President Clinton himself said that President  al-Asad spoke about normalization with Israel.    [Rabin] But it was Clinton who said that, I have to hear it  also from al-Asad.    [Sukenik] The new factor is that normalization was mentioned  for the first time in the Syrian context.    [Rabin] Normalization has been referred to by the Syrians in  the past. The problem is how it fits into the concept of peace,  what the timetable to achieve peace is, and what price Israel  has to pay.</p>

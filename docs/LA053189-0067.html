"I wasn't  looking for the biggest salary in the league; I didn't think I deserved that."  </P> <P> Reeves, 45, is entering his ninth season as Denver's coach, a tenure during  which he has compiled a 74-45-1 record, including back-to-back Super Bowl  appearances after the 1986 and 1987 seasons. The Broncos were 8-8 last season.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Intelligence Service of the Ministry of  Government has stated that "Vivo Rojo" -- a self-styled extreme  left group -- is a "clandestine activist partner" within the  Revolutionary Workers Party (POR). This information was  disclosed today by Colonel German Linares, chief of the National  Intelligence Service of the Bolivian Police.    During an exclusive interview with LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz,  Linares asserted that the "Vivo Rojo" subversive group is not a  disorganized faction within the Armed Forces but -- on the  contrary -- "it bases its actions on the ideology of the  trotskyist POR-Lora [whose leader is Guillermo Lora]."    Linares added: "Our investigations in various parts of the  Republic reveal serious evidence that this subversive group,  which is of a socialist tendency, plans its terrorist actions  following the dissemination of bibliographic material that  contains its doctrine. This is directed toward previously  selected sectors of Bolivian society."    Linares said that "Vivo Rojo" has links "which, although  unimportant, are particularly notorious among the small groups  within the Bolivian Armed Forces that supply information on acts  of corruption and irregularities to the clandestine group."    Linares explained: "`Vivo Rojo' takes advantage of these  cases to write slogans against the democratic system, the  government, and the high military command."    This statement somewhat explains the active presence of the  group in La Paz, Oruro, El Alto, and Cochabamba, where its  members have painted "graffiti" criticizing the current  government and the Armed Forces high command, which they call  "accomplices of the country's shortcomings."    The Intelligence Service chief disclosed that the  investigations which started last year to definitely establish  the presence of the extremist "Vivo Rojo" group, is classified  as "B-2 Information."    Linares said that for national security reasons, and to  protect the investigations, the State Intelligence Directorate  is unable to supply more information on what is being done to  "dismantle this clandestine organization" which he called  "incipient and unharmful to our democratic stability."    The controversial police official asserted on 6 January,  however, that the POR "is a latent threat to our democratic  stability."    He said the methods used by the group to indoctrinate, to  implement its partisan activities, and to disseminate its  ideology explicitly reveal that "it is a political group which  seeks by any means to discredit the institutions and their  legally established authorities" and thus destabilize the  democratic system in Bolivia.</p>

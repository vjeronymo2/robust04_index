			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Bonds: German finance agency in Pounds 100m Eurobond issue KREDITANSTALT fur Wiederaufbau, the German finance agency, launched a well-timed Pounds 100m Eurobond, which benefitted from Monday's rally in gilt prices, but was virtually sold out ahead of yesterday's market weakness. The Pounds 100m issue due 2008, arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, met strong demand from UK institutions, who bought the deal up quickly. The yield spread of 25 basis points more than the comparable gilt was considered quite attractive, offering a slight pickup over Gefco's recent Pounds 100m issue at a 22 basis point yield spread. The spread on the KFW deal had tightened to 23 basis points by the end of trading, due to the weakness in the gilts market. Dealers said the continued switching by UK fund managers from equities to bonds is benefitting sterling bond offerings. There was also some demand from continental Europe, especially Germany, despite continued concerns about the weakness of sterling. The Pounds 100m deal was swapped into floating rate D-Marks (Pounds 75m) and floating-rate sterling (Pounds 25m). The swaps market is illiquid beyond 10-year maturities, but BZW found a corporate counterparty willing to pay fixed rate over more than 15 years. Supply of sterling bonds is likely to remain sluggish, despite demand from investors, due to generally poor swap opportunities. Meanwhile, two more deals emerged in the Australian dollar sector, where demand has been strong since the market rally in the wake of last week's positive news on inflation. The State Bank of New South Wales launched an ADollars 150m issue of 9 per cent Eurobonds due 2002, arranged by Deutsche Bank, and Provence Alpes-Cote d'Azur, the French regional authority, launched an ADollars 100m seven-year deal via Hambros Bank. Both deals met firm demand, although the State Bank deal performed more strongly due to the higher coupon and the more familiar name. The State Bank deal was bid at less 1 1/2 points, well within fees of 2 1/8 points. However, the deal by Provence Alpes, which launched its first foreign bond in the Swiss franc market in January, also performed well, to trade within fees of 2 points. United Newspapers, which publishes the Daily and Sunday Express, has refinanced some of its Pounds 400m of debt in the US private placement market. The company has completed a Dollars 100m seven-year private placement, arranged by Chase Manhattan. The deal is believed to have been priced to yield 120 basis points above the seven-year US Treasury.</p>

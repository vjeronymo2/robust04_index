			<p>BFN     [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] chief political  commissar, Colonel Frank Mugambage, yesterday held a press  conference in Kigali.    Journalists of the BBC, ABC, Finland, LIBERATION newspaper  of  France, and Radio Muhabura attended the press conference.    The focal point of the press conference was the presence of  the French troops in Rwanda.    Asked how the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] views the French  troops' presence in the country, Col. Frank Mugambage said that  if the French troops came for a purely humanitarian mission,  then the RPF has no quarrel with the French. But if they came  with a hidden agenda of involvement in the war, then RPF is  ready to defend itself. Col. Frank Mugambage explained that the  RPF cannot stop bring suspicious about the French troops'  presence, because the French Government has always used the  pretext of humanitarian missions to intervene in the Rwandan  conflict while they have other hidden interests. Col. Frank  Mugambage also said that the French troops know very well that  their government armed and trained Rwandan Government forces and  militias, and therefore the French Government is responsible for  the genocide and massacres committed in the country.    Asked what the RPF thinks about the French troops coming to  Rwanda through Gisenyi and Cyangugu, an area controlled by  Government forces, the RPA chief political commissar said that  what is important is to know the actual reason for the French  troops' presence.    Responding to a question on the Arusha peace agreement, Col.  Frank Mugambage said that the Arusha peace agreement is not yet  nullified and once the war is over, RPF is ready to respect the  implementation of the agreement.</p>

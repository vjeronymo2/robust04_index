			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Defence sector on alert GEC's early morning delivery of an all cash offer worth 1400p a share for submarines group VSEL and subsequent purchase of some 14 per cent of the shares left the stock market with plenty to chew on over the weekend. News of the counter bid pushed VSEL up by 72 to 1395p in turnover of 12m, sent Vosper Thornycroft ahead by 14 to 71p but left British Aerospace languishing at 459p, a decline of 16. The initial reaction in the stockmarket was to talk of the bid in terms of a knock-out blow. Lord Weinstock's offer tops the all share bid from BAe by 144p and outstrips BAe's cash alternative by 160p. But this approach softened later as BAe showed itself determined to attack the GEC deal. It opted to play the monopolies card, declaring the offer from GEC as posing competition concerns. This led to speculation among some analysts that BAe might just decide to increase the value of its all-share terms. But the sheer power of GEC's finances - its cash balances of Pounds 3bn exceed BAe's market capitalisation by around Pounds 1.2bn - were the main talking point yesterday as GEC itself gained 8 to 278 1/2 p. Brian Newman, electronics specialist at stockbroker Henderson Crosthwaite said 'GEC's market raid effectively removes the financial engineering aspect of BAe's bid for VSEL.' He said GEC will not relinquish its shareholding, and that will prevent BAe from using its tax losses.</p>

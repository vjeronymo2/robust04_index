			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Freeze on assets clouds Ecuador's debt talks NEGOTIATIONS between Ecuador and its bank creditors over restructuring of Dollars 6.5bn in medium-term debt have been complicated by a senior creditor's attempt to secure a debt repayment. The creditor, the Zurich-based Weston Compagnie de Finance et d'Investissement, secured last week from a court in New York a pre-judgment order to freeze the assets of the Republic of Ecuador and other state entities. Weston was demanding repayment of Dollars 20m in various syndicated loans it had bought at a discount in the secondary market this year. The order, yet to be confirmed, froze some assets of the state-owned oil shipping company Flopec. However, Ecuador's central bank said that, 'due to opportune precautionary measures' it had taken, the country's international reserve position had not been affected. Mr Michael Strauss, a New York lawyer for Weston, said his client had requested payment from the government 'before it was forced, by the defendant's refusal to pay, to commence action in the courts.' Talks between the government and creditor banks, led by Lloyds of Britain, over debt rescheduling have been moving slowly. Banks want Ecuador to resume partial interest payments stopped last July, suspecting the government is trying to depress the secondary market price of its debt in preparation for a buy-back. They have objected to a government proposal, made in December, which suggests holders of debt should tender it in a unified auction for cash or financial instruments. The banks also dislike Ecuador's lack of explicit recognition of overdue interest - which accounts for Dollars 2.2bn of the Dollars 6.5bn under negotiation - and say the discount of nearly 70 per cent being sought is excessive. In response, they have suggested a more conventional, 'Brady-style' debt reduction agreement, named after former US treasury secretary Mr Nicholas Brady. Banks would exchange debt for two types of concessional bonds and a discount of 35 per cent. This structure is similar to that agreed in principle this week between creditor banks, led by Bank of Nova Scotia, and the Dominican Republic. This agreement, covering Dollars 775m of debt and Dollars 265m of arrears, allows for an exchange of debt for two types of concessional bonds, a discount of 35 per cent and separate treatment of overdue interest. The Ecuadorean government says it needs bigger concessions.</p>

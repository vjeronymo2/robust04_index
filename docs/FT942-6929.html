			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: All-round expansion boosts Alba by 40% Alba, which earlier this month acquired Goodmans Industries, a rival consumer electronics group, for some Pounds 3.6m, yesterday reported sharply higher full year profits, Pre-tax profits increased by 40 per cent to Pounds 7.39m in the year to March 31 from Pounds 5.05m last time when the outcome was reduced by a net Pounds 791,000 in provisions and closure losses. Turnover from continuing operations rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 126.3m against Pounds 109.9m, when discontinued operations added a further Pounds 3.59m. Mr John Harris, chairman, said the UK companies showed 'strong and consistent growth, greatly outperforming the pattern of the consumer electronics market as a whole'. He said all the businesses made a positive contribution to operating profits which increased from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 7.39m. Net interest costs fell to Pounds 351,000 (Pounds 467,000) as net borrowings fell to Pounds 8.55m (Pounds 9.53m), equivalent to gearing of 35.4 per cent. Total sales of the group's UK brown goods companies, Alba Radio and Bush Radio, increased by 16 per cent while the Hinari domestic appliance division continued its rapid growth, lifting sales by 65 per cent to Pounds 16.5m. Overseas, Alba France increased sales from FFr118m to FFr121m (Pounds 14.1m) despite the recession, while the small German operations lifted sales from DM6.3m to DM11.9m (Pounds 4.7m). In Hong Kong, Harvard Maritime again made a strong contribution to profits although sales slipped from HKDollars 220m to HKDollars 200m (Pounds 17.2m) reflecting the discontinuation of certain low margin businesses. Earnings per share increased from 8.32p to 12.11p and a final dividend of 4p is recommended for a total of 5p (4.85p). The shares closed 3p higher at 180p. Commenting on the Goodmans acquisition, Mr Harris said the product fit was good and expressed confidence that it would be possible to improve profit margins. 'We think we can make it as profitable as the rest of the group,' he said.</p>

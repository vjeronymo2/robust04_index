			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Fondiaria plans reorganisation FONDIARIA, Italy's second biggest private-sector insurance group, yesterday announced a wide-ranging restructuring of three stock market-listed subsidiaries. It wants to create bigger and more competitive units ahead of a long-awaited liberalisation of motor insurance premiums. The three companies - Latina, La Previdente and Ausonia - are small or medium-sized insurers with both life and non-life operations. Under the proposed reorganisation, Ausonia will be merged into La Previdente via a rights issue, while La Previdente will also be expanded through the purchase of Latina's motor business. Meanwhile, La Previdente's life insurance activities are to be transferred to Latina Vita, which will change its name to La Previdente Vita. 'This is the first of what are likely to be many Italian insurance rationalisations from within,' said Mr Simon Rudolph, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. 'The aim is to beef up capital and expertise, especially with the liberalisation of motor premiums on the way.' A committee of Italy's lower house of parliament this week approved measures to deregulate motor insurance premiums. The move, which is due to go into operation next year, should become law following acceptance by the senate next week. Both Latina and Ausonia derive much of their premiums from motor insurance, while La Previdente tends to specialise in personal lines.</p>

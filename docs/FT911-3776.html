			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Economic rescue package put to Soviet parliament PLANS FOR sharp curbs on strikes and political rallies in the Soviet Union, coupled with an emergency system for distributing grain and other foodstuffs were put before parliament in Moscow yesterday by Mr Valentin Pavlov, the prime minister. The proposed programme to deal with the country's escalating economic crisis also calls for financial stabilisation measures, giving Gosbank, the central bank, the power to control spending by republican governments. The measures are almost certain to be approved by the parliament and Mr Pavlov suggested that the Kremlin may resort to force to implement them. The proposals involve banning strikes and political rallies during working hours. Hard-liners in the Soyuz (Union) group called for the declaration of a state of emergency which would impose a ban on strikes and bring rebel republics to heel. Mr Pavlov said in response: 'They are right in two respects. There is a need for a special regime in certain crucial branches of the economy, such as energy and transport, and in certain regions.' Although it seeks to encourage privatisation and foreign investment, the plan has been criticised by the country's leading economists as too vague to combat the budget crisis. Mr Pavlov stressed that the so-called anti-crisis programme required co-operation with the republics and that any use of force would be limited. In the case of the current coal strikes, he suggested that force could be used to allow working miners to cross picket lines. He said: 'A state of emergency, or special regime, does not mean that people will be forced back to work, but it is possible to let people work with the help of force. For that purpose, we do not need the army.' President Mikhail Gorbachev, who faces threats to his leadership from his own Communist Party and as a result of strikes backed by opposition forces, is under pressure to opt for a coalition government. However, Mr Pavlov rejected calls for a coalition. He said his appeal a few months ago for alternative cabinet nominations had been ignored by the republics. He added that it was not up to him to decide whether to agree to the proposal by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, for 'round table' talks with republican leaders and opposition forces. Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, said, however, that the government could not introduce market reforms without recognising the sovereignty of republics. Mr Pavlov's programme also proposes that republics which refuse to sign a union treaty and contribute to the union budget should be charged hard currency for raw materials and energy. Only eight out of 15 republics have agreed to sign the treaty incorporating them into a political federation. The economic union proposal, approved by the republics last year as the foundation for economic reform, committed republics to a common market and currency, a financial stabilisation programme, and rapid privatisation. Mr Gorbachev is due to discuss the draft treaty with the republics today. One possible compromise would be to stop trying to push republics into signing the treaty if they agree to drop trade barriers, subscribe to a common financial policy, and delegate limited responsibilities to the central government.

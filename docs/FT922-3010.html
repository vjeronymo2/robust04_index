			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / How To Spend It: Cameo appearances - They're small, subtle and sought after . . . - Janet Marsh previews a major sale of sophisticated art PERHAPS it is the attraction of opposites: cameos, which are among the smallest of art works, have had a peculiar appeal throughout history to royal collectors graced with the sobriquet 'Great.' Alexander the Great and Mithridates the Great both had legendary collections. So, in the modern era, did Catherine the Great of Russia, by far the most voracious collector of all time. Admitting to being gripped by 'cameo fever,' Catherine bought up collections throughout Europe. Her hoard, which finally numbered more than 10,000, now resides in the Hermitage at St Petersburg. The most notorious royal collector was Prince Stanislaw Poniatowsky, whose enthusiasm began when he inherited 150 historic engraved gems from his uncle, King Stanislas Augustus of Poland. By the time of his death in 1839, the number had grown to 2,601, 1,800 of them bearing the signatures of all the great artists of the ancient world. Alas, when the collection came on the market in London, Victorian society was scandalised to learn that the signatures, like the greater part of the collection, were fake - commissioned by Poniatowsky himself from contemporary Italian craftsmen. After a century and a half, Poniatowsky's posthumous disgrace readily is forgiven. He chose his artists well, so that his 'fakes' often are valuable works of art in their own right. Several intaglios from these 'fakes' will realise as much as Pounds 3,000 each when they are sold by Sotheby's on Thursday. They are part of an anonymous collection of more than 250 cameos and intaglios which Sotheby's experts consider to be the best to come on the market since the second world war. Studying these exquisite little gems, it is easy to understand the enthusiasm of collectors during two millenia. Cameo carving is one of the subtlest and most sophisticated arts bequeathed by the ancient world. Its special skill consisted in carving a precious stone, formed in layers of different colours, in such a way that one colour served as a ground for figures cut in relief in the upper layer of contrasting colour. Different stones - onyx, agate, sardonyx, chalcedony - gave different colour effects. Indian sardonyx, for instance, would combine white and yellow with reddish browns; Arabian sardonyx provided cold blues and blacks. For most of the history of cameo carving, the same primitive tools were used to work the immensely hard stones (often it was said that it took as long to cut a large cameo as to build an entire cathedral). Originating in Alexandria at the end of the 4th century BC, the art reached a peak in the Hellenic and Roman periods. Portraiture and mythological and pastoral scenes predominated. Alexander the Great would be portrayed only by his court craftsman, Pyrgoteles. Emperor Augustus's personal sculptor, Dioskourides, the most influential of classical cameo artists, continued tactfully to portray his master as a comely youth for decade after decade. The art of cameo carving survived through the early Christian and Byzantine eras to flower again in 13th and 14th century France and Italy, when the favoured subjects were religious and heraldic. The Renaissance brought renewed interest in classical antiquity and spawned a new breed of rich and passionate collectors and patrons like the papacy, the Medicis, and Lorenzo the Magnificent. Artists supplied them with copies of the antique, but also developed new contemporary styles. Essentially a classical art form, the cameo declined both in technique and fashion with the baroque taste of the 17th century - only to re-emerge to a final rich flowering with 18th century Neoclassicism. In this period, the passion for cameos became epidemic. Every European gentleman of culture and means had to have his personal collection - or at least a few of the sets of casts of famous gems which were marketed along with descriptive catalogues. Distinctive schools of cameo art grew and flourished in France, Germany, Austria, England and, above all, Italy. In England, the finest cameo sculptors were the brothers William and Charles Brown, 400 of whose works - around half their total output - were commissioned by Catherine the Great and are now in the Hermitage. A William Brown cameo portrait of the Duke of Wellington appears in the Sotheby's sale, estimated at Pounds 800-1,200. The saleroom estimates suggest that cameos are still under-valued. Prices anticipated for a group of 16th century agate cameos range, for instance, from a few hundred pounds to Pounds 3,000-4,000 for a finely sculpted bust portrait of a warrior in a contemporary gold mount; this seems a very modest price for a Renaissance art work of high quality. The highest estimates (Pounds 5,000-7,000 each) are for two exceptional works from the neo-classical period: large, double-sided cameos by the Roman masters, Giuseppe Girometti and Giuseppe Cerbera. Cameo prices may, in fact, still reflect the decline in enthusiasm that resulted from the mass of spurious and mechanical cameo work turned out late in the 19th century. There are signs, however, that the time is ripe for a return to style and favour, with fashionable designers like Bulgari now leaning to archaeological inspiration for their jewellery designs.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BA acquires minority in Air Miles British Airways has bought the outstanding 49 per cent of Air Miles Travel Promotions from MCM. The airline would not say how much it paid but it is thought be less than Pounds 10m. BA has owned 51 per cent of Air Miles, since it was founded in 1988. Mr Robert Ayling, BA's group managing director, said: 'Air Miles is one of the best-known brand names in the country and we are now keen to get on with developing the business as a mass market customer loyalty programme.' Air Miles runs customer loyalty schemes for 150 companies, including BA's Executive Club, National Westminster Bank, Shell, Hertz, Hilton and Marriott. BA said it carried about 500,000 passengers through the Air Miles programme last year. This represented a little more than 5 per cent of its surplus seats, which would otherwise have been empty. There are 3.75m registered collectors of Air Miles in the UK and 2.75bn Air Miles in circulation. BA said this was the equivalent of 10 per cent of its unused capacity. The number of Air Miles in circulation is likely to grow to 5bn by the end of this year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Here in the Netherlands an aircraft belonging to the  Dutch airline KLM has crashed while landing at Amsterdam's  Schiphol airport. At least three of the 24 people on board have  been killed; 13 others were seriously injured and eight people  received slight injuries.    The aircraft, a Swedish-made Saab 340, had taken off from  Schiphol bound for Cardiff in Wales. Shortly after departure,  however, the pilot reported engine trouble and returned to the  airport. While landing, the plane overshot the runway, crashed  into a nearby field, and broke in two. Eyewitnesses report  seeing an explosion but no fire. Air traffic to and from  Schiphol was temporarily stopped after the accident.</p>

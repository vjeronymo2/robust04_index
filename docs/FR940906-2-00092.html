			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> The Ten-day Application Period <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The draft amendment would have required dealers to apply to a depository at least ten days prior to the closing date of a new issue to establish depository eligibility. This provision was intended to support the routine practice recommended by depositories even though depositories can and do make new issues eligible on shorter notice when it is necessary. A majority of commenters, however, believe that the ten day application period is inappropriate for an MSRB rule in light of the need of underwriters occasionally to settle a new issue with an issuer on short notice. Three commenters proposed a different approach that would tie the application requirement to the date of sale rather than the date of closing. These commenters suggested that the provision be changed to require the application to be made within twenty-four hours of the award of the issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSRB notes that this suggestion will avoid potential problems that might occur in the occasional cases in which there is less than ten days between the date of award of a competitively sold issue and the settlement of the issue. At the same time, the requirement for underwriters to apply to a depository on the day after the date of sale gives depositories the maximum amount of time available to establish eligibility and prepare for a book-entry distribution. Therefore, MSRB has included in the proposed rule change a provision requiring that the application to a depository must be made within one business day of the date of sale of the issue. The proposed rule change also includes a requirement that if the full documentation and information required to establish depository eligibility is not available from the underwriter at the time the initial application is submitted to the depository, the underwriter shall forward such documentation to the depository as soon as it is available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Exemption Until July 1, 1996, for Issues Under $1 Million in Par Value <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The draft amendment included exemptive language for issues under $1 million in par value. This exemption was included because of concerns that had been expressed by some dealers relating to their desire to continue to use physical settlements for small issues with limited distribution. Eight commenters urged MSRB to include issues under $1 million in par value within the rule with most citing the need for increased settlement efficiencies offered by book-entry when T+3 becomes effective. Two commenters suggested a temporary exemption for small issues and noted that ultimately all issues should be included within the scope of the rule but that some underwriters of small issues may need time to adjust their procedures associated with clearance and settlement of small issues. MSRB believes that this is a reasonable approach and has adopted a provision in the proposed rule change that will exempt issues under $1 million in par value until July 1, 1996. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four commenters suggested that a reduction in depository application fees would reduce the need for an exemption for small issues. MSRB, however, has no authority to change the fees charged by depositories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Exemption for Issues Maturing in Sixty Days or Less <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters suggested an exemption for issues maturing in sixty days or less and noted that these issues typically do not trade in the secondary market. MSRB is not aware of any substantial trading in such short-term securities and agrees that an exemption for issues maturing in sixty days or less would be appropriate. The exemption accordingly has been included within the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Other Suggested Exemptions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested exempting leases, notes, and bonds sold to nondepository participants. MSRB is not aware of any reason that these types of securities should be treated differently than other municipal securities. It accordingly has not provided exemptions for these types of issues in the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Depository Eligibility Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSRB understands that of the three depositories accepting municipal securities for deposit, the eligibility criteria is essentially the same and that nearly all municipal securities meet the criteria for depository eligibility. If, however, an issue could not be made eligible at any of these depositories, the proposed rule change will not require the underwriter to make an application. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  One commenter urged that depositories reach agreement on uniform minimum guidelines to minimize the burden on underwriters and inefficiencies that might be caused by any differing eligibility criteria among the depositories., While MSRB agrees with this goal, MSRB does not have regulatory authority over depositories. MSRB will continue to monitor any problems created by differing eligibility criteria and may suggest remedial actions to the Commission in the future if differing eligibility criteria create problems under the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The exception in the proposed rule change for new issues that do not meet a depository's eligibility criteria is necessary because the terms of a new issue ultimately are controlled by the issuer of the securities, which is not subject to MSRB rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so filing or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) by order approve such proposed rule change or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSRB requests that the Commission delay effectiveness of the proposed rule change until sixty days after Commission approval to allow dealers to adjust their underwriting procedures to obtain compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested people are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The new system also proposed changes in the enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority for dually participating (Medicare and Medicaid)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. OBRA '89 provided the basis for decisions as to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether the State's or the Secretary's determination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance or noncompliance or choice of remedies is binding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the case of a dually participating facility. Moreover,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statute at section 1919(h)(8), provides that whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification decisions and enforcement actions, as applied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Medicaid, are those of the Secretary or the State, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same certification decision and enforcement actions will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also apply to Medicare in a dually participating facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the statute specifies whether the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or State's certification decision and enforcement remedies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will prevail in the case of Federal validation surveys. Our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 28, 1992 proposed rule reflected these changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed rule published on August 28, 1992 in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , we proposed to implement the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of OBRA '87, as further amended by subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1988, 1989, and 1990 legislation. The specific proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Routine Process of Certification and Enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. State-Operated Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We proposed at &sect;488.155 and &sect;488.180 that in all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State-operated facilities, the State survey agency conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the survey, recommend to HCFA a certification of compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or noncompliance and recommend appropriate enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action(s). After the survey agency forwards its survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> findings and recommended certification and enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action(s) to HCFA, HCFA in turn would certify facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance or noncompliance and impose any enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Non-State Operated Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At &sect;&sect;488.155 and 488.180, we proposed the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For non-State operated SNFs, to continue to use the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process in effect before October 1, 1990, whereby the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agency conducts the survey and certifies compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or noncompliance with Federal requirements subject to HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval. We also proposed that the survey agency recommend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate remedies, and that, after the survey agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forwards its survey findings and recommended enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action(s) to HCFA for review, HCFA determines the compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or noncompliance of the facility and imposes any enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For non-State operated NFs, to continue to use the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process in effect before October 1, 1990, whereby the survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency conducts the survey, certifies compliance or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance with Federal requirements, and recommends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate enforcement actions to HCFA and the Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency. The certification of compliance or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance by the State is final except in the case of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaint or validation survey, or review of the State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> findings by HCFA in which the Secretary substitutes her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judgment for that of the State. Except where the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervenes, the State makes all enforcement decisions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposes remedies after consideration of the survey findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recommended enforcement remedies. Regardless of which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency of the State exercises certification and enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority, however, we look to the Medicaid State agency to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assure compliance with Federal requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For dually participating facilities, the survey agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would conduct the survey, certify compliance or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance with Federal requirements, and recommend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate enforcement actions. The certification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance or noncompliance and recommended enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action(s) by the State would be sent to both HCFA and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid State agency for review. In a new subpart F  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Remedies for Long-Term Care Facilities with Deficiencies),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we proposed to add a new &sect;488.234, to set forth procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for occasions when there are State and Federal disagreements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving findings when there is no immediate and serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threat to the residents. We view section 1919(h)(8) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act as calling for the application of the decision for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid NFs to Medicare SNFs when a facility is dually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Radovan Pavlovic: "Bokan and Pelovic on </F> Volunteers' Difficulties"]    [Text] One of the anecdotes retold most frequently during  the fierce conflicts in Croatia and having to do with the role  and participation of some of the Serbian volunteers in the  homeland war went something like this: "Have you heard that ...  was badly wounded?," with the blank filled in with the name of  one of the many commanders of volunteer units. The uninformed  would of course answer in the negative and ask in surprise: How  and where? "Well, on the front, in a mopping-up operation a  television set fell on his foot."    This anecdote, with its obvious moral, is like a summary of  the criticism that has been publicly expressed about the  participation of volunteers in military operations. It did of  course go further than that, and the Serbian fighters were  accused of having gone off to war with a single motivation  --looting. To some extent a climate was even created to the  effect that those going off to battle voluntarily were mainly  people from the wrong side of the law and that under the guise  of "mopping up" they were collecting for this operation, which  is the most dangerous operation in a war anyway, by hauling off  expensive and valuable things -- gold, equipment, and  automobiles.    In some battle areas there were even special units, not made  up exclusively of volunteers of course, whom observers  scornfully referred to as "vultures." When the forces of the  federal army passed, "patrols" would arrive equipped with  special peacetime vehicles for loading up plundered booty. There  is no doubt that all the belligerents suffered from this virus,  and the credit for this kind of "mopping up" should go not only  to the volunteers, but also to the local people where the  battles were waged, as well as to certain units of the former  JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], which a military court has been  and is now concerned with.    What is said about the behavior of the fighting men by some  of the commanders and responsible officers of the numerous  volunteer units which, under various names and referred to as  Serbian guards, with chetnik insignia and other national  symbols, waged war in Croatia and Bosnia?    Major Borislav Pelevic of the Serbian Volunteer Guards  [SDG],  better known as Arkan's Tigers, says that there is looting and  crime in every war, but that the volunteers who put their lives  at risk because of Serbian ideals should not be sullied because  of the acts of a few. Pelevic says of the Tigers that they came  out of every action with their honor bright and that there were  no cases of looting or any crime against civilians and prisoners  in the ranks of the SDG. Our informant explained that iron  discipline was enforced among the Tigers. There was a soldier's  code which all had to abide by. The most popular penalty for  those who messed up was the old and well-known folk punishment:  25 lashes on the bare buttocks. Alcohol was strictly  prohibited. If anyone was found to have had a drink, he would  get the prescribed "ration" of lashes in front of the entire  formation, Pelevic said, illustrating it for us. But anyone who  got drunk would be expelled from the guards.    In three years of waging war, Pelevic relates, there was one  Guard member who took some gloves. This Tiger received 25 lashes  at the point where the back loses its honorable name, and he was  expelled from the Guards.    Dragoslav Bokan objects to volunteers returning from the  battlefield never being asked where and how they waged war, but  what they brought back. He says of the White Eagles ("because of  what I said, they died for Serbia, while others only called for  war in fiery nationalistic speeches"), but they did not fight a  war between whites and blacks. "We did not distinguish who were  Muslims and Croats, which houses were theirs. The local people  where we fought knew that, both who was rich and where people  were hiding things." Bokan says that the local people in those  areas formed their own militia, a new military-police caste  which issued permits for carrying away goods, weapons, and  automobiles.    Bokan says that the looting occurred in three waves and that  the thieves were not confined to the volunteers. In the first  wave the looters were deserters, those who were fleeing from the  whirlwind of war; the regular army benefited from the second  phase and took away some things under the guise of transferring  military equipment and armament; and after them the local people  and their militia made their contribution.    Our informants agree that those returning from the front  encounter spiritual chaos -- no one asks you about your wounds,  but what you stole, Bokan says. Instead of welcoming words, they  are met with accusations; hungry fighting men, discharged from  their jobs, look upon them with suspicion; and the peacetime  thieves deliver moral lectures to them, Bokan believes, adding  that that is why many fighting men "crack" and have difficulty  adapting. The only survivors will be the volunteers who are  ideologically aware and who are ready to put up with all that,  Bokan warns.</p>

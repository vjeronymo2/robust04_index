Over the past five years, the university has named over 190  professors and associate professors from among the young and  middle-aged staff.    From 1992 to 1993, the university appointed 55 professors  and  47 associate professors, the youngest professor being only 28  years old.    To improve teaching and research conditions for young and  middle-aged professors and associate professors, the university  adopted eight measures. They included giving academic  allowances, Ph.D. degree allowances, a scientific research  foundation for young experts, a publishing foundation, and an  academic holiday system.    Recently, the university invested 2 million yuan in the  salary fund to ensure the adoption of a new higher salary  standard system formulated by the government.    It has used the money to set up "Jun'an -- Beijing  University  Scientist Prize" for the academicians of the Chinese Academy of  Natural Sciences, and tutors for graduates pursuing a Ph.D.  course.    The university has built six apartment buildings for the  people engaged in post-doctoral researches.    The improvement of the teaching and living conditions has  attracted some returned graduates from abroad. So far this  university has 60 professors who returned from abroad after they  completed their Ph.D. degree.</p>

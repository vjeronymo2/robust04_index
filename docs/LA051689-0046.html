			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST INDICTMENT DUE IN FBI CAPITOL STING  </P> <P> The first indictment of a legislator growing out of a three-year federal  investigation of political corruption in the Capitol is expected soon -- most  likely in the next week or two, several sources familiar with the probe have  told The Times.  </P> <P> Almost nine months after FBI agents raided Capitol offices on Aug. 24, scrutiny  of one lawmaker, Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), has become particularly  intense, these sources said.  </P> <P> Late last week, a federal grand jury subpoenaed legislative committee records  on at least four bills, including two authored by Montoya and two others that  went through committees on which he served.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, prosecutors also formally warned a former Montoya aide,  Amiel A. Jaramillo, that he was a target of the ongoing federal grand jury  investigation, according to Jaramillo's attorney, Christopher H. Wing. The  warning came in a letter inviting Jaramillo to testify voluntarily before the  grand jury -- a request that Wing declined.  </P> <P> The letter meant that Jaramillo was "somebody who at this stage they (grand  jury members) feel they are looking at as a suspect," Wing said Monday, "but it  doesn't mean ultimately he ends up being indicted."  </P> <P> Wing said that the fate of Jaramillo, now an attorney in private practice, is  tied to that of his former boss. "If Montoya gets hammered, my client will as  well," Wing said.  </P> <P> There are other signs that Montoya has been the subject of much of the grand  jury's attention. A number of present and former Montoya aides have testified  before the grand jury in the last several weeks, according to Montoya's  attorney, Michael S. Sands.  </P> <P> Also, in March, prosecutors obtained a warrant to search the offices of a  Capitol lobbying firm, Governmental Advocates. Agents were interested in a  series of bills either authored by Montoya or which went to the Senate Business  and Professions Committee, which he chairs. To obtain the warrant -- which  allowed investigators to keep the premises secure during a lengthy search --  prosecutors first had to convince a federal judge that they were likely to find  evidence of violations of racketeering, extortion and conspiracy statutes.  </P> <P> Montoya has repeatedly asserted his innocence of any wrongdoing and referred  questions about the investigation to his attorney Sands. Sands said the  slowness of the investigation may be because prosecutors are having trouble  assembling a case.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. David F. Levi refused to comment on when or if he would ask the  federal grand jury for indictments growing out of the undercover sting  operation, called Brispec (for Bribery -- Special Interest).  </P> <P> In the sting, FBI agents posing as businessmen sought help from legislators and  legislative aides for special-interest bills that would supposedly help them  set up a shrimp processing plant near Sacramento.  </P> <P> Since the sting came to light last summer, there has been increasing criticism  of Levi by some legislators and defense attorneys. If he has evidence of  criminal conduct among legislators, then he should have filed charges long ago,  they argue.  </P> <P> There is even some sentiment within the FBI's Sacramento office that the  investigation of possible legislative misconduct has gone on far too long --  that Levi had enough evidence to begin taking cases to the grand jury several  months ago, according to federal sources.  </P> <P> However, Levi has a reputation as a cautious and painstaking taskmaster,  someone willing to withstand the pressure to move ahead until he is satisfied.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'There Is a Tension'  </P> <P> "In all cases, particularly long-term investigations of this nature, there is a  tension between the U.S. attorney's office and FBI management," said one U.S.  Justice Department official. The U.S. attorney "has a natural hesitancy to  indict" until all the evidence is in hand; the FBI "has a natural desire to  move on to something else."  </P> <P> In recent days the internal FBI criticism has subsided, just as the  investigation appeared to be quickening.  </P> <P> Montoya was one of four legislators whose offices were raided last August. The  others were Assembly members Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), Frank Hill (R-Whittier),  and Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles). State Board of Equalization member Paul  Carpenter, a former Democratic senator from Cypress, has also been identified  as a target of the federal investigation.  </P> <P> Montoya has been the subject of the latest flurry of FBI activity. Last week,  agents delivered grand jury subpoenas in the Capitol requesting records of at  least four different bills, each with some connection to the Whittier Democrat:  </P> <P> * A 1981 special-interest bill, authored by Montoya, exempting the proposed  Bell Mar land development in the Malibu area from review under the state  Coastal Act.  </P> <P> * A 1987 measure by Assemblyman Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton) that changed the  rules governing personnel agencies, exempting certain job-listing services from  state licensing. The bill was approved by the Senate Business and Professions  Committee, which is chaired by Montoya.  </P> <P> * A 1988 bill by Montoya that would have given authority over local recycling  programs to the California Waste Management Board, rather than the Department  of Conservation, which oversees implementation of the state bottle recycling  program. The bill, which was opposed by conservation groups, was defeated.  </P> <P> * A 1986 bill carried by Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) for the Recording  Industry Assn. of America, which affected the terms of individual recording  contracts. Montoya served on the Senate Industrial Relations Committee and  voted to approve the measure, which was vetoed by the governor.  </P> <P> Only two indictments have been filed so far as a result of the corruption  probe. Both are spin-offs of the sting and not directly related to it. In  January, the grand jury charged Yolo County Sheriff Rod Graham with extortion,  bribery and conspiracy in collecting $3,650 in campaign contributions from an  FBI informant who was cooperating in the Capitol corruption probe. Graham's  former top deputy, Wendell Luttrull, has pleaded guilty to extortion charges.  </P></p>

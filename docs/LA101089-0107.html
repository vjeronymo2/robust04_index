			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOLO DEPUTIES TAKE PAY PLEA TO VOTERS  </P> <P> After two years without a contract and three without a pay increase, Yolo  County sheriff's deputies are turning to the voters for a raise.  </P> <P> Contract talks with the county have stalled, and deputies are taking action to  put a pay-raise initiative on the June or November ballot next year.  </P> <P> The deputies became the lowest-paid law enforcement officers in the county in  September, when the small farm town of Winters gave its police force a raise.  </P> <P> Last week, the Yolo County Deputy Sheriffs Assn. voted unanimously to spend  $5,000 to draft the initiative and prepare petitions, said Deputy Larry Garcia,  the association's vice president. Deputies need signatures of 10% of the  county's voters to qualify the measure for the ballot.  </P> <P> Deputies presently earn between $1,780 and $2,163 a month.  </P></p>

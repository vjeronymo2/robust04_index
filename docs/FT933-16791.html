			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Bundesbank rate cuts offer boost to Europe's economies: US welcomes 'positive' move / Four ERM countries follow suit THE BUNDESBANK yesterday officially blessed the German government's latest budget cuts and offered the international economy a helping hand with a reduction of half a percentage point in its discount rate. The cut to 6.75 per cent in its official floor rate and a reduction of a quarter point in the Lombard rate to 8.25 per cent was welcomed by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, who said it would help the government implement public spending cuts agreed by the ruling coalition earlier this week. 'The cut will give an impulse to the German economy and at the same time strengthen growth potential in other EMS countries,' he said. 'It secures confidence in the D-Mark, without which economic recovery would be impossible.' The discount rate is the floor rate at which the Bundesbank finances the banking system. The Lombard rate represents the Bundesbank's ceiling to German money market rates. In Washington, the White House described the Bundesbank's decision as 'positive'. Mr Rexrodt said the Bundesbank was treading the delicate path between support for the economy and 'the preservation of credibility in the D-Mark'. The D-Mark rose against the dollar and most European currencies yesterday. After some sharp swings in European trading, the D-Mark finished in London at DM1.699 against the dollar,  1/2 a pfennig stronger than the previous day, and in New York at DM1.693. Sterling, however, continued to make inroads against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM2.5625 - its highest position since devaluation last September. In late New York trading it was at around DM2.5632. Mr Ulrich Beckmann, senior economist at DB Research, the research arm of Deutsche Bank, said the cut could 'only do good for the economy', adding: 'We are sure to see further cuts in interest rates, probably in September.' Mr Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, said the cuts had been made first and foremost 'for domestic reasons'. He added: 'It would have been undiplomatic to leave the cut until after the G7 meeting next week. The move takes off the international heat.' Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the central bank president, said in Leipzig that the move - the first on internationally sensitive rates since April - meant no one could now accuse Germany of being a high-rate country. The rate of growth in both inflation and money supply had slackened, he said. The D-Mark had stabilised after its recent weakness, and the government's new package of DM25bn (Pounds 9.8bn) budget savings was a step in the right direction. 'It was especially important' that Bonn had made the main savings through cuts in spending, Mr Schlesinger added. The government's proposals were the only new or substantially changed factor in the criteria on which the bank formulates interest rate policy. In recent weeks, the bank has publicly identified runaway government borrowing as the main force driving monetary growth, and therefore as the main current source of future inflation. The spending cuts proposals, agreed by the coalition government at the weekend, were 'certainly suitable in the light of the state of public finances', Mr Schlesinger said. Within the ERM, the Bundesbank decision prompted rate cuts in Denmark, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, while Austria and Switzerland, which link their currencies to the D-Mark, also cut rates, as did Sweden. Spain was expected to cut rates today. Britain chose not to follow the German move. The Treasury welcomed the Bundesbank rate cuts, but a spokesman said UK base rates, which have been unchanged at 6 per cent since late January, were consistent with ministers' policy objectives. However, Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, said that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, should cut rates as part of European-wide interest rate reductions. Mr Brown said that Britain's economy was still sluggish in many areas in spite of some promising signs. Retail sales had fallen for two consecutive months, business failures were rising and the government was forecasting falling investment, he said. The announcement of a fixed rate volume tender for next week's auction of securities repurchase agreements (repos) was taken by economists as a sign that the Bundesbank is earnest in wanting to steer down money market rates. The 28 basis point cut in next week's repo rate to 7.30 per cent comes after a period of several months during which this core rate was trimmed via a sequence of small cuts, more recently cuts of only 1 basis point.

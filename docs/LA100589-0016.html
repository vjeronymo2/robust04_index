			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL SCHOOL CONTROL HOLDS PROMISE; CUTTING UP THE SCHOOL DISTRICT DOESN'T  </P> <P> Once again, suggestions are being made to reorganize the Los Angeles Unified  School District or divide it into smaller districts. These proposals are made  with the hope of improving the achievement of the district's students.  Unfortunately, they offer no assurance of success.  </P> <P> Since coming to the district little more than two years ago, I have become well  aware of periodic studies to determine if a different structure might be more  effective, while still maintaining the benefits of the district as currently  constituted. Time and again, the findings have indicated no overriding  advantage.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, change must be achieved to address the challenges and problems of  low achievement and high dropout rates common to many districts of all sizes  throughout the nation. Reform is possible without the disruption, expense and  possible legal issues that would arise in dismantling the district.  </P> <P> The current endeavor that I find particularly promising is the district's  implementation of school-based management. This process will provide the  benefits of local governance by educators, parents and the community while  retaining the economies of scale that are a distinct advantage of the current  structure of the district. Indeed, the size of the district came about not  because of expansionist ambitions but because of the economic advantage to  other smaller districts whose needs could best be met by annexing to the Los  Angeles system.  </P> <P> With school-based management, I am confident that each local community will be  able to decide what is best for the students served in its schools. Critical to  any such effort is the ability to attract and retain good teachers and the  assurance of adequate financial resources. Neither of these factors stands to  be improved by a breakup of the district. In fact, we currently are finding an  unprecedented increase in well-qualified candidates for teaching positions.  This bodes well for our future instructional efforts.  </P> <P> As for any potential savings in salaries, it is simplistic to presume that a  breakup of the district would result in a reduction in the number of  administrators. Glance at the structure of any school district, regardless of  size. Personnel must still be assigned to manage coordination of the  instructional program, construction and maintenance of facilities,  transportation, purchasing, insurance, collective bargaining and the other  functions required by law.  </P> <P> The fact is, according to the latest statistics available from the Los Angeles  County superintendent of schools, the Los Angeles school district spends a  smaller percentage of its education expenditures on central administration than  40 of the other 41 unified school districts in this county.  </P> <P> Most important, however, is the consideration of what is at stake and whether  there are advantages to breaking up the Los Angeles district.  </P> <P> Our students excel in a variety of competitions on the local, state and  national levels. Visits to our schools reveal the enthusiasm and optimism  shared by so many of our students and staff. The size and diversity of the  district allow for many educational opportunities that would no longer be  possible if the district were broken up. And there would be no assurance of any  improvement in achievement. Numerous programs to address students' unique needs  are possible only because of the aggregate number of such students in this  district.  </P> <P> Finally, it is tempting to infer circumstances and arrive at generalizations to  support a proposal that may have no realistic connection with the problem or  its solution.  </P> <P> Local community support of school efforts -- in which parents are active  participants -- will provide the most effective means of turning around the  schools in need of improvement, encouraging those that are accomplishing their  goals and achieving the success we know our young people are capable of  attaining.  </P></p>

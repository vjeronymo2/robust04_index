			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Observer: Under wraps Still on the subject of cricket, has anyone seen Barry Flanagan's odd statue which has just been removed from under the nose of the Bank of England? It was supposed to be a cricketer but a Financial Times reader rang to complain that it was more like a kangaroo sitting on top of some cricket stumps. Hardly the sort of work that should be supported by a nationalised industry, complained one reader, especially when England was receiving such a pasting at the hands of the Aussies. However, when Observer went to inspect the offending exhibit, which was part of the Art in the City project, it had disappeared. Had Eddie George, the new governor of the Bank of England, eradicated the last traces of his cricketing-mad predecessor? No such luck. The Bank of England is just as much in the dark as the sculpture's owner, Waddington gallery, as to the cricketer's current whereabouts. Let's hope the Australians haven't kidnapped it.</p>

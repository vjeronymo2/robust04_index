			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA'S CAR CULTURE  </P> <P> I am retired, after 30 years in the auto industry as a salesman, general  manager, dealer and auto trade association manager.  </P> <P> Criticism runs high against the salesman and dealer, but how about dishonest  customers? Many times I have seen cars traded in with bald-headed tires,  switched after the car was appraised with good tires; spare wheels missing,  radios taken out and cheap batteries replacing new ones; heavy oil in engines  to cut out noise -- just to mention a few.  </P> <P> Customers also lie about car condition, their credit and the competition's  prices. They get the best cash price and then expect retail for their car.  </P> <P> Then they forget all the good things done for them by a dealer when they get  ready to trade -- will drive a hundred miles to save $50, then expect the local  dealer to give them service under warranty. I had one expect me to buy  white-wall tires off his car, purchased from another dealer, because he had a  set in his garage.  </P> <P> RAYMOND E. RIEGER  </P> <P> Covina  </P></p>

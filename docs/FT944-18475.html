			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / US takes out Haiti faction US forces in Haiti yesterday stormed the headquarters of Fraph, the nationalist paramilitary faction loyal to the army government, as the US took the initiative on Haiti's political stability, reports James Harding in Washington. The attempt to neutralise the Front for the Progress and Advancement of Haiti, which killed at least five people at a pro-democracy march last Friday, was the first instance of the more aggressive US policy to disarm those Haitians thought to be trying to derail the restoration of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. After US soldiers had raided the offices of Fraph in downtown Port-au-Prince and put a tank outside the building, a crowd of Aristide supporters gathered outside. The raid will be seen as a response to criticisms, after the violence at the end of last week, that the US forces were failing to guarantee security of pro-Aristide demonstrators. It may also have been pre-emptive - Fraph members were reported to be planning attacks on Aristide activists in the week before his scheduled return about October 16. The importance of disarming the opposition was reinforced yesterday when a US soldier was shot and injured.</p>

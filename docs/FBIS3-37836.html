It is expected that the deputy foreign minister, who  is now visiting a number of Latin American countries, will  arrive in Washington on 26 February.    According to a high-level Russian official, it would be  possible, if we wanted to, to expose U.S. diplomats and some  Russians collaborating with these special services working in  Moscow, but we are not doing this. Just as the Americans were  not doing this until now. It is not clear why they have to cast  a shadow on their relations with Russia, which earns the highest  number of points for Bill Clinton's administration, the  high-level Russian official stated.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Hosokawa beating off the old guard: William Dawkins on Japan PM's drive to rid electoral system of corruption THE GRAND old men of Japanese politics are fighting to tone down the new government's plans to reform the scandal-prone political system. Their comfortable jobs are at stake. Thanks to their efforts, prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's radical plans to change the electoral system and curb political funding have been delayed. But they still look set to get through parliament, in one form or another, by his self-imposed deadline of the end of the year. Mr Hosokawa might have to extend the current parliamentary session, due to end on December 15, by 10 days or so. But most people are betting that he will not have to resign, as he has implied he would do if he misses the deadline. It is the only issue that holds together his unstable seven-party coalition, brought to power in an election in July with the LDP's defeat after 38 years in government, triggered by public disgust with its failure to enact political reform. Moreover, more than 85 per cent of lower house members want reform, according to a recent poll. The big unanswered question is exactly what kind of reform? Currently, the lower house of parliament is elected on a multi-seat constituency system, a consequence of which is to pit candidates of the same party against each other, so encouraging politicians to use money and influence rather than policies to attract votes. The proposals would create a 500-seat lower chamber, in place of the present 511 seats, of which 250 would be in single-seat constituencies and 250 chosen by proportional representation. Voters would cast two ballots. Corporate donations to individual politicians, an obvious source of corruption, would be banned. Companies would, however, be allowed to give cash to political parties. To ease the pain for individual politicians, there would be a state subsidy of Y41.4bn (Pounds 258m) a year to parties to dole out to candidates. Mr Hosokawa was hoping to get these plans through the lower house of parliament by Friday to ensure time for them to get through the upper house, where his coalition also has a majority, by the end of the session. However, the coalition has accepted an opposition LDP demand to delay public hearings on the bills - a legal requirement for passage through parliament - until November 8 to 11. Mr Hosokawa now hopes to get them through by the middle of this month, so that he can present the results to US President Bill Clinton, a keen advocate of Japanese political reform, when they meet in Seattle on November 19 at a summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation council. The LDP's interest in delaying the bills appears to be to enforce as many amendments as possible by pushing Mr Hosokawa close to the deadline. It is a high-risk game. 'If the LDP were seen by the electorate to block reform again it would be the final disaster. The party would have to break up,' says Mr Jeff Young, political analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia. The party's image is already being further damaged by allegations that it received funds from the scandal-ridden construction industry, in which public investigators have begun to circle around Mr Noboru Takeshita, a former LDP prime minister. The LDP's capacity to carry out a rational strategy is limited, however, by its internal divisions. Officially, the LDP wants to shift the balance towards single-seat constituencies, in which well-funded parties such as the LDP, which is still the biggest with 227 lower house seats, fare best. It has tabled a counterplan for a 471-seat lower house, of 300 single-seat constituencies and 171 under proportional representation. Mr Hosokawa has indicated that he is prepared to compromise. But there is a hard core of between 60 and 70 LDP members of parliament, mainly older politicians, who oppose the whole principle of single-seat constituencies. They have worked for years to build up local constituency support groups and do not relish having to compete against younger people for a single party nomination. However, the eagerness of Mr Yohei Kono, the new LDP president, to avoid upsetting the old guard rather than aggressively pursue the party's official pro-reform policy has frustrated reform-minded younger members. Former LDP members now at the top of the coalition are doing their best to woo these ex-colleagues to their camp. The coalition is also divided. Some members of the Social Democratic party, the largest coalition partner, are unhappy with single-seat constituencies, not because they share the LDP traditionalists' preference for the multi-seat system, under which the former Socialists lost half their seats in the July election, but because they feel they would do less badly under proportional representation. 'Inevitably, Mr Hosokawa will have to water down the package to get it through parliament,' says Mr Takashi Inoguchi, professor of politics at Tokyo University. The vested interests that will have to be satisfied are important because they provide an indication of the problems in store for the next stage. Once those bills are passed, the parties will have to meet in committees to redraw Japan's electoral boundaries. They will have to decide how to split the large multi-seat constituencies into small single seaters and how to shift the disproportionate weight of the rural vote - which counts for roughly three times the urban vote - to the cities. That process will take at least six months of behind-the-scenes power play. If, as seems likely, Mr Hosokawa is still in a job by then, he is expected to call an election under the new rules around next July, as soon as the new boundaries have been agreed. The coalition's chance of winning an election after political reform rests on its ability to sink its differences and campaign on a single ticket.</p>

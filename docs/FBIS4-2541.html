			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Xuejun (1728 1331 6511): "Our Province </F> Makes a Fairly Big Stride in Price Reform"]    [Text] Our province has achieved substantial progress in  conducting price reform along the orientation of the socialist  market economy, made big strides in changing the pricing  mechanism and readjusting the pricing structure, strengthened  the price monitoring work and the price regulation and control  work, and effectively checked the inflation trend and the act of  arbitrarily raising prices and pooling funds, donations, and  fees.    We have strengthened the building of pricing monitoring  network and enhanced the ability to cope with the changes in  market prices. Liaoning Province's initially built price  monitoring network has monitored the macroeconomic situation of  the whole province and the changes in the prices of essential  means of production, farm and sideline products, and consumer  goods after pricing reform was carried out in various cities and  counties. Through tracking and monitoring the situations in 14  large commercial enterprises, six wholesale markets, and 10  large production enterprises across the province, this network  has provided reliable information and policymaking basis for  governments at all levels to keep abreast of the local pricing  situation in a timely manner, to grasp the price reform  strength, and to select major pricing reform items. In March  last year, the prices of eggs continued to decline and were  lower than the production cost in some cities. On the basis of  carrying out monitoring work, Shenyang and Yingkou Price Bureaus  studied countermeasures, urged the governments to purchase and  store eggs for future use, and succeeded in raising the prices  of eggs within a short period of time and avoiding the situation  of stopping to raise chicken.    We have improved a guiding mechanism in which the prices are  formed mainly by the market, and cultivated the markets to  ensure their sound development. Our provincial pricing  departments have regarded entering the market as a strategic  task for establishing the new price regulation and control  system. The pricing departments across the province have  entered and stationed in 58 means of production, real estate,  and farm produce markets. The price inspectors stationed in the  markets have publicized the state commodity price laws and  regulations, and pricing policies, promulgated and disseminated  relevant pricing information, participated in market  construction, and supervised units entering the markets and  businessmen to observe the state pricing laws and regulations.  Pricing departments at all levels have also actively  coordinated the prices in various trades and guaranteed that  commodity prices were kept relatively stable within a certain  period of time.    We have applied economic, administrative, and legal means to  regulate and control the market prices. At present, price  regulation funds have been established in 12 cities and 21  counties. Last year, we invested 50 million yuan in stabilizing  the prices of some major nonstaple foods whose cost rose or  declined suddenly, the market prices of major nonstaple foods  during festive days, and the prices of commodities essential to  people's life, stabilized the prices of the "vegetable baskets,"  and ensured that the prices are linked with the price index  control target.    Last year, following the decontrol of meat, vegetable and  coal prices in the province, 14 cities across the province  generally decontrolled the marketing price of grain. Most of  the prices of commodities under the management of provincial and  city authorities had been decontrolled. Considering the  province's total purchase of agricultural products, 90.4 percent  of the products were purchased at market adjusted prices, of the  total retail sales of commodities, 96.6 percent of the  commodities were sold at market adjusted prices, and of the  total sales of the means of production, 87.4 percent of the  products were sold at market adjusted prices, and these three  figures were higher than the national average. Thus, we have  initially formed a new price operational mechanism with market  adjusted prices as the mainstay. The adjustment of prices of  railway transport, freight transport, electricity, oil products,  state-allocated timber, and of bus tickets and tape water supply  of some cities has played an active role in alleviating the  difficulties in our province's basic industry and promoting a  more rapid development in the national economy.</p>

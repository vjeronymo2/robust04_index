			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Tories offer olive branch to Lady Thatcher CONSERVATIVE party chiefs plan to offer an olive branch to Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, in an attempt to orchestrate a show of unity at next week's party conference in Blackpool. Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, will use his speech on the opening day of the conference next Tuesday to emphasise the continuity between present policies and the Thatcher reforms of the 1980s. Sir Norman, a long-serving cabinet minister under Lady Thatcher, is likely to argue that her admirers have no reason to be hostile to the leadership of Mr John Major, the prime minister. This year's conference comes with Mr Major's position under threat after the party's disastrous performance in two recent by-elections. Morale has been further sapped by an increasingly bitter internal argument over tax and spending ahead of next month's Budget. Combined with the continuing rift over Europe, this has given the impression of a party ravaged by civil war. Lady Thatcher fanned the flames earlier this week by criticising the government's plans to extend value added tax to domestic fuel. Party leaders are now bracing themselves for an interview with the former prime minister to be published in this week's Sunday Times, which is to start serialising her memoirs on October 10. In a separate development, Lady Thatcher has agreed to help raise money for the party by attending one or two fund-raising dinners early next year. The party said last night it welcomed the move both as a gesture of reconciliation and because the former prime minister is a successful fund-raiser. The party had an accumulated deficit of Pounds 19m at the end of March this year. Lady Thatcher is expected to arrive in Blackpool on Wednesday night and to appear on the conference platform the following day for the debates on employment and the economy. This means she is likely to be present when Mr David Hunt and Mr Kenneth Clarke - two of the most left-leaning members of Mr Major's cabinet - are speaking. The chancellor is almost certain to face calls both to rethink VAT on fuel and to rule out Budget tax increases altogether. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, plans to address a conference fringe meeting on Thursday, just three weeks after his scathing criticism of policy in a daily newspaper. Lord Tebbit, the former party chairman, will also be active, with three fringe appearances, culminating in a high-profile debate with Mr Clarke on the future of Conservatism.</p>

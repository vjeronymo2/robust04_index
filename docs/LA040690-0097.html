			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SYLMAR MAN FOUND GUILTY OF MANSLAUGHTER  </P> <P> A23-year-old Sylmar man was convicted Thursday of voluntary manslaughter for  killing a 21-year-old Los Angeles man during an argument outside a Reseda  restaurant last year.  </P> <P> Inho Kim was charged with murdering Hong Soon Lim last April 27 in the parking  lot of the Seoul Seoul restaurant on Louise Avenue.  </P> <P> But after a non-jury trial, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber said  there was sufficient evidence only to prove voluntary manslaughter.  </P> <P> Prosecutors and the defense attorney agreed that Kim, Lim and several others  argued inside the restaurant bar shortly before Kim killed Lim by shooting him  once in the head with a revolver.  </P> <P> But Deputy Public Defender Randall A. Megee argued during the trial that Kim  shot Lim after Lim threatened him and tried to choke him. Deputy Dist. Atty.  Ann Korban contended that Lim was walking toward Kim when Kim shot him with no  immediate provocation.  </P> <P> Haber scheduled sentencing for April 26. Kim faces a maximum sentence of 13  years in prison, Megee said.  </P></p>

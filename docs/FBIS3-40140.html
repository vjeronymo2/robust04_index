			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dai Qing: "How Will Han Dongfang Establish His </F> Own Orientation?"--First paragraph is editor's note]    [Text] This article was written to explain the  circumstances of Chinese workers under 40 years of Chinese  Communist Party rule and the events involving the CPC's  deep-seated feelings against the workers' movement and against  Han Dongfang. It also deals with the question of what role Han  Dongfang has set out for himself.    With the overseas democracy movement seemingly quieter with  each passing day, suddenly, we have the events surrounding Han  Dongfang's challenging Beijing and then running into roadblocks.  According to my view from the sidelines, the Chinese Government  and the overseas democracy movement each do their own talking,  but they never have any contact. Hence, what has emerged is a  situation of mutual denouncement, mutual revilement and harming  the opponent but never attacking his vital points; not because  both sides are different, but only because the mental knapsacks  of both sides are crammed so full of their stock roles and  phrases, they are unable (or unwilling) to talk about that which  is the most crucial.  <H5>  The CPC Cannot Bring Itself To Mention Han Dongfang </H5>   If we look closely at the relevant legal statutes, the  Chinese Government is in the wrong. Everybody maintains that Han  was issued an valid passport, and if they want to put him in  prison, to kill him or want to force to surrender, they must  first allow him to enter the country, at least in theory. If  they don't in fact imprison him, or kill him, then most likely  they will also not be able to play the game of inducing him to  capitulate, and will not be willing to sink so low as the  Kuomintang and resort to assassination, so it will push the view  abroad that everything is just fine, something that is clearly  naive, is it not? Of course, using the term "naive" to describe  the CPC I fear is a perfectly inappropriate use of the word. The  problem is that is it not naive to use the term naive in regard  to the CPC? My response is that I find it difficult to talk  about this.    What do I mean by difficult to talk about? First we must  talk about Han Dongfang. Han emerged as a leader of the  "Workers' Free Trade Union" in 1989, and no matter how hard he  worked to appear moderate and rational, within the government  and the society as a whole (including the US AFL-CIO and Hong  Kong's HK Alliance in Support of Democratic Movement in China)  there is fear that in his own mind, his social role and  orientation is as a "leader of a workers' movement." But what is  the workers' movement? For China what was yesterday's, what is  today's and what will be tomorrow's worker's movement? How will  this movement be led? And after this movement, what then? I  think that it is Americans and Hong Kong people who do not  understand these questions, including in this group the hard  working and honest Mr. Szeto Wah; Han Dongfang himself does not  understand very well. The CPC has the most understanding of the  issue, but cannot say anything. This is because it does not want  to allow those hundreds of thousands of industrial workers  inside the country to understand. In fact, it does not matter  much if the industrial workers understanding of these questions  is no better than their confusion regarding them, but this  touches on the theoretical foundation on which the CPC  established the party and established the government. I do not  know if the readers have all had this experience: Among CPC  cadres there is no lack of people who are warm and sincere and  do solid work, but if you touch on ideology, and the theory of  class struggle, then each and every one has a wooden face, and  unshakable determination. Therefore, in talking about this "Han  Dongfang returns to China and runs into obstruction" event, one  must start from the basic theories of the CPC and the Chinese  workers' movement.    Since there have been machines, there have been workers to  run the machines, and there have been workers who understood  themselves that they should be able to make a decent livelihood,  and that after struggling for a certain period for this  livelihood, there will be a worker's movement and for  convenience this movement will organize unions. This  circumstance has continued to the present, and has continued  until at the same time as the Han Dongfang case, the entire Hong  Kong Immigration Bureau asked for sick leave. Over the last  several centuries, people are already quite familiar with this  concept, that in order to describe this below for convenience,  we will for the moment call workers that for their own economic  interests conduct a struggle to form an organization a welfare  [material benefits] union movement.  <H3>  Lenin Changed Welfare Union Movement Into a Political  Activity </H3>   A welfare union movement is not very frightening, and this  can be said to stem from its strong industrial character (it  also does not have an all-encompassing social nature) and its  consultative character, and its social destructive power is  limited. After the goal of material benefit has been attained,  the movement also ends, and the society as before relies on its  own rules and regulations. This is also why countries that only  have welfare movements, though at times there are some who are  discontent and disturbances occur, the society as a whole is  consistently comparatively stable, and labor unions can jointly  exist with capitalist industrial production, as they have up to  this day.    What is unfortunate is that in the 19th century, we have the  emergence in Europe of the philosopher and economist Karl Marx,  who expounded the labor theory of value. This was an achievement  puffed up with the conceit of academic circles (compared with  Marx's academic activity, his revolutionary practice appears  quite minor); later, Lenin, a social activist who fully accepted  the tradition of the purity of the people, in a critique of the  value of this theory, added emotion (injustice), and the next  step then was to extend the theory to the political realm  (ending this injustice), and the result was trouble arising in a  Russia that was outside the bounds within which this theory was  expounded. Again later on, after this theory, including the  carrying out of practice based on this theory through "the sound  of gunfire," had arrived in China, the CPC regarded it as a  divine instruction, and as "advanced," and even definitively  stated that the burning-with-impatience intellectuals should  start to look down on any other theory outside of this Leninized  principle, and from this abandon their base and take the path of  theory, marching in succession towards the factories and mines,  playing the character of a 20th century Chen Sheng-Wu Guang  Uprising [209 B.C., first large-scale peasant uprising in  China's history] with a guiding principle and an organization.    For old Communist Party members this is very important  indeed, and when we think about the Cultural Revolution period,  and in order for the picture of Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi  entering the Anyuan Coal Mine to have been drawn and create such  a hubbub, we realize that this was no trivial matter. At this  time, the "politically awakened" workers could not be controlled  by a few cadres for a few hours, and many waved some money in  front of their eyes. This was a formula used by scab unions to  draw in corrupt workers. A working class armed with advanced  thinking had to be political, and had to "cast off the shackles  from their bodies, and take on the whole world!"  <H5>  Some Characteristics of the Situation of Workers in China </H5>   Originally, China was an agricultural country, and the  workers' movement had little effect during the struggle to seize  power. But this did not hinder the thoroughly astute Mao Zedong  from using a greatly simplified and Sinicized unified theory to  arouse the peasants, and this allowed him to force other people,  including the oldtimers [laobizu], foreigners, the  representatives of foreigners, and "leaders of the white areas,"  to one by one stand aside, and in the end he prevailed through  absolute superiority--this before ever entering a city.    After entering the cities, the situation for Chinese workers  then really becomes difficult to explain in a few words. To sum  it up, it involved the following points:    1) Workers were put in a very high political position by the  CPC. "Roots red, seedlings straight!," "leadership in  everything!", everybody was familiar with these sayings, and  didn't say them much.    2) Because on the mainland a policy of bringing living  standards to the same level, the people's economic position was  not bad, including that of idlers and fools.    3) Although there are unions, they are hollow, useless  organizations--the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is  subordinate to the CPC Central Liaison Department. Union  grass-roots level organizations also exist as subordinates of  the Trade Union Federation, but they only manage dances and  organize excursions. There is no way for them to clamor for  material benefits: Are you not the owner of the factory? How can  the owner petition himself?    4) In terms of politics, people think but all do not use  their thoughts. You are the leading class, you already have  rights, what further is there to ask about politics? If one does  not think about this or take any interest in it, there are also  opportunities, and the CPC early on gave you a firm definition,  but which political movement in the end was able to dispense  with the stand taken by the working class. In 1957, the turning  point in the Anti-Rightist Struggle from "attracting" to  "attacking" was when "the working class had spoken;" in 1976,  the "attack" was already concrete as the workers arrived on the  scene with government-issued clubs for dealing with the students  and city residents. But this was not only "the broad masses of  the workers"; some were fortunate to be able to serve as leading  cadres, even central leading cadres.  <H5>  The Reasons Why the CPC Will Not Let Han Dongfang Return </H5>   The reasons CPC authorities will not allow Han Dongfang  return should be very clear.    First, what type of movement actually is the workers'  movement led by Han Dongfang? Is it a Western-style unionist  welfare movement or is it a CPC-type political movement? For me,  looking at Han since 1989, including an examination of his  statements and actions prior to his imprisonment and after his  release, what he has done is exactly the same as Wuerkaixi and  Chai Ling, completely deviating from the CPC's mold, by marching  along in the footsteps of the elder generation, in which the  intellectuals were concerned with society, and really becoming  involved with the thoughts and feelings of social reform, going  down amongst the workers, and arousing them, organizing them....  This time, the intellectual's actual educational pedigree, and  occupation, including his consistently vainly hopeful moderate  positions and reasonable dialogue, have already become not  important, and the part he plays is the role more than 70 years  ago of Zhang Guotao and that played by Liu Shaoqi (exactly like  the May Fourth Movement and 9 December Movement hero images  compiled by the CPC and studied by Wuerkaixi and Chai Ling).  This is the first layer.    Second, at that time the CPC was arousing the workers,  arousing the students, and those in power constituted the "KMT  reactionary regime," therefore this was right. Now, however,  with the peoples' regime under the leadership of the CPC, what  you are doing resembles, and again is modelled on the complete  teachings of the CPC, which, in this case, I beg your pardon, is  counterrevolutionary!! The reader I'm afraid still remembers  those days in 1989, those two characters meaning "patriotism,"  and how justly and forcefully the students demanded, how justly  and forcefully Li Peng would not give, making the whole world as  a result feel injured and resentful, and that the truth lay here.    Third, any of those in power know that in arousing the  students, even if those aroused to take the lead cherish the  most utilitarian of political goals, it is also possible to have  nothing extraordinary occur--the South Korean students and the  police have fought day after day, while the nation's power all  the same has continued to increase. Arouse the workers, and they  can cut off water supplies, electricity, cut off transportation,  their power to disrupt society is too great. A movement to gain  material benefits uses just this type of deterrent to achieve  its goals. But economic demands also have a finite end, and the  capitalist side goes to extremes to declare that it will go  bankrupt. Political demands are difficult to deal with, and if  as luck would have had it, they had been in compliance with the  CPC's political demands of that year, would the movement have  been of any size? Among these people, who is there that has an  even clearer stand than the CPC itself? Would the authorities be  able to contain you as you carried political motives in arousing  the workers?    Fourth, I will form a movement for material gain, is this  allowed or not? As a matter of fact, China at present already  has a number of fragmentary movements seeking material benefits,  but these have not been stirred up by people concerned for their  country or their people such as Han Dongfang. Rather, their  standards are low, their scale is small, the extent of their  contacts is narrow, and their goals are simple. Even though they  are this way, the authorities pay close attention to each  occurrence, and in the shortest possible period and within the  smallest possible scope, either control and stop it, or the  problem is resolved and issue dropped. Movements for material  benefits in China are by no means the same as in a country with  private ownership and market economic mechanisms. In China,  capital is the state, and the interests that one demands  conflict with the interests of the government and takes from the  government's pockets, so how can the authorities not be in pain?  This is commonly understood. Arriving at the present time, the  anger of China's hundreds of thousands of workers does not come  from one place alone. Reform, reform, from the halls of  officialdom come petty thieves and hoodlums, all getting rich,  and only the greatly perspiring and hard working "leadership  class" is suffering. Add to the fact that Li Peng has been  floundering about for several years, and large- and medium-sized  enterprises are not doing well. If they do not act in accordance  with Li Peng's approach, to greatly expand imports, then the  fact is that state-owned enterprises will be even more anemic.  Running here, running there, finances worsening, wages not being  paid. At this juncture, engaging in a movement for material  benefits is exactly the type of tool that an out-of-power  politician searches for to cut down those in power, if it is not  subversion, what is it? How can the authorities dare allow Han  Dongfang to return to Beijing?  <H5>  What Role Does Han Dongfang Want To Play? </H5>   In response, your government blocks the way of one Han  Dongfang, has the situation turned into a completely economic  one? Han Dongfang cannot enter the country, China is such a  large place, how is it that there have not emerged a Zhang  Xifang [west], a Wang Nanfang [south] or a Zhao Beifang who  cherish the same ideas, and along with him experienced the same  "growing up accepting the Party's education?" The question is  how in terms of principles and policies, to make Hang Dongfang  and industrial workers understand that revolution is not a good  method for resolving China's problems, and is by no means the  only method. The CPC itself succeeded in revolution, but China's  affairs have not been handled well; today change is arising in  the same way, and those suffering losses will still be the  common people.    It is a pity that the CPC today has sealed off channels  through which criticisms and suggestions could be communicated  to the leadership, and wants to as before through talking big,  "stuffing" the workers, playing a new trick by having a beauty  contest, and singing soft popular tunes, to lull the workers,  and not allow people to discuss principles with clarity. This  being the case, it is forced to taste bitter fruit--including  the various types of inconveniences that go along with Han  Dongfang.    For Han Dongfang, I only hope that he has given a lot of  thought to his place in society. If he only has a happy,  patriotic desire, then he should go and do what he will do; if  he wants to be the leader of a workers' movement for material  benefits, he must first clearly understand the circumstances of  China's industrial workers; if his ultimate goal is to be a  social activist, a politician out of power, and then become a  wielder of power, like China's Wang Zhen or Poland's Lech  Walesa, having just experienced everything, this would also be  one stage in his own revolutionary career, as well as not  requiring too much grief.</p>

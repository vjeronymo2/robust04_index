			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Breath-test driver wins appeal A MOTORIST yesterday made legal history when his conviction for failing to provide a breath specimen was quashed because of a legal loophole. It was thought that more than 100,000 other drivers with similar convictions in England and Wales going back almost 25 years could now apply for them to be overturned. Mr Kofi Gandaa, aged 41, a computer engineer of Camberwell, south-east London, had been found guilty of failing to provide a breath specimen. He had been convicted under Section 7(6) of the 1988 Road Traffic Act by Bow Street magistrates in London. His counsel, Mr Donal McGuire, said section 7(6) of the act was 'bad for duplicity'. It created two offences of failing to provide a specimen and there were different penalties for each.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / International Company News: North Broken Hill posts 30% fall for year INDUSTRIAL problems helped to send North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian mining and forestry group, to a 30 per cent fall in net earnings for the year to June, although the annual dividend is being held at 11 cents a share. The company yesterday announced a fall in net profits to ADollars 84.2m (USDollars 60.1m) from ADollars 119.9m, on a fall in sales to ADollars 1.54bn from ADollars 1.64bn. The directors said about half the fall in earnings was attributable to industrial action at the company's Burnie pulp mill in Tasmania which cost about ADollars 12m before tax and abnormal losses of about ADollars 8.6m. The balance of the fall in earnings reflected a slide to ADollars 161.7m from ADollars 101.9m in the contribution from Energy Resources of Australia, the company's 66 per cent controlled uranium mining operation. The directors said the world recession would continue to affect results. 'Reduced steel production in Japan and Europe is expected to affect demand and prices for iron ore, but this trend will be offset, at least in part, by ongoing cost reduction at Robe River,' they said. 'Recovery in the uranium market is not likely until 1994 or later.' The result was after tax of ADollars 67.8m compared with ADollars 53.9m, while net interest took ADollars 66.9m against ADollars 86.1m.</p>

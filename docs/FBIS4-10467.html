			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 12  April.    The employment situation in Mexico is worsening. In 1993,  unemployment or partial employment adversely affected 23 percent  of the economically active population of 33.7 million. A report  from the Bank of Mexico and other organizations indicates that  in 1993 a total of 7.8 million people were unemployed or had  part-time jobs. Jobs decreased between 1991 and 1993, and  expectations for 1994 are grim. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in  Spanish 5 April 94 pp 1, 24)    The National Banking Commission has reported that 3.1  percent  of total credits granted by the banking system, 13.6 billion new  pesos, cannot be recovered. The figure is 198-percent higher  than that registered in December 1992. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO  in Spanish 5 April 94 p 16)    Mexican foreign debt grew 6.9 percent last year, reaching  $105.7454 billion by the end of 1993. Banks and the private  sector incurred debts with international financial institutions  because they found it less expensive to seek financing in  currencies other than the Mexican peso. International interest  rates were three, four, and five times lower than local rates.  (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 5 April 94 p 3A)    Productive investment in the country will be weak in the  short run because direct foreign investment has dropped to 14.7  percent in 1993, down from 57 percent in 1990. Experts say  foreign investment is stable; they do not expect sudden changes  this year although political events could hinder the growth of  foreign investment. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 6  April 94 p 3A)    Emilio Lozoya Thalman, energy, mines, and parastate industry  secretary, reported on 5 April that during 1993 the production  of copper, zinc, iron, and coal rose to its highest level this  century. Gold and silver production was the highest in four or  five decades, he said. Lozoya said Mexican mining is  consolidating itself as a promoter of regional development.  (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 6 April 94 p 19)    Mexican Petroleum, PEMEX, reports that 1993 was one of the  worst years for the world's petrochemical industry. PEMEX  Petrochemicals suffered revenue losses totalling $230 million.  PEMEX management said the losses were due to falling  international market prices. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 7  April 94 p 20)    The national Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent in  March, as compared to February, for an overall increase of 1.81  percent during the first quarter of the year, the Bank of Mexico  reported. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0410 GMT 8 April 94)    PEMEX reported today that at least 58 oil fields have been  located in the past five years, which is 80-percent higher than  the previous five-year period. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2051 GMT 9  April 94)    Mexico has the second highest foreign debt in Latin America,  second only to Brazil. The country's total foreign debt is  $118.894 billion, according to an Inter-American Development  Bank, IDB, report. The Mexican foreign debt has grown 26  percent since 1989. The IDB report also indicates that the  country's per capita GDP fell 1.2 percent in 1993 as compared to  1992. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 11 April 94 pp 1, 18)    During the first quarter of 1994, the country's workers  received salary increases of under 4 percent as compared to the  same period last year, while wage increases stipulated in  revised collective bargaining agreements only went up by less  than 2 percent according to figures provided by the Metropolitan  Association of Industrial Relations Executives. (Mexico City LA  JORNADA in Spanish 11 April 94 p 22)    PEMEX confirmed today that it granted a contract to the  Spanish company Mecanica de la Pena for the construction of a  plant in Guanajuato for $22 million for gasoline quality control  improvement.

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Coca-Cola lifted by sales growth A 5 per cent increase in shipments helped further strong profits growth for Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks group, in the third quarter. However, changes in the tax regime reduced the impact on the bottom line. Net income would have been 15 per cent ahead at Dollars 623m, but the effects of unusual items  - mainly tax changes  - left the figure 9 per cent ahead at Dollars 590m. Mr Robert Goizueta, chairman and chief executive, said the company was pleased to have achieved the results in the face of weak economic conditions worldwide. Mr Goizueta forecast earnings-per-share growth of 19 per cent to 20 per cent for the full year, excluding non-recurring items. Earnings per share in the latest quarter were up 17 per cent at 48 cents excluding unusual items. After items, they were 10 per cent ahead at 45 cents. In the nine months to date, net income grew 18 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn excluding unusual items and 15 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn including them. Coca-Cola said the 5 per cent increase in North American volume was driven by gains in the sales of core brands and new products, such as PowerAde and Nestea. European sales growth was hindered by weak economic conditions and poor weather. Japanese volumes fell after a wet summer, but these factors were offset by faster growth in other regions.</p>

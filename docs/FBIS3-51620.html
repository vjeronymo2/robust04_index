We are talking straight  today, here on Radio Rebelde, with journalist Renato Recio of  the newspaper TRABAJADORES. The topic: the workers assemblies  that are being held the length and breadth of Cuba. Renato?    [Recio] Well, the assemblies are not yet being held  throughout the country. Forgive me for contradicting you.    [Roque] Yes, but they are indeed being held, in the sense  that the pilot assemblies have been held in all provinces. That  is why I say that these assemblies are already covering almost  the entire country.    [Recio] The process is now beginning; and, especially, what  is called the preparation of the union cadres is beginning in  order to improve the process of holding the meetings that have  come to be called Parliament in the Workplace. So, by chance --  or rather, not by chance; because of my job, of course -- I  attended yesterday the cadre-preparation assembly in Matanzas.  And, well, to a certain extent, I have some fresh ideas, fresh  suggestions regarding this matter, which is a very important one.    [Roque] Comrade Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National  Assembly of the People's Government, participated in that  assembly.    [Recio] As did Pedro Ross, secretary general of the Cuban  Workers Federation. Both were there the whole time, and they  were very interested; and, well, they talked, participated, made  important statements.    In any case Juan Carlos, I am not going to try to report on  that, which is a bit of news that has already been reported this  morning in various media; but, rather, I am going to think a  little, reflect a little, on this matter of the assemblies --  which as you know are on Cuba's financial problem, on the  nation's situation -- which is quite critical from the financial  point of view.    And, initially, I would like to think about this matter that  is being spoken of: how the measures will represent a certain  amount of sacrifice. They are measures that need to be  understood, and they are not measures the majority will find  pleasant. Not at all.    [Roque] Is that why this popular consultation is being held?    [Recio] Of course, because a consensus is being sought. What  is being sought is, let us say, for everyone to aspire to the  same thing, despite the fact that there is a certain measure of  sacrifice involved. However, I want to reflect upon this aspect:  Is it a matter of a real sacrifice or of a sacrifice that is  only apparent?    I say this without having a conclusive answer to this  question -- simply because I think that if through these  measures the peso recovers, and if through these measures  salaries also recover, then the problem is not how many pesos I  lose through any other measure, such as, let us say, prices,  taxes, etc. Rather, the question is how much can I acquire with  the pesos I have, that is, with the salary that I receive. And  then we see that an action can either be a sacrifice or not. It  depends. If we recover the value of the peso, if the buying  power of the salary is recovered, then we will all feel we are  benefiting.    [Roque] However, here what we call the equilibrium between  supply and demand comes into play.    [Recio] Exactly.    [Roque] Such equilibrium does not exist at the present time.    [Recio] Exactly. What we have at present is a big imbalance,  that is, a very low supply and an excessive, solvent --  expressed in money -- demand. And in this connection, since you  are talking to me about this, I find it interesting that now, at  this Parliament in the Workplace, there are two aspects. There  are two well-defined aspects, and the assembly also has to take  into account equilibrium as regards these two aspects.    Look. First of all, there is the fact that being discussed  at  the different work centers is the economic and financial  situation of the work center itself, of that very place itself.  And thus one has to notice how the costs are running; how the  billing and paying among the different enterprises is done;  whether or not there is an excess of personnel; whether  resources are being diverted, whether there is any disorder in  that regard; to what extent the place is being subsidized; to  what extent that subsidy can be decreased; etc. And I want to  tell you, Juan Carlos, that that aspect is of the utmost  importance, even when the other aspect, which I am going to  describe for you next, seems to be more sensational, seems to be  more pleasant.    [Roque] Well, let's pause a moment, and then we will  describe  that other aspect, here on the Straight Talk program.    [Roque] We have with us today journalist Renato Recio of  the newspaper TRABAJADORES, with whom we will be discussing  workers assemblies -- that is, this so-called workers parliament  -- which are to take place throughout Cuba, and which are at the  present time being held, more or less as pilot assemblies, at  several important work centers, within various important sectors  of the economy.    [Recio] I was saying that there are two important points. I  already mentioned the first one. I repeat: The first point is  the economic and financial situation of the very work center in  question; and the second, which I said was perhaps more  sensational. People are tempted to devote more time to this  point. But the other one is very important.    [Roque] Yes, of course.    [Recio] It has to do with discussing and proposing possible  financial measures of a general nature to reduce the budget  deficit and excess liquidity that exists in the streets, in  society. Now, these two points, both of them, have to do with  economic and financial streamlining, because, as you recalled,  there is a problem of imbalance between supply and demand. I  will myself give a brief explanation, if you will so allow.    [Roque] Yes.    [Recio] That enormous excess of circulating currency,  calculated at some 11 billion pesos, has been rising because of  the imbalance between supply and demand. Everyone knows what  supply is. It is the products, the articles, the services that  people consume or enjoy, and which they buy. Now demand is  expressed in the amount of money that people have, with which to  acquire those products and services. What is happening now is  that the supply is extremely limited, while the demand is  gigantic. The ideal thing, and everyone realizes this, would be  to resolve the imbalance by having a larger supply. That is, for  there to be more products, more things to buy, more services to  offer. That, of course, is solved through more work, more  production, with the entire economy functioning properly,  harmoniously.    [Roque] Indisputably. Work creates wealth. And through work,  only through work, through sacrifice, through serious  production, can we get out, to a great extent, of this rut we  are in.    [Recio] However, -- and this must be clear -- the supply  cannot at present be increased, abruptly, or quickly because, in  the first place, Cuba has no external financing.    [Roque] Of course.    [Recio] It is well known that we are in our current crisis  due to external causes.    [Roque] Nor can we recover immediately.    [Recio] No, we cannot do that either, because we lack hard  currency. We have little hard currency, so we can provide little  input to make our factories and service centers produce. In  addition to this, there is this same business of excess monetary  liquidity, a factor that, as everyone knows, does not exactly  contribute to recovery. It is a factor that contributes instead  to labor indiscipline, lack of spirit, and lack of incentive to  work. We therefore must solve this problem of excessive amounts  of circulating currency in order to seriously aspire to economic  recovery for the nation. In that connection, I think the  assemblies are making their opinions strongly known.    [Roque] I believe that these base-level assemblies somewhat  enhance the analysis of concrete aspects. In other words, the  base level is itself seeking to solve problems at the level  where responsibility for production exists. This is an important  aspect of this entire debate, which will be conducted throughout  the country.    [Recio] In addition, we know there is room for efficiency  everywhere. Unfortunately, as everybody knows, our efficiency  dropped not only in the last few years; it was an ongoing  process which gave rise to the rectification process. There was  a process of decline in efficiency. Therefore, since we have and  have had low efficiency, there is room for improvement. The  problem now is to exploit our reserves, bring to them to light  despite the difficult situation.    [Roque] How can we encourage this?    [Recio] The workers know what is happening. An experienced  worker knows what is being done at his work center. He knows  what should and should not be done. If we can again create an  economic awareness among the workers, if we can create a  political and moral awareness among the workers, we can increase  production and reduce expenditures. This would be a great  contribution to the streamlining of our economy.    [Roque] I agree. I also believe that this process of  encouragement, when the worker is being asked to produce more,  must also take something important into consideration: We must  create the minimum conditions in which the workers can produce.  Many times this is not done because someone does not want to.  The special period is blamed for many things that can [5-second  break in reception] workers.    [Recio] Without overlooking that there are many problems  that  are caused by the situation we are experiencing.    [Roque] Problems caused by inefficiency, by negligence.    [Recio] There are other problems that we must attack. These  are problems caused by inefficiency and negligence. These are  problems caused because people do not want to work.    [Roque] These problems affect the situation we are talking  about.    [Recio] We spoke earlier about the meetings being held at  the  work centers. At those meetings they are discussing the problems  that arise as a result of excess currency. If we were to adopt  the overall measures suggested, they would only serve to alter  the consequences; however, the reason for the problem is in the  inefficiency at the work centers.    [Roque] TRABAJADORES reporter Renato Recio is here with us  on  "Straight Talk." We have three minutes left to analyze what we  have talked about on this program.    [Recio] As I have already said, we cannot ignore the  importance of the first point. Each work center must discuss its  own problems. I believe this is more important than discussing  whether prices go up or not, whether this or that product is  taxed, whether we should seize the money the hoarders have.    Now regarding the measures, we must not only listen to the  workers' ideas, but also the suggestions they are making. Many  of these suggestions are very good. For example, a suggestion  made by La Corona Cigar Factory workers is very good. I believe  it is a logical measure and worthy of discussion. The workers  suggested that sick leave be restricted to a specific number of  days a year. You may recall that back in the days of capitalism,  some companies paid for nine days of sick leave a year and  anyone who was sick for more than nine days had no rights  whatsoever.    [Roque] I agree with you that it is a suggestion that should  be studied. However, there are some people who have certain  illnesses for which nine days' sick leave would just not be  enough. If this system were implemented, then the worker would  not be taken care of....    [Recio, interrupts] No.    [Roque] No? Then explain it to me. Explain this to me  because  I am against that measure.    [Recio] The suggestion does not specify nine days. The  suggestion does not specify the number of sick-leave days.  However, if a worker is sick for longer than the authorized  number of sick-leave days, then he will be covered by social  security. If this suggestion was adopted, we would put an end to  the problem of the medical certificates. Anyone can get a  medical certificate. You can get them wholesale. Everyone uses  medical certificates. Everyone has a friend or relative who is a  doctor who can get the certificates. It is really a mess.    [Roque] I have to agree with you on this, but we have to  study this well. We must protect the rights of the worker.    [Recio] I agree. Now that we are at the end of the program,  we can emphatically state that the goal of the labor and social  laws is to help those who need help. In our system if you need  help you will get help. What we must avoid is people using the  paternalistic laws to rob the other workers and the country as  well.    I do believe the suggestion is good. If the worker does not  take any sick leave in a year, he will be paid for those days.  In other words, the worker will be rewarded for not taking sick  leave. Many times workers do not show up for work for reasons  other than illness. They have a headache and they do not go to  work. Take an aspirin and in approximately 30 minutes you will  be rid of the headache. But you know what that is like.    The idea is not to help for the sake of helping. The idea is  to help those who truly need help.    [Roque] I believe that people, people who have always  supported the Revolution, know what they want and are capable of  studying the appropriate measures during the parliaments and in  the workplace.    [Recio] I agree with you.    [Roque] Renato Recio was our guest on this program.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Unions recover Pounds 360m a year damages, TUC says DAMAGES WON by unions for their members amount to about Pounds 360m a year, considerably higher than previous estimates of Pounds 150m to Pounds 200m, according to a Trades Union Congress survey. The findings, which will be presented to the TUC's social, health and environmental protection committee today, underline the growing importance of legal services to unions and their members. Most awards arise from cases involving personal injury. Legal services appear to be cost-effective - the TUC estimates that unions spent a total of Pounds 20m last year on legal action. A survey of 10 unions, representing 2.75m people, produced a figure of Pounds 122m for last year which, a report for today's committee says, represents Pounds 44.35 a member, or more than Pounds 360m a year if it is applied to the whole TUC membership. A recent survey for the Labour Research Department found that unions spent Pounds 11m a year and recovered Pounds 190m. One member in 44 made direct use of his or her union's legal services and average compensation was Pounds 1,174. Labour Research found that the highest rate of return in legal services was achieved by the TGWU general union, which secured Pounds 83.83 for each Pounds 1 spent. The rail union RMT recovered Pounds 61.73 for each Pounds 1 spent. The GPMU print union is credited with the highest compensation per case, at Pounds 5,026.</p>

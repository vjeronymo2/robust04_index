			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Personal View: A picture of a more open BBC Recent turmoil at the BBC stems largely from its attempt to introduce radical management changes with more haste than finesse. But the process of change is being made more difficult by the BBC's confusing constitutional structure. The basic problem is that the board of governors combines regulatory and managerial functions. Moreover, the BBC lacks a well-defined framework of objectives and performance indicators - obligations and aims are specified throughout the Charter, the Licence and Agreement, legislation such as the Broadcasting Act 1981 and even in the BBC's annual review, published on Wednesday. The resultant package is too lacking in precision to offer a peg for accountability to the viewing public. If it is assumed that the BBC is to remain a single, coherent organisation that serves the public interest by offering a broad range of distinctive programmes, what should the structure be when the current Charter expires at the end of 1996? Most important, regulatory and executive functions should be separated. An Office of Broadcasting (Ofbro) should be established, responsible by statute for regulating the BBC's execution of its obligations, for approving its strategy statement and for adjudicating on complaints. There are arguments for and against combining within Ofbro the regulation of other broadcasting channels, such as ITV, Channel 4 and cable and satellite. There may be advantages in having one regulator for the whole industry rather than several regulators, each enjoying a closer relationship with the organisation it regulates. The powers of Ofbro should attach either to a single regulator or to a board appointed by the home secretary. The BBC as an executive body should be headed by a chief executive responsible to a board of executive and non-executive directors. It should be the BBC's function to devise strategies for meeting obligations. The new legal framework should be statutory as is the case in utilities regulation. A Royal Charter may give a breadth of capacity that is not offered by a statute, but this advantage means little to a body such as the BBC which is also subject to a Licence and Agreement. A new Broadcasting Act should set down the duties of Ofbro and the BBC. The home secretary should continue to issue a licence to the BBC, which would be obliged to make a periodic 'statement of strategy' setting out both how it sees its role and how it proposes to implement its objectives. The statute would call on Ofbro to approve the policy statement with amendments where necessary. The agreed strategy statement would then be reflected in a set of performance targets. Fortunately, television audience measurement makes it possible to capture both numbers of viewers and how much they appreciate individual programmes. It would therefore be natural to specify the BBC's targets as a combination of quantity and quality and to link the pay and tenure of the corporation's senior executives to the attainment of the targets. A regime in which the ultimate regulator (Ofbro) lacks accountability to ministers depends on the openness of its procedures if it is to be seen as legitimate. To some extent a separate regulator and a published 'statement of strategy' offer more openness than applies at present, but performance deficiencies may be due to poor execution, poor regulation or both. In a new initiative, therefore, increased public funding should be made available for a viewers' council, which would be empowered to report to the public on the activities of both Ofbro and the BBC. For its part, parliament may see it as appropriate to establish a standing committee on public service broadcasting. What is to be gained from such a revised system? First, an institutional separation that encourages effective control and accountability. Second, more openness in policy formulation and, as a result, greater responsiveness in a rapidly changing environment. Third, increased powers for viewers' representatives. Such arrangements are likely to enhance not merely accountability and the fair treatment of viewers but also the potential of the BBC to be seen to satisfy its mandate.

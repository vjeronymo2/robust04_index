			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Israel and Palestinians End Hostility: Gaza's worst problem is its best hope - How a public works strategy could improve living standards and kickstart the economy BEDOUIN women dressed in flowing black cloth herd their sheep across a disused airstrip, overgrown with weeds, in the economically impoverished and under-developed Gaza Strip. Like much of the infrastructure that will be inherited by a Palestinian authority, the 300m airstrip, with no terminal buildings, has suffered from years of neglect during 26 years of Israeli occupation. Nowhere are the gaping infrastructural needs more apparent than in the rubbish-strewn and densely populated refugee camps of Gaza - home to at least 260,000 of the 780,000 Palestinians crammed into the 365 sq km that make up the Strip. It is in Gaza, far less developed than the West Bank, that the political peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians could be made or broken by economic developments. Failure to meet economic expectations could backfire and fuel Islamic fundamentalist groups which reject the peace accord. In the filthy Jabalya camp, crowds of unemployed Palestinian youths gather in the afternoon on the dusty roadsides to escape the heat and claustrophobia of their tiny corrugated iron and breeze-block shacks. Donkey-drawn carts carrying oil drums of water and crates of vegetables work their way along streets where the stench of open sewage and contaminated water is everywhere. Economists agree that sewage, water and housing are the priorities facing the Palestinian authority and external donors, despite a PLO decision not to dismantle the refugee camps until talks on a final settlement within three years. A programme of public works will be critical to alleviate a male unemployment rate of 62 per cent, provide jobs for a population growing at 4.6 per cent and create the infrastructure needed to encourage wealthy Palestinian, Arab and Israeli businessmen to invest. Mr Alex Pollock, an economist with the United Nations Works and Rehabilitation Agency in Gaza, said nearly all Gaza's infrastructure is 'either missing or in a deplorable state. We are talking about scrapping most things and starting again.' But he believes an aid-backed public works development strategy for a labour force with proven skills acquired in Israel's construction sector could quickly alleviate poverty. 'Gaza's best assets are its slum conditions, its over-population and its international goodwill,' he said. 'Its worst problem is its best hope - because a well-funded public works programme could immediately provide jobs, alleviate suffering and defeat political opposition.' A draft World Bank report says external official financing of Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 1.75bn will be needed to fund the public sector in both Gaza and the West Bank for a five-year transition period, creating 12,000 jobs. The report says public sector financing needs in the short and medium term will centre on water and waste-water, transport, power and solid wastes. 'The upgrading of physical and social infrastructure, a key priority for improving living standards of the population and for stimulating private sector development, would have to be undertaken mostly by the public sector,' the World Bank says. Many of Gaza's pot-holed roads require urgent attention. In many parts of the strip, especially around the villages, most roads are not even metalled. The airport will have to be upgraded to carry at least light passenger traffic between Gaza and the West Bank and add some freight facilities. But economists warn against grandiose multi-million dollar projects - likely to be urged on an incoming Palestinian authority for political and nationalistic reasons - such as a deep sea port, an international airport and a water desalination plant. Housing will also be a priority, with Palestinians estimating that at least 120,000 new units must be built in the territories within a decade. So far Palestinian and international economists are agreed that housing should be left to the private sector, with the government assisting with a revolving, low-cost loan scheme. Much of the transitional economic phase will depend on success in job-creation. Israel estimates the Gaza work force at 125,000, but Palestinians say the figure is closer to 200,000. At least 10,000 new entrants join the Gazan work force every year. Economists say that the public works programme will not soak up the high unemployment. Continued migrant labour to Israel, under a properly negotiated Israeli-Palestinian framework, will be vital to the Gazan economy. It has plummeted from 80,000 in 1987 (45 per cent of the work force) to 20,000 today largely as a result of restrictions imposed by Israel. Ultimately, private sector development will have to be the main job-creator. Gaza's industrial base, however, is limited. The biggest industrial firms are the 7-Up bottling plant, a citrus packaging factory and a textile plant which get sub-contracting work from Israel. There are other small firms in plastics, woodwork and food processing but no company employs more than 70 workers and no company has an annual turnover in excess of Dollars 1m. Most of Gaza industries are family-owned or small informal sector businesses with a maximum investment capital of Dollars 250,000. A huge gap in management and executive skills for medium- and large-scale companies will have to be filled in Gaza by the Palestinian expatriates who have worked mostly in Gulf Arab states and who the World Bank hope will provide an extra Dollars 200-Dollars 250m of private capital into the territories over the next five years. Another constraint will be the high price of land in the strip. In Gaza city, which has only four buildings as high as 10 storeys, a dunum (1000 sq m) sells today for Shk1.6m (Pounds 370,000). Apartments of 60sq m sell for Dollars 55,000. Its not all bad news. A Palestinian self-government will inherit a decent education and health system with good teachers and medical staff  - in large part due to the efforts of UNWRA, which devotes a substantial part of its Dollars 84m annual budget for Gaza on the two services. Primary and secondary education and health will, however, have to be expanded. University education will benefit from integration into the universities of the West Bank. Also on the positive side of the economic equation is the bureaucracy in Gaza. In all, 12,000 Palestinians work in the Gaza departments of the Civil Administration and UNWRA, many with years of experience. Therefore, a Palestinian authority could, initially, move into the buildings of the Civil Administration in Gaza City and take over a slim and efficient administration.</p>

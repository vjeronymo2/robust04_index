			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ALASKA;  </P> <P> FEDERAL PROSECUTION OF EXXON IS URGED  </P> <P> Alaska has asked the Justice Department to prosecute Exxon Corp. for federal  crimes and to seek full damage payments, in addition to fines, without letting  the company plea bargain to avoid culpability in the Alaska oil spill,  according to court documents. In testimony before a state Superior Court  pretrial hearing in Anchorage for fired Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood,  Larry Weeks, Alaska's chief prosecutor, said that the state wants a federal  court order requiring Exxon to pay full restitution for the worst spill in U.S.  history. Weeks said that Exxon should be held accountable legally and  financially for the spill of 11 million gallons of crude oil.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUZZER-BEATER STRIKES AGAIN;  </P> <P> TITANS: WAYNE WILLIAMS, WHO'S MAKING A HABIT OF IT, HITS A 32-FOOTER AS TIME  EXPIRES TO BEAT PACIFIC, 76-73.  </P> <P> The ball, Wayne Williams said, ended up in the right person's hands.  </P> <P> They were his own.  </P> <P> Dell Demps of the University of the Pacific knew as much as soon as Cedric  Ceballos tapped the ball away from him and into Williams' grasp in the final  seconds of Cal State Fullerton's game against the Tigers Saturday.  </P> <P> "I knew he'd made some shots like that before," Demps said. And as Demps  watched and dreaded, the sophomore -- whose teammates call him Buzzer-Beater --  did it again, launching a 32-foot shot that rattled in as time ran out, giving  Fullerton a 76-73 Big West Conference victory in front of 2,113.  </P> <P> It wasn't much different from the basket that Williams made to beat Nevada Las  Vegas at the overtime buzzer last season, only about seven feet farther out and  at the other end in Titan Gym. And it set off a pandemonium the likes of which  hadn't been seen in Titan Gym since the victory over UNLV.  </P> <P> "It wasn't one of my better ones," Williams said, "but I'll take it."  </P> <P> It wasn't much different from four other buzzer-beating three-pointers that  Williams has made in a career that is only 41 games old.  </P> <P> As a freshman last season, he hit halftime buzzer-beaters that helped spark the  Titans past UC Santa Barbara and UC Irvine, plus, of course, the Rebel-beater  at the overtime buzzer.  </P> <P> This season, he hit a halftime buzzer-beater in a victory against Fresno State  Thursday. Last week, he missed one against Utah State as the overtime clock ran  out.  </P> <P> And Saturday, he made one that kept Fullerton out of overtime and spared the  Titans the possibility of becoming the first conference team to lose to Pacific  at home since January 1987.  </P> <P> "We had this game penciled in as a win," Williams said. "It would have been a  big disappointment to lose it."  </P> <P> Fullerton (8-5 overall, 2-2 in conference) had led this game by 14 points, but  almost let it get away. Pacific took a 72-71 lead with 1:18 remaining on two  free throws by Demps, who led Pacific with 22 points. Anthony Woods, fouled by  Williams, made the first of a one-and-one with 25 seconds left, but missed the  second -- one of only two missed free throws by Pacific in the game -- leaving  the Tigers with a two-point lead.  </P> <P> On the other end, Fullerton tied it on a pressure-packed turnaround jumper with  11 seconds left by Agee Ward, whose inside touch gave Fullerton 14 points,  including eight in a row during the final minutes.  </P> <P> "We practiced that all week. I had a lot of confidence," Ward said.  </P> <P> With the score tied, Pacific took a timeout, and Fullerton planned to pressure.  </P> <P> "We weren't going to let them bring it up easy," Fullerton Coach John Sneed  said.  </P> <P> The Tigers inbounded the ball at the far end of the court with Fullerton  pressing. As Demps crossed halfcourt, Ceballos and Williams converged on him,  and Ceballos tipped the ball loose with about three seconds left.  </P> <P> "I was careless with the ball and he stripped me," Demps said. "I was too  concerned about getting a shot off."  </P> <P> Williams saw the loose ball, snatched it up, turned back toward the basket and  after a few dribbles launched the shot from an angle on the right side.  </P> <P> Just your basic high-percentage shot for Williams, who has a bit of trouble  with layups on occasion and is shooting only 31% from the field. But this kind  of shot is his thing.  </P> <P> "The ball happened to go to Wayne Williams," Sneed said. "Vintage Titan, what  can I tell you."  </P> <P> It was a tough way to lose for Pacific (9-6, 2-4), a much-improved team over  last season's 7-21 club. The Tigers, behind Demps and Reggie Ricks, whose 20  points included six three-pointers, had a chance at an upset against a  Fullerton team that had its best shooting performance in four years, making  61.5% of its shots.  </P> <P> Instead, the Tigers were beaten by a buzzer-beater.  </P> <P> "That's something you don't expect," Coach Bob Thomason said. "It's a shock. It  was a lucky shot, but sometimes you win games on lucky shots."  </P> <P> Williams says he doesn't practice the shot much, but admitted he tried it  earlier in the day Saturday.  </P> <P> "Just to see if it would go in," Williams said. "It was way short."  </P> <P> With the game on the line, it was right on the mark. It was Williams' third  three-pointer in three attempts Saturday, giving him 11 points.  </P> <P> "I don't think it would work if it was set up," he said. "It was just something  that needed to be done."  </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> Reserve forward Ron Caldwell has been suspended from the team indefinitely and  will not travel to San Jose State, Cal State Long Beach or New Mexico State,  Coach John Sneed said. "I just decided it was the best thing for the team right  now," Sneed said. Caldwell and Sneed have had a strained relationship for some  time, and Sneed suspended Caldwell for one game this season after Caldwell  didn't follow instructions in practice. Caldwell is averaging 3.2 points a  game. . . . Cedric Ceballos and Mark Hill led Fullerton with 19 points each  against Pacific and remain tied for the team scoring lead with 21.5-point  averages. . . . Cal State Disneyland Dept.: Mickey has Minnie, and now  Fullerton mascot Tuffy Titan has a significant other too. A feminine Tuffy, as  yet unnamed, made her debut during Saturday's game.  </P></p>

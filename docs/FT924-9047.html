			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index holds on to 2,700 mark THE UK stock market held on to most of the high ground recaptured this week despite some profit-taking yesterday. Trading volume remained high and the second line stocks outperformed the FT-SE 100 list as the institutions widened their investment range in the stock market. The plans by the US government to impose punitive tariffs on some European farm exports unsettled distillery issues which could be affected if the US action is extended to other areas. But the broad range of the London stock market was focusing on the British government's Autumn Statement, due next Thursday, when the City of London hopes to see the first steps in the official 'strategy for growth.' Some traders suggested that the eagerly-awaited cut in base rates might also come next week. Early gains, which put 4 points on the Footsie, melted away as profit-takers appeared and the market spent the rest of the session in negative territory. However, dealers stressed that selling pressure, largely concentrated on the Footsie list, was never of any great significance. At least four trading programmes were identified, and there were hints that a raid on the shares of Lonrho, the international trader, was planned. A loss of 10 points was stemmed when the market rallied at the Footsie 2,701 level and, despite a slow start to the new session on Wall Street, London closed comfortably above the day's low. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,702.7 for a net loss on the day of 8.4 points. Over a somewhat erratic first leg of the two week account, the equity market has gained 44.4 Footsie points, or about 1.7 per cent. Seaq volume was again strong yesterday at 652.8m shares, only just below the 701.8m of the previous session. Retail, or customer, business in equities jumped nearly 25 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn on Thursday. London is waiting for a more definite response from Wall Street to the outcome of the US presidential election. But confidence that the UK economy will be stimulated has reappeared. Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research said yesterday that what lies ahead in the UK stock market is 'too good to miss.' Gilts remained firm, making little response to the issue of a Pounds 1bn tranche of Treasury 2009 stock. Index-linked issues shaded lower. Equity volume slipped lower ahead of the Maastricht vote in the UK and the pressidential election in the US but is now moving higher again.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Repossessions of homes climb 72% to record: Slackening in recruitment sustains unemployment - Fewer mortgage defaulters likely to be evicted THE number of homes repossessed by mortgage lenders because their owners could not keep up with monthly payments reached 75,540 last year. The total, by far the highest recorded, was 72 per cent up on 1990. It was slightly below forecasts of 80,000, however, and the rate of increase in repossessions slowed in the second half of last year. The Council for Mortgage Lenders indicated yesterday that the worst might be over. Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the council, said it was impossible to predict how many people would lose their homes this year. He added , however: 'We expect a declining trend during the course of the year.' The council believes the decline in eviction rates reflects the fall in mortgage interest rates and an increase in the provision of advice from lenders. In spite of the slowing in the rate of repossessions the number of borrowers more than six months in arrears was 275,350 at the end of the year. There were 91,740 borrowers more than 12 months in arrears, compared with 59,690 half way through 1991. There were also 183,610 borrowers between six and 12 months in arrears, up from 162,210 in the middle of the year. These borrowers are all at risk of having their homes repossessed, suggesting that repossessions will remain at very high levels this year and next. Woolwich Building Society, one of the largest mortgage lenders, said yesterday, however, that the number of its customers less than six months in arrears was now the lowest for four years. Its more serious arrears cases had also stabilised. The council expects about 40,000 homes to be saved as a result of a package of measures agreed between lenders and the government just before Christmas. These measures include the direct payment to lenders of social security payments for mortgage interest and the provision of Pounds 1bn for mortgage rescue schemes by lenders. Leeds Permanent, the sixth-largest building society, yesterday became the latest lender to launch a rescue package. It will spend Pounds 100m on a scheme under which the society will take a share in the value of a house and provide the borrower with a reduced mortgage payment. The interest rate for such borrowers will be capped at 9.9 per cent for five years. Mr Mike Blackburn, Leeds Permanent chief executive, warned that there could be no quick cure for the repossessions problem. 'A full recovery will take at least two years to achieve and will depend on factors beyond our control,' he said. He added that the decline in the number of new arrears cases was by far the most important development. National Westminster Bank, the only high-street clearing bank to put up funds for a mortgage rescue scheme, launched a Pounds 30m mortgage rescue scheme yesterday. The number of repossessed homes for sale will continue to depress the housing market for some months. At the end of last year lenders still had 67,370 repossessed homes on their books after selling more than 47,000 properties in the year.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Electricity workers switch off Ireland THE Irish government says there is a 'tremendous urgency' to settle a strike by electricity workers which has caused power cuts throughout the country. Much of Ireland was without electricity yesterday, writes Kieran Cooke in Dublin. Hospitals had to use generators, factories closed and many motorists were stranded, with petrol stations unable to pump fuel. More than 1,000 electricians at the state-run power company are striking for more pay and in protest about a company reorganisation.</p>

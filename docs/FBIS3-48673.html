			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vientiane, January 27 (KPL) -- The  Savannakhet-Mukdahan border checkpoint on January 25 was  declared the third international border checkpoint with the  agreement of both Lao and Thai authorities. The declaration is  to facilitate the visit of the Lao and Thai people as well as  foreign visitors to a third country. The upgrading of this  border checkpoint is hoped to facilitate tourism and trade  through Laos between Thailand and Vietnam.    Since 1990, there are 80,000-100,000 in-coming and out-going  passengers each year through the Savannkhet-Mukdahan border  checkpoint.    On January 5, Savannakhet and Quang Tri Province opened  their  border checkpoint.    Until now, Laos has opened three such checkpoints with  Thailand: Tha Deua-Nong Khai in Vientiane Prefecture and Nong  Khai Province of Thailand, Houai Sai-Chiang Khong between the  northern Laotian Province of Bokeo and Chiang Rai Province in  northern Thailand, and Savannakhet-Mukdahan international border  checkpoint.    Savannakhet is a province in the central part of the country  and Mukdahan is a northeastern province of Thailand.</p>

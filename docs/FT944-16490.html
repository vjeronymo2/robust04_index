			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Prospect of housing benefit cut recedes Mr Peter Lilley is playing down speculation that his department will introduce big cuts in housing benefit this year. The social security secretary has told colleagues that his officials at the Department of Social Security can make only 'cosmetic' changes to the housing benefit programme, because they are occupied with too many cost-cutting projects in next year's legislative timetable. Treasury officials have put intense pressure on the DSS in recent months to reduce its Pounds 9bn annual expenditure on housing benefit, arguing that the programme is growing much faster than the nation's ability to pay for it. Earlier this year Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, said he wanted to target housing benefit costs in this year's Budget, arguing that 'quite a lot' of recipients were 'living in houses that are too big for them'. He said: 'There are areas such as the exponential growth in housing benefit where you have to look very carefully to make sure taxpayers' money is not being wasted.' However - as this year's public spending round draws to a close - officials at the DSS have privately remarked that Mr Aitken was not properly briefed when he made these remarks, and that the DSS cannot carry out a sweeping reform of the programme this year. They argue that large-scale changes to the programme would require primary legislation and that the DSS is already committed to pushing through two substantial bills next year on the reform of occupational pensions and the Jobseeker's Allowance. Mr Lilley confirmed yesterday that he would introduce a 'Back To Work' bonus next year, making it worthwhile for unemployed people to take part-time work as a prelude to starting a full-time job. Under the proposals, which will benefit 150,000 people, those who lose benefit when they start a part-time job will build up a DSS 'credit'. This can be converted into a bonus of up to Pounds 1,000 when they undertake a full-time job. Mr Lilley told journalists that the government would shortly be introducing a white paper on the Jobseeker's Allowance, outlining details of a new agreement. This may tighten up the rules under which benefit recipients are obliged to look for a job.</p>

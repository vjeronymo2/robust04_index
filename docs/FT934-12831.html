			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Management (Tips from the top): The four principles of corporate giving - Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, executive chairman of Kingfisher, offers advice on selecting good causes There are more than 170,000 registered charities in the UK and many of them, in marketing terms, have advanced some way beyond the box-rattling stage. Alongside this growing sophistication of demand is our corporate need to make donations work positively for us. So we have had to think clearly about what we are doing in this department and why. In many companies charitable involvement is moving out of the chairman's office - where it took the shape of the traditional chairman's fund - and into the marketing and human resources departments. Certainly, the causes backed by Kingfisher have a wider scope and sharper focus than they did 10 years ago. We have moved from the idea of 'charitable donations', through 'community investment' to 'corporate social responsibility', which embraces issues such as employment practices and the environment. Underpinning our policy is the belief that a healthy business needs a healthy community. Policy is directed by a social responsibility committee, which includes our corporate affairs and human resources directors, as well as one of our non-executive directors, Lady Howe. It meets quarterly and each of our businesses reports to it twice a year. As a group, Kingfisher spent around Pounds 1.3m on social responsibility programmes in 1992. One of the things our strategy has to do is take account of the individual needs of our relatively devolved business units, while maintaining an overall corporate shape and consistency. We have four guiding principles. The first and firmest is that any issue we support must be relevant to our mainstream commercial objectives. It may be by addressing social problems which ultimately affect our profitability, for example, or by improving our corporate reputation. We support crime prevention because this ties in with the high street environment. The safer people feel, the more likely they are to come out and shop. The second principle is that we are very clear about the target audiences we are trying to reach. While our businesses will focus cause-related marketing on their customers, our audiences at the centre include opinion formers, shareholders, employees and national and local government. We support women's issues, because two-thirds of our employees are women. We are also active on critical health issues and education, because these too affect our employees. Principle number three is to limit ourselves to a manageable number of issues instead of trying to cover the field. Finally we try to build up a leadership position, to give us a competitive edge with particular target audiences. This may be by anticipating issues that will become important, or by not shrinking from those that may prove controversial. We are helping, for example, to fund a Stonewall study on attitudes of and towards gay men and lesbians in the workplace. It is important to recognise that the objectives of a voluntary organisation are different to those of a commercial one. The essence of successful projects is to identify the mutual benefit for each of those involved and then for them to work in partnership. Once we have identified a particular cause - such as homelessness or equal opportunities - choice of project becomes the next key step. This is as important as the choice of charity, which must be well-run and have an acceptable brand. We will ask ourselves how material the project is to our business objectives. How innovative is it? What value can we add? How much support do they want, relative to what we can afford? We will look at the quality of the organisation's management and operating plan and at how they will evaluate and report back. We may also seek the attitudes of the relevant government department. Pressure from public figures and other business people to support pet projects can be considerable. Where the project has no relevance to our commercial objectives, policy dictates we should decline, but some occasionally sneak through.

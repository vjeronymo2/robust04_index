			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Clarke lobbies for Brittan Sir Leon Brittan deserved the backing of France as well as the UK for the European Commission presidency for the skill with which he had reconciled the two governments' opposing stances in the Gatt trade negotiations, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer said in Paris yesterday, writes David Buchan from Paris. Mr Clarke also used a two-day visit to Paris to lobby for another UK candidate, Lord Lawson, as head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

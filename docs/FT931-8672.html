			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / BT and Oftel in price agreement BUSINESSES which make extensive use of private telecommunications networks will be able to predict their costs with greater confidence following an agreement between British Telecommunications and the industry regulator Oftel. The organisations have agreed to a formula controlling the prices BT will charge for private circuits for the period 1993 to 1997. It sets a cap on the rate of inflation on three families or 'baskets' of private circuits - national analogue circuits, national digital circuits and international circuits.</p>

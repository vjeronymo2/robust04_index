			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: Intelligent attention - Radio THIS YEAR'S Reith Lectures are given by Professor Edward Said, born in Israel, now Professor at Columbia University. His subject is 'Intellectuals and their role', and if many intelligent people argue that they have no role, this should at least ensure plenty of intelligent attention. The first lecture (Radio 4, Wednesday, repeated Radio 3, Friday) was called Representations of the Intellectual, but it went beyond that; he even used the phrase 'the Intellectual vocation'. His chosen representations were fictional - Bazarov in Turgenev's Fathers and Sons, Stephen Dedalus in Joyce's Portrait of the Artist and Moreau in Flaubert's L'Education sentimentale; pretty different characters, but all determined not to be involved in matters where decisions had been made by others. There must be some good intellectual points to be made in the five lectures to come. Radio 4's Monday Play was David Edgar's The Shape of the Table, repeated from the World Service. A dissident writer, Pavel Prus, opens with an account of his descent from writing fairy-tales to imprisonment, but he is soon involved in the political discussions of the new order, an unviolent revolution having taken place. The old guard are out, and a newly reactionary party is busy sorting out the best jobs. This kind of state scheming is the very thing Edgar likes; there is something intellectual, indeed, about his concern. I was not totally entranced by the talk, which dealt with imaginary party-lines one was not familiar with; but there were telling exchanges - 'You made your deal', 'We had our conversation'. The political climate becomes more and more bourgeois, and I need hardly say that Prus ends up as President. He was played by Karl Johnson, and the direction was by Hilary Norrish. Wednesday on Radio 4 is baby night, and unexpectedly horrifying. This week, Baby Farming; last week, midwives; the week before, Rescuing the Inner Child, about the after-effects of child-abuse. Wednesday's piece, presented by Stanley Williamson, was documentary, and the horrors it recalled are unlikely to be equalled today. Between 1866 and 1869, of 298 inquests the Central Middlesex coroner sat on, 174 were of murdered babies - not mainly of poor families but of middle and upper classes too. Awkward children went to 'minders' for a shilling or so a week. A public-spirited doctor, Alfred Wiltshire, made enquiries; one minder was found by the police with five babies a few weeks old and five aged between 14 months and 2 1/2 years; she was subsequently hanged. Not until 1872 was any government action taken. The Inner Child programme, presented by Jane Grayshon, was about the after-effects of child abuse. Childish reactions are retained in adults and can cause social trouble. The cure advised by counsellors is to treat this 'inner child' from an adult point of view, perhaps even write letters. Some of the experiences recalled were unpleasant, but at least there is official retribution available nowadays. There are many silhouettes of the star players of old times on Radio 2, and if I do not refer to them here it is because they don't tell me anything new. We had Grace Moore on Tuesday - a song from the New Moon film, recordings from the Met in New York (where she failed her first audition), the Music Box Revue. We heard her singing, but not talking; the truth is we learnt nothing. These 'spotlights' are fun to hear, but they only amount to illustrated editions of Who's Who.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. For transactions involving the distribution of multiclass securities in a public offering, the Sponsors are responsible for assuring that distribution will be by licensed broker-dealers in good standing under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GNMA requires entities wishing to participate in this program as Sponsors to provide GNMA with certain information and meet certain requirements. Currently, a Sponsor must have minimum capital assets of $250 million in shareholders' equity, evidenced by the Sponsor's most recent audited financial statements. GNMA also requires that Sponsors have had at least one REMIC transaction with the Federal National Mortgage Association (``FNMA'') or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (``FHLMC''). If an entity that wishes to sponsor GNMA guaranteed transactions has not had this experience, GNMA requires an alternative demonstration of experience, as GNMA determines appropriate. A computer bulletin board, gREX, will be used to announce revisions to this policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Entities that would like to obtain application forms or obtain further information should contact Chemical New York, Inc., 1325 G St., N.W., Suite 640, Washington, D.C. 20005.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Selection of Trustee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA has determined that the safety, integrity and efficiency of the multiclass securities program will be best served if a limited number of institutions act as trustee. In making this determination, GNMA was particularly mindful of the long-term obligations associated with acting as trustee for multiclass securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To secure trustee services, GNMA has requested applications from qualified institutional trustees under a CAP. In the meantime, the trustees approved for the initial stage will continue to serve as trustees for multiclass securities transactions. Trustee services must include tax administration as well as customary securities administrative and payment functions. Trustees approved pursuant to the CAP will be authorized to serve with respect to securities issued during the period (not more than five years) specified in the request for applications. Once a trustee is assigned to a specific transaction, it will continue to act as trustee for the life of the security, unless removed in accordance with the Trust Agreement. Sponsors will use trustees approved pursuant to the CAP. Trustees will be paid from funds related to the transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Trust Counsel and Accounting Firms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Trust counsel selected by the Sponsor will provide customary securities and tax opinions on the transactions, in accordance with GNMA's requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accounting firms selected by the Sponsor will perform customary procedures with respect to financial information included in the offering documents and as part of the closing process, in accordance with GNMA's requirements. GNMA currently requires entities wishing to participate in GNMA guaranteed transactions to submit certain information to GNMA. Interested parties may obtain the appropriate forms from Chemical New York, Inc. (``Chemical Bank'') at the address set out in section II.B. above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. The Guaranty Fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA will (1) make such multiclass guaranty fee adjustments as it determines, in GNMA's sole discretion, to be appropriate to fulfill the objectives of the program, and (2) establish and adjust from time to time such guaranty fees as it determines to be appropriate for other types of multiclass securities transactions in accordance with the objectives of the program. Guaranty fees and changes in guaranty fees will be announced on gREX (described below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F.

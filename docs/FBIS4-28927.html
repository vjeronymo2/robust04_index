			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Despicable Political Tool of Specified Forces" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  says the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) must no more  be a despicable political tool of specified forces.    The paper notes:    The IAEA decided not to call in question Japan's concealment  of plutonium. This is an unjustifiable act to evade its  responsibility for having failed to properly discharge its  mission.    It is maximizing the DPRK's "nuclear issue" with a  groundless  "suspicion", while leaving alone the criminal caught red-handed  who intentionally and wantonly violated the nuclear  non-proliferation system. This is the height of partiality and  the double standard.    The partiality of the IAEA is found, above all, in its  notion  of the nuclear danger.    Japan's concealment of a large amount of plutonium is  directly linked with its nuclear armament. Japan hopes to  become a nuclear power with thousands of, tens of thousands of  nuclear weapons. For the IAEA not to call in question the  concealment of plutonium is to connive at and foster Japan's  wild ambition to become a nuclear power.    Japan's nuclear armament is a new big threat to peace in  Asia  and the rest of the world. Compared with it, the fledgling  peaceful nuclear activities of the DPRK which extracts a tiny  amount of plutonium for an experimental purpose do not pose a  threat to anyone. It is unreasonable for the agency to maximize  the matter of the minimum of amount of reported plutonium of the  DPRK.    The prejudice and partiality of the agency only impair its  authority and dignity.    The partiality of the IAEA is manifested also in judging the  possibility of divergence of nuclear material. The 70 kg of  plutonium of the Tokaimura nuclear fuel-making plant of Japan  was reportedly discovered at three of the 17 glove boxes of the  plant.    The world considers that the amount of plutonium exposed in  Japan this time where many nuclear facilities have been in  operation for scores of years is a very small part of the total  amount concealed all over Japan.    The IAEA which should solve Japan's diversion of plutonium  which stands out with great urgency in actuality is bringing  forward the non-existent diversion of nuclear material by the  DPRK, making the situation complicated, while covering up the  immediate question.    The effectiveness of the DPRK-proposed method of preserving  the technical possibility for the later measurement of fuel rods  has been proved theoretically and experimentally and recognized  by world's experts. Nevertheless, the IAEA is deliberately  distorting the stark objective reality and blocking a smooth  solution of the DPRK's "nuclear issue" under an unjustifiable  pretext. This is a very irresponsible act.    Facts show that the IAEA Secretariat does not seek  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons but has pursued the  sinister political aim of stifling the DPRK from the beginning  according to a prearranged scenario under the manipulation of  specified forces.    If the agency continues to pursue a vicious political aim,  expanding partiality, the non-nuclear states, the third world  countries, will no more trust it.</p>

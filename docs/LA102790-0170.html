			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECTS FOUND 2 YEARS AFTER COSTA MESA SLAYING  </P> <P> A man and a woman who eluded Costa Mesa police for nearly two years were  arrested early Friday in Riverside in connection with the shooting death of the  woman's husband, authorities said.  </P> <P> Roberto Tovar Ramirez, 40, and Graciela Delacruz, 42, both formerly of Santa  Ana and now living in Perris, were arrested at 2 a.m. after police staked out a  Greyhound bus terminal in Riverside and found them on a bus bound for the East  Coast, said Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Ron Smith.  </P> <P> Ramirez was being held in the Costa Mesa Jail on suspicion of murder, and  Delacruz was being held in Orange County Jail on charges of aiding and abetting  a suspected felon, Smith said. Each is being held in lieu of $250,000. They are  to be arraigned Tuesday in Harbor Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Smith said the couple fled after the Dec. 26, 1988, shooting death of  Delacruz's husband, Jeremias Diaz Delacruz, 41, of Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The husband, who was driving a vanload of friends through Costa Mesa, had  spotted his wife in Ramirez's car. He followed Ramirez to a cul-de-sac, and  when the men got out of their vehicles, Ramirez allegedly fired two fatal shots  at Jeremias Delacruz and shot twice more at the passengers in the van. No one  else was injured.  </P> <P> Based on a tip on the suspects' whereabouts Thursday, police first went to  their home in Perris, only to find that they had been warned and had left a few  hours earlier, said Smith, who heads the department's homicide investigation  unit.  </P> <P> Smith said the couple apparently traveled from Perris to Los Angeles and then  boarded a cross-country bus.  </P> <P> Police staked out local bus stations and arrested the couple without incident  when they arrived at the Greyhound depot in downtown Riverside about 2 a.m.  Friday.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Galina Kolesova; first paragraph is large-type </F> boldface SMENA introduction]    [Text] Seventy-five Russian territories are already  lodging serious complaints to the government in connection with  the collapse of a most important social service -- the Russian  Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological  Oversight [Gossanepidnadzor] system.    As of today, the Russian government's debt to all federal  services amounts to 40 billion rubles, 16 of which is to the  Gossanepidnadzor. A selective conference of representatives of  the public health services of 75 regions throughout Russia  convened yesterday morning to discuss one matter: development of  a set of demands to the government.    These demands, the ``13 Points,'' were developed and  approved  by the participants at the Petersburg Conference of Workers at  Gossanepidnadzor Institutions back on 28 July. But because our  city health service is in the same situation as all other such  services in Russia, the essence of the regions' demands has not  changed. The main demands are as follows: Provide the total  financing for the sector's institutions that was allocated from  the federal budget, including wages to its workers, and classify  medical education and scientific institutions as socially  significant services...    And only one item caused disagreement: the need to  temporarily shift the service to financing from the local  budget. There have already been similar precedents in Russia.  And what initially seemed like a rescue turned out to be fraught  with new problems because, as is a well-known fact, he who pays  calls the shots. In Yakutiya, for example, the local authorities  financing this service sharply cut the size of the service  itself. In other regions, authorities actively opposed the  closure of ``ecologically dirty'' enterprises...    In any case, there are grave doubts on the matter in  Petersburg and no hurry to ``go begging to Sobchak.'' It is  precisely for this reason that the collective of the city  agreement committee especially insisted on government guarantees  regarding repayment times in the event that short-term  interest-free loans from ``local funds'' are granted to the  service.    And our city service is trying to resolve yet another  important matter. It is trying to obtain permission to use 50  percent of all fine sanctions at its own discretion. The Malyy  soviet already denied this request in the spring. The agreement  committee members were convinced that the the amount -- 50  percent -- frightened the deputies, whereas they believe that  the city cannot receive even this sum because there is nothing  more frightening than a ``corrupt sanitary inspector.'' And, as  they emphasize, it is only one step from poverty to corruption.    The chairman from Krasnodar, speaking at the selective  conference, said ``A blow to the public health service is a last  blow to the people.'' Perhaps it was right after this phrase  that premier Chernomyrdin yesterday morning gave Finance  Ministry Director Fedorov permission to grant emergency  appropriations to repay the service's debt. Fedorov, they say,  handed the directive down -- to the local authorities.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [SALZBURGER NACHRICHTEN report: "Positive EU Atmosphere </F> Increases"]    [Text] Linz -- Since the conclusion of the negotiations  for membership, the number of supporters of the European Union  [EU] has been increasing, although the Austrians are not very  satisfied with the result of the negotiations. This was shown  by a poll of the Linz opinion research institute, Spectra, which  was published on Thursday [14 April]. According to Spectra, the  share of EU supporters increased from 43 to 48 percent at time  the negotiations were concluded. However, with 26 percent, the  number of EU opponents did not change. Thus, according to the  opinion researchers, the new votes for the EU come from the  group of the undecided (currently only 26 percent). Thirty  percent of the (1,000) interviewees assessed the result that had  been brought home by the Austrian negotiating team as a clear  success. For 37 percent, only a "medium success" was achieved.  About 20 percent are "less" or "not at all satisfied."</p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Revels for a state without a creed: As Spain gears up for its 1992 festivities, Peter Bruce examines a country which is having trouble paying for modernity It is party time in Spain and everyone is invited, which is only fair as almost everyone is paying for it. Nineteen ninety-two promises to be a monumental celebration, bringing to a climax the country's first uninterrupted decade of democratic rule. But it also marks the end of Spain's most glittering economic successes since the Conquistadores took South America more than 400 years ago and draws a curtain on its reign as the Wunderkind of Europe. Few countries as poor as Spain would consider trying to host the summer Olympics and a World's Fair in the same year and probably even Spain would have baulked had it realised the extent of the economic strain involved, even though EC structural funds have played a key role in the effort. Somehow, more than Pta1,500bn (Pounds 8.2bn) - a combination of state spending and European Community financing - has found its way into Spanish roads, bridges, railways and airports to prepare for the festivities. But back in the years after the death of the dictator General Franco in 1975, as the world rushed to congratulate Spaniards on their remarkable transition to democracy, no ambition seemed too grand. The country, once bitterly divided, had awakened to a promise of something completely new. Calm. This was briefly interrupted by a coup attempt in 1981, but Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, the country's longest-serving elected leader, still tells visitors what he felt on the night he was first elected in 1982: 'People have not voted for change. They have voted for a rest.' Spain needed that rest to be able to focus its efforts on becoming an integrated part of a democratic, open Europe. A country ruled imperiously from the centre for nearly 40 years by Gen Franco had developed potentially poisonous regional conflicts, particularly in the Basque country and Catalonia. Holding Spain together had always been Madrid's big challenge, leading one of its leading early 20th-century philosophers, Jose Ortega y Gasset, to proclaim: 'If Spain is the problem, Europe is the solution.' That lesson has finally been taken aboard - being part of Europe is what unifies Spain. The sense of being a player on a wider stage has enabled the country's disparate communities to unite around a common objective rather than, as in the past, sniping at the government in Madrid. Spain realises its aspirations can no longer be met in a narrow domestic context, but only by opening itself to broader influences. This perception has not stopped Spaniards using democracy as a breathing space. The government's transformation of a once-closed economy into one of the world's most open, and the subsequent spurt of foreign investment, has disguised the extent to which Spaniards have remained themselves. The good life is being lived to the full: heart disease is growing faster in Spain than anywhere else in the industrialised west. Recent polls have shown that despite the growth of Aids and drug abuse in the country, parents still worry most about their children abandoning Catholicism or having abortions. Only 5 per cent of Spaniards have bought a book in the past year and more than 10 per cent of them remain functionally illiterate. They still take three-hour lunches and smoke in department stores. Yet criticism from abroad still rankles. This helps explain why 1992 has become, in Spanish eyes, such a critical year. For the doubters beyond Spain's borders and those few inside them, it is the ultimate showcase. Barcelona is a transformed city. Some Pta760bn have been spent on Olympic facilities and on easily the most ambitious urban renewal programme in Europe since the reconstruction of Germany after the second world war. Seville, a lethargic, sun-drenched tourist venue, looks like the kind of capital that might be built in the jungle by a mad dictator, as fantastic buildings take shape on the island of Cartuja where the Guadalquivir river skirts the city. Here the grandly named Universal Exposition 1992 (Expo) will welcome nearly 20m visitors between April and October. They will get there by car on a shiny new network of highways that now criss-cross the region of Andalucia. Or by air into a Pta9bn airport terminal that even the government admits will not be used to full capacity for at least 20 years. Or by rail on a new Pta400bn high-speed train link with Madrid. So much money has been spent on the rail project that there will be none left for connecting the country to Europe's high-speed network until the next century. New managers at the state railway company, Renfe, admit that, given the choice now, the line between Seville and Madrid would not have been built first. It will turn out to be more decorative than practical, an extravagant gesture to the poverty-stricken south. Jealous of the money being spent on Seville, and on Barcelona to the north, Madrid was determined not to be left out of the jollity and has become the Cultural Capital of Europe this year. Perhaps fortunately for Madrilenos, almost nothing has been done; the city has not been torn apart by construction works and potholes. Madrid came late to the trough though, so there is little money for anything except renovations to the old opera house and some museums, a few big concerts and exhibitions. Spanish leaders defend the spending spree in Barcelona and Seville. They argue that 1992 has been an investment trigger for pouring cash into regional development that would otherwise never have been undertaken. In the view of independent critics in Madrid, that makes sense in Barcelona, which is, anyway, the country's leading industrial centre and desperately needed an overhaul of its transport infrastructure. But the Pta800bn spent on Andalucia and Seville is greeted less enthusiastically. The mere existence of enhanced communications in Andalucia, the critics argue, does not imply automatic economic transformation after the Expo festivities are over. There is a serious risk, they say, that the facilities left behind will be underused because the region has little industrial culture or skills. A nagging sense persists of, perhaps, having overdone it, which is leading some Spaniards to caution against expecting too much of 1992. One of the wisest is Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, the country's foreign minister. 'Nineteen ninety-two,' he says with a flick of the wrist, 'it doesn't mean a thing'. Nearly three centuries of trying to get Gibraltar back from the British has made Spanish foreign ministers masters of lowering expectations but even wily Mr Ordonez is probably too late to save the authorities from the effects of overselling 1992 as a watershed for the country's development. 'Five years ago,' says Mr Jesus Martinez Vazquez, editor of the leading national business newspaper, Expansion, '1992 was a sort of horizon we were all moving towards. Now we are there and we have still not solved our fundamental problems'. These remain inflation and unemployment. Four years of a virulent mixture of high interest rates and tight credit have failed to bring underlying inflation below 6 per cent. Unemployment still languishes at above 15 per cent and is likely to get worse as thousands of jobs in the steel and coal industries of the north are threatened by Community subsidy limits. If the government is lucky, the economy will grow only 2 per cent this year, less than half the rate of two years ago. Time is now very tight. Spaniards will be left to get on with the party  - the Expo site and its 250 bars and eateries will be closed only from 4am until 9am for cleaning - while the government struggles to shore up the economy for a much more sombre 1993 in the hope that nobody notices the join. The challenge facing the government is all the more pressing as its political dominance is under threat at the next general election, which has to be held by October 1993. The ruling Socialists now have just half the seats in the Cortes (parliament) and must fight at the polls while at the same time trying to impose on Spain the harsh array of commitments made to their European partners at the Maastricht summit. They are broadly committed to taking the peseta into the narrow band of the ERM in the next two years. This would entail restricting exchange rate fluctuations from 6 per cent to 2.25 per cent and would thus severely limit the extent to which Spanish interest rates can be used as a tool of economic management. Interest rates would have to fall with narrow band entry, and the only way to do this without recharging inflation is to cut public spending. Until now, the Socialists have tried to resolve the conflict between budgetary discipline and spending by curbing consumer appetites. This, however, has only served to underline the fact that the state, as the biggest spender and employer, is itself the root cause of the inflationary malaise. If economic convergence with the rest of the Community is to be achieved and high public spending is to continue, someone else will have to pay for the roads. Hence Spain's insistence at Maastricht that the method of financing infrastructure projects with EC funds be changed. At present it is done on a 50-50 basis, with Spain matching EC funding. But it wants to pay less and the EC to pay more. Wrangling with the Community over money is a far cry from the expansive and exciting concerns of a decade ago and this year thus also probably marks Spain's coming of age, when the choices it has to make become more mundane and, perhaps, more mature. It is no longer a matter of how rich the country wants to be, but how poor it can bear to be. The absence of political mechanisms to make such choices less chaotic is not all the government's fault. But when Spaniards finally realise that the party is over, that they have not yet built a truly competitive industrialised country, selling the message will be tough. Spain's system of proportional representation is one of the most rigid in Europe. As a result parliamentary debate is practically non-existent, attendance is low and voters pay little attention to the deliberations of the Cortes. They do, however, pay attention to the government and feel free to criticise it in a way that would have been unthinkable 16 years ago. It is this liberal rule - Mr Gonzalez calls it catharsis - that may prove just as dangerous as an economic crunch. One of its side-effects has been to do allow widespread corruption in public life to come to the surface. The prime minister never tires of saying that he will leave office a relatively poor man, and most people believe him. But he misses the point. Corruption and influence trafficking around the government seem endless. The deputy prime minister was forced to resign last year after it became clear he had lent a government office in Seville to a businessman brother who then used his connection to win himself several business deals. A few months later, it emerged that two bogus consulting firms run by senior Socialist party officials had been taking million-dollar 'fees' from big industry for their services. The money appeared to have been going into party coffers. Corruption has induced a weariness in many Spaniards, especially those who failed to become rich in the boom years between 1986 and 1989. Even in Spain it is hard to get very rich very quickly and legally. Spain enters 1992 still a country without a creed. It is richer and outwardly more contented than it has been for much of this century, and the onset of harder economic times has taken the edge off the selfish, uncaring side of the country that briefly emerged after 1986. But it leaves Spaniards wondering what happens now, with nobody prepared to tell them how bad it could get.</p>

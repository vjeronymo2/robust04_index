			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Crime action splits Russians: Crisis decree could revive the KGB A decree empowering Russian police to launch open warfare on organised crime, which is due to come into effect today, is causing divisions among politicians and intellectuals and raising fears that combating criminality may lead to authoritarian rule. The campaign was authorised by a decree from President Boris Yeltsin two weeks ago and was deemed by the parliament last week to be unconstitutional. However, General Mikhail Yegorov, the first deputy interior minister and Russia's top official on organised crime, brushed aside deputies' objections, saying they were acting out of self-interest. 'Checks on bank accounts will show what financial support certain politicians have. It's only natural; they don't want this information made public,' he said. Mr Victor Stepashin, head of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service (FCS)  -successor to the KGB - said last week: 'I'm all for the violation of human rights if the human is a bandit or a criminal.' This view may be popular: crime has long since topped the opinion polls as the issue of greatest public concern. The decree allows suspects to be held incommunicado for up to 30 days; authorises searches of offices, flats and hotel rooms without warrants; and gives police the right to look at bank accounts. Even Mr Yeltsin has not tried to claim that it is constitutional - the constitution, for example, allows a period of only 48 hours for being held without charge. He argues that the clampdown is justified by the crisis into which crime is plunging the country. Its scale, in Russia and the other former Soviet states, is attracting great international concern. Mr Louis Freeh, director of the US FBI, leaves today for a 10-day trip to Russia and other east and central European nations for talks on how to control the spread of crime - particularly theft of nuclear material and drugs. Commenting on Mr Yeltsin's decree, Mr Freeh said it attempted to hold back 'an avalanche of violent crime threatening the very structure of government'. US officials estimate Russian gangs have 100,000 members and are linked with US, Sicilian and Colombian drug traffickers. Mr Stepashin has claimed that foreign intelligence services - especially those of the Baltic states - are using Russian gangs to destabilise the Russian state. He claims that a decree, re-establishing the formerly banned investigation department in the FCS, is awaiting presidential signature. This would give the former KGB back many of its former powers. Figures published by the Russian authorities over the weekend point to huge rises in drug use and crimes. The figures show 1.5m addicts in Russia as against 800,000 in 1992, almost a doubling in two years, and claim that 1m hectares are now growing the hemp from which opium is made, while 400 farms have been turned over to narcotic production. While the decree and the activity are likely to be popular among people who now witness both greatly increased violence and conspicuous luxury on the part of criminals it is tearing politicians apart. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the reformist Yabloko faction in the lower house, clashed angrily and publicly with Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg, at a World Economic Forum conference in Moscow last week on the issue. The former claimed the president was tearing up his own constitution and the latter defended the need for it before crime engulfed society. Though Mr Yavlinsky claimed the prosector's office was 'in chaos' under the twin pressures of a presidential decree on the one hand and a constitution on the other, Mr Alexei Ilyushenko, the acting public prosecutor, appears to support the decree. 'It is a question of whether the state can bring the Mafia to its knees  - or vice versa,' he told Interfax news agency. Russia survey, Section III</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / International Company News: Dresdner Bank confident on current-year profits Profits at Dresdner Bank are continuing to increase after a 24 per cent surge to DM2.04bn (Dollars 1.19bn) in operating earnings last year, Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, group chairman, said yesterday. Reporting a double-digit rise in income for the first two months, he forecast a satisfactory result for the full year after an 'especially successful' 1993. Mr Sarrazin also announced plans for a more international distribution of the group's shares. As expected, he unveiled a project to raise an estimated DM1.2bn through a private placing of American depositary receipts with US institutions. Dresdner was the first German bank to take this route, which did not oblige it to adopt more transparent US accounting and reporting practices, he said. The new paper would be priced at around the current share price, he added. Shareholders would also be asked at the annual meeting on May 20 to approve a further DM200m authorised capital to be issued as convertible bonds or options by the bank's foreign subsidiaries. In common with other domestic banks, Dresdner markedly increased provisions against bad debts last year: a 47 per cent increase took the total to DM1.77bn. The bank had been severely affected by the DM3.4bn rescue of Metallgesellschaft, but all provisions and costs had been included in the 1993 results, Mr Sarrazin said. Following the rescue Dresdner's stake in the metals, mining and engineering group had risen to 14 per cent from 12.6 per cent. Reviewing prospects for the current year, Mr Sarrazin said he expected developments to be 'calm'. Demand for financing for exports and construction would rise more strongly, with a more modest increase in calls for investment loans from corporate customers. He hoped increased industrial production would expand, increasing plant utilisation rates and helping restore domestic customers' financial stability. This would enable the bank to scale down risk-provisioning in the current year. Personal business would suffer because falling real incomes would lead to lower savings and less demand for loans for large purchases. While he did not expect an absolute decline in this area, growth rates would certainly shrink. Mr Sarrazin also expected own-account trading to continue to improve on the back of rising German stock markets, although he indicated that developments would be less dramatic than in 1993. Last year's profits from financial transactions increased 122 per cent to DM650m. Net commission income rose 29 per cent to DM3.16bn, interest earnings increased 9.6 per cent to DM6.27bn, and pre-tax profits climbed 17 per cent to DM1.83bn. As announced earlier this week, the 1993 dividend was raised DM1.50 to DM13.50.  ---------------------------------------------------- SHARP RISE IN GROUP RESULTS (DM)  ----------------------------------------------------                            1993       1992   % change  ---------------------------------------------------- Net operating profit     2.04bn     1.65bn      +23.5 Pre-tax profit           1.83bn     1.57bn      +17.0 Net profit               1.07bn       966m      +10.3 Own-account profit         650m       293m     +122.0 Risk provisions          1.77bn     1.21bn      +47.0 Dividend                  13.50      12.00      +12.5  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

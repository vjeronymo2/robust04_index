Sporadic gunfire continued  to be heard, especially in the northern areas of Bujumbura. In  the area of Kamenge, which has been most affected by the  prevailing insecurity, the situation seems to have eased.    The mayor of Bujumbura and the commander in charge of  security in that area today toured the area and witnessed the  situation that has relatively bettered and called on the  hundreds of people that have fled to return to their homes.  [sentence as heard]    In the meantime, Defense Ministe Lieutenant Colonel Gedeon  Fyiroko talked about the prevailing situation and the way the  Army was working to take control of the situation. They also  showed to reporters a heap of weapons that had been taken from  what were said to be rebels fighting the Army in the northern  areas of the capital. They also denied any rumors of a military  coup attempt in preparation. Mathias Ndayiragije has more:    [Begin Ndayiragije recording] Insecurity which prevails in  this country could be settled soon, the defense minister said,  if all moral forces could indulge in such business. He said  other forces must collaborate with the government and the  population as a whole, in an attempt to find ways out. For him,  the first thing to be done was to create confidence among the  population and be aware of the danger as it results in several  losses of human lives, for which the minister for defense does  not want to make stories or accounts whatsoever, because it is a  shame. [sentence as heard]    All rumors which are [word indistinct] in this country tend  to create mutual hatred among the population and this hatred  results sometimes in mutual exclusion.    As for rumors which said there ought [as heard] to occur a  military force coup, the defense minster said that the Burundi  Army keeps loyal and fully supports the government and all the  democratic institutions of the country.    The Burundi minister expressed concern over the disarmament  issue because people who have no civil rights to hold weapons  continue to seek them and this will always constitute a threat  to the country's security. There are [word indistinct]  thousands of weapons circulating among the population, and some  of them are not available in the Burundi arsenal military stock.  Some of the weapons are manufactured and imported from South  Africa, Israel, Brasilia, China, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Russia  and so on.    Those weapons include guns, (?F.M. Karash), grenades of  different kinds, as well as rockets. There were also some  weapons which are not available in the Burundi military stock  arsenal but which are actually used in the Rwandese Army. Most  of the other weapons such as pistols, are used by the Burundi  intelligence services. For him an action of disarmament should  start soon and provide [break in transmission].

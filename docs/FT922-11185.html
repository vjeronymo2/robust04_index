			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Observer: Rounding up A favourite quiz question for all who believe that corporatism has been buried in the UK: which successful strike in the late 1980s was led by a director of the Bank of England and a governor of the BBC? The answer is the engineering hours dispute; the men in question, Gavin Laird and Bill Jordan, respectively general secretary and president of the Amalgamated Engineering Union. But, in spite of their eminence, Laird and Jordan come well down the league table of union bosses' pay. They will this week receive a 5 per cent pay rise from the union's national conference, taking each man's salary to Pounds 31,762. Only George Brumwell of the building union, Ucatt, does worse in the top 10 unions' list, with Pounds 27,000. At the top end is Alan Jinkinson of white-collar union Nalgo on Pounds 55,000, Ken Gill, left-wing leader of technical union MSF on Pounds 52,000, and John Edmonds, leader of the GMB on Pounds 48,000. However, Laird and Jordan might be due for a big pay rise: the engineering union is about to merge with the electricians' union, the leader of which, Paul Gallagher, is on nearly Pounds 40,000.</p>

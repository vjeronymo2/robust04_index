			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: TV-am asset sale continues its stake in Virgin Radio, which will launch a national pop channel on April 30. TV-am bid for the second national commercial radio licence in a joint venture with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group at a time when it was trying to put together a portfolio of broadcasting businesses. Since then the company has decided to sell up and distribute proceeds to shareholders. At the same time as buying out TV-am's interest in the new station Virgin has brought Apax Partners, a venture capital group which will take up a 25 per cent stake in the new station. Mr Bruce Gyngell, TV-am chairman, will step down as chairman of Virgin Radio. No price was disclosed for the deal but it is believed Virgin has paid about Pounds 1.5m. Recently MTV paid Pounds 3.5m to buy TV-am's headquarters.</p>

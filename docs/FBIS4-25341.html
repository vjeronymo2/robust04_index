			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Some Local Officials To Be Dismissed for Qiandao </F> Lake Incident"]    [Text] Beijing, 5 Jun (WEN WEI PO)--According to an  informed person here, the central leadership has decided to deal  with a number of relevant local leaders after conclusion of the  Qiandao Lake incident, and some officials will be dismissed from  their posts. He said the central authorities hold that since  the serious case occurred in the Qiandao Lake area, the relevant  leaders there, of course, are to be held responsible to a  certain degree. This person said the mainland currently  practices the "one-vote negation system for comprehensive  management of public order," that is to say, the performance of  the leaders of a particular place is weighed against the public  order of that place or against problems occurring there and  their performance can be judged accordingly.    It is learned that the "serious robbery, arson, and murder  case at Qiandao Lake" is due to be tried by the Hangzhou City  Intermediate People's Court from 10 June onward. In the  incident, three suspects killed 32 people by extremely cruel  means, most of whom were Taiwan tourists.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In Brussels on 6 April, President Juan Carlos  Wasmosy again blamed the press for all the troubles in the  country. He said the media is controlled by powerful  organizations established during the previous administration.    The president said such organizations frequently do not have  any mercy on the administration's need for space, adding that  his government was seated only a short time ago and had to  administer the many conflicts that currently are surfacing.    "My government guarantees the most absolute freedom of the  press, which is controlled by powerful communications  organizations that were established during the previous  administration and that frequently do not have any mercy on the  administration's need for space in the short time it has had to  administer the many conflicts that are surfacing today," the  president said.    Wasmosy read his speech during a working luncheon with  European Parliament President Egon Klepsh and various European  deputies.    The head of state said the method for administering  conflicts  in a true democracy was quite different from the methods used in  the past autocracy.    Regarding the social crisis, Wasmosy told the European  deputies that his government was committed to facing the social  problems caused by poverty, disease, ignorance, and lack of  communications in wide areas of the country with courage and  determination.    Wasmosy said his government used the invaluable democratic  instrument of dialogue, compromise, and agreement with  opposition forces, adding that the opposition controlled both  houses of Congress.    The head of state stressed that this attitude permitted them  to close a pact with the opposition that will guarantee the  democratic governability of the country. Wasmosy said the pact  with the opposition will allow them to fulfill, in freedom, the  people's long delayed and legitimate aspirations.    The president admitted that the country's economy was  fragile  and weak because 76 percent of the 4 million inhabitants earned  their incomes from agriculture, adding that agriculture depended  on the success or failure of cotton and soybean crops, which  usually are affected by international markets' cyclical  variations.</p>

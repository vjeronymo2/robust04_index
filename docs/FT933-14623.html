			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Germany supports franc THE Bundesbank intervened to support the French franc yesterday as the currency continued to face strong speculative pressure, writes Stephanie Flanders. In early morning trading the franc fell as low as FFr3.4125 per D-Mark, less than 2 centimes above its ERM floor against the D-Mark of FFr3.4305. The intervention caused some firming in the middle of the day, but afterwards the franc continued to fall, closing at FFr3.416 from a previous FFr3.399. The Bundesbank's purchases of francs came after supportive comments by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, who reaffirmed the close ties between Germany and France and expressed confidence in the fundamentals of the French economy. The day's developments confirmed the market belief that, to have a positive effect, action to support the French currency would have to come from Germany, rather than France. 'Because the trigger for recent events has been the French need to cut interest rates, traders are not likely to take an increase in French rates seriously,' one trader said. Dealers now expect the Bundesbank to shave a few basis points from the repo rate when it is announced tomorrow. The more important possibility is a cut in the German Lombard rate when the Bundesbank council meets on Thursday, but opinion is divided about whether this will occur. 'There is increasing optimism that there will be further rate adjustment before the summer recess,' said a London-based dealer. 'But the people expecting a cut on Thursday are being a little premature.' On balance, most thought that the Bundesbank would do its best to hold out until the council meeting on July 29 before a further cut in rates. Rate reductions before then would risk a domestic bond market backlash, since little has changed to German economic conditions in the 10 days since rates were last cut. However, the precipitous decline of the franc once the Bundesbank had left the market cast doubt on the German authorities' ability to hold out. 'The bottom line,' said Julian Jessop at Midland Global Markets in London, 'is that Germans will cut rates if they have to.' Some thought that even a cut in German rates would not be enough to avert a crisis: 'this is about confidence in two economies, not the level of interest rates,' one London-based trader opined. The dollar benefited from its status as a safe haven currency, as well as the fact that European interest rates are expected to fall soon. It rose steadily against the D-Mark to end at DM1.7285 from Friday's DM1.7210. In New York it finished at DM1.7298. During the day, sterling seemed to benefit from its isolation from the ERM. The currency closed 50 basis points firmer at DM2.5550.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Bank of England wins appeal over Mount Banking THE BANK of England was yesterday vindicated in its decision a year ago to petition for the closure of Mount Banking, a small Asian-owned bank. The Banking Appeal Tribunal ruled that the Bank had been justified in applying to a High Court judge for provisional liquidation in October last year. The tribunal's 52-page ruling, circulated yesterday, showed that the Bank acted on suspicion of large-scale money laundering of proceeds of a fraud against Standard Chartered and the Indian Stock Exchange, and 'other serious improprieties'. The judgment is particularly significant in ratifying the Bank's attempts to take a bolder line in using its judgment as a regulator since the closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The Bank had been criticised in the Bingham report into BCCI for relying too far on high standards of evidence as a basis for regulatory actions and being unwilling to have its authority tested. The judgment came in the first sitting of a tribunal under the 1987 Banking Act. It met in September under the chairmanship of Mr Jonathan Mance, QC. It revealed that the Bank of England has allowed Mount Banking to keep its licence for another three months, which may give time for its sale. The tribunal determined that the Bank was right to assess the two shareholders of the bank, Mr Navinchandra Bhagwanji Shah and Mr Suresh Bhagwanji Shah, as 'fit and proper' to hold their positions as directors. The tribunal ordered the appellants to pay the Bank of England's costs, expected to be several hundred thousand pounds.</p>

So far there are 22 firm orders for the  aircraft.    The Fokker 70 is now halfway toward obtaining its  certification, which is expected in October 1994. Since its  first flight on 2 April 1993, the prototype has made 195 flights  and logged 250 hours, including 765 landings. The chief  mechanical characteristics have been confirmed during this  period: indicators and response to controls, flight envelope and  stall limits, performance on takeoff and landing, and external  noise measurements. The aircraft recently completed a two-month  evaluation period in Spain (Granada), during which it flew more  than 20 hours per week. The prototype has returned to its test  facility at Schiphol (Amsterdam), where it will be equipped in  January for a new series of tests that will include automatic  landing with the AFCAS (Automatic Flight Control and  Augmentation System) control system and verification of the  performance of its engine (RR Tay 620), avionics (ARINC 700),  and systems.    After being ferried to Cranfield in Great Britain, the  Fokker  70 will undergo tests aimed at verifying the behavior of its  nose landing gear on wet runways.    Program officials are very satisfied at the moment. They say  that takeoff performance exceeds expectations and that fuel  consumption is lower than expected. Early conclusions point to  flight characteristics similar to those of the Fokker 100 and to  the possibility of improving the Fokker 70's carrying capacity  by moving the center of gravity forward two percent.    Commonality with the 100-seat Fokker will make it possible  to  train the first crews on the Fokker 100 flight simulator. That,  in turn, will make it possible to reduce the number of hours  necessary for crew training by half.    Assembly of the first series aircraft (No. 02) will begin in  February so that it will be able to participate in the  certification program in August. The order book contains 22 firm  orders: 10 for Sempati, five for Pelita (Indonesia), five  (leased) for British Midland, and two (plus an option for six)  for Mesa Airlines, the first North American customer. The  manufacturing schedule calls for the production of two aircraft  in 1994 and 15 in 1995. Sempati, which is the first customer,  will take delivery of its first aircraft at the end of 1994 with  the intention of putting it into service in March 1995. British  Midland will receive two aircraft in 1995 and three the  following year.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH AND LOW HOPES  </P> <P> My family and I enjoyed the recent Bob Hope special. We especially enjoyed the  comedic talent of Michael Crawford ("Phantom of the Opera").  </P> <P> It was nice to see him out from behind the mask and showing his flair for  comedy. We hope to see more of the multitalented Crawford in the future.  </P> <P> Linda Jalbert, Arcadia  </P></p>

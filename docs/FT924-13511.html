			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Observer: Squeaky clean It would seem that Anita Roddick is rewarding Body Shop's overseas employees for their selling skills - which have kept the UK company above the tide-mark - by issuing them with a free T-shirt. In a departure from her usual exhortations to take care of the environment, the T-shirts now being distributed to workers in Body Shops in the US carry the message Don't Let the Future Happen Without You - Register to Vote. A similar theme is being pushed in Canada, where a national-unity referendum takes place in ten days' time. Body Shop has been careful not to take sides. But can there be any doubt that Roddick would support environmentally-friendly Bill Clinton and Al Gore if she were a US citizen?</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Survey of Luxembourg (3): Continuous trading needed - The Stock Exchange LUXEMBOURG'S stock exchange is home to the Eurobond. It was first issued in 1963, and is celebrating its 30th anniversary, but the tiny bourse is also looking to the future, seeking to carve for itself a niche in the European Community's single market. It hopes to be sitting pretty through a period of less introverted trading and more international activity - with an eye on the 1996 implementation of an EC Investment Services Directive (ISD) which gives brokers a 'passport' to trade throughout the EC, and a much-touted 'Eurolist' allowing important securities to be simultaneously listed on various European exchanges. 'We were always based on transnational and transcontinental business,' says Mr Edmond Israel. the bourse chairman. 'All developments leading to greater efficiency for transnational business in Europe will enhance the business in Luxembourg.' Mr Israel, together with other officials in this tiny country wedged between France, Germany and Belgium, is touting a tradition of international expertise. Between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of the world's outstanding Eurobonds are listed in Luxembourg. While lower interest rates around Europe helped the Eurobond market to break volume records, analysts noted its ability to withstand currency turbulence. With more than 10,000 securities denominated in 26 currencies, Luxembourg's exchange is a significant part of a marketplace which hopes to take a central position in Europe, and not just geographically. 'I think we are well positioned for the future,' Mr Israel says. That belief stems partly from the expectation that foreign banks and international companies will continue to set up shop, taking advantage of Luxembourg's flexible regulatory structure and its centrally located, multi-lingual base. With some 200 banks already in the Grand Duchy, Mr Israel sees 'quite a lot of potential here in the securities field.' Even without the new EC rules integrating stock exchanges, he thinks the 1990s will be good for bourses; he anticipates a trend towards greater equity investment. 'The stock exchanges have a big role to play in . . . converting short term cash into long-term investment, which will contribute to Europe's the economic development.' Total trading volume in June rose to LFr23.34 bn, an increase of 22.49 per cent over the first 1992 period. Mr Israel predicts that volume will continue its climbing pace. 'By December 31 this year I would anticipate a growth of between 25 and 30 per cent over last year.' He also says that, thanks to Luxembourg's liberal trading tradition, the volume of trading off the exchange 'exceeds by far' that of on-exchange trading. Under the ISD, those transactions will have to be reported to a central authority, increasing the bourse staff's workload. Although he says the on-exchange turnover is 'extremely satisfactory,' it is still one of Europe's smallest. Mr Israel wants 'to increase the transactions more substantially.' That means computerising securities. While nearly 800 securities are now being traded electronically, traders complain that the computers are not always working. Meanwhile, the old, open outcry system still prevails. Trading floor activity is still limited to between 10.45am and 1.15pm - a disadvantage compared to Paris, which trades between 10am and 5pm. Plans to extend the Luxembourg exchange's hours have not yet borne fruit, but Mr Israel says: 'There's more than a fair chance that it will happen next year.' No decision has yet been taken on which securities could be traded during extended hours. Traders say that another feature ripe for change is the manner in which securities are called in succession on the exchange, allowing trading on a particular bond or share only when it has been called. Securities also come up one by one on trading screens. 'We absolutely must create a continuous trading market throughout the working day,' complains one Luxembourg trader. Luxembourg has continued on its path towards making investment funds a speciality; it lists 1,915 domestic and foreign funds. But bond trading constitutes the bulk of the exchange's activity, thanks mostly to listings by foreign companies. With 855 new bonds listed since January, bond turnover reached LFr15.48b in June. Mr Israel says that he expects to see growth in Luxembourg franc and Ecu-dominated bonds, as well as shares of 'major international investment funds' which he declined to identify. He also foresees growth in equities, 'where next year the Eurolist shares could play a major role.' Though the Ecu remains the most traded currency, it has slipped as the bond denomination of choice, accounting for nearly half the bond volume a year ago, but not even a third of its volume today. Luxembourg franc-denominated bonds now represent 17 per cent of total bond trading, followed by Canadian and US dollar bonds. And bonds have shrunk as a fraction of total trading volume, from 75 per cent last December to some 66 per cent in June. Meanwhile, stocks and shares, which accounted for 26 per cent of total trading on the bourse in 1992, now constitute 33.7 per cent. Luxembourg securities account for nearly 90 per cent of stock trading. Of the exchange's 66 domestic shares and 202 foreign ones, the top 10 traded shares so far this year are all Luxembourg companies. Those include Arbed, the steelmaker, whose shares remained remarkably stable despite the announcement of heavy losses, and Audiofina, the holding company, whose shares rose to record heights. (Audiofina holds a controlling stake in the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion.) Mr Israel's view is that domestic companies will remain the core business on Europe's larger stock exchange, but that - at least in Luxembourg - the drive for a European single market will 'bring more players into the picture.'</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINO HIRING PLAN TO WAIT FOR A HEARING  </P> <P> The City Council postponed a vote Tuesday on the adoption of an affirmative  action plan to triple the number of Latinos working in city government over the  next five years.  </P> <P> City Atty. Wesley Fenderson and Councilman Maxcy Filer said that a recent U.S.  Supreme Court ruling makes it necessary to hold a public hearing to document  the need for an affirmative action plan before one is adopted. If a city has  not documented the need for affirmative action via the hearing process, they  said, a plan could be challenged later in court.  </P> <P> Only about 9.7% of the city's work force of 514 is Latino, while black workers  total 78%. The affirmative action plan was developed by members of the  Committee on Hispanic Affairs, which is composed of city staff members and  representatives of Compton's Latino community.  </P> <P> The plan calls for bringing the percentage of Latino workers to 27% over the  next five years. No date was set for a hearing.  </P></p>

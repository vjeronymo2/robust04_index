			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Yeltsin olive branch for Volsky: Russian president hints he is ready to work with Civic Union RUSSIAN PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has indicated that he would 'work seriously' with the centrist Civic Union group, in a further apparent sign of his willingness to moderate reforms before the forthcoming Congress of Peoples' Deputies, at which an all-out attack on his government is planned. Mr Arkady Volsky, the head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, which is closely associated with the Civic Union, and which has just completed its programme to 'correct' the government's policies, said the government and the Civic Union had been coming closer together in their thinking. At the same time, the National Salvation Front, the nationalist-communist coalition which Mr Yeltsin banned earlier this week, decided to defy the ban. Mr Ilya Konstantinov, a leader of the Front, said yesterday: 'This is an anti-constitutional decree contrary to the legislation - we will not recognise its legal force.' Yet more ominously, Lieutenant Colonel Yevgeny Chernorikov, deputy chairman of the Union of Officers, a nationalist grouping claiming 10,000 members, said the group had appealed to officers to reconsider their loyalty to the Russian authorities. 'The personal loyalty of the minister of defence to the president does not mean that this corresponds to the interests of the country.' According to Col Chernorikov, the army had received an order that all weapons except those issued to guards must be locked up - an apparent indication that the authorities feared an army revolt. Mr Yegor Gaidar, acting prime minister, said when asked about the order that he knew nothing of it, but would make inquiries of the Defence Ministry. Mr Yeltsin said in an interview with the mass-circulation weekly Argumenty i Facty that he would be 'tough with those who call for the overthrow of constitutional power'. But he dismissed those 'who shout a lot' as having no social base, saying they could therefore not be called an opposition. The Civic Union, however, could be called an opposition, but so far it had only put up about a dozen slogans, which did not constitute a programme. 'When such a programme is unveiled, then we must work seriously with the opposition,' he said. One option apparently being considered by Mr Yeltsin is an agreement, tacit or explicit, with the Civic Union - which would include some cabinet changes, possibly even the removal of Mr Gaidar from his post as prime minister. However, Mr Gennady Burbulis, one of his closest aides, said in a separate interview yesterday that things were becoming so unstable that presidential rule 'must be considered'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Liviu Tudor: "KGB Agents Have Embarked Upon </F> Aggressive Espionage Activity Against Romanian Intelligence  Service Employees"]    [Text] With the support of their agencies in the Republic  of Moldova, as well as those in our own country, especially in  the northeastern region, the KGB has embarked upon a sustained  campaign intended to disclose and gather documentary evidence  with respect to the activity of the SRI [Romanian Intelligence  Service] employees. Currently the D Division of the SRI, for the  intelligence protection of SRI personnel, has several files with  references to Russian surveillance activity and their attempts  to penetrate the circles of SRI employees in the north-eastern  part of Romania. The documents sent to the government and the  presidency briefing them on these facts have been left without  answer.    The collapse of the USSR in 1990 did not implicitly mean  that  the KGB's potential dropped as well. As neither its authority  nor its influence at home or abroad has suffered setbacks, the  KGB is trying to keep under control its zones of influence, and  especially Romania.    Moscow does not like the ideas and the conception of the  Romanian Armed Forces and certain political circles to integrate  within NATO structures. The assertion made on 24 December 1992  by the SRI director [Virgil Magureanu], in his speech occasioned  by the Day of Antiterrorist Fighters, according to which "the  Romanian Intelligence Service should involve itself more in  Romania's reunification with Bessarabia," was a further signal  that caused concern at Russian secret service headquarters.    Two years after this statement, during a news conference  organized in the month of March 1994, SRI Director Virgil  Magureanu hinted that the most aggressive intelligence service  currently acting on Romania's territory is the KGB.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 24 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- It has been  reported here that hundreds of Haitians are fleeing the country  for fear of repression by the military. International  commercial flights to Haiti stop at midnight tonight.    Shortly before the deadline set by the United States and  Canada, U.S. airlines stopped flying to Haiti in compliance with  the extension of the embargo declared by the UN Security Council  against the Haitian military government. These measures,  together with the cancellation of visas to Haitian businessmen,  important civilian officials, and military officers, are  designed to force the coupist government to step down and  reinstate deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.    Stanley Schrager, U.S. Embassy spokesman in Port-au-Prince,  has confirmed that petitions for asylum from approximately 1,000  Haitians are being reviewed. If the petitions are approved,  these Haitians will permitted to travel on chartered flights.    Meanwhile, internal repression is increasing in Haiti. The  government of Emile Jonassaint, which has not been recognized  internationally, has forbidden foreign journalists to travel  outside the Haitian capital.    Today in Santo Domingo, President Joaquin Balaguer voiced  his  hope that the economic embargo against Haiti will come to an end  soon, arguing that the Dominican Republic is having to spend  enormous amounts of money to prevent contraband. Balaguer added  that his country is strictly complying with the embargo by  closely monitoring the border. Nevertheless, he did not rule  out the possibility of a few gallons of fuel being smuggled  across the extensive border.    Meanwhile, officials of the Balaguer government said they  will move to ban the presence of foreign troops on Dominican  territory to reinforce the economic embargo against Haiti.  Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral said: "We cannot  accept, whatsoever, the presence of foreign troops to reinforce  the border."    Herrera Cabral's remarks came into response to President  Carlos Menem's offer to dispatch Argentine troops to reinforce  the embargo against Haiti. The offer had been made during  Menem's meeting with President Bill Clinton in Washington. Two  weeks ago, Argentina became a member of the "Friends of Haiti"  group, which includes France, the United States, Canada, and  Venezuela.    Herrera Cabral said the Dominican Republic is bearing the  full financial burden of maintaining troops along the border  without the assistance of any international organization.</p>

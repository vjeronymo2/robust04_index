			<p>BFN     [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader  Afonso Dhlakama continues his visit to Sofala Province in  preparation for the first general multiparty election due to be  held on 27 and 28 October. Tome Igreje reports.    Everyone must register in order to actively take part in the  coming multiparty elections scheduled for October this year.  This was the principal message conveyed by Renamo President  Afonso Dhlakama to the residents of Dondo and the administrative  post of Mafambice yesterday.    Accompanied by Raul Domingos and Sofala provincial  representative Manuel Pereira, Afonso Dhlakama reminded the  people that the war between Renamo and the government has ended  and he gave assurances that it will not be repeated in  Mozambique. Proclaiming himself the defender of democracy,  freedom, and justice in Mozambique, the Renamo leader said the  people must prepare themselves to choose their president and  government for the next five years.    [Begin Dhlakama recording] A voter registration process is  under way throughout the country at present. Voter registration  teams are recording the names, place of birth, and age of  prospective voters. After that they distribute voter  registration cards. I would, therefore, like to request my  parents here, all the people here to go to voter registration  centers. Voter registration is vital for you to be able to vote  in the election. No matter how you like this or that party, you  cannot vote without being registered as a voter.    The war has ended in Mozambique. I am the one who is saying  it. I do not want to hear of war any more. I do not even want  to see someone holding an AK-47. [end recording]    Afonso Dhlakama said proudly that he had defeated the armed  forces of the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] and their  allies of the eastern block. Frequently applauded by thousands  of people present at the Mafambice rally, the Renamo leader  removed his spectacles on several occasions to show his eyes to  the people. He told the people that they should look at him  closely so that they could better recognize him, in an apparent  appeal to them to choose him in the coming presidential  elections.    [Begin Dhlakama recording] I can say with pride that Renamo  won the war. Renamo defeated Frelimo together with all its  allies. [applause] Let us now forget war. Let us now forget war  and speak about peace. Let us speak of peace.    I am always in Maputo, holding talks with my brother the  president of the Republic. This means, therefore, that the war  has ended. The only war that now remains is the political war.  There should be no more hatred. We should not say: This one  belongs to Frelimo. I do not want to associate with him because  I belong to Renamo. That has ended. Now we are going to wage a  political war.    The power now is in the hands of the Mozambican people. It  is up to them to choose the future president of Mozambique who  will be able to respect their supreme interests. We say thank  you for your presence here at this rally. [preceding sentence in  Sena] Thank you, thank you very much, Mozambican people. [end  recording]    The Renamo president then left for Mafambice in a luxurious  Mercedes Benz. There he visited the installations of the sugar  factory and was briefed on its operation. At present the  factory is paralyzed.    Afonso Dhlakama also visited other districts of Sofala  Province today, but these were not named for security reasons.    At a meeting presided over by Afonso Dhlakama in Dondo  yesterday, two citizens were detained by Renamo men for  allegedly carrying placards which were against Renamo. The two  men were forcibly carried by Afonso Dhlakama's men to Mafambice,  where the second rally took place.    In Mafambice journalists wanted to approach the two citizens  who were detained in a vehicle but were prevented from doing so  by Renamo men who said there was no reason to interview them.  Following journalists' insistence, the Renamo men said there was  no major problem with the detained people. They were there just  to investigate who sent them to the meeting with the placards,  which the journalists were unable to see. The two men were  later on released before the holding of the mass rally.</p>

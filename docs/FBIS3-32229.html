			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Melo from National Congress in Quito -- </F> live]    [Text] Alfredo Corral Borrero, labor and social resources  minister, has stated that 50 percent of employees at businesses,  enterprises, and factories have halted their activities in  response to the appeal issued by the United Workers Front [FUT]  and other labor groups. The minister refrained from saying  whether the national strike had been a success or a failure but  asserted that such actions will not solve the country's critical  problems.    [Begin Corral recording] Transportation workers have not  joined this drastic measure, nor have construction workers. As  far as this ministry is concerned, that is, speaking strictly  about labor issues, the reports we have received from all labor  inspection offices throughout the country indicate there has  been a partial work stoppage at businesses, enterprises,  factories, and so forth. Some cities have been more affected  than others. If we establish an average evaluation for the work  stoppage, we can say that it is approximately 50 percent. That  implies that the other 50 percent of the workers have been  working and continue to work despite the strike decreed by the  FUT. Information received from the country's agrarian and  livestock areas indicates that everything dealing with the labor  sector has proceeded normally. Consequently, labor activities  in the countryside are normal. [end recording]    Labor Minister Alfredo Corral also said that social  compensations include the freezing of urban transportation  service fares and a possible increase in some of the components  of the Ecuadoran workers' salaries.

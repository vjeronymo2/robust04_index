			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Books: A post-apartheid tale - Fiction NONE TO ACCOMPANY ME by Nadine Gordimer Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 324 pages Here's fortune] Nadine Gordimer, with a speed that beggars belief, has produced her novel of the New South Africa. The Nobel Prizewinner is of course a political writer, and her response to the extraordinary transformation that has overtaken South Africa has all the relevance, the sympathy, the wisdom, that we could have hoped for. None To Accompany Me marks, I believe, a welcome retreat from the apocalyptic, even strident, tone that has jeopardised some of her recent books, a return to the quiet authority of the middle period of The Conservationist and Burger's Daughter. Indeed, it is also a return to the liberal and multi-racial Johannesburg of the earliest novels and short stories of 30 years ago: today, almost unbelievably, the revolution has been achieved, the circle has been closed. Vera Stark is a dedicated lawyer, working for a version of the real-life Legal Resources Centre, which helps black and disadvantaged people in trouble with what used to be apartheid and which these days finds itself focusing on problems to do with land ownership. It is 'the year the prisons opened' - 'the year when the old life comes to an end' - and, with majority rule approaching, the exiles are returning home and Vera and her friends can 'indulge a little in the euphoria they knew couldn't last, but they were entitled to enjoy . . .' Gordimer has always had a remarkable gift for conveying the reality of contemporary South African society, and at this most immediate level None To Accompany Me is fascinating. That society is experiencing a convulsion of change: the past is being undone before our eyes. Vera observes, approves, becomes involved, understands: 'I can't live in the past', she tells her expatriate son. She understands that, no longer young nor even middle-aged, she must now go in search of her true self. Her friends Didymus and Sibongile Maqoma have returned from their long and dangerous political exile, having earned their heroes' welcome. But it is Sibongile whose political career blossoms; her husband is dumped ungratefully, and not because he had a brief involvement with the ANC training camps to the north where torture was a scandal of the liberation struggle. The new black middle classes move into the glossy suburbs and restaurants of their white predecessors, the young leader (the un-named Chris Hani) is assassinated, there are terror attacks from the white Right, hit lists, rumours of corruption, casual - and fatal - violence, constant debate about the re-making of the country - all this is the stuff of the novel, yet informed by Gordimer's concern for her characters and their humanity. 'Perhaps the passing away of the old regime makes the abandonment of an old personal life also possible.' There is the theme of None To Accompany Me. Vera Stark remembers the friends and lovers of her younger years. She buries her father-in-law and leaves her husband. She acknowledges that her daughter is a lesbian. She welcomes her grandson. She makes a profound, non-sexual relationship with Zeph Rapulala, one of the new black businessmen. She is 'working through dependencies'. She sells her home and moves into the annexe of Zeph's house. The symbolism is evident yet never too intrusive. Vera and Zeph are the alliance, the relationship, the friendship, that are to be the new South Africa. Vera - alone in her annexe, rather as black maids used to occupy a room behind the kitchen - has broken with the past and learned responsibility for the consequences of that younger life. She has earned and entered the solitary 'Nightfall in Autumn' of Gordimer's epigraph. This is, to repeat, a political novel in the sense that the author writes about the world (of strangers, of ideology, of conflict), but she populates and illustrates this world with men and women, black and white, old and young. Vera Stark is one of her most substantial creations.</p>

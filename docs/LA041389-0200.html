Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> KOHL FIRES DEFENSE MINISTER AND REPLACES 7 OTHER CABINET MEMBERS  </P> <P> Chancellor Helmut Kohl today fired his defense minister and replaced seven  other Cabinet members in an apparent bid to stop his party's declining  popularity.  </P> <P> In addition to the defense post, Kohl announced a new chief of staff and new  ministers for finance, interior, transport, economic cooperation, construction  and information.  </P> <P> Defense Minister Rupert Scholz was the only Cabinet member left jobless under  the changes. He was replaced by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg.  </P> <P> Kohl said at a news conference that the changes were not a direct consequence  of his Christian Democratic Union's recent election setbacks, but he conceded  that his party and coalition government face "a totally new situation."  </P></p>

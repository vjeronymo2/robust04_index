			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> Gregory Vose attempts some sprightly turns in a clutch of marble pieces marking  his first local one-person show. Small odd forms, witty cuts and generally  light-handed treatment of a heavy-duty medium are all good signs.  </P> <P> In "Botticelli," a white tray-shape perched on a graceful, three-footed metal  stand holds a tall, faceted twist of white marble enveloping a ball and -- at a  distance -- a small phallic squiggle lying on its side. "Little Egypt," a  semi-abstract tabletop piece, suggests a reference to the famous burlesque  artist via a zig-zag "profile" and peek-a-boo "belly." But when he reaches for  a heavier theme in "Ozymandias," Vose doesn't allow the faceted bulky black  marble pieces on the floor to be read with sufficient clarity.  </P> <P> Alexandra Benjamin's paintings and watercolors are mostly of the organic-flow  variety, with ribbons of bright color curving through space. A dated approach  even in watercolor, where at least technical control is at issue, this imagery  has little to redeem it as rendered flatly in acrylic paint, with a few drips  and splatters suggesting a timid attempt at improvisation. (Gallery 454, 454  Robertson Blvd., to Feb. 4.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergei Tikhy: "Crimea Opts for Moscow"; first </F> paragraph is introductory paragraph]    [Text] The second round of the presidential elections in  Crimea produced no surprises: 75 percent of Crimea's voters went  to the polls and 73 percent of them voted for Yuri Meshkov.    MN File: Yuri Meshkov was born in 1945, his  mother is Ukrainian and his father Russian. Graduated from  Moscow University's Department of Law. Worked as a senior  investigator at the Procurator's Office in Crimea which he was  forced to quit because of an attempt to call some members of the  party-managerial nomenklatura to account. Spent three years in  the merchant marines. Then worked as a lawyer. Is a deputy to  the Supreme Soviet of Crimea. Is married and has two  children.    His rival, Nikolai Bagrov, polled 23.5 percent. These  figures  may be interpreted as a result of the referendum on whom Crimea  belongs to, the conduct of which was one of the key planks of  Meshkov's election programme. In effect, this means that Ukraine  has missed its chance to strengthen its hold on the gift  presented by Nikita Khrushchev in 1954 (cf. MN No. 3).    The main reason behind such election returns is not the fear  of growing Ukrainian influence in all aspects of life, the  threat of which was used to scare the electorate (considering  that one in five Crimean inhabitants is Ukrainian, only one in a  thousand Crimean schoolchildren studies in Ukrainian). The main  source of the Crimean electorate's sympathies and antipathies  lies in whatever is known all over the world as the  Ukrainization of the economy.    Meshkov won, but his victory boiled down to a questionable  right to make the first move in a position amounting to a  stalemate for everyone.    From his very first day in the post of President Yuri  Meshkov  will be severely limited in terms of time. Considering the  character of his electors (it is easier to lose than win their  sympathies), the President will have to work to secure a repeal  of the moratorium on the referendum in Crimea so as to hold it  on March 27, the day of elections to the Supreme Soviet of  Ukraine and Crimea. Otherwise Meshkov risks not only his  position, but even the chances for a parliamentary victory by  the forces supporting him. Thus, less than two months has been  allotted for the creation of the legal basis he has promised to  rely upon in relation with Ukraine. Moreover, Meshkov will have  to predicate himself on the following real circumstances.    Crimea depends economically to an even greater extent on  Ukraine than the latter on energy imports. The question is not  about something of secondary importance, but about fresh water  and electricity. Crimea consumes one billion dollars' worth of  electricity each year alone in terms of world prices. In the  course of TV debates, replying to his opponent's blunt question  about what he would do if Kiev cut off the supply of electricity  to the Crimea, Meshkov confined himself to general words,  claiming that Russia would not abandon Crimea. However,  electricity cannot be delivered by tanker whereas the  construction of power lines of corresponding capacity across the  Kuban and the Kerch Strait will take at least three years.    The fulfilment of even the most fantastic of Meshkov's  election promises, like the entry into the rouble zone, will all  the same not produce anything economically unless political  stability has been guaranteed in Crimea. Without it the  peninsula's economic infrastructure, geared mainly to tourism,  will be doomed to final degradation.    And besides, the newly-elected President's relations with  the  indigenous people -- Crimean Tatars -- have been hopelessly  spoiled. The Tatars are today the only ethnopolitical force in  Crimea which is organized in support of the status quo regarding  relations with Ukraine. They supported Bagrov in the first and  second rounds and their leader, Mustafa Dzhemilev, has already  stated that Tatars will not regard Yuri Meshkov as their  President. The Tatars have repeatedly declared that they alone  have the legitimate right to national statehood in Crimea and  are prepared to resort to any means should the situation be  aggravated.    The results of Crimea's elections have already polarized  Ukrainian public opinion. Any extreme moves by Meshkov to  implement his programme are dangerous in this situation.    In the past two weeks Yuri Meshkov has publicly said that he  maintains excellent contacts with the Russian leadership at the  highest level. Though he gave no names, he stressed each time  that the question was not about President Yeltsin. In the  corridors, however, even names were mentioned --two days before  the elections Meshkov cited the following list of his  "contractors": Zhirinovsky, Communist Leader Zyuganov,  representatives from the Agrarian Party... Unless this is a  bluff, the politicians traditionally opposed to Boris Yeltsin  and his team have got at their disposal a button with the help  of which they can at any moment explode both Russian-Ukrainian  relations and the inner political situation in Russia.</p>

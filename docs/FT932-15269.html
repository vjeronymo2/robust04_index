			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Top ratings help CBS turnround CBS, which owns one of the three US television networks, yesterday posted a strong improvement in underlying first-quarter earnings, helped by a better business climate and the television network's ability to command higher advertising rates as it gains market share. Net income in the first three months of 1993 was Dollars 54.2m, or Dollars 3.50, compared with a net loss of Dollars 64m, or Dollars 4.18, a year ago. During the latest quarter, earnings benefited from a pre-tax gain of Dollars 19.2m on the sale of some marketable securities. A year ago, CBS took a non-cash post-tax charge of Dollars 81.5m, or Dollars 5.32, for the adoption of new accounting standards. The absence of the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl from CBS's winter programming resulted in a 19 per cent decline in sales in the quarter to Dollars 878.9m from Dollars 1.08bn. However, the sales gains from the 1992 special event sports broadcasts were largely offset by high rights fees and related production and promotion costs. CBS television, which languished for many years as the third-rated US network, is starting to benefit from its relatively new-found place at the head of the ratings table. Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and chief executive, said: 'CBS has just begun to capitalise both on its status as the nation's top-rated television network and on its efforts to carefully contain costs'. During the 1993 quarter, the television network benefited from improved unit pricing and operating income in prime time and daytime entertainment and news. 'The network's earnings also benefited from a shift in its programming mix, airing more entertainment and news programmes and fewer special-event sports programmes,' said Mr Tisch. Advertising in New York and Los Angeles was weak in the 1993 quarter because of sluggish regional economies. On Wall Street, shares in CBS climbed Dollars 6 7/8 to a 52-week high of Dollars 236 7/8 before the close. CBS recently agreed to remain headquartered in Manhattan after it was offered about Dollars 37.5m in city and state tax incentives and Dollars 12.2m in energy savings. In exchange, CBS has agreed to invest more than Dollars 300m in building improvements, equipment and new technologies for broadcasting and production.</p>

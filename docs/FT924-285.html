			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Letter: Endless disputes in sight if British Rail is broken up Sir, Most transport professionals would agree with one conclusion in your editorial 'Privatising British Rail' (December 22). Lack of investment and continual government interference must change and a more enterprising culture must be adopted. However, your endorsement of government plans to separate responsibility for track and signalling from that of running trains shows a lack of understanding of how the railway business is conducted. Unless all elements are managed as a whole there will be endless disputes about responsibility for delays and disruption, with lawyers involved at every trip and turn. You say that separating track infrastructure from the provision of services is the way of the future in Europe, quoting Sweden as having successfully implemented this policy. You omit to say that vast sums of public money are being spent on upgrading the Swedish railways or that these railways are lightly used by our standards. In Sweden only about 25 per cent of the costs of maintaining railway infrastructure are contributed by train operators under a policy which sets out to equate the terms of competition between road and rail. You ignore the fact that, under the terms of the White Paper in Britain, railway operators will have to pay the full costs of using infrastructure, including a return on capital employed, a policy which is likely to drive most freight off our railways. You might have looked at Japan where the railways have been divided into six regional companies embracing train operations and track. These publicly-owned companies are making great financial progress prior to intended privatisation. The same policy could be adopted in Britain. Finally, you might have drawn attention to the lack of any transport policy framework in Britain within which the railways are to fit. Sweden, the Netherlands, France and Germany have such frameworks. Bill Bradshaw, Centre for Socio-Legal Studies, Wolfson College, Oxford</p>

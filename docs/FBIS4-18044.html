			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Rustam Arifdzhanov report: "Yet Another Oil Company Lowers </F> Its Prices In Order To Increase Its Survival Chances"]    [Excerpts] The second largest Russian oil company --  "Yukos" -- has decided to lower its prices of petroleum products  for Central Russian farmers until 15 June. This decision was  made following a tour of eight Russian agrarian oblasts by the  company's president, Sergey Muravlenko. The necessary quantity  of petroleum products for the sowing campaign has already been  dispatched to the regions.    There is quite a serious subtext to this -- at first sight,  paradoxical and populist -- decision. Around one month ago  another oil giant -- "Lukoyl" -- resorted to the same step,  lowering its prices for three months. The oil companies'  decision is in many ways to be explained by the nonpayments  crisis. The consumer debt to "YUKOS" already amounts to more  than 500 billion rubles. The three biggest debtors are  agrarians, metallurgical workers, and the military-industrial  complex. [passage omitted]    Contracts have been signed with agrarians on barter exchange  -- petroleum products for agricultural produce. Companies  require at least some kind of guarantee that their product will  be paid for. Otherwise, if there is a repeat of last year's  nonpayments crisis, the oil industry will be ruined.    The threat of the breakup or reorganization of companies is  compeling them to adopt various counter tactics. The spring  price reductions are unexpected only at first glance. In the  face of the threat of a return to the times of state monopoly  and state control, oil companies are showing that the market  mechanism allows one to act swiftly and flexibly in the oil  industry too.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Full Text" of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's Letter to </F> King Sihanouk -- date not given]    [Text] May I beg your Majesty's forgiveness for any  possible inappropriate expressions that might occur in my letter  and the inconveniences it created to Your Majesty while you are  on your medical treatment.    I was forced by the current situation to write this letter  which is intended on the one hand to make clarification on a  number of issues, and on the other hand to solicit Your  Majesty's advice on some issues that I have to address, namely  the solution to be brought to the Khmer Rouge problem and the  issue of conferring state power to Your Majesty.    Regarding the solution to the Khmer Rouge problem, so far  some allegations have been made that my humble person as well as  Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, especially my humbleself  were the obstacle to any accommodation with the Khmer Rouge,  moaning that "Hun Sen is the hardliner opposed to any  accommodation with the Khmer Rouge."    In this regard, I could not really understand, because I  have  done nothing but conforming myself to the Constitution which  resulted from the elections. Concerning the Khmer Rouge problem,  it is well known that the Khmer Rouge are opposed to the Paris  Agreements, to the elections, to the Constitution, and to the  elected Royal Government.    Now, they oppose Your Majesty's initiative of national  reconciliation starting with the ceasefire. They even dare to  demand that a new government be formed which is tantamount to  the dissolution of the legitimate institutions resulting from  the elections and to nullifying all the efforts jointly exerted  by the whole Cambodian people and the international community in  implementing the Paris Agreements.    They are continuing this warfare, the assassination of  innocent people, committing untold tragedies to the nation and  to the people and yet the Khmer Rouge could get away with it and  everything was blamed on Ranariddh-Hun Sen who are only  exercising their legal obligations of protecting the people.    Some people said that the Royal Government refused to  accommodate because it preferred the military option to destroy  the Khmer Rouge. In this regard, allow me to say, Your Majesty,  that for the moment, the Royal Government has no choice. The two  rounds of Round Table (peace-talks) failed because of the Khmer  Rouge. May I also inform Your Majesty that my humble person, Hun  Sen, now is a little bit different from the Hun Sen prior to the  Paris Agreements and from the post-election Hun Sen: then I had  two important options either to continue to fight or to seek a  solution by ways of the Paris Agreements, either not to accept  the election result and to rekindle the flame of war or to  accept the election results to avoid warfare and to create  conditions for national reconciliation.    But for the moment, the Khmer Rouge do not leave Samdech  Krompreah and myself with any option since the Khmer Rouge have  decided to opt for warfare against the nation and the  population. There are indeed two other options that I certainly  could not go along:    1. to accept the Khmer Rouge demands of dissolving the  National Assembly, the elected Royal Government and to form a  new government with the Khmer Rouge in it. Proceeding this way  is equivalent to a cool coup d'etat since even the Constitution  will have to be scrapped or suspended. I have no mandate to go  that far, but this is the prerogative of the National Assembly.  But in my capacity as an MP, I will certainly vote against such  a proposal because it constitutes an outrageous concession  tantamount to a legal coup d'etat to dissolve the Constitution,  to dismantle the National Assembly and the Royal Government  elected by the people. It is also a big blow to the achievement  of the UN operation in Cambodia just for the sake of exchanging  it with the participation of the genocidal group.    2. for the sake of avoiding combat initiated by the Khmer  Rouge's offensive, the Royal Government was forced to withdraw  from the areas where the Khmer Rouge aim to occupy. Doing so  would allow the Khmer Rouge to expand their control over the  territory and the population, and it will not be long before the  Khmer Rouge would control the whole of Cambodia. For me, the  above two options are impossible. But I don't know whether there  are any personalities who can accept the above two mandates. If  there are, they should come out to take my position and carry  out these tasks, which is better than to go about fomenting  social unrest.    Your Majesty,    There were times when I did not want to hear allegations  that  "Hun Sen was the obstacle to accommodation with the Khmer  Rouge," I picked up my pen and wrote my resignation, so as to  make way for the Khmer Rouge easy return. But this act of mine  would have resulted in the disappointment among the population  and would provide a good opportunity for Khmer Rouge genocidal  group, pro-Khmer Rouge group, Khmer Rouge sympathizers and those  who use the Khmer Rouge as counterweight to achieve their  objectives, to be satisfied as they no longer need to destroy  the achievement of the Paris Agreements to come to power  illegally.    After having enough said of the Khmer Rouge problem, may I  now turn to the issue of conferring the state power to Your  Majesty.    On this issue, I prefer not to make any judgment because I  have received two different sets of information. The first one  directly from Your Majesty on the morning of May 18, 1994 when  Samdech Chea Sim and myself accompanied Your Majesty and Samdech  Preah Mohesei from the Royal Palace to Pochentong Airport. Your  Majesty mentioned that "there are people who accuse me of  wanting to take power. But I am too old, what do I want the  power for? And the Constitution provides that the King reigns  but does not govern."    Successive information received also proved that Your  Majesty  denied the allegations that Your Majesty wanted to resume power.    Another set of information was that Your Majesty needs to  take direct state power, there was even an attempt to foment a  manifestation in support of the request to confer the power to  Your Majesty. As the first hand information and the relayed one  were so different that I did not pay much attention. But on the  evening of June 17, 1994,I was deeply shaken by the article  published in the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW on June 23, 1994  entitled "Cambodia -- Last Act" written by Nate Thayer,  supposedly an interview with Your Majesty.    According to this article, I have become another obstacle on  the way of conferring the power to Your Majesty. I do not know  whether those were words of Your Majesty or whether the author  creates the story himself.    With regard this issue, whether Your Majesty did say so or  whether the reporter did not write so, may I be allowed to  submit to Your Majesty as follows my thought and my feelings.    Whatever the turn of the political situation and more than  half of life, I have always been following Your Majesty. My  decision to go into the maquis on April 14, 1970 would not have  been made then if was not for Your Majesty because then I had  many options to choose from: to be a student, to be a farmer, to  be a worker or to be a businessman etc... Through various  situations, whether I hold the positions of a Minister, Deputy  Prime Minister or Prime Minister, I always believe that the best  way to put an end to the war was a political solution which  would give an opportunity for Your Majesty to return and to lead  the country. I have made it to become a reality.    Your Majesty and Samdech Preah Mohesei as well as the Royal  Family and the non-communist resistant forces certainly have not  yet been informed of all the hardships I have gone through in  the search for a political solution in Cambodia. I had to face  untold dangers so as to achieve this enormous and historical  task. The influence of leaders of some countries exerted upon me  to seek a red resolution which would have denied the roles to be  played by Your Majesty and the non-communist resistant forces  and which I did not accept was another kind of danger, which I  would not reveal their names right now but would mention in the  book to be published later on.    This brief mention of history does not mean that I want to  take credit for it but just to show Your Majesty of what I have  done for the nation and in following Your Majesty. On June 13  1994, Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut came to report to me about  his trip to Europe. He also proposed for my consideration the  issue of conferring the power to Your Majesty. To Prince  Kromkhun, I expressed my view that no one has any doubt about  the King who is our Father.    The National Assembly had conferred full power and special  power to Your Majesty on June 14, 1993 with which Your Majesty  was able to form a Provisional Government which was not at all  provided for in the Paris Agreements and which led us to unite  to produce a Constitution to be respected by everyone. Any  change or amendment to the Constitution is of the mandate of the  National Assembly. I further told Prince Kromkhun that it is not  sure that the National Assembly would support any change of the  Constitution. Moreover, Article 17 of the Constitution which  mentioned that the King reigns but does not govern prohibits any  change of it. On that occasion, I also shared with Prince  Kromkhun my worries about the rumour saying that Your Majesty  wanted to take power but Your Majesty always denied this rumour.  Where is the truth? Is it a Khmer Rouge's trick to dismantle the  Royal Government and to create a new one by exploiting Your  Majesty's name?    Your Majesty,    I was very shaken when I read the REVIEW's article which  mentioned that "Sihanouk acknowledged that his bid for power  would be doomed without the acquiescence of Hun Sen and the CPP  [Cambodian People's Party] ... because I do not want to shed  blood to fight for a secession led by Hun Sen... unless I have  the assurance that Hun Sen and his party will join me in my  government."    This paragraph is very serious vis-a-vis myself because it  implies that a war might break out not by the Khmer Rouge but by  my humble person. Now, a group of people in Phnom Penh who are  unscrupulously greedy of power are using this article to poison  the atmosphere going so far as telling Thai businessmen not to  work with the current government because it is about to collapse  and to wait to work with the new government. It is very funny  because the Khmer story is like a kid's game since a press  article may be able to dissolve or to form a government. This is  too simple and the Constitution seems to be worthless. Everyone  is boasting of pro-liberal democracy but instead is violating  the nation's Constitution. What do they really want,  dictatorship or democracy?    May I take this opportunity to submit to Your Majesty that  the question of dismantling the incumbent Government and  creating a new one, of appointing anyone as Prime Minister,  Deputy Prime Minister, does not depend on me but rather on the  Constitution and the National Assembly. I can walk out and led  Khieu Samphan to replace me if it is allowed by the  Constitution, if there is a support in the National Assembly and  if it is necessitated by national interest. Therefore, there is  no need to fear that I might wage a secessionist war. What I  need right now is a truth whether Your Majesty really wanted to  take power as the Prime Minister as it has been published in the  media, so that I might assess according to the real fact.    Your Majesty,    I am very worried by the length of my letter and by its  content. If I did not write and tell Your Majesty the truth and  to seek the truth, confusion would prevail. I know very well  that a number of people will accuse me of arrogance, daring to  write to His Majesty the King. But Your Majesty is well aware  that I am not a reserved person and not a "yes-man". Your  Majesty used to say that Hun Sen is like Your Majesty.  Specially, during the dinner on May 27, 1994, Your Majesty said  that: "Samdech Hun Sen is not my son but he is like me:  unreserved". This is my natural character of frankness.    I am writing this letter to request Your Majesty's advice  with regard to the above-mentioned issues. As far as the  solution to the Khmer Rouge is concerned, how can I and the  Royal Government address this problem? How to address the  rumours surrounding the question of conferring the power to Your  Majesty? I am awaiting Your Majesty's noble advice for further  action.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Belarussian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich has  pessimistically assessed the outcome of the CIS Premiers session  in Moscow on Friday.    One of the things he did not like was that instead of the  planned signing of papers on the creation of an inter-state  economics committee to coordinate economic development in the  CIS states, an "amorphous" body was set up at the  Coordinative-Consultative Committee -- an economic integration  commission with purely consultative functions.    Kebich argues that without an inter-state economic committee  the CIS Economic Union will never work.    He told Interfax that a number of Commonwealth states had  wished to follow the example of Russia and Belarus and join the  ruble zone. According to him, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and  possibly Armenia are virtually ready for that.    In his opinion, other Commonwealth countries would like to  join but are put off by the need to follow the Belarus example  of "harmonizing their legislations with Russian laws." Belarus  has taken two years for that, he added.</p>

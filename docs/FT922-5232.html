			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Binding the moral and political wounds: Italy's new president will seek urgent action The cartoonists have lost no time in poking fun at Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Italy's new president, picking on his publicly professed Catholic faith and his authoritarian manner. The 73-year-old head of state was being depicted as an Ayatollah within 24 hours of his inauguration last week. The humour of the cartoonists has brought into sharp relief the personality of the new president, and the mood of Italy. The country is crying out for leadership - both political and moral. Mr Scalfaro, within the limits of his presidential power, wants to provide it. The political parties wasted the whole of 1991 rehearsing for general elections, which in the end were held this April. A large protest vote further fragmented the political parties and rendered unworkable an already discredited system of coalition government. The difficulties of forming a new government risk leaving Italy rudderless - precisely when decisions are most needed. The deteriorating state of the country's public finances demands urgent and unpopular corrective measures. Otherwise, as Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, pointed out at the weekend, Italy's economy will never meet the minimum requirements for convergence with its main European Community partners. In the past three months, a moral dimension has also emerged on two fronts. Continuous revelations in the municipal corruption scandal in Milan have angered a nation seemingly immune to tales of pork-barrel politics. Magistrates are uncovering a sophisticated carve-up of commissions on public contracts among all the main political parties, including the self-professed 'clean' former-Communist party of the democratic left (PDS). Mr Scalfaro partly owes his compromise candidature for the presidency to his being seen as a figure untainted by corruption. The second front is organised crime. The brutal Mafia assassination of Mr Giovanni Falcone, Italy's leading anti-Mafia magistrate, nine days ago, was a direct challenge to the state. It was not just the manner of the killing - blowing up his three-car convoy near Palermo with a ton of explosives. Mr Falcone was the most heavily guarded official, and symbolised the fight against organised crime, which is more powerful today than at any time since the Second World War. At least part of the explanation for the Mafia's survival is seen in the way politicians have been willing to use organised crime and vice versa, to their mutual benefit. Against this bleak backdrop, Mr Scalfaro could prove the benign Ayatollah and promote change. On his inauguration, he took the unprecedented step of 'inviting' parliament to form a commission to study proposals for an urgent overhaul of the constitution. He also told the military a large parade in Rome next weekend was inappropriate. The parade has been cancelled, even though the review stands were already erected. This week may provide further clues to how Mr Scalfaro sees his role, when he begins consultations to form a new government. Traditionally, the head of state's right to invite someone to form a government has been treated as a formality. The real power has lain with the parliamentary parties, who have put the president in his job anyway. However, this does not preclude the president from knocking heads together or acting as an arbiter. Mr Scalfaro's long parliamentary experience, combined with his credentials as an independent- minded Christian Democrat, backed by the second largest party, the PDS, permit him the role of referee  -especially when the parties are so weak. Before the general elections, the main political parties believed the next government would be formed by a continuation of the Christian Democrat-Socialist alliance, which had kept the Communists at bay for years. These two parties, with their minor allies, the Liberals and Social Democrats, planned to continue their carve-up of power, with Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, as prime minister, and probably Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing premier, being rewarded with the presidency. The poor showing of the Christian Democrats and the Socialists in the elections ended the prospect of the outgoing four-party coalition forming the next government. Although the coalition retains a narrow majority in parliament, it lacks the credibility to govern on its own, and its leaders' reputations have been damaged by the failure to read the public demand for reform. The Christian Democrats are in disarray after the April elections - highlighted by the inability of the party to rally to support Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the party's secretary, as the preferred presidential candidate. His resignation, after failing to gain sufficient backing for his presidential bid, hastens a generational change, and strains to the limit the party's capacity to juggle with at least seven different factions. The Socialists have been gravely damaged for their perceived involvement as the principal actors in the Milan corruption scandal. Milan magistrates allege that, at the highest level in the municipality, there was an arrangement whereby bids for big construction contracts were rigged and then commissions were handed out on the basis of the quota of votes each party gathered in the elections. The split went allegedly 27 per cent to the Socialists, 20 per cent each to the Christian Democrats and the PDS, and the remainder to the smaller parties. The scandal has played into the hands of the populist Lombard League, the electoral platform of which was directed against corrupt party politics. But, more generally, the prestige of the parties has been weakened and they are seen as the prime culprits for encouraging an abuse of political patronage which, in turn, has weighed on the size of the huge public sector deficit. To be credible, the next government has to take account of this deep public unease over the perversion of the current political system, whereby state and party interests have become intertwined. But the pressure for change is coming most directly from Brussels. The EC has been issuing increasingly impatient diktats to bring the economy into line with the Maastricht summit's terms. On the central criteria of inflation levels, interest rates, debt and public sector deficit, the Italian performance is increasingly distant from that of its main EC partners. The public sector deficit is more than 10.5 per cent of gross domestic product, debt is close to 105 per cent of GDP, and retail price inflation is an annual 5.8 per cent. The 1992 budget is so overspent and underfunded that the EC has proposed the rapid introduction of an austerity package. The budget is heading for a deficit of at least L165,000bn (Pounds 74.5bn) instead of the L128,000bn agreed with the EC. The politicians no longer have the excuse of an electoral timetable to duck action. The plight of the economy could well dictate the formation of a 'technical' government, with the limited task of economic stabilisation and introducing political reforms to alter the unworkable system of proportional representation. President Scalfaro is likely to stake his reputation on persuading the politicians to agree as soon as possible.</p>

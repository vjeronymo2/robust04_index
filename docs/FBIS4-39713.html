			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev, 9 Jun -- The Dniester Republic leaders  have accused the Moldovan leadership of dragging out the talks  on a settlement to the Dniester region issue, said a statement  issued today in Tiraspol by the Dniester Republic president's  and government's press service. The document claims that "the  attempts made by Tiraspol to speed up the negotiation process,  which was started with Russia's mediation, has again run into a  silent blockade by Moldova, and President Mircea Snegur has in  fact withdrawn from further talks."    In this regard Igor Smirnov, head of the Dniester Republic,  has appealed to Ambassador Vladlen Vasev, plenipotentiary envoy  of the Russian president, to exert all his influence on Mircea  Snegur. The statement also underlines that the inhabitants of  the left bank of the Dniester river have postively assessed the  joint statement by the leaders of Moldova and the Dniester  Republic on finding a settlement to the aftermath of the armed  conflict, which was signed at the end of April.    At a time when President Igor Smirnov is complaining about  the lack of progress at the talks, State Secretary Valeriy  Litskiy, chief coordinator at the talks from the Tiraspol side,  discussed today with the CSCE mission in Moldova prospects of  resuming the dialogue. They agreed that the talks could be  continued in the near future following the return to Kishinev of  Richard Samuel, head of the CSCE mission. The arrival of  Vladlen Vasev, the special Russian envoy, is also expected then.</p>

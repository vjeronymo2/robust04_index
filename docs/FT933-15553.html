			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind moves to reassure suppliers MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, defence secretary, tried yesterday to soothe defence manufacturers' concerns about recent equipment cuts by indicating that the government would give preference where possible to British contractors. 'There is always a bias towards a national supplier,' he said. Mr Rifkind, answering questions after a speech on the defence programme to the Royal United Services Institute in London, said it was important for Britain to have an industry that could 'manufacture as much as possible' to meet the country's military needs. His remarks contrasted with the strong emphasis placed on international competition for defence orders during Sir Peter Levene's period as chief of defence procurement from 1985 to 1991. Defence equipment remains outside the scope of the European single market. Mr Rifkind said the Ministry of Defence, with a Pounds 9bn annual procurement budget, was by far the largest single client British industry had or was ever likely to have. UK arms manufacturers had also, with MoD support, cornered 20 per cent of the world market last year, more than any other country except the US. 'I can't think of any other part of our industry which has a performance remotely comparable to that,' he said. Mr Rifkind also took issue with his former armed forces minister, Mr Archie Hamilton, who argued at the weekend for a reduction in the number of troops in Northern Ireland. Mr Rifkind promised that the government would provide 'whatever is needed' to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary and that Northern Ireland would take priority over other missions such as UN deployments. There are more than 19,100 soldiers in the province, including the locally recruited Royal Irish Regiment. Meanwhile, officials disclosed that the British army might move part of its training to North Africa because of the loss of its main training area in Germany and pressure from environmentalist lobbies in the UK.</p>

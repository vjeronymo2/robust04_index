			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Invergordon resists latest tilt from Whyte &amp; Mackay A RENEWED attempt by Whyte &amp; Mackay, the UK drinks subsidiary of American Brands, to gain control of Invergordon Distillers has been rebuffed. Fleming Investment Management, which has a 13.6 per cent stake in Invergordon, is understood to have rejected an offer of 300p a share - 275p cash and a 25p dividend. Whyte &amp; Mackay was left with 41 per cent of Invergordon after an unsuccessful takeover bid two years ago. It launched that bid at 225p a share and raised the offer to a final 275p a share. Another Invergordon shareholder said yesterday that it considered the new approach inadequate. 'If Whyte &amp; Mackay thinks it can come back after two years and take advantage of a temporary dip in Invergordon's share price, it should think again.' A price of 300p, the shareholder added, did not reflect the value of Invergordon, which had doubled net assets to Pounds 64m and reduced borrowings from Pounds 46m to Pounds 22m since its flotation three years ago. Invergordon's share price closed 2p higher at 268p yesterday. The shares have fallen from 295p since the company last month reported a 23 per cent fall in first-half profits to Pounds 11.3m. It was the first setback in nearly a decade of uninterrupted growth. As analysts downgraded forecasts of full-year profits to Pounds 27m from last year's Pounds 32m, there was widespread speculation that Whyte &amp; Mackay would make a further bid to take over the company before the end of this year. Robert Fleming, the investment house, which is Invergordon's financial adviser as well as a leading shareholder, played a crucial role in the rejection of Whyte &amp; Mackay's bid in 1991. The deaf ear that its investment management arm has now turned to Whyte &amp; Mackay's further advances indicates that the institutional shareholders who supported Invergordon's management then have no intention of giving way cheaply. The institutions include Norwich Union, the Prudential and Legal &amp; General. Invergordon, one of the few remaining independent Scotch whisky distillers, supplies about a quarter of the own-label brands to UK supermarkets, as well as marketing Cluny, Findlater and Isle of Jura whiskies.</p>

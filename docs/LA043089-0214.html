			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> A candlelight vigil will be held tonight in Laguna Beach in support of  preserving Laguna Canyon. The last of three nightly events is presented by  Light Around the World and will start at midnight on Main Beach in Laguna. The  purpose of the event is to support preservation and to protest any future  development of Laguna Canyon. The vigil will feature music, speakers and silent  meditation.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, construction is scheduled to begin Monday on a planned 600-foot  mural along Laguna Canyon Road, made from more than 40,000 snapshots.  Spearheaded by photographers Jerry Burchfield and Mark Chamberlain, the project  is named "The Tell" (the archeological term for a mound of buried artifacts)  and is part of a larger effort to document changes in the canyon during a time  of heavy development.  </P></p>

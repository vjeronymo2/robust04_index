			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPPORT FOR CRISIS PREGNANCIES  </P> <P> Hunnicutt's letter makes judgmental statements as to compassion shown by  pro-lifers outside the delivery room.  </P> <P> She specifically stated how wonderful it would be if the demonstrators would  adopt unwanted children, etc. My wife and I and three children, including two  adopted twin boys, now Eagle Scouts, stood in that line. Our daughter adopted  three unwanted, children, two of which came from druggie mothers. Our  sister-in-law and husband and other members of our expanded family have adopted  five others. Let Hunnicutt be less judgmental. Let her rather talk by the  example she has set in doing any of the things she judges us pro-lifers to have  been remiss in doing.  </P> <P> GRANT A.

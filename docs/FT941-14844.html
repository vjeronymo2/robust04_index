			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tea industry believes record crop gathered in 1993 Industry estimates put India's 1993 tea output at an all-time high of over 750m kg, compared with 703.9m in 1992, when all major tea growing countries suffered major setbacks. Aided by favourable weather in every production centre, India, according to the country's Tea Board, had harvested a crop of 715m kg by the end of November, up 49m kg over the corresponding period of the previous year. 'Since the weather in December was quite good, the production last month must have been more than 40m kg. Generally, India produces around 40m kg of tea in December,' said Mr HM Parekh, chairman of J. Thomas, India's biggest tea broking firm. Mr HP Barooah, chairman of Indian Tea Association, agreed with the production estimate. While the two south Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala had made a significant contribution to the improvement in production, Assam and West Bengal in the north had recorded handsome gains. 'Not only had India produced a record quantity of tea, but there also had been an improvement in the quality of tea grown in the north Indian gardens. It is time the south Indian tea estates gave attention to the quality aspect,' said Mr Parekh. Almost the extra production in 1993 had been in the form of CTC (cut, tear and curl) tea, for which demand is growing steadily both within and outside the country. Despite the marked improvement in production, said Mr Parekh, the industry realised much better prices for all kinds of teas last year. At the Calcutta auction, CTC tea fetched an average price of Rs52.54 (Pounds 1.12) a kilogram, up from Rs41.83 in 1992. At Rs55.76 a kilogram, orthodox tea was dearer by Rs12.73. The Darjeeling tea price rose by nearly Rs17 to Rs94.52 a kilogram. As a result, the majority of tea companies earned handsome profits during 1993. According to industry officials, the strong rise in domestic demand, particularly for quality tea, and the improvement in exports contributed to the rise in auction prices. 'We think, India's tea export last year rose to about 200m kg from 173m kg. This happened as the Commonwealth of Independent States stepped up its purchase by 30m kg to 80m kg. But less Indian tea had been shipped to the UK,' said Mr Parekh. While the export of tea to Poland had been maintained at 14.5m kg, shipments to Egypt and Iran had declined. The United Arab Emirates, however, had bought more. It is too early for the industry officials to make any forecast for the current year's tea crop as plucking in north India does not get fully into gear until March. They are, however, worried that north India had not received any rains since October. 'North India must receive a few showers now for the March tea production to be good,' they said.</p>

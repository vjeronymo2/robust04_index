			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: NEC says it is in talks over taking stake in Bull NEC, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday agreed it was taking part in negotiations with Groupe Bull of France which could lead to NEC holding a stake in the state-owned computer manufacturer and a seat on the main board. NEC's acceptance of its involvement in talks implies it approves a profound restructuring plan prepared by Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull chief executive, designed to eliminate Bull's huge losses and return the company to profitability within three years. The plan involves sweeping away the company's untidy and inefficient structure and replacing it with a global operation comprising separate operational divisions handling manufacture and marketing for different regions. The Japanese company refused to comment on speculation that the stake could be as much as 10 per cent. The Japanese manufacturer supplies the loss-making French computer maker with large mainframe computers and has extensive links with it. Groupe Bull is NEC's principal marketing conduit to the West for its large machines. Talks have been going on for some months with a view to resolving the future of NEC's 15 per cent stake in Bull HN, a company set up in 1987 in which Groupe Bull held a 72.2 stake, NEC, 15 per cent and Honeywell of the US 12.8 per cent. Honeywell recently marked its final retreat from the computer business by selling its stake in Bull HN to Groupe Bull for an undisclosed sum. The success of Mr Lorentz' strategy depends on NEC's agreement to redeploying its stake in Bull HN into Groupe Bull. Senior government officials said Groupe Bull's losses - last year they amounted to some Pounds 700m (Dollars 1.2bn) - and its need for a foreign partner were big factors behind the Paris administration's decision early this month to allow private companies to take minority stakes in state-owned ones. The government would be relieved, sources suggest, to see Bull supported by such a strong partner as NEC. Observers had long speculated that Bull's problems would be the final element to force the government to loosen President Francois Mitterrand's three-year-old freeze on nationalisations and privatisations. This relaxation in the government's hold on state industry comes in the form of a decree, which paves the way for NEC to take a shareholding in Groupe Bull, as well as easing the way for foreign alliances currently being negotiated by two state banks.</p>

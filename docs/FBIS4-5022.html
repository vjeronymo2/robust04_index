			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear Listeners: The Democratic Voice of Burma [DVB]  inquired by telephone about the proposed peace talks today  between the KNU [Karen National Union] and the SLORC [State Law  and Order Restoration Council] as mentioned in today's BANGKOK  POST with a KNU responsible official. The KNU official  responded by saying the news is untrue. Moreover, the KNU  Central Committee's seven-point announcement of 29 March  included the following important factors concerning the  negotiations.    Since the KNU wants genuine peace, it has vowed to begin the  peace process given any opportunity. The KNU has already agreed  to hold separate talks with the SLORC. The KNU also proposed  the talks be held at a neutral place agreed upon by both parties  in order to hold free and frank talks, but the SLORC has not yet  given any reply. The announcement said current events have  indicated that political problems cannot be solved politically.    The KNU also urged the three following points to various  persons and organizations inside and outside the country. The  KNU will continue its efforts to hold separate talks with the  SLORC. It will also strive relentlessly to achieve a genuine  and stable peace by solving political problems politically. And  it will call a general congress of all political forces from  among the populace and personnel and organizations from overseas  in order to solve political problems politically. The KNU  believes only then genuine and stable peace and democracy can be  achieved nationwide.</p>

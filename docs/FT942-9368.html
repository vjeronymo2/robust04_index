			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / US Senate leaders back sanctions against N Korea The US Senate's two highest-ranking lawmakers, responding to North Korea's latest apparent disregard of international nuclear conventions, yesterday said they backed the imposition of economic sanctions on the Pyongyang government, AP adds from Washington. 'I believe that we cannot tolerate the actions that are occurring without any response at all,' said Senate majority leader Mr George Mitchell. He called economic sanctions 'the most prudent and likely effective response at the current time.' 'We've been in this cat-and-mouse game with North Korea now for about the last 15 months,' said Senate minority leader Mr Bob Dole, of the opposition Republicans, who appeared with Mr Mitchell on NBC's Meet the Press. He said he still hoped the issue of North Korean stonewalling over its reported nuclear weapons program could be resolved. 'But failing that, I think sanctions should be imposed.' Both Mr Mitchell and Mr Dole ruled out any immediate pre-emptive military strike on North Korea. But Mitchell said economic sanctions should be pushed despite North Korean threats and even if China, one of North Korea's few allies, objected.</p>

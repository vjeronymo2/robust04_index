			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Letter: The route round the late-payment cycle Sir, We are constantly hearing about how the late payment of debts is, supposedly, causing the downfall of many a business, and I dare say this is a factor in the appalling company-failure statistics. Nevertheless, the reality is that most trading companies selling on credit to other businesses should never go down because of late payment of debt. The reason is the existence in the financial markets of invoice discounting and factoring products. By advancing to the company up to 80 per cent of invoice value (including VAT) as soon as it is raised - the balance reverting after collection - the greater part of the debt is properly funded at the outset, enabling working capital to be replenished and the business cycle to continue. Brian Sumner, managing director, Causeway Invoice Discounting Company, 123 St Ann's Square, Manchester M2 7HS</p>

Narasimha Rao, today began the last leg of his Germany visit.  Flying into Berlin from Bonn in a German Government plane, the  Prime Minister's major programme for the day was a meeting with  the German President, Mr. Richard von Weizsacker. Mr Rao also  had a luncheon meeting with eminent Indologists here, when a  number of issues to facilitate studies on India were brought to  the notice of the Prime Minister.    With Mr. Weizsacker, the discussions were general in nature,  it being basically a courtesy call. The German President is well  acquainted with India, having been there in 1991. Mr. Weizsacker  was in India at the height of its political crisis when the  minority Chandra Shekar Government was in power and its  continuance in office was under doubt. This aspect was  highlighted by the German authorities on many occasions as a  measure of their commitment to maintain high political relations  with India, irrespective of the Government in power.    In fact, the importance that Germany attaches to India has  been confirmed to the Prime Minister not only by the present  Government in Bonn, but by the host of Opposition leaders as  well, who called on Mr. Rao during his two-day stay in Bonn.  <H5>  `Asia policy' </H5>   The leaders of the coalition parties in the present  Government, as well as those from other political parties, have  also told Mr. Rao that the new "Asia policy" of Germany had a  national consensus and would be pursued by any Government that  comes to power after the federal elections in October this year.  The "Asia policy" of Germany focuses on the entire Asian region  as the priority area for trade and economic concentration as  well as for high political contacts. Almost all the countries of  Asia have been included in the priority list, including India  and Pakistan, but three countries have been identified for  intensive co-operation--China, Japan and India.    Parallel meetings conducted by the members of the Prime  Ministerial delegation had also indicated that the German  Government has sent out the signal to its industrialists that  India is now a priority area for investment and that  concentration should begin. The process has been facilitated by  the fact that just a few days before Mr. Rao's visit, the  Government of India relied to a detailed memorandum that was  submitted by the German Chancellor, Mr. Helmut Kohl, after his  return from India in February last year. This memorandum listed  out the various irritants that were obstructing German  investment in India and the response of the Government of India  had been sought to the points raised.    The proposals submitted by the Germans were broadly divided  into six categories covering the financial sector, the  pharmaceutical and chemical industry, the power sector,  telecommunications, air traffic and general issues. The Indian  response too has been fairly detailed with areas listed out  where decisions have already been taken. The pending areas  include liberalisation of the pharmaceutical and chemical  industry, removal of phased manufacturing programme obligations  for units established prior to the new industrial policy,  increase in the prescribed payment limits for automatic  approvals of technical collaborations, amendments to the  Industrial Disputes Act and removal of the condition that  foreign equity should cover the foreign exchange requirement for  import of capital goods under the automatic approval category.    The Government has also indicated that it is not in a  position to agree to the suggestion for a negative list of  imports, an uniform industrial policy in all the States,  abolition of octroi and automatic adoption of environmental  standards prescribed in advanced countries.  <H5>  Joint Ventures </H5>   Individual interactions between the Prime Minister and chief  executive officesr of multinational corporations too have  confirmed that German industry was now positive about investment  in India. For instance, the representative of Mercedes Benz said  that a passenger car project was being finalised with the Tata  group which would make the project one of the major investments  by Benz in India. Similarly, the Siemens group will be setting  up two power projects in India--one at Jayamkondan with a  capacity of 1,500 MW [megawatts] and another at Gandhar of 600  MW capacity. Another multinational, BASF is setting up a  chemicals factory in Mangalore for the manufacture of dyestuff.</p>

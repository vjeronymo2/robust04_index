			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Cutting down on hot air The owners of one large London office building reduced their gas consumption by two-thirds over a three year period when they modernised their energy management system. Many businesses could make similar savings if they improved the quality of their energy controls, according to a new handbook.* Quadrant House, headquarters of the Reed Publishing Group, was a speculative, air-conditioned office building, completed in 1980. Impressive savings in energy use and costs were achieved after energy management was contracted out to Matthew Hall. Under the arrangement, the contractor could invest its own time and money to make savings and share the benefits with the client. Gas consumption was reduced by better control of the central air handling plant and by eliminating the inefficient use of central boilers in summer by installing point-of-use heating of hot water for catering and washrooms. Just before the start of the contract in 1987, automatic lighting controls were fitted in the building and the banks of switches in corridors were replaced by local switches in each office. The improved plant and lighting management cut electricity use by 15 per cent, in spite of increased use of office equipment and the move to electric hot water heating in summer. Managements should start by questioning their own energy use and policies, the guide suggests. What is the cost of energy used in their offices? How does it compare with other similar buildings? When was energy use last surveyed? And has management implemented any efficiency measures? Technical assistance is available from a range of organisations providing energy consultancy and contract energy management. *Director's Guide to Energy Management. Institute of Directors.

			<p>The     appearance in Jerusalem of a new Palestinian newspaper  apparently intended to present the PLO leadership's viewpoint to  educated Palestinians reflects the leadership's concern to  maintain support in the occupied territories as the peace process  proceeds.  According to a report by Israel Television on 13  February, the English-language weekly The Jerusalem Times is  edited by Hanna Sinyurah, formerly editor of the daily Al-Fajr-  -until it closed last July--which generally supported Yasir  'Arafat and the mainstream PLO leadership.  The report cited  staff members of the paper as saying that the paper seeks "to  boost grass roots support for the political process" and that it  receives "ideological support," though not financial assistance,  from the PLO.

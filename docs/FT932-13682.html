			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Drug cultures Zeneca's pathfinder prospectus contains little to convince those sceptical of the benefits of demerger, but at least it will not have to support ICI's cyclical chemicals business through the next downturn. Cash transfered to ICI amounted to Pounds 421m last year, more than half Zeneca's cash inflow from trading and three times the amount paid over in 1990. Of course, Zeneca has to bear its share of ICI's dividend instead - Pounds 200m before the rights issue - but the new owners may prove less demanding in this respect than the old. Other promised benefits are more nebulous. Liberated from the influence of ICI's chemical engineers, Zeneca might create a corporate culture rooted in scientific research and marketing. But that will not deliver speedy results even if it can be achieved. There are restructuring benefits to look forward to, although these could equally be achieved within the larger group. The lion's share of last year's Pounds 195m exceptional charge is being spent reducing costs, notably in speciality chemicals and agrochemicals. Since Zeneca expects this expenditure to be repaid within two years, that should flow quickly to the bottom line. Given the uncertain outlook in Zeneca's main markets, that is just as well. Agrochemicals must live through another two or three lean years while the reform of the CAP reduces demand. Pressure on the drugs industry from governments shows no sign of easing. Mrs Hillary Clinton is now unlikely to reveal details of her crusade against healthcare costs before the rights issue is priced. The good run in pharmaceutical shares this week must be encouraging, but there have been plenty of false dawns during the great de-rating of the sector.</p>

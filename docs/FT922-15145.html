			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Tube line in Docklands is wins support LABOUR yesterday expressed support for extending London Underground's Jubilee Line to Docklands. But it stopped short of offering to provide funds if Olympia &amp; York, the property developer, failed to provide its share of the finance. O&amp;Y agreed under a proposal announced by the Department of Transport in 1989 to contribute Pounds 400m to the cost of the Pounds 1.3bn project, with the rest coming from the government. There is also thought to be a smaller contribution due from British Gas. Ms Joan Ruddock, a shadow transport minister, said: 'We are not seeking any variation of the proposals. The plan (for the extension) is there ready to start. We want O&amp;Y to come up with the money.' O&amp;Y, which is holding debt-restructuring talks with its banks, was originally expected to pay Pounds 40m towards the project on Tuesday. However, the Department of Transport has said that if the agreement with O&amp;Y about its contribution to the project's costs is not concluded before the election, the first payment will become due on the day the agreement is signed. Ms Ruddock declined to be drawn on reports that O&amp;Y and its banks might seek to reduce their contribution - a move that would almost certainly shift the onus to the Treasury. 'We still expect Olympia &amp; York or its bankers and British Gas to honour their financial commitments to this scheme,' she said. 'Clearly we want to see whatever is on offer and see how best the contract can be drawn up.' If O&amp;Y carried out its 'moral obligation' and came up with its share, there was 'no reason why the extension should not go ahead within the original timetable'. Last week Mr Wilfred Newton, chairman of London Transport, wrote to Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank - which is co-ordinating the UK restructuring of O&amp;Y - saying that O&amp;Y's obligations on the Jubilee Line should be met. 'You will, of course, be aware of the crucial importance of the Jubilee Line extension to the medium and long- term fortunes of Olympia &amp; York's development at Canary Wharf,' he wrote. Labour hopes O&amp;Y and its bankers will back the project because of the risk that failure to do so might jeopardise Canary Wharf.</p>

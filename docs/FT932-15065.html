			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Zeneca boosts its Quorn production ZENECA, the bioscience wing of Imperial Chemical Industries, is beefing up production of Quorn, its vegetarian low-fat protein food. Marlow Foods, Zeneca's wholly owned subsidiary, yesterday announced it is to invest Pounds 26.5m in new production facilities for its fake flesh food. The mycoprotein biotechnologically manufacturered product is based on the micro-fungus fusarium graminearum, a distant relation of mushrooms and truffles. The High-Wycombe-based company intends to build two plants, a fermenter at Belasis, Cleveland, and a processing facility at nearby Stokesley which should be fully running by 1995. ICI's UK capital expenditure last year was Pounds 328m. The plants will increase Marlow's Quorn capacity to 14,000 tonnes a year. Production is presently less than 7,000 tonnes a year, as a Pounds 37m plant at Stokesley announced in November 1991 is yet to come fully on stream. The group refused to give sales figures for Quorn. Two years ago, it claimed UK sales had increased fivefold from Pounds 3m to Pounds 15m over the previous five years. Mr David Barnes, Zeneca's chief executive, believes the product is a wild card in the company's hand, capable of eventually generating annual sales of anything between Pounds 200m and Pounds 2bn. Marlow is part of Zeneca's speciality division, which BZW, one of ICI's brokers, predicts will increase operating profits from Pounds 26m last year to Pounds 65m next year on sales up 9.9 per cent. BZW forecasts the division's profits at Pounds 136m by 1996. Quorn is commercially available in the UK, Ireland and Belgium. Zeneca said demand is outstripping supply, and advertising in the UK is being limited to the London area. The company aims to capture part of the growing vegetarian food market. Meat eating is declining in all UK social groups, according to the Vegetarian Society. More than 5.6m Britons, equivalent to about 10 per cent of the population, have eliminated red meat from their diets in recent years. Zeneca said market research suggested 19 per cent of UK households were willing to try Quorn, and 55 per cent of those were likely to repurchase. Most of the new capacity will be sold in the Netherlands and Germany and it will also be marketed in France and Italy. Pilot trials in Amsterdam and Munich suggests significant potential markets in those countries. Quorn is available as a fresh ingredient either minced or in chunks and escalopes. It is also supplied as ready-made casseroles and curries.</p>

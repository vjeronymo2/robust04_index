			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd: "A World </F> Role for a Great Power"]    [Text] A debate has been stirred up in Russia which  closely affects British interests. Not a debate generated by  the revanchist views of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy -- Russian  soldiers washing their boots in the Indian Ocean, nuclear  weapons dispatched with abandon. But a broader debate, about how  a country which used to be locked in superpower confrontation  should adapt to its changed circumstances, now that the Cold War  is over and the Soviet Union has collapsed.    Dean Acheson's pithy one-liner on post-imperial Britain --  losing an Empire without yet finding a role -- has echoes in  Moscow. It took Britain three decades to transform Empire into  Commonwealth. The Russians lost their empire in three years.    William Hayter was and remains an acute observer of the  scene. He was right when he wrote, in this paper some weeks ago,  that "Russia today is in the same position internationally as  Russia before the Bolshevik Revolution, a Great Power like  another, likely to play its part...in the concert of Europe."    It is natural that Russia should want to act as the great  power it is. But there are limits, too, to those actions. The  government today is aware of popular constituencies which were  less obvious before the December elections. There have been  changes in the cabinet, and the government now is working to  match those changes in political circumstances with its foreign  policy priorities. For all of us in the West, that debate  produces both problems and opportunities.    The Russian role in Bosnia has been valuable. A more  vigorous and lateral-minded policy brought Russian troops from  Croatia into Sarajevo. That buttressed the ultimatum which NATO  had the previous week issued to Serb militia in the hills around  the city. It reinforced the admirable efforts of General Sir  Michael Rose to secure the cease-fire around Sarajevo. Three  efforts -- one by the UN commander, one by NATO members, one by  the Russian Government -- together brought stability and a  certain amount of sanity to Sarajevo. The Russians, together  with the rest of us, could not achieve success at Gorazde. But,  looking ahead in Bosnia, we can see that the Russians are now an  essential part of the international effort.    There are other parts of Europe, however, where Russia's  activity appears dubious or unacceptable. I recently visited  Riga for talks with the three Baltic foreign ministers. Russian  troops have already left Lithuania. Russia has undertaken to  withdraw its troops from Latvia by the end of August, and was  quick to correct its mistaken announcement recently which gave a  different impression. The Russians are engaged in negotiations  with Estonia to withdraw their remaining 2,600 troops, having  also set a date for withdrawal: the end of August.    I recognise the importance to Moscow of the Russian  communities in the Baltic states. It is important that their  rights are respected. But there is a basic fact that overrides  all others. These countries are sovereign. They have a right,  as independent states, to ask any foreign troops to go. This is  not something to which conditions can be attached. So the  August withdrawal dates from Latvia and Estonia must be kept,  since that is what both countries wish. We accept that Russia  has interests, both economic and political, in other parts of  the former Soviet Union. But these countries, no less than the  Baltic states, are sovereign and independent. They, too, are  entitled to ask the Russians to withdraw their troops; Moldova  has already asked. Equally, they are free to enter into  bilateral agreements with Russia on the stationing of forces,  and other issues, should they wish to do so. The key is freedom  of choice. This is something the Russians must respect, and  something we shall watch very carefully.    Conflicts in the former Soviet Union are a legitimate  concern  for Russia, but also for Britain and the international community  as a whole. We welcome Russian participation in UN and CSCE  efforts to bring about peace settlements to the conflicts in the  Transcaucasus. There are no special "spheres of influence." We  need to work together on this. But the British Government will  not underwrite any proposal to deploy Russian forces in the  former Soviet Union unless we are sure that peacekeeping forces  will not turn into occupiers. Andrey Kozyrev (the Russian  foreign minister) and I have thought hard about and jointly  described in public the kind of ground rules which should  dictate our responses to this kind of situation. We agreed that  respect for the sovereignty and wishes of these newly  independent states is central to the whole issue. We agreed  that any peacekeeping operation needs a parallel peace process,  a clear mandate for the forces sent in, and a clear exit  strategy once the mandate has been fulfilled.    Between now and the Russian presidential elections in 1996,  Britain and Europe must find ways of accentuating the positive  side of the new Russian engagement in international affairs, as  in Bosnia. As part of that, we need to find ways of helping the  Russian Government to convince its own electorate that this is  the wise and right approach.    Russia's participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace would  make a big difference. We are keen that Russia should play a  full and active part in this initiative. There is clearly a  great deal it can contribute, not least in involvement in the  peacekeeping-related activities envisaged under PFP [Partnership  For Peace]. Working closely with NATO in this way could do a  lot to build up understanding and co-operation, not only between  Russia and NATO but across the whole of Europe.    The Russian leadership and the Russian people have come to a  crucial point. They are debating among themselves what kind of  foreign policy they should pursue. I have no doubt that they  should be pursuing the policy of a great power -- but a great  power within the context of international law and norms. We  must watch to ensure that Russian policy conforms to these  criteria. There are plenty of voices in Russia urging, against  powerful opposition, the kind of foreign policy which fits in  well with our own and with the needs of their neighbours. We  must help them.</p>

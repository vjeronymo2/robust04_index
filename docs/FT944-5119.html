			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / UK Company News: UK jeans maker to go private Vivat Holdings, which makes jeans under the Lee Cooper brand, is being taken private in a deal that values it at more than Pounds 36m (Dollars 56m). The group, which has had a patchy trading record over the last 10 years, has suffered from the fact that 15 shareholders held more than 90 per cent of the shares. 'Its status as a public company was an anomaly,' said Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman since October 1991. A new company, known as Chiefco, has been set up to buy Vivat. On Friday, it claimed to have bought, or to have irrevocable undertakings on, at least 69 per cent of the shares. It is offering 65p a share cash, a premium of 71 per cent over the closing price on Decem-ber 1. Chiefco is owned by NatWest Ventures, USI Holdings, Phoenix Fund Managers and Mr Heidi Djilani, chairman of Lee Cooper Tunisie. USI Holdings is part of the Singapore based Wing Tai clothing group and has swapped its 29.1 per cent stake in Vivat for a similar stake in Chiefco. CNM, a French holding company, has sold its 28.1 per cent stake to Chiefco. Mr William Jackson of NatWest Ventures said the company's main problem had been the lack of liquidity in its shares. 'Whatever the management does - good or bad - the shares do nothing.' In the last three years the shares, which closed at 65p on Friday, have traded between 23p and 45p.</p>

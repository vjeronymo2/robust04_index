			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (6): Many contracts still to be awarded / A look at repairs to the electricity and water networks ONLY camels are comfortable without air conditioning in Kuwait. Temperatures are manageable at this time of year but in the summer, the country bakes. The scorching heat of August will be the greatest test for the emirate's patched-up power and water network. Work so far has barely scratched the surface. Millions of dollars worth of contracts are still to be awarded to make good the severe damage inflicted during the seven-month Iraqi occupation. Repairs to the country's power stations have restored about a third of their pre-war capacity of 7,200MW. That is enough to meet the current load, but it is still short of the likely surge in demand over the next six months. 'We have set a target to produce 5,000MW by August 24,' says Mr Ahmed al-Adsany, minister of electricity and water. 'By then we estimate the peak load will reach 3,300MW.' Work on the power stations was especially urgent because they also provided virtually all the country's domestic and industrial fresh water at combined desalination plants. The government says that 98 per cent of the country has been linked to power and water supplies, although some farming areas in the north are still without plumbed water. It is likely to be two to three years before the network is fully up and running. All six of Kuwait's power stations were damaged during the war. Early estimates put the full cost of the repair work at about Dollars 1bn. Now the government says it will have to spend Dollars 5bn on the network over the next five years, including nearly Dollars 2bn for a new plant at Subiya in north-east Kuwait. Mitsubishi of Japan won the Subiya contract before the war but the project was suspended after the invasion. The company will supply the boilers and turbines, worth about Dollars 1bn. It is now negotiating with the government which is trying to hold the company to prices agreed under the 1989 contract. A group of Turkish companies is building the plant's infrastructure. Work is due to start in 1994. Much of the post-war work has been to carry out urgent, but temporary, repairs, and only a handful of the biggest contracts has been awarded. Scores of western companies are battling for the spoils. Bristol Babcock, the UK engineering company, has just completed an Dollars 8m contract to repair the control room at Doha West power station, built in 1983. The new control room was scheduled to be switched on today for the first time since the war, operating initially at a tiny proportion of its capacity. The UK company is working on a similar Dollars 10.8m contract to repair the control room and other items as the adjoining plant at Doha East, which was built in 1977. Boilers were also badly damaged and most of the fuel tanks were destroyed. Deutsche Babcock, which supplied the original boilers at the two plants, won the order for new boilers. The government has reopened bidding for a Dollars 20-Dollars 25m order for the new fuel tanks after rejecting initial bids last year. FC Babcock, the group's French subsidiary, appears to be a likely contender. One of the biggest single contracts being negotiated is for the replacement of desalination units at Shuwaikh. Estimates for the work range from Dollars 20m to Dollars 40m. The government says that damage to the power plant, built in 1954, was so severe that it is not worth repairing. But the desalination plant was only a few years old. The pre-war capacity of each of Shuwaikh's three desalination units was 6m gallons of water a day, about a sixth of the country's daily consumption. Westinghouse of the US is chasing the Shuwaikh contract along with Hitachi and Mitsubishi of Japan, Hyundai of South Korea, Alsthom of France and a handful of smaller western companies. Westinghouse says it will enter a joint venture with a civil engineering company, possibly Blount of the US, if it wins the contract. Temporary repairs have been carried out at two of the other power stations, but the Shuaiba North plant is still out of action. Shuaiba South and the al-Zour plant, Kuwait's newest power station, built in 1988, suffered little damage. The two plants are supplying all Kuwait's current capacity. Transmission cables to al-Zour have been patched up, along with about 10,000km of cable throughout the country. Blount carried out temporary repairs to the cable network jointly with subcontractors, local companies and government workers. Some of the subcontracted work has gone to Balfour Beatty, on overhead repairs, and BICC on ground cables. The repairs have enabled the country to tick over, but the heavy investment needed to bring the system up to full power has barely started. The cable network was so extensively damaged that it will cost about Dollars 200m to put right. Blount has just started work on a Dollars 15m contract to replace high voltage overhead cables. A string of European, Japanese and US companies are bidding for the rest of the cable work and for the outstanding contracts to repair the country's 4,000 substations, about a third of which will have to be fully replaced. Several hundred substations have been repaired and equipment replaced by Westinghouse in partnership with Blount. Trans-electro, of Hungary, which built many of the original substations, has also carried out much of the temporary repair work. The full tally of work is likely to reach Dollars 200m. Power supplies were more severely disrupted than the flow of water. Early repairs to the distribution system quickly secured enough water to satisfy demand from the returning population. Reservoirs, which suffered little damage, are back to pre-war storage levels of about 2bn gallons. Current demand of 90m gallons a day will rise to about 130m by the summer. The two Doha plants and the al-Zour plant are now capable of producing 185m gallons a day between them. Full capacity will be reached only when the power stations are restored. The destruction has at least given the government the impetus to upgrade the system. Western engineers say the network needed repair anyway because of poor maintenance over a long period. The size of the final bill is forcing the government to look at ways of reducing demand and cutting costs. Mr al-Adsany says the government is considering a phased reduction of the heavy subsidies it pays on electricity and water bills. It may also introduce higher peak-level charges. The timing of such measures might be difficult. The government has promised public sector pay rises of 25 per cent, but as Mr al-Adsany says: 'What we give with one hand, we cannot take with the other.'</p>

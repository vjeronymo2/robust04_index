			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Electricity workers are offered 5.5% rise MORE THAN 130,000 electricity workers have been offered a 5.5 per cent wage rise in a move which is likely to fuel the pay expectations of other groups. The offer, nearly 1.5 percentage points above the latest inflation figure, is above the manufacturing norm, which most analysts say is below 4 per cent. The offer is being recommended by union leaders who are bargaining together for the first time - previously there have been three separate negotiations. The unions' recommendation means that this is the first time in several years that the electricity pay talks have not resulted in threats of industrial action. The electricity industry is one of the largest sectors which still negotiates national pay deals, and the 5.5 per cent offer is likely to be cited by union negotiators in many other industries. It will be of particular importance at British Gas, where negotiations for 27,000 manual workers are in progress. Most workers covered by the public-sector pay review bodies will receive more - between 5.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent - but employers in the private sector may dismiss such increases as irrelevant for comparison purposes. One reason for the electricity employers' apparent desire to reach an early settlement - and so offer a relatively high rise - is that this will be the last year of national negotiations. All 20 electricity companies have given notice that they intend to negotiate local pay and conditions deals next year. That is likely to result in protracted talks, and the employers wanted to clear the air for them and avoid any sour relations that might have resulted from protracted discussions this year. Senior executives in the electricity industry have themselves been criticised recently for accepting high pay rises. The national talks cover all workers below management level in the 20 companies. Current salaries range from Pounds 6,178 for junior clerks to Pounds 36,576 for senior administrative workers. Craft rates range from Pounds 8,719 to Pounds 14,120. Pay for most workers including manual employees will rise from April 1, although engineers will receive their increases backdated to February 1.</p>

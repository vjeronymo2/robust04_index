			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Karolos Papoulias, foreign minister of Greece and  chairman of the Ministerial Council of the European Union, today  arrived in Belgrade. He was met at the Belgrade airport by  Zeljko Simic, deputy federal prime minister. In a statement for  journalists, Papoulias did not announce new ideas for peace, but  stressed that the European Union will remain, as he said,  dynamically present in the continuation of the negotiations on  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Jelena Vidic reports:    [Vidic] Journalists meeting the Greek foreign minister at  the Belgrade airport asked him whether the European Union was  disturbed by the monopolization of the problem of  Bosnia-Herzegovina by the United States and Russia. Papoulias  answered the following:    [Begin Papoulias recording in Greek with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] A political factor such as Europe  is not disturbed. In any case, we want to maintain our presence  together with other powerful factors such as the United States  and Russia. However, no one should forget the European Union's  contribution so far, nor the ideas in the program of activities  of the European Union. These ideas are today still the most  important ideas. [end recording]    [Vidic] Papoulias said that Bosnia-Herzegovina will be  discussed at the informal meeting of the European Union's  ministers at the end of this month. He said that the possible  dispatch of Turkish soldiers to Bosnia is currently of interest  for all Balkan countries, because they had agreed not to deploy  their troops on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.  However, if the Turkish troops are deployed in Bosnia, Greece  will consider the possibility of doing the same, Papoulias said.    Here is now what Zeljko Simic, deputy federal prime  minister,  said about expectations from talks with the Greek foreign  minister today.    [Begin Simic recording] From today's talks we expect the  speeding up of the process of settling the crisis in Bosnia-  Herzegovina and the Balkans in general. In this sense we will  hold talks with Mr. Papoulias with pleasure. We are very  familiar with the stand of Greece, which is investing enormous  efforts toward the peaceful settlement of the crisis, and toward  the settlement by political means of all problems affecting the  Balkan Peninsula.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cast Economic Evaluation Center: "Economic Cycle </F> Rebounds; Relaxed Environment Remains To Be Created" -- Two  graphics not reproduced]    [Text] Sign of Exceptionally Early Rebound Appears in  Current Economic Performance    At the end of June 1993, the central authorities had  resolutely adopted a series of measures to stabilize the  economy. By November, the "overheated" economy was notably  controlled. The target to exercise macro-economic control were  basically achieved as expected. The Cast [kasite 0595 2448 3676]  index shows that the uniform composite index fell from its peak  of 115.3 to 106 with an average monthly drop of 1.8 percent. The  comprehensive evaluation mark dropped from the middle section of  the red light zone (54 points) to the lower limit of the yellow  light zone (43 points). All this indicates that the economy is  approaching normal operation. The measures taken this time have  drawn support from the relatively tight monetary policy.    Since the last quarter of 1993, the tight monetary policy  had begun to slacken off. The indexes of the narrowest measure  of money supply M1 and the broader measure of money supply M2  had rapidly risen in December with their rate of growth reaching  20.87 percent and 23.7 percent. The rate of growth of the total  industrial production value stopped to fall since November. It  rose to 29.7 percent in December, 10.8 percent higher than that  in November. Incentive for more investment was once again  aroused. The uniform composite index in December rose by 1.9  percent over November. The comprehensive economic index  increased to 48 points showing itself within the upper limit of  the yellow light zone. As seen from the present moment, the  exceptionally early rebound in the entire economy merits  attention, although indicators of one month cannot represent the  whole situation.  <H5>  Two Possibilities Affecting 1994 Economic Trends </H5>   Due to the fact that policies for macro-economic control may  vary in the days to come, there may be two different trends in  the development of our overall economy.    1. The monetary policy which has already become relaxed will  continue to slacken off. This will make the economy to grow  rapidly. As a result, the need for macro-economic control will  once again become pressing, and original problems such as  serious unbalanced economic developments, various "bottlenecks"  and inflation will once again crop up. This will prevent the  various on-going reform measures from being smoothly carried  out. Also, it may force the government to readjust its economy  and use "emergency brakes."    2. Timely and adequate measures will be adopted to exercise  micro-economic adjustments, to strengthen guidance over the  economic sector, to control the growth of investments and money  supply and to optimize the economic structure by selecting the  proper investments. Under this kind of situation, the general  economic trend may possibly be as follows:    The rate of economic growth will drop to 9-10 percent from  the 13 percent in 1993, and the commodity price index will drop  below 10 percent from the 13 percent in 1993. As a result, the  uniform composite index will only fluctuate on a small scale,  and our overall economy will remain in the area between the  green light zone and the yellow light zone. This kind of  comparatively relaxed environment will not only help the smooth  transition of the economic cycle to the economic expansionary  period. It will also help quicken the tempo in carrying out  reform and in making preparations for the rapid economic growth  in the near future.  <H5>  How To Create a Relaxed Economic Environment </H5>   This year is the first year of great significance in  carrying  out reform. Studies and practice at home and abroad indicate  that the announcement and implementation of policies in carrying  out reform must keep pace with the economic cycle. Generally  speaking, reforms in financial affairs, taxation, commodity  prices and investments are usually carried out in the period of  economic decline so that such reforms would have less negative  impact. Therefore, this year's macro-economic control is  basically aimed at continuously creating a stable economic  environment which is conducive to the reform program and at  reducing the shock the program may possibly create to the  minimum.    A relaxed environment in 1994 is mainly determined by the  following three factors:    1) A stable price index. Commodity prices constitute a  direct  factor in affecting social stability. Right now, we still need  to prevent the inflation from going beyond the endurance of the  society. We must strive to keep the price rises below the 10  percent level.    2) Adequate rate of growth. The history of China's economic  cycle indicates that China's economy is mainly one of  "speed-effectiveness" type. An excessively high rate of growth  often drives the economy into the red light zone and makes us  feel notably restrained by the environment. Therefore, we should  keep the rate of growth of our GNP below 10 percent in 1994.    3) Flexible monetary policy. Since the implementation of the  reform and opening up program, we discover that the several  economic fluctuations in the past were invariably connected with  the monetary policy. In most of the cases, the tightening of the  monetary policy was often the first choice in preventing our  economy from entering the red light zone. The monetary policy  will still play an important role in 1994. We should control our  economy by adopting the form of "tightening the overall economy,  while relaxing the control over specific projects." That means  to place the overall economy under control, while ensuring the  fulfillment of important economic plans.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Old Speckled Hen boosts Morland Morland, the Thames Valley-based brewer, yesterday reported a 10.6 per cent increase in interim profits buoyed by a better than expected 21 per cent increase in sales of its own ales, led by Old Speckled Hen. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 4.02m (Pounds 3.63m) in the six months to March 31, on turnover ahead 12 per cent at Pounds 26.6m (Pounds 23.7m). Earnings per share were 12.8p (11.9p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 3.06p (2.78p.) The shares rose 10p to 518p. Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, chairman, said the result continued a trend of sustained growth and had been achieved despite a generally depressed trading environment. Operating profits rose 12.3 per cent to Pounds 5.41m but were reduced by a Pounds 109,000 (Pounds 30,000) deficit on property disposals and net interest costs of Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 1.16m). Sales of Old Speckled Hen, now its biggest selling beer brand, more than doubled over the same period last year, helped by a series of agreements with wholesalers and other brewers. Overall beer volumes were ahead 13 per cent, and the group said it plans to increase capacity at its Abingdon brewery next year. Volumes in the tenanted estate were slightly lower but profits were marginally ahead on a like-for-like basis. The 75-pub estate, showed a 17 per cent increase in profits with those pubs specialising in food again recording strong growth. Food now represents 27 per cent of sales, and meals in the Artist's Fare restaurants showed a 12 per cent increase. The group is seeking more Artist's Fare and Ale House sites. Volumes in the free trade, including wholesalers, were 50 per cent higher and, combined with a Pounds 100,000 reduction in bad debts, led to a marked improvement in profit contribution. Net borrowings were Pounds 23.9m, down from Pounds 24.8m at the year end, equivalent to gearing of 22.7 per cent.</p>

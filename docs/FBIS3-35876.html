The  strength of the republic's airborne troops has been  significantly weakened by a mass exodus to Russia; over 300  officers changed their place of service. The paper also reports  that about 2,500 officers are trying to leave for Russia in the  near future. Over half the Belarusians who are graduating from  Russian military schools this year have already signed contracts  to do their service in the Russian Armed Forces. The newspaper  believes that a higher level of social guarantees for servicemen  of the Russian Army is the main reason for this.</p>

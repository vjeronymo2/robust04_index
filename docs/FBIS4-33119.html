			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Otto Sarkis and Luiz Antonio Novaes] </F>   [Text] During the 1989 presidential campaign, five of the  government's intelligence organs were mobilized to keep tabs on  Brazil Popular Front candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. The  spies focused especially closely on the most radical groups  within the PT [Workers Party]. Coordinated by the SNI [National  Intelligence Service] and in cooperation with the secret police  services of Argentina, Israel, and England, agents were  infiltrated into organizations that had a history of activity in  the armed struggle. They kept Planalto Palace supplied with the  documents prepared during the campaign. The results of the  investigation are found in 154 pages of reports produced by the  Alfa 1 Working Group, or GT-A1 as it was known in the business,  and obtained by ISTOE on an exclusive basis. In eight months,  the SNI listed 17 radical factions housed within the PT, studied  the modus operandi of 21 leftist organizations in Latin America,  and identified, among 300 militants, 97 Brazilians who had  studied guerrilla warfare in foreign countries.    The documents prepared by the group state the target of the  operation, the working rules to be observed by the information  analysts, the minutes of the meetings, their final conclusions,  and--frequently--refer to internal flaws in the official  intelligence system. Begun in March 1989, the spying in the PT  was intended to detect the potential for emergence of an armed  movement that would seize power in Brazil. On 10 November  [1989], five days prior to the first round of voting, the  "brain" of the Brazilian espionage effort concluded that  although the party was respecting the rules of democracy, the  ideological base of the PT was still "orthodox Marxist," founded  on the class struggle.    The only reason Lula did not win the support of some people  in the top echelon of the government in the runoff election was  that the SNI found that he was hostage to radical schools of  thought. President Jose Sarney and his minister/chief of the  SNI, Ivan de Souza Mendes, were personally at odds with Fernando  Collor, who had called the former "corrupt" and Planalto Palace  a "den of thieves." The task of collecting and analyzing the  information for the GT-A1 was an important factor in the  decision by Sarney, General Ivan, and other Planalto aides to  cast blank ballots.    Other participants in the investigation besides the SNI were  the Intelligence Centers of the Army (CIE), the Navy (CIM), the  Air Force (Secint), and the Federal Police's DOPS [Department of  Political and Social Order], which was then headed by Chief  Amaury Galdino, later the Federal Police director during the  Collor administration. After obtaining the reports, ISTOE  contacted five high officials in the intelligence community. On  Wednesday 27 April, we located the coordinator of the entire  operation, Colonel Jose Luis Savio Costa (Reserve), who was then  an advisor to the SNI's Central Agency, headed by General  Freitas Almeida. Costa confirmed the authenticity of the  documents and agreed to talk with this magazine provided that  the names of three other SNI agents who worked on the operation  were not revealed. Two of them are still in the Intelligence  Undersecretariat of the SAE [Strategic Affairs Secretariat], an  office linked to the Presidency of the Republic that absorbed  what was left of the SNI. On Thursday, 28 April [1994], Galdino  told ISTOE that he had attended the first meeting of the five  Alfa groups--one from each organ--at which three agents from  SIDE [Secretariat for State Intelligence], the Argentina secret  police, were also present.    The Alfa groups were initially set up to monitor the risk  that disturbances might break out in Brazil similar to the La  Tablada armed uprising in Argentina on 22 January 1989, or the  Caracazo, the popular revolt that occurred in  Venezuela that same year. The SIDE agents alerted the Brazilian  intelligence community to the possibility that La Tablada had  been planned in the zone along the border between the two  countries. Two Brazilian sisters had participated in the  invasion of the Argentine barracks: Aldira and Celia Pereira  Nunes. Aldira died. The Argentines suspected that terrorist  Henrique Haroldo Gorriarah Merlo, aka "El Pelado," was behind  the attack. He was thought to have masterminded the  assassination of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza in  September 1980, in Asuncion, Paraguay. According to the SNI  investigation, El Pelado had made several visits to Praia  Grande, on the Sao Paulo coast, between 1968 and 1975. In 1983,  he was shadowed in Sao Paulo by Brazilian agents. Besides the  Argentine terrorist, a Brazilian--Expedito Carvalho, aka "Paolo  Parra"--had been named as one of the leaders of La Tablada.    The reports obtained by ISTOE do not mention those two  individuals, since Operation Alfa ultimately expanded to become  a meticulous analysis of the groups on the Left, both legal and  clandestine, in Brazil. There are, however, references to three  other investigations undertaken by the SNI that involved  monitoring two terrorists--the "Gringo," "Goiabada," and  "Acapulco" operations. The "revolutionary movements" in Latin  America, mainly those of Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay,  Chile, Venezuela, and El Salvador, were analyzed, as were their  ties to the Brazilian Left.    At that point in time, according to the SNI, the Latin  leftists were coordinated by cells established in Nicaragua,  Cuba, or Libya. "By then, talking about armed struggle was a  thing of the past," Admiral Mario Cesar Flores, now the  minister/chief of the Strategic Affairs Secretariat said on  Wednesday the 27th. "That's over with. People are no longer  being followed around in Brazil for ideological reasons," Flores  said. After setting out the rules governing the work routine of  the GT's [Working Groups] in a document dated 30 March [year not  given] entitled "Analysis of the National Trend (Political  Violence)," in which the obtaining of the Argentine information  is reported and the British and Israelis are asked to mobilize,  the SNI produced, on 18 April [year not given], its first  document on the Brazilian "revolutionary Lefts." They are  described as more "prudent" organizations--but still fully  captive to the "possibility of the eclosion of the armed  struggle."    All the documents are written in typical leftist language  and  that report, for example, studies the existence of the  "objective and subjective conditions for revolution." Col. Savio  Costa was considered at Planalto Palace as one of the SNI's most  well-versed specialists in Marxist theory. Among his  recommendations are requests for surveillance of the student  movement, the Progressive Church, the actions of labor unions,  and the news reporters in the press. In analyzing the  possibility that a "charismatic leader" might foster conditions  favorable to a "union of the Lefts" and the "armed movement,"  the SNI is referring indirectly to Lula. It asks that leaders  who have that potential be monitored not only in the "political  arena" but also in their personal lives. Another factor uniting  the Lefts was the activity of the radical Right. The UDR [Rural  Democratic Union] was also closely watched by the SNI.    The Alfa GT listed the following leftist organizations as  priority targets of surveillance: the PCBR [Brazilian  Revolutionary Communist Party], the PRC [Communist Revolutionary  Party], the ALP [expansion not given], the PLP [Progressive  Liberal Party], the MCR [Revolutionary Communist Movement], the  PRO [expansion not given]--all given top priority. Assigned  secondary priority were the Trotskyite organizations CS, ORMD-S,  OQI, COT-QI, COT-PT [expansions not given], PORT-P  [Revolutionary Workers Party-Trotskyite Faction] and PRT do B  [expansion not given]. The PCdoB [Communist Party of Brazil] and  the MR-8 [8 October Revolutionary Movement] (neither allied with  nor housed in the PT) ranked third in priority. The PCB  [Brazilian Communist Party] came last. The 21 leftist  organizations in South America, most of them Argentine, were  always selected with an eye to their connections with alleged  Cuban or Nicaraguan commandos and their possible links to  Brazilians. Cuban, Nicaraguan, and Libyan diplomats were also  kept under surveillance.    The efficiency of the SNI, capable of listing 97 Brazilians  who had taken courses in guerrilla warfare in foreign countries,  was only relative. The agency was only able to locate 71 of this  contingent in Brazil--26 were still unaccounted for. On 25  September [year not given, photo accompanying article suggests  it was 1989], a periodic report expressed regret, for example,  that the lack of systematic studies and the absence of a  documentation at the Central Agency made it impossible to locate  Jose Luiz Del Royo, described as an ex-militant in the ALN  [National Liberating Alliance]. The militant not found by the  government spies was located by ISTOE on Thursday the 28th  [1994]. Now shuttling between Milan and Sao Paulo, Del Royo is a  writer and historian. He returned to Brazil in 1979 under the  amnesty, and since then has been publicly active, representing  Italian social studies institutes.    He voted in all the elections and holds a passport. In 1986,  he wrote the book Historias do Primeiro de Maio  [Stories from May 1], which received plenty of attention in the  press. "Now we discover that the intelligence service was  working in our favor," Del Royo said, sarcastically. According  to him, the DOPS has accurate information on his activities in  Brazil. "That means they didn't even cross-check the data," he  concluded. In 1982, Del Royo launched a magazine, Memoria  da Historia [Memoirs of History], in Brazil. His name  appeared on the masthead of four published issues. The SNI  catalogued that magazine.    According to the regulations governing the work of each  analyst, the coordinator of the Alfa GT ordered them to meet  daily. On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday afternoons the GT-A1  met to read through documents and reassess previous studies to  update the information. Thursdays were reserved for evaluations  of political developments. Periodically, the Alfa GT's met to  exchange experiences. The first meeting of this kind was held on  10 and 11 May [year not given, presumed to be 1989], and the  work continued until Collor's inauguration in March 1990.    In another document, of 15 pages, the SNI made a study of  the  educational and training background of former militants of the  Left and their influence on the new members. The organ assessed  the various factors that led these militants to get involved in  the armed movements starting in 1964. In 1989, the SNI perceived  that those militants were more influential and more careful:  "So, they had progressed from the impetuousness of adolescence  to maturity and, although not as vigorous physically, had gained  greater cultural and political leverage."  <H5>  [Box p 21] </H5> <H5>  "There Have Always Been Moles"--The Boss of the Spies Talks </H5> About His Work    The coordinator-general of the spying operation against the  PT and its radical factions, Col. Jose Luis Savio Costa, 61, who  recently underwent a triple bypass, subscribes to official party  publications and buys books on Marxism. Currently he is reading  Jurgen Habermas's Necessidade de Revisao da Esquerda  and Anatomia da Esquerda Universal, by Ferenc Feher  and Agnes Heller [original titles not given]. In the reserve  since 1990, married, four children and five grandchildren, he is  setting up a property security company in Brasilia. Following  are highlights from the interview he gave ISTOE at his home.    [ISTOE] Do you know whether the intelligence organs still  have undercover agents in the PT?    [Savio] There will always be infiltrators whenever you have  a  radical group, provided the service is an intelligence service.  People were not planted in the PT, but in the illegal  organizations that existed within the PT. We had people in the  PCBR, the old ALN, in the MRC, the PRC--organizations that had  blended into the factions in the PT.    [ISTOE] And what is the situation now?    [Savio] I am out of that so I don't know, but if some agency  thinks a party is capable of putting the democratic state at  risk, it will inevitably try to infiltrate that party. I think  that right now, the Causa Operaria [Workers' Cause]  is an illegal party. It was expelled from the PT and is acting  without recognition. There may be some "moles" in Causa, but it  is a very closed group, one with tight security because it is  small.    [ISTOE] Did the SNI infiltrate people into the Sixth  National  Meeting of the PT, in 1988, the last one of your era? How did it  do so?    [Savio] Yes, by issuing them credentials as if they were  state representatives.    [ISTOE] And now, do you think there were "plants" at the  Ninth meeting?    [Savio] There is no need now, everything is open.    [ISTOE] Were the PCB and PCdoB also infiltrated in 1989?    [Savio] Traditionally the PCdoB was infiltrated.    [ISTOE] And now?    [Savio] Now there are friendships between former members of  the enforcement agencies and the subversives. They talk about  ideology.    [ISTOE] Is there any way for the intelligence organs to go  back to the former "moles" and get them to spy on the Left?    [Savio] They know there are plenty of shameless moles out  there. That has always been true.    [ISTOE] Does the SAE have that list of moles?    [Savio] I don't know, the SAE did not inherit all the SNI's  material. A lot of things were neutralized during the  transition. A lot of people, disgusted with the way things were  done, ruined the documents so they could not be used.    [ISTOE] In your opinion, is the PT still a revolutionary  party?    [Savio] It is not I, but the PT's own documents, that say  so.  The party is based on the class struggle and it wants to achieve  as nonviolent an institutional breakdown as possible.    [ISTOE] Does the PT pose a threat to democracy?    [Savio] I am not afraid of the PT, but of its radical  factions. My greatest fear is that the election campaign will  become hardened, so that the radical groups that thought they  saw victory at hand might then lose hope and start doing things  that threaten the institutional order.    [ISTOE] If you were in the SNI, would you suggest that a  group shadow the PT?    [Savio] There should be a group that would monitor the  election situation for signs of potential political violence and  take action to prevent evolution of the problem.    [ISTOE] Do you think such a group is being readied?    [Savio] I don't know. The suspicion that hangs over the  intelligence organs is preventing them from acting. That was set  up, a campaign that turned out right [sentence as published].  Despite that, Jose Dirceu (a federal deputy and PT  candidate for governor of Sao Paulo) is interested,  excessively interested, in intelligence and is capable of  organizing a system for the PT.    [ISTOE] Do you think the PT has a functioning SNI of its  own?    [Savio] I think there are a lot of PT spooks  [petepongas] out there.  <H5>  [Box pp 22-23] </H5> <H5>  Spooks in the Backlands--The Service That Did Not Predict </H5> Its End Now Works on Droughts    Except for the building and the idiosyncrasies typical of  any  intelligence service, such as a mania for security, little or  nothing remains of the old SNI. In its heyday, the "Service," as  it was called by insiders, had as many as 3,000 employees in  Brazil and other countries. Unable to anticipate the full impact  of Fernando Collor's resentment of its activities, the SNI was  taken by surprise when the "hunter of maharajahs" abolished it  in March 1990 and created the Strategic Affairs Secretariat  (SAE). Collor blamed the spooks of the secret service for the  abduction, accompanied by a mock execution by firing squad, of  which he had supposedly been the victim during his student days  at the University of Brasilia. The implosion of the SNI reduced  its personnel to a little more than 1,400 employees. The  overseas agents were deactivated, and illegal and covert  operations such as telephone-tapping ended officially.    That does not mean the Intelligence Undersecretariat of the  SAE, which inherited the estate of the SNI, might not sometimes  resort to "bugging" someone's telephone. To do so, however, it  needs court permission. The SAE does not even know what happened  to the SNI files, many of them destroyed by agents who were  unhappy with the change. This is admitted by Col. Savio Costa  himself, one of those affected by Collor's purge. By its very  nature, the "Service" continues to eavesdrop on events it thinks  the President of the Republic should know about: strikes, rural  unrest, and "more prosaic things," as SAE chief Admiral Mario  Cesar Flores said. An example of the latter would probably be  the survey made last year of the drought in the Northeast, to  guide the government in selecting the cities to be given  priority in federal aid.    Furthermore, the Intelligence Undersecretariat is no longer  headed by senior military officers, as it was even during the  Collor administration. Part of the folklore is the anecdote  about former SAE Secretary Pedro Paulo Leoni Ramos's attempt to  visit the facilities of the undersecretariat. He was barred from  entering by the spooks on duty at the building in Brasilia's  South Police Sector. Now the undersecretariat is headed by  journalist Afonso Antonio Marcondes, who never practiced the  profession for which he studied. Instead, he has been a career  employee since SNI days. Security is still strict. The  Intelligence Undersecretariat has a sophisticated system that  includes locks with electronic codes. Outsiders, when they visit  the building, are escorted at all times by agents. The site of  the former National Intelligence School now houses the Center  for Basic and Advanced Human Resources Training (Cefahr), used  by the undersecretariat for courses in international espionage  and counter-espionage aimed mainly at protecting scientific and  technological projects. At the end of the year, the government  plans to sponsor the first open competition in the "sector" to  recruit 60 new analysts.</p>

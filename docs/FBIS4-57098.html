			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] On 12 May, Brazilian President Itamar Franco sent  a letter of welcome to Commander in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz,  where he reiterated Brazil's admiration and friendship toward  Cuba. In the letter presented to Castro on 11 May by state  officials in Salvador, Bahia State, President Itamar Franco  recalls his meeting with Castro during last year's Third  Ibero-American Summit and stressed his delight at the prospect  of meeting again at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit scheduled  to be held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in June.    In his reply letter, Castro deeply thanked President Franco  for the warmth of the welcome and pointed out that he and his  delegation feel at home in the midst of the unsurpassed warmth  and friendship of the citizens of Bahia. Castro stressed that he  holds the ineradicable memory of the days spent in that city  which hosted the Ibero-American Summit and that this is the  reason it will be a pleasure to greet Franco again in Cartagena  de Indias.

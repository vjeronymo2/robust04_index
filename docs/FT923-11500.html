			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Net income plunges by 45% at ITT ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday reported a 45 per cent drop in second-quarter net income, due mainly to sharply lower earnings at its ITT Hartford insurance subsidiary, accounting adjustments and restructuring action at the Sheraton hotels business. The group reported net income of Dollars 106m, or 75 cents a share, compared with Dollars 194m, or Dollars 1.43, in the second quarter of 1991. Sales rose 4 per cent to Dollars 5.36bn. Net income would have been Dollars 131m, or 95 cents a share, compared with a restated Dollars 206m, or Dollars 1.53, if the non-cash accounting adjustments were excluded. The figures also included after-tax portfolio gains at ITT Hartford and ITT Financial of Dollars 22m, or 17 cents a share, compared with Dollars 6m, or 5 cents, in the same period of last year. ITT Hartford saw income drop from Dollars 117m to Dollars 41m. The company said this was 'mainly due to unfavourable adjusted underwriting income caused by higher catastrophe losses, largely from several weather related events, along with continued adverse developments in workers' compensation and reinsurance'. ITT Sheraton had an operating loss of Dollars 14m, against a profit of Dollars 15m, after restructuring its headquarters operations to make them more efficient. Excluding this charge, the company would have reported a small profit, although still below last year. Among the group's seven other major businesses, the automotive, financial and communications operations produced higher operating income; fluid technology and the Rayonier paper business were flat; and the defence and components businesses showed drops. For the six months ITT reported a net loss of Dollars 336m, or Dollars 2.62 a share, after taking a Dollars 580m non-cash accounting adjustment. In the first half of last year it made Dollars 406m, or Dollars 2.99 a share. Sales rose 3 per cent to Dollars 10.44bn.</p>

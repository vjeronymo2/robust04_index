			<p>BFN     [Text] Employees of the St. Petersburg Department of  Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCIS) to combat  terrorism have conducted an investigation and detained a group  of people who intended to sell more than three kilograms of  uranium dioxide (the share of uranium-235 isotopes is  90%).    The people involved in this case were detained early March  after the first information was received by the FCIS. Leader of  the Department's press service Yevgeniy Lukin underlined in his  interview with Interfax that during this month employees of the  service managed to reveal all places where this strategic  material was kept and not to lose even a gram of this material  which presents radioactive danger.    A total of 3.05 kilograms of powder were confiscated, part  of  it was kept under conditions presenting danger primarily for the  life and health of the criminals and their relatives. They kept  it in a glass pot and a metal retort.    Decontamination operations were conducted in one of the  suburbs of St. Petersburg where the powder was kept. A butcher  of a food shop and a plumber were among the people who tried to  sell this strategic raw material.    Employees of the St. Petersburg Department established that  the uranium was stolen from one of the enterprises belonging to  the Automobile Industry Ministry and situated near Moscow. The  case which was instituted in accordance with Article 223, part 3  of the Criminal Code -- robbery of radioactive materials -- was  transferred to the prosecutor's office to St. Petersburg for  further investigation.    The FCIS does not rule out that the stolen uranium-235 can  be  sold abroad. According to some estimates, the price of one gram  of this substance which is used in atomic industry is 300  dollars.    The press service of the St. Petersburg department reported  that the president was informed about this case by a special  report.</p>

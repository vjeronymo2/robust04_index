BRIEFING;  </P> <P> OAT BRAN CUTS INTO KELLOGG EARNINGS  </P> <P> Kellogg Co. said it expects its third-quarter earnings to be lower than the  same period last year due to increasing competition for ready-to-eat oat bran  cereal, triggering a sharp fall in the company's stock.  </P> <P> The stock of the Battle Creek, Mich.-based cereal giant sank $2.75 to $70.875  in heavy afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> The company earned $145.7 million or $1.18 a share in the year-ago third  quarter.  </P> <P> Kellogg Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William La Mothe said in a  statement that archrival General Mills continues to gain market share aided by  growing consumer interest in oat bran, high-fiber cereal touted as a  cholesterol reducer.  </P> <P> He said the company expects an increase in earnings for the full year. Kellogg  recently introduced Common Sense Oat Bran and is currently introducing  nationally two new products, OatBake and HeartWise.  </P></p>

These commenters thought that trustee officials should be allowed to estimate lost nonuse values through analysis of charitable donations, insurance premiums, and conservation expenditures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 11.83(c)(3) of the March 25, 1994, final rule allows trustee officials to use any valuation methodology, regardless of whether it is explicitly listed, provided it measures the public's WTP and satisfies the criteria set forth in &sect;11.83(a)(2). 59 FR 14286. The Department is currently unaware of any methodology available for the express purpose of estimating economically valued nonuse losses of specific injured resources, other than CV, that meets these specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters thought that if assessment of lost nonuse values is allowed, the Department should restrict such assessment to present and future values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Where little time has elapsed since the occurrence of a nonuse loss, trustee officials might conclude that CV respondents' WTP is not likely to have changed significantly. On the other hand, in cases where a great deal of time has elapsed since the occurrence of the nonuse loss, determination of WTP becomes more problematic. Therefore, as discussed above, the Department is soliciting comment on methods for estimating nonuse values lost over a significant amount of time for possible inclusion in a technical information document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters requested that the Department clarify that even if a CV study of lost nonuse values met any conditions set forth in the natural resource damage assessment regulations, it would still have to meet judicial standards for admissibility of evidence. Some commenters cited case law for the proposition that CV studies of lost nonuse values do not meet judicial standards for admissibility of evidence.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State of Idaho <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Southern Refrigerated Transport Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , No. 88&hyph;1279, slip op.

Therefore, the Department believes that any CV study of lost nonuse values performed in accordance with these regulations should satisfy judicial standards for admissibility of evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is unaware of any case that has held CV studies per se to be inadmissible in court.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Idaho <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Southern Refrigerated Transport <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  addressed the use of a particular CV study in a case where the natural resource damage assessment regulations were not followed. The study had been conducted not for the purposes of the specific case but rather to guide a utility council in making operational changes in a hydropower system. Slip op. at 20. The court did not rule that the study was inadmissible. However, the court did find that the study was not sufficiently persuasive to sustain the claim for lost nonuse values, noting that the survey questions were aimed at doubling fish runs from 2.5 million to 5 million whereas only 1,688 fish had actually been lost due to the specific release in question.

Therefore, no further analysis pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (43 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) has been prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department certifies that this rule will not have significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The rule provides technical procedural guidance for the assessment of damages to natural resources. It does not directly impose any additional cost. As the rule applies to natural resource trustees, it is not expected to have an effect on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been determined that this rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and has been determined to constitute a significant regulatory action. However, because of the difficulty of evaluating the effects of alternatives to this rule, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget has waived preparation of the assessments described in sections 6(a)(3)(B) and 6(a)(3)(C) of Executive Order 12866 for the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been determined that this rule does not have takings implications under Executive Order 12630.

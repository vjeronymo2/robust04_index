			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Walesa hankers after stronger role: Anthony Robinson asks whether a powerful presidency would benefit Poland PRESIDENT Lech Walesa, the Solidarity hero who led Poland from communism to freedom, is engaged in a power struggle with the product of his efforts  - the government of Mr Jan Olszewski. The prime minister heads a coalition cobbled together from seven of 10 political parties which gained more than a dozen seats in inconclusive elections last October. The fact that no single party gained more than 12 per cent of the vote and that 58 per cent of the electorate did not vote in the first free elections since the Second World War has reinforced Mr Walesa's ability to claim that he is more representative of Poles than the parliament and the government sustained by it. He after all was elected president with a 75 per cent majority in 1990, although only after he failed to win an overall majority in the first round. This failure and the indifference of the electorate in the October elections indicate that few Poles believe either in charismatic leaders or mediocre politicians. But this is not the conclusion reached by Mr Walesa. With increasing persistence he is insisting that Poland needs the dynamic leadership that can only come from an executive-style president enjoying wide political powers. A man with acute political antennae and considerable political intuition, he knows many Poles are frustrated and angry that democracy has not brought greater prosperity. Speaking to thousands of Solidarity supporters from the nearly bankrupt state enterprises outside the presidential palace last week, Mr Walesa hinted that he might try to re-create a mass movement to give him the support needed to push ahead faster with the reforms he knows Poland needs. But Mr Walesa has little understanding of economics and many question whether he has the knowledge or the patience to be an effective executive president. The message from a recent World Bank report is that for Poland, as elsewhere in the region, there are no short cuts, just the need for years of hard slogging to build up the institutions and skills of a market economy and the self-confident middle class needed to sustain a democracy. The irony is that Mr Walesa knows that Poland has no real alternative but to swallow the IMF and World bank medicine. If he gained greater powers he would have to use them to demand the sacrifices required. This is precisely what happened to Mr Olszewski, who became prime minister by criticising the economic policies of the first two post-communist governments but now runs a government whose key member, Mr Andrjez Olechowski, is the finance minister dedicated to keeping the budget deficit within IMF limits. If Mr Walesa did succeed in bringing down the government the most that he would probably achieve would be the promotion of Mr Olechowski from the finance ministry to the premiership. But this would leave the constitutional issue of the relationship between the president, the government and parliament unresolved. The essential stand-off in Polish politics would remain.</p>

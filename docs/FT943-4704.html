			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Profits at Australian insurer fall to ADollars 6m C. E. Heath International, the Australian liability insurer which was spun off from its UK parent in 1992, yesterday posted an operating profit after tax and abnormals of ADollars 6m (USDollars 4.4m) in the six months to end-June. This compares with a profit of ADollars 18.7m in the same period of 1993. Heath's problems stemmed from the worsening investment environment - in particular, rising fixed-interest markets which created unrealised investment losses of ADollars 32.7m, when the portfolio was 'marked to market value'. This caused Heath to move to an operating loss before tax and abnormals of almost ADollars 15m, compared with a ADollars 28.7m profit last time. The loss was then partly offset by a ADollars 24.5m abnormal surplus, resulting from the sale of Californian operations. Heath added that its underwriting profit, net of expenses, rose from little better than break-even in the first half of 1993, to ADollars 9.7m.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> ELVIS HITLER JABS AT TRASH CULTURE  </P> <P> A canny, icon-bashing name still capable of shock appeal, Elvis Hitler suggests  all kinds of satirical possibilities. But do not expect any socially acute  agit-punk (i.e., the Dead Kennedys) from this Michigan-based quartet, which  plays tonight at Night Moves in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Neither "skinhead" fascists nor a theatrical novelty, Hitler's stocky lead  singer-guitarist, Jim Leedy, does not wear a tiny mustache or a big pompadour,  and his band is about as political as corn pone.  </P> <P> Playing Raji's in Los Angeles this weekend, Hitler blasted a brand of  "hellbilly" faster than a speed-metal bullet racing "From Berlin to Memphis."  That title is where the Third Reich 'n' Roll comparisons begin and end:  Primarily, these turbo-charged songs (befitting a Motor City outfit) are about  automobiles; the band's philosophy is summed up in this motto: "Live fast, die  young and leave a good car."  </P> <P> Hitler's humor jabs at the soft underbelly of American trash culture with  post-adolescent humor. The high point of this kind of wit was the group's  juxtaposition of the "Green Acres" theme song over Jimi Hendrix's "Purple  Haze," the kind of silliness that goes over big with fans of such pop-culture  trash shows as MTV's "Remote Control."  </P> <P> Elvis Hitler is not breaking new ground -- such bands as the Cramps and all  that followed them tilled this particular shock 'n' roll field years ago -- but  with their high-velocity assault and ferocious enthusiasm, they come awfully  close to crashing the sound barrier.  </P> <P> Universal Congress Of, which ended the evening, is becoming one of the local  scene's vital musical resources, a primarily instrumental quartet capable of  sliding from funky blues to free-jazz improvisations to sly be-bop. The band's  intricate, multilayered, rebirth-of-cool approach lies far outside the  rock-club mainstream.  </P> <P> That UCO can make these sounds so accessible and appealing is just another  indication of this band's increasing artistry. A band for the future.  </P> <P>  Elvis Hitler, Tube Blaster Overdrive and the Don Hodads play tonight at 9:30  at Night Moves, 5902 Warner Ave., Huntington Beach. Admission: $3. Information:  (714) 840-6118.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 'POLITICAL CLICHES' MARKED BUSH TALK, SHEVARDNADZE SAYS  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze accused the U.S. Administration of  conducting a foreign policy of "empty political cliches" in a blunt assessment  Saturday of President Bush's policy-setting address May 12.  </P> <P> While not responding directly to Bush's proposal for an "open skies" policy  permitting unarmed surveillance flights over the superpowers, Shevardnadze said  much of Bush's speech appeared to indicate a step backward for superpower  relations.  </P> <P> "It surprised me by its tone, and I would even say by its somewhat old-style  ideological tinge and sometimes edifying emphasis," Shevardnadze told the  Communist Party newspaper Pravda in an interview carried by the Tass news  agency.  </P> <P> "It seemed to us that our political dialogue had already moved to a different  category and removed the blinkers of ideological rhetoric and that we could  conduct it without empty political cliches," the foreign minister said.  </P></p>

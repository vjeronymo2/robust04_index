			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet - Ballet English National Ballet has now entered its runner in the summer's Romeo and Juliet stakes. This is the version which Sir Frederick Ashton made for the Royal Danish Ballet in 1955 - a significant date because it was not until the next year that Western audiences were to be bowled over by the Bolshoi's massive spectacular. Ashton was, as it were, creating 'blind', with no pre-conceptions. The result is small-scale, poetic in a sometimes secret way  -you have to watch closely to see certain little choreographic marvels that Ashton offers, witness the ball-room duet for the lovers - and ultimately a production that does not pack enough emotional punch. With the Danes, the playing was so true, so detailed and so natural, that the choreography won on its own terms. With ENB, it looks like Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare - a few highlights, and an awful lot of workaday prose. On Monday the men provided the chief merits of the performance. In Thomas Edur, the Romeo, we see the finest classical danseur in the country (Mukhamedov is hors concours). The opening scene, a brief solo for Romeo, is enough to reveal his qualities. Edur displays a refinement of means, an elegance of style, an effortless sense of drama, that seem a text-book example of the virtues we hope for in a danseur noble. What is especially grateful to watch is the purity and unforced nobility of his manner. The dance speaks with extreme distinction; the playing is sure in its effects, lyrical in its intonation. We believe, both in Romeo and in the classic dance itself. His companions were Tim Almaas as a lively, quick-tempered Mercutio, and Stephen Sherriff as Benvolio. Sherriff has regained that exactness and distinction of style - steps made to look witty - that was his as a valued soloist with the Royal Ballet. From Kevin Richmond a menacing Tybalt, dangerous to cross, and quick in feeling: how angry, and vivid, his death. The Juliet was Rebecca Sewell. Her reading is much more assured technically than last year, and she is charmingly the young girl of the opening scenes. I missed, though, something inevitable about the later action, the signs of both bravery and despair, and of awakened sexual feelings, even in Ashton's understated dances. It is a failing of this version that it is not ecstatic enough, does not tell us - as Ashton so beautifully did for Chloe, Cinderella, and the Girl Pigeon - about the intensity of young love. Rebecca Sewell must find a way to increase the emotional temperature of this cool production. ENB's artists bustled industriously through group scenes that have an underpopulated feel, and a utilitarian look in Peter Rice's designs. (Friar Lawrence, though, has a couple of fetching outfits.) The score sounded very well under David Garforth's baton, with a strong rhythmic drive that did not miss the pungent qualities of Prokofiev's writing. There was drama here we did not see in the choreography. ENB presents Romeo and Juliet until Aug 14. Casting varies.</p>

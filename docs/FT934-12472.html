			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (10):  Electronic data interchange and electronic mail - The paperless office is almost as much a tantalising dream today as it was a decade ago. But in some areas, including the exchange of routine business documentation such as orders and invoices and electronic mail, some significant progress has been made / Valuable boost for efficiency ELECTRONIC data interchange (EDI) is a value-added network service which enables two organisations, usually customer and supplier, to exchange business documents using standard electronic forms and their own computers linked through a service provider. It is often a faster, cheaper and more reliable means of exchanging information than the traditional paper-based business transaction and can play a crucial role in automating a transaction chain. EDI also automatically sets up an 'audit trail' which enables an organisation to check and validate electronic documentation. These benefits have spurred growth in the use of EDI in the US, where it originated, and in the UK and the Netherlands which lead Europe in EDI usage. Ovum, the technology consultancy, expects the EDI market in Europe, including customer software and support, to grow from about Ecu 196m in 1992 to about Ecu 590m in 1997, a compound annual growth rate of 24 per cent. 'The EDI market in Europe continues to grow steadily,' Ovum noted in its latest report on the European Vans market, 'most large organisations are now using, implementing or trialing EDI.' However the report also notes that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are showing much more resistance than was expected to the adoption of EDI. Nevertheless, as an increasing number of smaller suppliers have discovered, big companies are beginning to demand EDI links with their trading partners. This, in turn, fuels the growth in EDI trading as more organisations gain direct experience of the benefits. Ovum notes that the majority of EDI traffic today is based on industry specific application protocols. However, the report forecasts that 'virtually all new user-communities are basing their services on Edifact (an international standard) - and many existing communities using proprietary application protocols are moving towards Edifact.' By 1997, Ovum predicts that 90 per cent of EDI traffic in Europe will be based on the Edifact standard. The UK and the Netherlands are by far the most mature EDI markets in Europe followed by France, Sweden, Switzerland and Belgium which are 12 to 24 months behind, then Germany, Italy and Spain which are about three years behind according to Ovum. Among the service providers the market leaders in Europe are IBM and Geis which have pan-European networks and services and International Network Services (INS - jointly owned by Geis, the US-based network services company, and ICL) which dominates the market in the UK with an estimated 55 per cent market share. Other service-providers in Europe include Unisource, a joint venture between the Dutch,Swiss and Swedish telephone network operators, BT Global Network Services and France Telcom/Transpac which are aiming to build up a European-wide presence, AT&amp;T Easylink which has a significant position in the UK and is now expanding across Europe. Intesa, a joint venture between Fiat and IBM, has an important position in Italy while Silgos is the market leader in France. In the UK, competition between the three main service supplier is intensifying and last year IBM, AT&amp;T and BT announced inter-working between their networks in an attempt to isolate INS which provides three main EDI 'communities,' INS-Tradanet, the main service for retailers and their suppliers, Brokernet for the insurance sector and Fleetnet for the fleet leasing-management sector. The biggest, INS-Tradanet, handles more than 6m documents a month. Companies use these EDI service suppliers because they provide a central 'post office' function, directing message traffic to the appropriate recipient and providing any 'data translation' needed between different computers or message standards. About 10,000 companies and other organisations in Britain are estimated to be using electronic trading and the number is growing by between 20 and 30 per cent a year. But there is still much room for growth. Some recent estimates have suggested that less than 5 per cent of business transactions in the UK are handled by EDI. Of the top 1,000 companies, roughly 300 use EDI. As Sir John Harvey-Jones noted at the Electronic Business Exchange conference held in London earlier this year, that 'against the potential of both the number of firms and the uses that could be made of electronic trading, we are barely scratching the surface.' Tesco, one of the pioneers of EDI use in the UK, has automated its entire transaction chain of recording sales, amending and checking stock records, re-ordering goods, receiving and checking invoices and making payments. The benefits of EDI have been so great over the last six years that the supermarket chain has stopped measuring them against the costs. Tesco now trades electronically with over 1,200 companies of all sizes, representing more than 95 per cent of products on its shelves. Half these suppliers send their invoices to Tesco by EDI. Other big EDI users in the UK include ICL, the computer group, Nestle, Colgate-Palmolive. EDI users are also becoming increasingly sophisticated. Originally, EDI tended to be used only for basic transactions such as ordering and invoicing. However, as familiarity with electronic trading has grown, so has the range of information transmitted over EDI links. Tesco now exchanges 13-week sales forecasts with a quarter of the 1,200 suppliers which trade with it electronically to help them schedule production and reduce stocks - thus keeping their own costs and prices down. EDI is also being integrated with existing internal electronic mail systems and other computer applications. Using EDI in this way enables a customer to link two or more incompatible e-mail systems, for example in different departments or divisions of the same company, or to build an 'electronic bridge' between e-mail systems following a merger or acquisition. Unlike EDI, electronic mail is a non-interactive service based on sending computer originated messages across a telecommunications network. In Europe, electronic mail is already a significant and fast expanding Vans market. Ovum estimates that service providers earned Ecu 176m from e-mail services last year and will earn almost Ecu 1.5bn by 1997. The largest share of the market (8 per cent) is held by BT GNS, followed by IBM, Unisource and Geis. Ovum has identified seven other smaller market players including AT&amp;T Easylink, Mercury and Sprint which are earning at least Ecu 5m from e-mail services in Europe. According to Ovum, single terminals connected directly to public services account for almost 90 per cent of current e-mail traffic but by 1997 Ovum estimates this will have dropped to 20 per cent with the remainder accounted for by gateways to private e-mail systems. In the UK, e-mail usage is growing rapidly partly reflecting the introduction of new value-added services like Mercury's Multimessage facility which provides an integrated approach to sending a single message to any combinations of fax, telex and electronic mail addresses together with other special features like automatic re-dial and deferred transmission. Taken together with EDI, electronic mail is helping to redefine the way businesses trade and communicate with each other, and the office is at the centre of this new system of 'electronic commerce.'</p>

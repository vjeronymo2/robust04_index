			<p>BFN     [Text] A delegation of the Serbian Civic Council is  visiting Moscow. Heading the delegation is Mirko Pejanovic,  member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and chairman of the  council. Vlastimir Mijovic has the details:    [Begin Mijovic recording] The main goal of the Serbian Civic  Council delegation is to acquaint Russian officials with the  real situation in which the Serbian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina  have found themselves. So far, Moscow has only been visited by  representatives of the group that rejected the idea of a united  Bosnia-Herzegovina and with arms and crimes tried to draw (word  indistinct] ethnic borders. Through grave manipulations and  disinformation, the impression has been created in Russia that  all Bosnian Serbs support such an option (?embodied) in  Karadzic's (policy).    In the scheduled talks, the delegation headed by Mirko  Pejanovic will try to acquaint Russian officials with the  concept that the Serbian Civic Council advocates, which is the  survival of the Serbian population that is true to joint life  and a united state.    Our delegation will be received tomorrow by Vladimir Lukin,  chairman of the Foreign Committee of the Russian Duma and a very  influential person of Russian foreign policy. The delegation  will later meet with members of the Foreign Committee and  representatives of all parliamentary groups. It is still not  known whether our delegation will attend the parliamentary  debate on the Bosnian crisis initiated in the Duma. The Duma  leadership has still not decided whether it will hold an open  debate or behind closed doors. If the session is open, our  representatives will also be given an opportunity to speak.    In the next two days, the Serbian Civic Council delegation  will hold talks at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  will also visit the patriarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church.  Its main task is to present the situation in which the Bosnian  Serbs have found themselves, as well as the overall political  views of the government in Sarajevo.    As Mirko Pejanovic and Miro Lazovic have told us, they are  going to convey an official invitation to Boris Yeltsin to visit  Bosnia-Herzegovina. They will also try to arrange a visit by a  high-level Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation to Russia. In any  case, through the representatives of the Serbian Civic Council,  Russian top politicians will have an opportunity to learn about  another option that is entirely opposite to the one on the  Serbian issue that representatives of [word indistinct] the  Belgrade authorities have been presenting to them.    It is difficult to expect a major advance overnight, but it  is certain that this visit will contribute to Russian circles  attaining a better view of the Bosnian crisis. [end recording]</p>

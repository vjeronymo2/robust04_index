			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Specific Comments on Rule Sections <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 570.420&blank;General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Five commenters call for the abbreviated CHAS requirement to be eliminated. Section 570.420(d) requires that there be a certification in the Small Cities application that housing activities proposed to be funded by the Small Cities Program must be consistent with the applicant's abbreviated CHAS. This is required by 24 CFR part 91 and Section 105(b) of the National Affordable Housing Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter wanted to lower the requirement that 70 percent of the grant funds must be used to benefit low-and moderate-income persons to 51 percent. The Department believes that the commenter misunderstands the requirement. Under &sect;570.208(a)(1), if at least 51 percent of the residents of an area are low- and moderate-income persons, an activity that benefits that area is considered to benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Section 570.200(a)(3)(v) provides that area benefit activities are to count as benefitting low- and moderate-income persons 100 percent. Accordingly, if a water project is funded for $300,000, which benefits an area that is 57 percent low-and moderate-income, the entire $300,000 is considered to be benefitting low- and moderate-income persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three commenters said that the regulations should clearly state that &sect;570.200(a)(3)(iii) applies, and that grantees should not include Section 108 loan repayments in the calculations for meeting the objective that not less than 70 percent of the total of grant funds from each grant and Section 108 loan guarantee funds received under 24 CFR part 570, subpart M, within a fiscal year, must be expended for activities that benefit low-and moderate-income persons. The Department agrees and paragraph (e)(2) was revised to incorporate this change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eight commenters protested the elimination of the rating and ranking scoring factors from the regulations. As a result of these comments, &sect;570.421(a) has been added to the final rule to describe the selection system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There were multiple comments recommending that the Department establish an Economic Development set-aside with an open window, so that economic development applications could be submitted at any time during the year. Commenters also suggested that Section 108 loan guarantees be used to fund economic development projects to the greatest extent possible. These comments are addressed in &sect;570.421(a)(5), which provides that the Department will use the Section 108 loan guarantee program to the greatest extent possible to fund Economic Development projects, and that the Department will fund Economic Development applications as they are determined to be fundable in a specific amount by HUD. All Economic Development projects that are funded with Small Cities funds must have a substantial impact on the needs identified by the applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that only housing and public facilities applications should be funded during the competitive funding cycles. Under the new &sect;570.421(a) (``Selection system''), both competitive applications and the first year of multiyear plans will be funded on a competitive basis with the NOFA indicating how that competition will be held. Since ``Economic Development'' and ``Imminent Threat'' projects funded on a non-competitive basis, the competition will essentially include housing, public facilities, and comprehensive applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that the division between comprehensive projects and single purpose projects be retained with an eye towards evening the chances of obtaining funding from both types of projects. Another commenter requested that funding be continued for comprehensive grants. The nomenclature of single purpose and comprehensive projects has been removed from the final rule, but the Department may elect to retain and define such categories in a NOFA. Under the final rule, there will be competitions for competitive applications and multiyear plans with the funding divided between the categories fine-tuned by a NOFA that will be issued each year. The former single purpose projects will be eligible for funding as competitive applications. The former comprehensive projects may be funded as either competitive applications or as multiyear grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requested that the Department allow counties to apply on behalf of municipalities. This suggestion was incorporated into the final rule at 24 CFR 570.421(c)(3). Another commenter suggested that the Department encourage county-wide applications. County-wide applications are eligible for funding and will receive the same consideration as all other applications for Small Cities funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Six commenters requested that the Department allow multiyear funding for comprehensive grants. This comment was adopted in &sect;570.421(a)(2) of the final rule, which will allow the Department to fund multiyear plans. After the first year of a multiyear plan is funded, the Department may fund future years on a non-competitive basis subject to acceptable performance, submission of an acceptable application and certifications, and the provision of adequate appropriations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that multiyear grantees should not receive other grants during the time period that the multiyear grant was ongoing. The Department decided that this issue is more appropriately addressed in the NOFA rather than the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter suggested that consideration be given to female and disabled heads of household in giving fair housing points and contracts given to female-owned businesses should be taken into account in reporting minority business enterprise achievements. In order to retain flexibility to address changing priorities, the Department decided that the makeup of the fair housing and equal opportunity points will be disseminated in the NOFA rather than the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 570.424&blank;Grants for Imminent Threats to Public Health and Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters wanted the imminent threat set-aside retained in the final rule, and one commenter wanted it deleted. The Department decided to retain the imminent threat set-aside to give the Department the flexibility to respond immediately to threats to health and safety such as flood damage from hurricanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 570.425 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD Review and Actions on Applications for New York State Applicants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter said that if there was more than one funding round in a fiscal year, an unsuccessful application should be able to be resubmitted in the next round. The Department agrees and paragraph (c) was added to &sect;570.425 which authorizes HUD to provide in a NOFA that unsuccessful applications will be automatically held over for the succeeding rounds of competition if the applicant so requests in writing. The applicant will have the option of amending or withdrawing its application. For FY 1995, applications not funded in FY 1994 will automatically be reconsidered under the FY 1995 NOFA unless the applicant notifies HUD otherwise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter indicated that HUD should ensure that applications are funded for the least amount of funds necessary to implement the proposed activities. As a result of this comment, paragraph (b)(4) was added to &sect;570.425 of the final rule. This paragraph gives the Department the right to take into account the size of the applicant, the level of demand, the scale of the activity proposed relative to need and operational capacity, the number of persons to be served, the amount of funds required to achieve project objectives and the administrative capacity of the applicant to complete the activities in a timely manner in determining the appropriate grant amount to award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To respond to a commenter's request to even the playing field for smaller communities, the Department has revised &sect;570.425(a)(3) in the final rule to allow units of general local government to incur costs for certain CDBG grant activities before the establishment of a formal grant relationship and charge the pre-agreement costs to the grant, should it be funded. This includes the cost of application preparation, but does not create an obligation on part of the Department to fund the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

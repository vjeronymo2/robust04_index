			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Strike hits Kroger second period KROGER, the US food retailer which took on a heavy debt load when it conducted a defensive restructuring in 1988, yesterday reported an after-tax loss of Dollars 29.4m for the three months to June 13. This compares with a Dollars 30.6m profit in the same period a year earlier. Earnings before interest, tax and depreciation - the company's operating cash-flow - were also down sharply, at Dollars 184.4m, compared with Dollars 235.6m for the same period of 1991. Interest charges fell from Dollars 123.7m to Dollars 110m. Kroger's poor results are partly due to a strike by clerks and meat-cutters in the Michigan region. However, the figures also underline the extremely tough competitive conditions faced by many supermarket groups in the US at present. Mr Joseph Pitcher, chairman, said the 67-day stoppage in Michigan explained virtually all the decline in second-quarter cash-flow. He added: 'Clearly, the slow pace of economic recovery had not yet restored the confidence of consumers who continue to watch household spending on consumable items.' Total sales in the second quarter were Dollars 5.07bn, down 0.3 per cent on the same period a year earlier. But, even with the effects of the Michigan stoppage excluded, same-store sales were flat. In the first six months of 1992, Kroger has reported an after-tax loss of Dollars 38.7m, compared with a profit of Dollars 36m a year earlier on sales of Dollars 10.1bn against Dollars 9.99bn. The 1992 figure, however, is struck after a Dollars 64.2m extraordinary loss from the early retirement of debt. Ahead of extraordinary items, profits would be down from Dollars 71.1m to Dollars 47.7m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Filippov, leader of the All </F> Petersburg electoral coalition, by NEVSKOYE VREMYA correspondent  Irina Lebedeva; place and date not given: "All Petersburg: Let  Us Start With an Island"]    [Text] The election marathon is already halfway  through. Of 35 electoral coalitions 17 have met the requirement  of collecting 35,000 signatures and are nominating their members  to run for the city assembly. Our correspondent interviewed  Aleksandr Filippov, one of the leaders of the All Petersburg  electoral coalition.    [Lebedeva] Aleksandr Sergeyevich, your bloc's desire to put  together a team of professionals willing to take the  responsibility for solving the city's key problems is admirable.  A considerable share of these problems, however, is decided on a  different level. One does not have to go far for examples. As a  member of the higher learning community, are you prepared to  assume responsibility for the government not fulfilling its  obligations to people working in our institutes and universities?    [Filippov] There is nothing to justify such a government's  actions: Every person must keep his word. Especially persons  vested with authority.    The state has no right to remove itself from the spheres of  life that ensure cultural, moral, intellectual, and physical  dignity of the people. Therefore, I am bothered by Petersburg  residents' current apathy toward elections to the city assembly.  I was born in Leningrad; I love my city and will never agree  that our lot, according to Pushkin, is "a yoke with rattles and  a whip." How long can we count on rulers? My colleagues in the  electoral coalition--finance professionals--have drafted a  concrete program for increasing budget revenue and, accordingly,  reorientation toward financing of socially significant spheres,  including institutions of higher learning. The city as a  federation component has been given sufficiently broad powers in  matters of culture, education, and health care which we must  use, including setting up an influential lobby in the  government. I am not talking about pulling a blanket to our  side; this is about conceptual things: Throughout the entire  world culture, education, and social protection are under the  patronage of the society. And it is at the very least  irresponsible to leave workers in the nonproduction sphere to  the mercy of fate and engage in demagoguery by proposing that  they earn a living through commerce.    [Lebedeva] You, however, not only chair a department in the  Petersburg University, but also are a successful businessman,  the head of the Business Link company well known in the city,  which was the first in the city to undertake implementation of  the idea of territorial agencies for city reconstruction...    [Filippov] Three years ago when my university colleagues and  I decided to start a consulting company, it was more an attempt  at self-realization than a need to make money. Then came the  idea of territorial development with the help of outside  investors--a structure vested with sufficient powers, organized  in order to carry out a concrete task needed by the city, with  the right to make operational decisions. The idea was further  developed and fine-tuned in the mayoralty's economic development  committee. The city hopes that setting up a whole network of  such agencies will help attract additional investment.    We have already registered a territorial agency for the  development of the northwestern part of Vasilyevskiy Island. The  plan calls for construction of a large business center in  undeveloped territories of Vasilyevskiy Island with the help of  foreign investment. Part of the revenue from the center's  operation will go toward meeting the needs of the city.  Companies will be registered in the rayon, which means that  taxes and rents (which will be high) also will produce revenue  for the rayon. The Vasilyevskiy Island Development Fund is the  agency's cofounder. The money going into the local budget from  business center utilization (which will be considerable) will be  used to build apartments for those on the waiting list; in the  social sphere, elimination of communal apartment living, and  reconstruction of old buildings. We are talking about very  specific projects that have the support of Vasileostrovskiy  Rayon administration. By the way, the head of the rayon  administration, Valeriy Golubev, also is running on our  coalition's slate.    [Lebedeva] It looks like while all Petersburg is not yet  part  of your coalition, you have a good chance of bringing the entire  Vasilyevskiy Island to your side.    [Filippov] By selecting this name for our coalition--which  an  "Itogi" correspondent recently attributed to our ambition--we  only wanted to emphasize that the list of candidates our  coalition is going to put on the ballot is open to all city  residents. I thought it especially important because right now,  despite democratic window dressing, the population is virtually  removed from the opportunity to influence what is happening in  the city. Even those services that operated during stagnant  times no longer function. It is rare for a resident's petition  or complaint to get a reply. The letters department in a  newspaper has become an anachronism. Any talk of social activism  of the population, or development of self-rule is perceived  almost as retrograde. Meanwhile, for instance, in Switzerland,  which is comparable in population size to St. Petersburg, city  residents only need to collect 5,000 signatures to put any  problem to a vote in the form of legislative initiative--from  regulating store hours on holidays to the need to adopt new  legislation on the press. To bring the problem to the federal  level requires 50,000 signatures. Our coalition has collected  almost as many on All Petersburg signature lists. So perhaps  residents of our city, too, should engage without delay in  resolution of St. Petersburg's urgent problems.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Germans aim to lift British purchases Daimler-Benz has set up a subsidiary to co-ordinate plans for increasing component purchases in the UK. The group, which includes truck and carmaker Mercedes Benz, AEG and Deutsche Aerospace, says it is spending Pounds 200m a year in the UK. The new company, Daimler-Benz Purchasing Co-ordination (UK), will be based at Mercedes' headquarters in Milton Keynes. The group says it intends to increase purchases made outside Germany - in other countries as well as the UK - from 17 per cent to 25 per cent of spending. This represents additional spending outside Germany of DM4bn, or just more than Pounds 1.5bn. Mr Peter Stangl, the new company's managing director, said: 'We want to make even more use of the British procurement market. Prices are competitive and standards are high, so there are many opportunities for suppliers.' New car sales will exceed 2m this year for the first time since 1990, the motor finance arm of National Westminster Bank said yesterday. The forecast, by far the most optimistic from any industry source, was made by Lombard Motor Finance. About one in five of all new cars purchased by a finance arrangement goes through Lombard.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has assured  all public servants that their future is safe after the  elections. In a statement the TEC asks public servants to give  their full support to assure good administration and security  during the elections. They are not to take part in disruptive  activities such as strikes. The statement referred public  servants to the provisions of the new constitution that provides  for any person employed in any government department on 27 April  to be retained in service after elections.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: BP-Statoil's joint project in Azerbaijan may cost Dollars 3bn THE BP-Statoil alliance expects to invest up to USDollars 3bn on the development of the Chirakh oilfield in Azerbaijan, according to an internal Statoil document that also spells out development plans The two companies have been reluctant to produce investment figures because of fears that negotiations now under way might be adversely affected. The Anglo-Norwegian alliance, which holds a 50 per cent stake in the field, aims to complete negotiations with Azerbaijani officials in mid-1993 on development terms and conditions. Socar, the Azerbaijani state oil company, holds the other 50 per cent. Of the Alliance total shareholding, Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, holds 18 per cent, which means it will invest up to Nkr3bn (Pounds 285m) to cover its share of development costs. That would be the biggest investment ever made by Statoil outside Norway and would have to be approved by the government and possibly by the parliament. Chirakh's oil reserves are estimated to be between 1bn and 1.5bn barrels of oil. It also has some gas. One steel platform substructure is already in the field and two others are under construction in Baku, Azerbaijan's capital. According to preliminary plans, two drilling platforms at present under construction are aimed to be installed in the field at the end of 1995 with 20 wells drilled from each. In addition, the process platform may be installed at the end of 1996 and produce oil from 1997. A third drilling platform is to be installed in 1997 from which 50 wells will be drilled. Production from the field is expected to be reached by 1999 at a rate of 200,000 barrels a day. The alliance will build the platforms locally but the modules will have to be built in the West and transported via the Black Sea or the Baltic. One 36 inch diameter oil pipeline and a 28 inch diameter gas pipeline from Chirakh are planned to link to an 800,000 barrels of oil a day capacity oil terminal and a gas terminal with capacity to handle 4.3bn cubic metres annually. The oil is to be transported further through another pipeline to Iskenderun on the Turkish Mediterranean sea coast while the gas will be used locally.</p>

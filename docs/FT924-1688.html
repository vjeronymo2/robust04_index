			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Retailers set to defy Sunday trade ruling THE European Court of Justice threw the retail trade into confusion yesterday, as it ruled laws regulating Sunday trading in England and Wales did not clash with European trade laws and were enforceable. But many retailers said they would go ahead with plans to open this Sunday - the last before Christmas. They joined with MPs and both sides in the Sunday trading debate in calling for the speedy introduction of new legislation to replace the 1950 Shops Act. 'The government should bring forward proposals on Sunday trading as a matter of urgency so that the present real mess can be cleared up without delay,' said Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary. The Keep Sunday Special campaign group welcomed the decision. Mr Bill Connor, deputy general secretary of the shopworkers' union Usdaw, said it was 'good news for shopworkers under pressure to work on Sundays'. Retailers including supermarket chains J. Sainsbury, Asda and Tesco and B&amp;Q, the DIY chain, said they would open this Sunday, although some said they would seek legal advice about future Sunday trading. The Shopping Hours Reform Council, which proposes partial deregulation of Sunday trading, played down the ruling, saying it had been 'made politically irrelevant by the government's plans to introduce new legislation on shopping hours'. It added that it expected many local councils would not be prepared to spend time and money enforcing a dying law. Even some of the councils that have most actively enforced the law in the past said yesterday they would wait until the ruling had been ratified by the House of Lords. This was in spite of a statement from Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, that local councils could continue to issue summonses or seek injunctions The European court was ruling on three separate cases referred to it by English courts seeking verification of the Shops Act. It rejected retailers' arguments that limited hours reduced their need to import goods from EC countries, resulting in a barrier to trade that contravened Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome. MPs are due next month to debate a private member's bill sponsored by Mr Ray Powell, Labour MP for Ogmore, which would allow only limited Sunday opening. This is seen as unlikely to become law, but Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, plans to present an 'options' bill allowing MPs to choose between total or partial deregulation or limited Sunday opening.

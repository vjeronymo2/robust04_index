			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cameroon has officially requested an emergency UN  Security Council meeting following, I quote, the brutal attacks  launched recently by the Nigerian Armed Forces in the border  Bakassi Peninsula. In a letter addressed to the Security  Council, which was made public in New York yesterday,  Cameroonian Foreign Minister Ferdinand Oyono said that on 18  February, the Nigerian Armed Forces launched brutal attacks  against Cameroonian troops stationed at Bakassi Peninsula in  violation of the territorial integrity of Cameroon. My  government reiterates its determination to resolve this dispute  through peaceful means in full compliance with the objectives  and principles of the UN Charter, Oyono stated adding that  Cameroon will continue to seek the appropriate international  channels for resolving this issue.    Meanwhile, French diplomacy has been activated. After  Yaounde, a French diplomatic and military delegation went to  Abuja, Nigeria, where it met with President Sani Abacha.  Nothing filtered from that meeting but it is known that the  Nigerian Government stated yesterday that this conflict could be  resolved bilaterally. The same feelings are shared by the  radical Cameroonian opposition. Social Democratic Front Chairman  John Fru Ndi still believes in dialogue in order to prevent the  worst. We have on the line, Mr. Fru Ndi whose statement is  translated by Mohamed Youssoufou Saliou.    [Begin Fru Ndi recording, in English with superimposed  translation into French] I do not think that Cameroon's border  problems with our neighbors Nigeria, Chad, or others should lead  to a civil war. I think we should hold dialogue with those  countries in the African way and we should try to resolve the  problems of our border peoples, but if we have to resort to war  it will only result in dividing our continent. I am convinced  that the problem could be resolved at the OAU. In Cameroon, we  have about 2 million Nigerians and in Nigeria we have some  800,000 Cameroonians studying or doing business. Having said  this, I believe good neighborliness must be encouraged instead  of seeking to provoke a civil war that will divide our people.  [end recording]</p>

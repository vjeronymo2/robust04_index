			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Call for Guatemalan congress to resign GUATEMALA'S President Ramiro de Leon is winning increasing support for his call for the resignation of all 116 members of congress and supreme court magistrates. The President's move followed weeks of criticism in the media and among civil organisations which have called for a purge of both organisations, widely believed to be riddled with corruption. Union leaders and indigenous groups have backed the President this week. So far about 70 congressmen have offered their resignations, mostly to the Instancia Nacional de Consenso, an umbrella group of civic organisations which was instrumental in restoring democratic government after former president Jorge Serrano's failed attempt to seize authoritarian powers in May. Mr de Leon, formerly Guatemala's highly respected and combative human rights ombudsman, was elected by congress on June 6, following the constitutional crisis triggered by Mr Serrano's attempted takeover. However, Mr de Leon is taking a gamble that popular support will force congress to resign. He has threatened a referendum on the issue if congressmen do not stand down. The vote could not be held before November, and the delay would undermine the President's ability to push through legislation. 'If he gets the active support of the people he may succeed,' says Mr Emilio Arroyave, a political analyst at Asies, a local think tank. 'If not we will have a serious confrontation on our hands which could undermine the President.' Mr de Leon called his attempt to clean up congress and the courts 'a national crusade against impunity and corruption in response to popular clamour,' in a recent televised address.</p>

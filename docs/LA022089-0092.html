			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE KILL MAN THEY SAY WAS RUSHING THEM WITH WEAPONS  </P> <P> A Huntington Beach man who "charged" at two police officers with martial arts  weapons in each hand was shot and killed Sunday in a home on a quiet  residential street, police said.  </P> <P> It was the third fatal police shooting in Orange County in 3 weeks.  </P> <P> Police responded to a disturbance call at a house in the 6800 block of Red  Coach Drive about 1:15 p.m. and were confronted by Alan Edward Norried, 26,  Huntington Beach Police Sgt. William Stuart said.  </P> <P> "He had some kind of an Okinawan karate weapon" in one hand and a nunchaku in  the other hand, Stuart said. "Apparently he charged toward the officers and  they opened fire."  </P> <P> Neither of the officers was injured and their names were not released.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Investigations Sgt. W.C. Peterson said officers were  called to the residence by a neighbor reporting a disturbance. Upon arriving,  they heard noise inside the home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Police Confronted  </P> <P> The officers "called into the home and were admitted to the home where they  were confronted by Alan Norried," according to Peterson.  </P> <P> "Norried advanced on officers with a martial arts-type weapon in each hand," he  said. "Repeated demands by officers to drop the weapons and freeze . . . were  ignored and the officers retreated for their safety."  </P> <P> When "Norried reached a point very close to the officers and they were in  danger of serious injury, two officers fired at Norried," Peterson said. He was  pronounced dead at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center.  </P> <P> Both officers were placed on administrative leave with pay, in keeping with  department policy, Peterson said. Police declined to comment further on the  case, referring inquiries to the Orange County district attorney's office,  which was investigating the matter as is standard procedure for  officer-involved shootings.  </P> <P> One Red Coach Drive neighbor who asked that she not be identified said police  had been to the residence where Norried was shot on prior occasions. Stuart  said he could not verify that claim Sunday night.  </P> <P> Norried's parents have lived at the residence about 15 years and he  occasionally lived there with them, the neighbor said. Yet the man and his  family were not particularly well known in the neighborhood, she said.  </P> <P> Stuart said the Okinawan karate weapon held by Norried was "a sai," which  originally was a farm implement.  </P> <P> "One pointed end is used for thrusting and stabbing movements" while the other,  forked end is used "to catch wrists, clothing or other weapons an opponent may  have," he said. "It is used to twist, lock or disable an opponent."  </P> <P> The nunchaku is a martial arts weapon consisting of two sticks connected with a  rope or chain, Stuart said.  </P> <P> The death was the third fatal police shooting in Orange County since Jan. 20,  when Dennis Paul Gonzales, 20, of Garden Grove was shot to death in a volley of  gunfire by two Garden Grove policemen responding to a disturbance call at a  residence.  </P> <P> Police said the officers opened fire only after seeing Gonzales point what  later was determined to be a toy gun at them. Three eyewitnesses to the  shooting disputed the police version of the incident, although a district  attorney's investigator said preliminary investigation cast doubt on the  witnesses' account.  </P> <P> On Feb. 2 police shot and killed an unarmed man outside an Anaheim motel room  near Disneyland, where his wife and 9-year-old stepson were waiting for him to  return from an errand.  </P> <P> Robert Vincent Edson, 28, of Orange, died of a single gunshot wound when two  uniformed Anaheim police officers fired 10 shots at him following an auto  chase. Police said Edson had appeared to reach for a weapon on the second-floor  balcony of the motel.  </P> <P> Edson's friends said the man led police on a 45-minute chase when they tried to  stop him for a traffic violation because he was driving with a suspended  license and could not afford auto insurance.  </P> <P> The Edson shooting also is under investigation by the county district attorney.  </P> <P> On Feb. 4 the district attorney's office cleared Newport Beach police of  wrongdoing in the shooting of an unarmed Liberian immigrant along the beach  last Labor Day weekend.  </P> <P> Sundaga Bryant, a Santa Ana resident, was critically wounded in his arms and  torso by a single blast from the officer Derek Duncan's 12-gauge shotgun. The  officer said he mistook a portable radio that Bryant carried for a gun.  </P> <P> The Newport Beach officer "reasonably and honestly, albeitly mistakenly,  believed that he was being confronted by a life-threatening danger,"  investigators from the district attorney's office concluded in ruling out  criminal charges.  </P> <P> Bryant, 26 at the time, has sued the city of Newport Beach and Duncan for $1  million.  </P> <P> In recent years there have been a number of fatal shootings by Huntington Beach  police. On Sept. 22, 1988, the son of a Los Angeles County sheriff's lieutenant  was shot to death by an officer who responded to a disturbance at a Jamaica  Circle home where the man appeared at the door with a gun.  </P> <P> In 1985 two men were killed by Huntington Beach police. On Aug. 1, 1985, a  Huntington Beach police officer shot and killed a man who threatened him and  others with a knife at a Wildrose Lane home. And on April 13, 1985, a  Huntington Beach police officer killed a robbery suspect when he responded to a  silent burglar alarm and was confronted by two men at a shop near Main Street.  </P></p>

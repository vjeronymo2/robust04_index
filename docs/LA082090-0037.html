			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I.A. LEWIS, 68; DIRECTOR OF THE L.A. TIMES POLL  </P> <P> I. A. (Bud) Lewis, director of the Los Angeles Times Poll since its inception  in 1979 and prior to that a respected pollster for CBS and NBC who was credited  with conducting the first canvass of voters as they left their polling places,  died Saturday.  </P> <P> Lewis was 68 and had been diagnosed with cancer earlier this month at Glendale  Adventist Medical Center, where he died.  </P> <P> He came to the relatively new art of polling after writing for Dave Garroway on  the original "Today" show. He delighted in telling colleagues how each day he  would try to create accompanying dialogue for whatever antics had been sketched  out for J. Fred Muggs, the chimpanzee Garroway used on the daytime talk and  information show.  </P> <P> That was in 1956-57, a few years after he had returned from Germany, where he  had been a civilian employee of the Armed Forces Network working as a news  writer and bureau chief.  </P> <P> He then worked for United Press International and for Armed Forces Radio before  joining the Garroway unit at NBC.  </P> <P> Lewis, born Irwin Albert Lewis, next joined the NBC election unit and became  its director of polling in 1966 and director of elections in 1969.  </P> <P> Frank Jordan, former director of the NBC election unit, said Lewis -- as  director of polling -- was the first to station his workers outside precincts  asking voters how they had marked their ballots.  </P> <P> That was in the off-presidential year elections of 1966 and the samplings were  taken in U.S. Senate races in a few selected states. The results provided an  early, accurate edge in predicting the outcome of races. Exit polls since have  become a staple of the industry, sometimes angering candidates who believe that  West Coast voters may stay at home when they believe elections have already  been decided by their counterparts in earlier time zones.  </P> <P> In 1976, Lewis joined CBS News as director of polling for the CBS News/New York  Times Poll, leaving for the Roper (polling) Organization the following year.  </P> <P> Two years later he came to this newspaper.  </P> <P> A graduate of Princeton University and a veteran of Air Force Intelligence  service in the China-Burma-India theater during World War II, Lewis is survived  by his wife, Allison, and four daughters.  </P> <P> Funeral services are pending at Forest Lawn Glendale.  </P></p>

			<p>Exceeding   5nm Emerges for Development and Production of 0.25  micron LSI   <F P=102> 94FE0436A Tokyo NIKKEI MICRODEVICES in Japanese Mar 94 pp  50-56---FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0436A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI MICRODEVICES </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text]    In the development of 0.25 m LSI, several SEM makers  are  introducing technology to measure circuit lines with high  precision reaching 5nm. The technology is urgently needed, and  each maker plans to incorporate it in its equipment. Since the  problem of SEM surfaced through questionnaires conducted by  SEMI, it was clear that SEM technology was urgently needed after  0.35 m. In 0.35 m, 0.25 m technology will be  incorporated. Each SEM maker will seek short term measurement  for improvement, and will reduce the charge-up contamination.  Some makers might attempt to lower voltage acceleration to less  than 500 volts. In view of stability, this time mainly the TFE  model electron gun will be employed for SEM.    Aiming at less than 5nm precision rendering measurement  needed for manufacture of 0.25 m LSI represented by 256  MDRAM, SEM makers will install technology for high precision  measurement within 1994 (see figure 1 and figure 2.) Because low  voltage is increasingly demanded, it is essential to reduce  inconsistent measurement of line width, and improvement in high  precision is urgently needed (see figure 3).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-40A>      Figure 1.

In Transistor, Influence From Inconsistent Gate </FIG>     In order to improve the development of the technology, it is  essential to understand the present status of measurement  technology. For the purpose of standardizing the equipment, the  SEMI Standardization Committee, which is the international  organization for LSI manufacturers and material makers,  distributed a questionnaires in Japan, U.S., and Europe between  1992 and 1993. As a result, it was realized that even the  existing technology of EB measurement will not be adequate to  interface with high precision measurement (details will be  discussed later).  <H5>  Improvement For Rendering High Precision Measurement </H5> Urgently Needed    It is said that in the era of 0.25 m, low 1 volt  devices  will be needed as notebook type personal computers and portable  cellular phones are in great demand. Thus, it is necessary to  reduce the tolerance level from 10% to ``5%'' in  circuit line  width (Engineer at NEC's R&amp;D Center - ULSI Devices).    In order to reduce the production of inconsistent line  widths, lithography and etching processes must be controlled  with high precision. And the problem of this kind ``will be  solved by employing new processing technology'' (Process  Engineer at Hitachi's R&amp;D Center). However ``improvement for  precise measurement is rather urgently needed'' (Process  Engineer at NEC's R&amp;D Center - ULSI Devices). In order to  guarantee 5% tolerance of line width, high precision  measurement of less than 5 nm must be obtained.  <H5>  By Reducing Charge Up And Contamination, Measurement </H5> Rendering 5 nm Is Sought    SEM makers have been working on the development of precision  measurement with emphasis placed on (1) consistency for short  term; and (2) consistency for mid term, in order to respond the  needs of LSI makers. Within the year, SEM will be incorporated.  <H5>  Consistency For Short Term Improved by Reduction Of Charge-Up </H5>   For the developing site, the objective of (1) short term  rendering measurement with about 30 repetition must be improved.  For this reason, SEM makers have developed the technology in  which line width is variably changed with a short period of  time, and reduced (1) charge up and (2) pattern contamination.  At present, especially Topcon of the EB Business Group is trying  to reduce charge up which largely influences the quality of the  image and processing.    For example Topcon succeeded in reducing the charge up by  lowering the accelerating voltage to less than 500 V with  secondary main power equipment. Since secondary electrons are  captured from the very surface of the wafer, pattern edge  necessary at the time of measurement and detailed image at the  bottom surface of the pattern are obtained. Within the year,  Topcon said, ``the development will achieve 3nm resolution and  5nm (3 sigma) rendering measurement.''    In order not to reduce the resolution even with low  acceleration, a 500V/mm electrical field in the pattern part,  and 1,000 gauss magnetic field are added, and the secondary  electron beam coming from the bottom of pattern was collected  efficiently. Also even with a low acceleration voltage,  electromagnetic lens aberration is reduced to 1/5th.    On the other hand, a new comer, Nikon, came up with a new  and  unique method of employing electrically conductive gas in the  chamber, and ``this is effective for reduction of charge up''  (Nikon SEM designer). Even with 3 kV, a relatively high  acceleration voltage, charge up can be prevented, beam diameter  can be narrowed to about 10 nm, and 5 nm resolution can be  achieved. By improving the electromagnetic lens, they aim to  achieve 5 nm rendering measurement.  <H5>  Problem Of Pattern Contamination Suddenly Surfaced </H5>   Pattern contamination also will influence the precision of  rendering measurement. Traditionally, it was thought that  distortion of direction of secondary electron beam by charge up  causes this problem. However, because always line widths tend to  increase regardless of negative or positive electrical load, it  was pointed out that the problem is not because of distortion by  observational electrons, but it is due to the formation of a  wide pattern by contamination.    Hitachi is tackling the problem based on the notion that  degassing from the wafer, and contaminants coming from a reverse  direction, from the exhaust system are the cause. So, the  problem is being solved by looking at the reduction of exhaust  resistance, pump material, and structural design. From  experience in the development of ultra high particle  decomposition SEM that is quite sensitive to contamination, ``we  know how to solve this problem'' (Hitachi). Hitachi is confident  that it can solve this problem and indicates that the problem  will be solved using the currently installed equipment.  <H5>  Shifted To Radiation Model By Thermal Field Emission </H5>   In a mass production line in which measurement is frequently  done, the objective described in (2) above, mid term, about a  day of rendering precision will become a problem. Quite a few  LSI makers say that the problem is caused by cold field emission  (CFE) from the electric gun. A flashing operation that cleans  the surface of the electron gun with a large current may lower  the consistency of measurement. At present, Hitachi's ``S-6000  Series'' which has an 80% of market share in SEM, employs  this  CFE type. Each LSI maker now is considering the employment of  thermal field emission (TFE) which does not require flashing.    Since the CFE model produces minimal spreading of the  electron beam, it is advantageous for high resolution. Although  at present this point is indisputable, at the time before and  after flashing, the measured value fluctuates, and ``precision  is lowered'' (process engineer at a major LSI maker). On the  other hand, the TFE model is disadvantageous because of low  resolution.    However it is said by SEM makers that employ TFE, that by  improving the electromagnetic lens, resolution was ``improved  more than that of CFE model.'' ``If data compatibility is  disregarded, the model can be used right a way,'' said a major  LSI maker which has a mass production line using the CFE model.    Responding to the needs of LSI makers, Hitachi finally plans  to market TFE from 1994. Hitachi says, ``resolution has not yet  reached the level of CFE,'' so the company will manufacture two  models in parallel. However, for consistency level, ``main  equipment will be shifted to TFE'' said Hitachi pointing to  competitors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 18 (BTA) -- A Bulgarian delegation, led  by Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, which arrived on an  official visit to Turkey on May 16, met with representatives of  the Turkish business community in Istanbul today, Bulgarian  national radio special correspondent Apostol Saruivanov  reported. At the meeting, Mr. Farzat Kucani, chairman of the  Council for External Economic Relations, set forth the Turkish  businessmen's views of the state of trade and economic contacts  between Bulgaria and Turkey, as well as of the opportunities for  their expansion. Bilateral trade, which has been around 300  million U.S. dollars in the last few years, is seen as too low  for the considerably larger potential of the two neighbouring  countries, the sides agreed. Mr. Kucani discussed the prospects  for cooperation which requires assistance and decisions of the  government authorities. He said that Turkish companies are  ready to share in the modernization of the Port of Burgas (on  the Black Sea), of tourist facilities in the area of Burgas, and  in the construction and implementation of other projects in  Bulgaria.    For his part, Mr. Daskalov pointed out that common  understanding had been reached at the talks in Ankara to draft  agreements on the avoidance of double taxation and on reciprocal  investment protection and promotion. These agreements are  expected to be signed during the visit of Bulgarian President  Zhelyu Zhelev to Turkey.    Mr. Daskalov visited Turkey to arrange the forthcoming visit  of President Zhelev to Ankara and a visit to Bulgaria by Turkish  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. During his stay, the chief  Bulgarian diplomat met with his Turkish counterpart Hikmet Cetin  and with the President of Turkish Grand National Assembly  Husamettin Cindoruk. Yesterday Mr. Daskalov was received by the  president of Turkey Suleyman Demirel. The two countries'  foreign ministers yesterday signed a protocol on expansion of  bilateral cooperation. Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokesman  Radko Vlaykov said at a news briefing today that this is an  important document as it specifies areas of future cooperation  between Bulgaria and Turkey. From Istanbul, Mr. Daskalov is  scheduled to leave on a working visit to London.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNTY SPENDING PRIORITIES  </P> <P> After reading Joe Domanick's commentary on "L.A. Turns Its Back on Its People"  (Commentary, June 20), I was appalled to see the cuts our county Board of  Supervisors are planning to make in vital humans services -- closing down to  more mental health clinics, in addition to the nine already closed; closing the  only children's hospital in the county system, the Pediatric Pavilion at  County-USC Medical Center; eliminating all pediatric services from Martin  Luther King Hospital; drastically reducing outpatient services and shutting  down 41 public health centers.  </P> <P> By failing to supervise and discipline the Sheriff's Department, the county has  had to pay more than $8.5 million in judgments to victims of excessive force  and brutality in the last three years. In the past year the County Department  of Children's Services has paid more than $18 million in settlements because it  has taken children who were abused and neglected and placed them in foster  homes where they were again abused, sexually molested, beaten and neglected.  </P> <P> The county's problems are part of a larger problem that pervades our whole  society and threatens to destroy our democratic system -- a lack of  responsibility. How can we expect our elected officials to act responsibly and  serve the needs of the people when the people are sending the politicians the  message that they don't care enough about their government even to vote.  </P> <P> Recently, I went up to Sacramento to lobby the state Legislature for increased  funding of our social programs -- for education, health care, children's  services, etc. What I heard there was very discouraging. The state has a $3.6  billion shortfall in the budget, and funding for the social welfare programs  will be cut rather than increased. Gov. George Deukmejian intends to leave this  problem for the Democratic majority in the Legislature and the next governor to  deal with. That way, the Republicans can demagogue the issue again and blame  the Democrats for raising taxes or making drastic cuts in social services.  </P> <P> When I attempted to encourage legislators to show a little political courage  and deal responsibly with our state's problems, I was told that the people  don't care anyway. Look at the low voter turnout in this June's primary  election. It's politics as usual in Sacramento.  </P> <P> There is a saying that people get the kind of government they deserve. But how  about the abused and neglected children, the working poor with no health  insurance, the mentally ill and the homeless? How about those of us who do try  to exercise our civic duties by becoming informed voters, studying the issues  and candidates' records, writing to and visiting our legislators, etc. Is this  the government that we deserve?  </P> <P> CAROL MILLER  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

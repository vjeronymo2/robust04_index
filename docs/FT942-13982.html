			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Town halls accused of bid rigging Some councils appear to be rigging the bidding for refuse-collection contracts to ensure they are won by their own direct-service organisations, says a survey to be published next week. The survey presents evidence that some councils are encouraging their direct-service organisations to win contracts by submitting low bids that would involve making a loss. Additional payments are made after the contract has been awarded so that the organisation meets its statutory target of a 5 per cent return on capital. The result is that average savings are greater with a private contractor than with the direct-service organisation. Average expenditure has fallen by 22.7 per cent where private companies win contracts, compared with 17.3 per cent for contracts won by in-house teams. The survey, by Professor Stefan Szymanski of Imperial College, London, analyses costs of refuse collection for 280 of the 365 English local authorities involved, using data collected by the Department of the Environment. Two-thirds of council refuse-collection contracts have been won by direct-service organisations. The survey shows that compulsory competitive tendering has cut refuse-collection costs in England by about 20 per cent, saving roughly Pounds 100m a year. These savings are higher than the 12.4 per cent quoted by the environment department. The average cost of refuse collection per household in successful contracts is the same for both private contractors and direct-service organisations. But the amount actually paid with a direct-service organisation once the contract is in operation is higher than with private companies. This could be explained by additional payments made to direct-service organisations to help them earn the required rate of return, says Prof Szymanski. A 'politically-motivated local authority' might boost the income of the direct-service organisation by 'additional exceptional payments or rewriting elements of the contract, all of which could be justified legally', he says.

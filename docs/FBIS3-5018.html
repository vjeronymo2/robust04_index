			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Armed Forces Chief Gen. Lisandro Abadia admitted  yesterday the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] continues to  be plagued by factionalism within its rank and file. Without  identifying the supposed factions, the retiring AFP top man was  obviously referring to the rebellious Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang  Makabansa [RAM], Soldiers of the Filipino People, and the Young  Officers Union (RAM-SFP-YOU). The group which is headed by  cashiered Army Col. Gregorio Honasan has been responsible for  the series of attempts to overthrow the former Aquino Government.    "Factionalism still hounds the AFP. The RAM, for instance,  is still making the rounds among AFP personnel. Umiikot pa rin  sila [They are still moving]," Abadia said when interviewed  during yesterday's commemoration of the February 1986  Revolution. Abadia was referring to the series of consultations  of RAM in various military camps aimed at popularizing the  ongoing peace process among soldiers and military personnel.    He likewise scored the persistence of the "bata-bata  [patronage] system" in the military establishment which, he  said, contributes to the harboring of discontent among AFP  officers. "We should really go back to the merit system in the  promotion of our officers. We should do away with the bata-bata  systems," he said.    Abadia recently revealed he had been asked by several  politicians and businessmen to stage a coup before the national  elections in 1992. But he said he flatly refused the overtures  made by the group saying he wanted to give democracy a chance.  [passage omitted]    In a related news, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon said  the  government should not be faulted for the delay in the release of  six RAM members contrary to complaints aired by the RAM. Drilon,  in a memorandum for President Ramos said Sergeants Alberto  Caoili, Fernando Casanova, and Victoriano Cordova have been  confined in respective local jails pursuant to the order of the  courts and can only be released upon the order of said courts  which acquired jurisdiction over their respective cases. He said  that appropriate motions for the temporary release of the three  on recognizance were filed but the courts concerned denied the  said motions. Clearly, he said, the prosecution cannot be held  responsible for their continued detention.    Caoili and Cordova are facing charges of illegal possession  of firearms and ammunition. The nature of Casanova's case was  not established, though it was reported to be a bailable one. On  the other hand, Drilon said Sergeants Antonio Soriano, Orlando  Ayeras, and Willy Marayag were not among the RAM/SFP/YOU members  in the list which was the subject of the president's order for  release dated 23 December 1992.</p>

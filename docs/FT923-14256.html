			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / German companies with Iraqi trade links raided THE German authorities carried out a huge operation yesterday to seize documents from nine German companies which are suspected of illegally exporting weapons materials to Iraq, AP reports from Darmstadt. The action in the western Rhineland area was part of ongoing government attempts to track down businesses that supplied Iraq with parts for President Saddam Hussein's nuclear weapons programme. The Darmstadt prosecutor's office said that 400 customs investigation officials and 11 state prosecutors were involved in the series of raids against the suspected companies. The case against the companies, which were not named, is based on a report issued in January by United Nations weapons inspectors. The UN's report cited evidence that Iraq was trying to build special centrifuges which are needed to produce enriched uranium used for assembling nuclear weapons. Companies throughout Germany were said to be implicated in the supply of parts. Stung by criticism that German companies for many years sold arms to foreign dictators, the country's parliament gave the go-ahead in February for tough new weapons export controls.</p>

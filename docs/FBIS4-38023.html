			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Yahya al-Mutawakkil by </F> Shakir al-Jawhari in Sanaa; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Al-Jawhari] Mr. Minister, I would like to start  this interview by asking you to explain a phenomenon that I do  not understand. How did you manage to control the security  situation during war times better than during peace when many  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders were targets for  assassinations, which was one of the reasons for the current  crisis in Yemen?    [Al-Mutawakkil] We thank God that the security situation  fares well in spite of the existence of a conspiracy to  undermine and sabotage institutions. We have unraveled many  chapters of this conspiracy. In spite of this conspiracy, one  can note that the security situation is satisfactory, and I hope  this will remain so for a long time. [passage omitted]    [Al-Jawhari] Can you give us examples of the sabotage  operations that citizens have been tasked to carry out and which  they have revealed to you, as well as who tasked them to do so?    [Al-Mutawakkil] We have discovered many sabotage operations,  including plans to blow up the television station building, and  many bridges on public routes, power plants, and oil pumps.    Some of the operations were carried out. However, thanks to  God, they were unsuccessful. A device was detonated on the oil  pipeline from Ma'rib to al-Sarif [name as transliterated] Port  near al-Hudaydah. But, the citizens quickly repaired the  damage. The perpetrators were identified and we arrested some  of their relatives. We now are looking for the perpetrators  with the help of their relatives.    [Al-Jawhari] To which side do those involved in the sabotage  operations that were discovered before they were implemented  belong?    [Al-Mutawakkil] Most of them are mercenaries who are ready  to  work for the party that pays them. Some confessed that the YSP  paid them money, while others said they were YSP members.    Their arrest has also revealed to us that some of them  collaborated with leading figures within the YSP in carrying out  the assassination attempts against the party's leaders. We will  try these elements at the appropriate time. [passage omitted]    [Al-Jawhari] House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh  'Abdallah al-Ahmar said that Tariq al-Fadli was set free. How  can he and others be released without trial?    [Al-Mutawakkil] I would like to clarify here that those who  were detained in Aden and Lahij were released in view of the  present battle because the prison doors were open. They came  out and some of them are fighting.    [Al-Jawhari] Fighting with whom?    [Al-Mutawakkil] Some are fighting with the forces of  legitimacy and others against it. Tariq al-Fadli is the only  one to be released on bail because the public prosecutor, as  yet, has not indicted him. Therefore, and in view of the  extraordinary circumstances, he was released on bail on  condition that he appear before the court as soon as conditions  enabling the court to convene are made available.    [Al-Jawhari] Who put up the bail for him?    [Al-Mutawakkil] One of the shaykhs of the al-Fadli clan.    [Al-Jawhari] And who ordered his release?    [Al-Mutawakkil] The public prosecutor. No one objected to  this decision. We did not object because we are passing through  extraordinary circumstances. While he was under arrest, he used  to ask that he be tried. Aden used to ask that he be tried in  Aden, while we believe he should be tried in Sanaa. He insisted  on being tried because he said he was innocent. He gave himself  up because he was certain of his innocence. When the war broke  out, several shaykhs pledged that he would present himself to  court when asked to do so. The public prosecution agreed to  this and we did not object. [passage omitted]    [Al-Jawhari] Has his interrogation disclosed that he is a  member of the Jihad group?    [Al-Mutawakkil] I am not sure of this but the information we  have indicates that he is.    [Al-Jawhari] And did he fight in Afghanistan?    [Al-Mutawakkil] I am not sure of this, as he was arrested  before I took office.    [Al-Jawhari] According to the information you have as  interior minister, is there any relationship between the Jihad  group and any other group in the country?    [Al-Mutawakkil] The prevalence of democracy following unity  has enabled political parties to work in a healthy atmosphere.  The Islamic parties were among the parties that exercised their  political role with complete freedom, and emerged in the Yemeni  arena as an influential, positive, and constructive force that  rejects terrorism. From this premise, any Islamic grouping,  whatever the name it assumes, if it does not apply for a  license, will be considered illegal if it carries out any  activity. This is because it will be viewed as an unlicensed  party.    [Al-Jawhari] Has the Jihad organization applied for a  license?    [Al-Mutawakkil] No, and I think it is not qualified to be a  party.    [Al-Jawhari] Why?    [Al-Mutawakkil] Because it consists of very small groups.  There are two major Islamic parties, the Yemeni Reform Grouping  and the al-Maqarr Party [name as published]. These two parties  represent all the politically active members of the religious  community.    The elements of the Jihad are very few and cannot form a  party or attract anybody. Their work is mostly guided.    [Al-Jawhari] You have said that the Jihad organization is  not qualified to be a party. Do you mean that it is not  qualified because of reasons that have to do with it or because  of objective reasons related to the Parties Law?    [Al-Mutawakkil] Reasons related to the party itself because  any party should have a minimum of 1,500 members, as I recall,  before it can operate.    [Al-Jawhari] What if the Jihad organization presents a list  including the required number of members, will you give them a  license as a party?    [Al-Mutawakkil] If they abide by the rules of the political  game and the laws and regulations and have enough members then  why not?    [Al-Jawhari] Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar says some members of  the Jihad are now fighting alongside the Socialist Party. Does  your information confirm this?    [Al-Mutawakkil] As far as I know, some of the people who  were imprisoned by the party because they were members of the  Jihad are now out. Some of them are now fighting alongside the  party. I think those people were employed by elements within  the party to play a certain role.    [Al-Jawhari] Perhaps they are fighting because they are  biased toward the south?    [Al-Mutawakkil] Some of the armed forces fighting with the  legitimacy are one hundred percent composed of southern  elements, including commanders and troops, and also the  al-Wahdah brigades in al-'Anad.    [Al-Jawhari] If the Jihad organization is illegal and some  of its elements have carried out terrorist operations and  assassinations, are all its members wanted by the security men  or is this confined to those who are involved in disrupting  security?    [Al-Mutawakkil] From a legal point of view, we can only  demand the elements that have carried out acts of sabotage.    [Al-Jawhari] But the law does not permit the existence of  illegal parties.    [Al-Mutawakkil] So far we have been dealing with the name  "Jihad" as an assumption because this name has not been  announced yet. The name was mentioned only in the confessions  of some defendants who said they belong to this organization.  We do not have sufficient evidence and documents that prove  such an organization exists.    [Al-Jawhari] President Mubarak said last November that some  elements in Yemen are involved in the terrorist incidents in  Egypt. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih told me then that you have  explained your point of view to Egypt. I assume there have been  contacts since then and that Egypt was not convinced of your  view, considering its current attitude. What took place in  these contacts? Have they given you documented information?    [Al-Mutawakkil] We have received Egyptian security men. We  have spoken to them and made it possible for them to see for  themselves that these charges are baseless.    When the president visited Egypt, I was with him. I met with  the Egyptian interior minister and we agreed to conclude an  agreement for security cooperation between the two countries to  prevent terrorism in Yemen and Egypt. Regrettably, however, the  agreement was not concluded because we were waiting for a  representative of the Egyptian interior minister to come to  Sanaa before we sign the agreement so that we can cooperate in  explaining the situation. They will either tell us what we don't  know about plots, camps, and elements, or we will explain the  opposite to them.    The representative did not show up and things developed the  way they are today. The time is not appropriate now to go to  Egypt and talk about signing the agreement.    Whether this has any reflection on Egypt's attitude toward  unity, we still hope that Egypt will preserve its historic role  in Yemen and sacrifices by siding with the people who adhere to  their unity. I would like to say that despite all the biased  statements, we have heard from President Mubarak -- during the  visits of Planning Minister al-Iryani, the foreign minister, and  'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Presidential Council --  reassurances that Egypt will side with unity despite the lack of  understanding of our stand toward the claims that we want to  impose unity by force. Unity was the result of popular  referendum and was bolstered through democratic elections. What  is happening now is an attempt to impose secession by force.    So far, they have not understood this, but attempts are  still  under way. We hope Egypt will continue to play a constructive  role to end the bloodshed and reach a common solution and  resolve differences with our neighbors who are concerned with  the current problem one way or another.    [Al-Jawhari] What did the Egyptian security officers who  came to Sanaa achieve?    [Al-Mutawakkil] The information, which they had obtained  from  persons here regarding the existence of terrorist training  camps, is untrue and unfounded. We sent these officers to the  places that they said contained these camps, but they found  nothing. They also made sure that the phone numbers they had  were not used in the country.    [Al-Jawhari] Jordanian newspapers said that some of those  who  were arrested for involvement in bombing operations in Jordan  early this year admitted that they had come to Yemen for  training and that Shaykh 'Abd-al-Mahjid al-Zindani,  representative of the Yemeni Reform Grouping in the Presidential  Council, received them, sent them to training camps, and gave  them money before they returned to Jordan. Did Jordan inform  you of this?    [Al-Mutawakkil] Never. It has not informed us of such a  matter at all. Our relations and ties with Jordan are so close  that Jordan would have informed us of that, if it had taken  place and we would have taken measures to clarify matters, but  we were not informed of anything.    [Al-Jawhari] To my knowledge, Jordan informed you of the  ambush to which a Jordan patrol was exposed in the township of  al-Karamah late last year--an ambush during which two Yemenis  were killed along with a third Jordanian citizen.    [Al-Mutawakkil] This is true. Yemenis exist everywhere. We  also do not deny there were Yemenis in Afghanistan and that  Bin-Ladin recruited them to carry out terrorist operations in  many places, including the recent bombings in Jordan. We are  with the Jordanian Government and with any other government  cooperating to confront terrorism, whether the terrorists are  Yemenis or not.    [Al-Jawhari] Did Bin-Ladin try to restore his Yemeni  nationality after his Saudi citizenship was withdrawn?    [Al-Mutawakkil] He did not try. Maybe he is in the  Democratic Republic of Yemen, to which some sultans, like  Bin-Salimah and others, have returned. Why shouldn't he too  return to it?    [Al-Jawhari] How many members of the YSP and the opposition  parties have you arrested on the sidelines of the current war?    [Al-Mutawakkil] I prefer that you pose this question to the  YSP and other parties.    [Al-Jawhari] In fact, I telephoned all my friends in these  parties and found them free, but I do not know the members of  all these parties.    [Al-Mutawakkil] I assure you that we have not arrested  anyone  because of his political affiliation, especially the YSP members  who declared their support for unity and who have helped us  confront the secession and reply to the forces of apostasy and  rebellion.    But we have discovered warehoused weapons and espionage  equipment inside Sanaa, including communications equipment, in  the possession of elements of the YSP security, which was called  the revolution's security. These weapons and equipment were  found in public warehouses and places. They were confiscated  and the perpetrators were arrested for questioning. Those who  were not tasked with any duties except warehousing were released.    [Al-Jawhari] What were the duties of the others?    [Al-Mutawakkil] Some elements from the north and the south  were tasked with carrying out terrorist operations in all the  northern governorates, particularly in Sanaa, as soon as the  dispute erupted. We stormed these weapons warehouses to arrest  the perpetrators, many of whom managed to escape. Some of them,  however, returned and said that they were ordered by the YSP  leadership to carry out such operations and that they were ready  to cooperate with the security forces. They are actually  cooperating with us to obtain new information.    [Al-Jawhari] How many YSP members are now in prison?    [Al-Mutawakkil] I assure you there are no YSP members in  prison. However, there are elements who do not belong to the  YSP but were ordered to carry out bombing operations. When we  questioned them, we discovered they were just mercenaries.    There are other people who possessed weapons belonging to  the  YSP. These were arrested and questioned for one week and were  freed. I assure you that every detained YSP member was  released. Undoubtedly, some people were kept after weapons were  found in their houses and after they were accused of acts of  hostility, but we released them after one or two weeks.    [Al-Jawhari] Have other people from other parties been  arrested?    [Al-Mutawakkil] No one from other parties was arrested.  [passage omitted]</p>

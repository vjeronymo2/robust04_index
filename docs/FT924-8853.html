			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Amstrad Mr Alan Sugar's Pounds 113m bid for the 65 per cent of Amstrad he does not already own equates almost exactly to the cash in the company's last balance sheet. Since much of the cash for the offer is being lent or guaranteed by the company, shareholders have every right to feel short-changed. In other circumstances it would certainly be worth pressing for a better price. Yet Mr Sugar maintains there is nothing more available - presumably because Amstrad cannot afford to lend him more. His scheme is perfectly legal, but it is more than disquieting to see the company lending the chief executive cash to buy its shares. The offer also raises old worries about the ethics of management buy-outs. The terms certainly look generous compared to the 19p share price before the intention to take the company private was announced. But then Mr Sugar was in the privileged position of knowing whether that price fairly valued the company. Amstrad will not pay a dividend for the foreseeable future if it remains a public company, but Mr Sugar will repay the bank out of dividends if the deal goes through. With no prospect of an outside bid, and the unpalatable alternative being to live with a disgruntled Mr Sugar, investors may just be glad to see the back of Amstrad. Mr Sugar's legendary antipathy towards the City must by now be fully reciprocated.</p>

Klaus said this before reporters  in response to a RUDE PRAVO question on Wednesday. He added  that the original promises that this matter "will be settled in  October, December, February, and March are being constantly  postponed." Klaus considers the transfer of the RFE from "a  clearly government, state institution to another" an additional  problem. Businessman Soros would "participate as a co-owner" in  dealing with the latter problem. If this happened, the entire  problem would move, according to the prime minister, to an  entirely different level.</p>

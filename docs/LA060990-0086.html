			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN SNUBS U.S. DEMANDS ON PUBLIC WORKS SPENDING  </P> <P> Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said Friday that he would not give in to a key  U.S. trade demand that Japan specify targets for boosting its public works  spending, a hoped-for wedge in opening the market here to more foreign  business.  </P> <P> Kaifu's tough stand, coming a day after a stunning trade breakthrough in which  Japan accepted U.S. technology as a cellular-phone standard, suggests that the  government intends to assert itself despite heavy pressure for economic reform.  </P> <P> Japan agreed in April to increase public spending as part of an unprecedented  pact to reduce its $49-billion trade surplus with the United States by  attacking trade barriers. But the prime minister has come under harsh criticism  in Parliament for bowing to U.S. demands.  </P> <P> Kaifu said Friday that Japan would refuse to specify the ratio of public works  spending to its gross national product in a final report on the April  agreement, called the Structural Impediments Initiative.  </P> <P> "It was settled in the interim report (in April)," Kaifu told reporters. "I  don't quite understand why they are raising the issue again."  </P> <P> Japan did agree then to boost public spending, which would expand the number of  projects that U.S. firms could bid on.  </P> <P> But the United States had sought a definite annual spending target. Japan,  rejecting what it called interference in internal affairs, said it would  specify a total figure for the next 10 years and decide yearly spending  flexibly to avoid overheating the economy.  </P> <P> Kaifu's firm stand was a striking contrast to Thursday's announcement.  </P> <P> The government, in what may be the most potent symbol of Japan's recent  willingness to open its markets, said it was adopting digital cellular-phone  technology made by Motorola, Inc., as a national standard.  </P></p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Why innovation can become a risky business Many owner-managed businesses take unnecessary risks with innovation and new product development because they do not plan ahead, according to a survey* by accountants Touche Ross, writes Charles Batchelor. Only half attempted to assess the commercial feasibility of a new product before launching it while 60 per cent did not know how much they spent on innovation. Nearly half did not attempt to protect the rights of their products. Nearly half of the companies had a formalised new product development programme although only 15 per cent had a research and development department. Ideas tended to be generated by management and staff with nearly half of all ideas coming from internal sources. In spite of this reliance on in-house creativity, only 15 per cent of companies offered incentives to staff for successful ideas and fewer than one-in-12 had a suggestion box or a formal suggestion scheme. Only 16 per cent of companies picked up ideas from competitors or in the market place, despite the fact that 'me too' products can be cheaper and less risky to introduce than completely new products. Three-quarters of respondents held group discussions to identify potential winners but this made it easy for a director or senior manager to push a favourite idea in the absence of any quantifiable market knowledge. Only one-third made use of market research. About 86 per cent of funding for innovation and product development came from internal resources, representing a substantial risk for the business. Sixty per cent of respondents were unable to quantify their spending in this area while nearly half did not protect their innovations. *Contact Steve Blundell, Touche Ross, Hill House, 1 Little New Street, London EC4A 3TR.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Observer: Eagle eye Should George Bush be told? Germany's Treuhand agency has put 'Amerika' up for sale. This is not, it turns out, the resurgent eagle selling off other people's continents to raise much needed D-Marks. On closer reading, a newspaper advertisement, complete with Stars and Stripes flag, turns out to be soliciting for a tender for an old cotton-milling settlement on the river Zwickauer Mulde in Saxony. The east German privatisation agency, only empowered to sell off small conurbations that belonged to now-defunct state companies, suggests international investors might care to develop a 'leisure time and adventure town' out of the abandoned 19th century mills. Euro-Disney, look out.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cordoba, 19 Apr (NA) -- A low-intensity explosive  device exploded at the home of an Army official who, according  to neighbors, had been commissioned to Artillery Group No. 161  in Zapala, Neuquen Province.    Even though the reports that First Lieutenant Daniel Vega, a  physician, had been commissioned to that garrison were not  officially confirmed, they were not denied by military  authorities either.    According to what was made public by Cordoba Province  Police,  the explosive device went off at around 0200 local time and  caused only minor damage and no injuries.    The explosion only caused some damage to the door of the  house located at 112 Jacinto Rios Street in the General Paz  district, where Vega and his wife live.</p>

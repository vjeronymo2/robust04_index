			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Two-card trick from Visa - The credit card company's motives in sponsoring the city of Atlanta In an unusual marketing deal, Visa looks set to become the official credit card of the city of Atlanta, Georgia. Barring a last-minute political upset the agreement, for more than Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.6m) over four years, will be finalised next week. Already it is being hailed by city officials as a marketing milestone. They and Visa executives predict that it will be widely imitated by many other cities and companies. But the partnership has critics, who wonder how far the city's rampant commercialism may go. Will Tylenol's manufacturers market the pain reliever as the city's official headache remedy? Maybe, if they become a sponsor of the 1996 Olympics, which will be held in Atlanta. Visa, which is already an Olympic sponsor, says it saw the additional partnership with the city as a good 'ambush marketing' strategy. During the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, last year, Visa accused American Express of running a campaign which implied a close relationship with the Games, even though AmEx was not an official sponsor. Such 'ambush marketing' can be also be done by plastering the airport of the Olympic city with advertising, for example, giving the impression of an Olympic link. Olympic sponsors pay dearly for the Games' commercial opportunities (an Atlanta Games sponsorship goes for Dollars 40m) and react viscerally to alleged ambushers. Under Atlanta's deal with Visa, other credit card companies will be excluded from placing their ads around the airport or from otherwise diminishing the exclusivity of Visa's sponsorship. While the Olympics provided the impetus for the deal, Joel Babbit, Atlanta's marketing chief and the mayor's official spokesman, believes there will be more like it. He argues that cities are seeking new ways to raise revenues at a time when the public is hostile to higher taxes. Babbit admits, however, that there are limits to such marketing alliances. He would draw the line at firearms and sexually-oriented products, for example. His main targets are the 1996 Olympic sponsors, though he says he would not rule out partnerships with other companies. This suggestion has some in the business community worried that the city is extorting 'protection' money fromtheir Olympics sponsorships. Nonetheless, companies appear to be lining up to pay. Babbit says he is currently negotiating with three more companies and expects to sign similar marketing deals soon. From Visa's standpoint, the deal protects the company's impending Olympic sponsorship, but also wins it plaudits as a good corporate citizen. Although a large slice of its fees will go to the Atlanta Conven-tion and Tourism Bureau to market the city worldwide (with Visa's logo on the materials), the remainder of the money goes to general city expenses like park improvements, and police and teacher salaries. The eagerness of other cities to become part of corporate marketing campaigns is unclear. Greg Longini, assistant commissioner for planning and development in Chicago, where the opening game of the 1994 World Cup soccer contest will be played, says that the idea might have merit. But he cautioned: 'Before the city became a partner in a corporate marketing campaign, we'd have to look very, very carefully.' One sensitivity he noted was that a marketing deal should not tread on the toes of a city's existing investors. In essence, if McDonald's has a corporate presence in your city (as is the case with Chicago), you cannot sign a deal with Burger King. The Atlanta Chamber of Commerce has worried aloud about the potentially harmful effects of the Visa deal on economic development. The chamber, which leads Atlanta's promotional efforts to recruit investors, is concerned that the city's alliance with Visa could preclude investment by other credit card companies.</p>

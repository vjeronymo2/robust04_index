			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Sychev: "Pacific Fleet Sells </F> Written-Off Submarines and Is Happy"]    [Text] The Asia-Pacific Region is panicking slightly.  Following the four written-off "Foxtrot" class Russian  submarines (IZVESTIYA No. 9), the Pacific Fleet has apparently  sold another 10 "Golf-2" submarines, capable of carrying three  SS-5 sea-based ballistic missiles, to North Korea.    The unease in the countries in the region neighboring North  Korea is entirely explicable. Pyongyang does not allow the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to monitor Korean  nuclear reactors, thereby reinforcing the world community's  suspicions that secret plans exist in North Korea to acquire  nuclear weapons. "Nodong" missiles, copied from the famous  "Scuds," have been flying out of the country's military test  sites.    Reports obtained by IZVESTIYA at the Navy Press Center  provide no grounds for suspecting the Russian military of having  an frivolous attitude. A contract has been signed by the  Russian Ministry of Defense, which, by an edict of the  president, has been authorized to sell written-off warships for  scrap.    An agreement has been signed with the Japanese firm "Toen  [name as transliterated] Trade Inc." for the sale of 12 diesel  submarines manufactured in the period between 1961 and 1968.  They have outlived their service life and, so we were told, it  is no longer safe to go to sea in them -- indeed, it is now  quite impossible to do so. Under the contract, all the  submarines have been brought to a condition which rules out the  possibility of restoring them for naval use. All weapons, basic  equipment, and precious metals have been removed from them. The  "Toen Trade Inc." firm will receive only the hulls, which it  will supply itself to a ship-cutting enterprise.    Under the terms of the contact the company does not have the  right to re-sell the submarines for purposes other than in the  form of scrap, and it is obliged to supply documents confirming  that the hull has been cut into pieces. Defense Ministry  experts will be on site to monitor the fulfillment of the  contract.    The Japanese company has so far collected only one  submarine.  The contract does not stipulate where the submarines will be cut  up or who will finally get the scrap. The Navy Press Center  refused to name the sum involved in the contract, saying merely  that the fleet did not get a bad bargain.</p>

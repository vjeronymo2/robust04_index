			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Licence fee likely to be retained: Tory backbenchers call for new funding structure THE TELEVISION licence fee is 'likely' to be the basis on which the BBC's future is to be secured, Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, told MPs yesterday. Replying to questions on yesterday's green paper, Mr Brooke said: 'In terms of financing the BBC, there is no obvious improvement on the licence fee.' His remarks followed calls from Tory backbenchers to consider implementing a fee structure that did not oblige viewers to pay for programmes they did not watch. Mr Brooke sought to reassure MPs on the government's commitment to public-service broadcasting, saying 'we strongly envisage' that the concept would play a key role in the BBC's activities at the end of the consultation period. He declined a request from Mr Roy Hattersley, the former Labour deputy leader, to 'specifically reject' the notion that the BBC might be limited to a narrow range of programmes. But Mr Brooke said it was important that Britain should emerge from the consultation with 'a major production base'. Mrs Ann Clwyd, shadow heritage secretary, said her party remained 'completely committed' to the concept of public-service broadcasting. Labour would oppose any attempt to privatise the BBC 'even at its edges'. Mrs Clywd asked whether the government would support index-linking the licence fee for a minimum of 10 years, as a means of ensuring stability and enabling the organisation to be 'free from any attempt at editorial control by the government or anyone else'. For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Robert Maclennan, home affairs spokesman, said there was a danger the BBC would be put on 'starvation rations' and its public-sector role attenuated. The BBC's 'firm financial independence' was the 'basis of its role as a defender of free speech', he said.</p>

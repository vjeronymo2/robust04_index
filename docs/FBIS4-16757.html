			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yekaterina Deynego, Yevgeniy Krasnikov report under the </F> "Party Organization" rubric: "Opposition Regains Strength.  Officers Union, Russian State Party Have Held Congresses"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The first congress of the  Russian Power Party [Rossiyskaya Derzhavnaya Partiya] was held  on 17 April. It was organized by Officers Union's activists  under Stanislav Terekhov and representatives of a number of  left-wing and patriotic organizations and movements (Russian  Federation Communist Party (CPRF), Cossack unions, and so  forth). To all appearances, the new organization will be  modeled on the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (a charismatic  leader, strict internal hierarchy) and is apparently designed as  an alternative to it. Stanislav Terekhov said in his address  that the new party's closest allies should be the CPRF  ("Zyuganov's party") and the Russian Orthodox Church. The  congress delegates received a paper entitled "On Statehood,"  which, to all appearances, will become the new party's  ideological platform. The state-patriotic document was drawn up  jointly by Officers Union and CPRF experts.    Prospects for an alliance between the state patriots and the  CPRF, however, will become clear only after the Communist  Party's second All-Russia conference, scheduled for 23-24 April.  During the conference, the party leaders will have to resolve  the dilemma: either they enter the Union of Communist Parties --  the CPSU, hewing to the principles of proletarian  internationalism and uncompromising struggle against the current  regime; or continue as a left-wing state-patriotic party of  constructive opposition. Although on 16 April the Moscow branch  of the CPRF decided at Yegor Ligachev's initiative to raise the  question of the CPRF's joining the CPSU at the upcoming  conference, the proposal is unlikely to be adopted. "Zyuganov's  party" is gradually becoming a more and more respectable and  law-abiding organization that tries to avoid unnecessary  conflicts with the current authorities. Typically, its leaders  are inclined to hold May Day festivities together with the trade  unions, not Viktor Anpilov's communists (this decision was made  by the CPRF Moscow branch and others).    One possible form of the CPRF's coalition with the patriotic  forces may become the Public Committee for the Rule of Law and  People's Power, which was set up yesterday, including both  communists and patriots: Stanislav Terekhov, Sergey Baburin,  Viktor Ilyukhin, and others.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Head of the Odessa Military District press service,  Vyacheslav Voronkov, stated in an interview with INTERFAX today  that there were practically no Black Sea Fleet units remaining  in Odessa.    He said the situation in the first brigade of defense of the  Ukrainian Navy area (the former 318th Black Sea Fleet division)  was calm. "The planned work was supervised by the new  commander, Second Rank Captain Marchenko," Voronkov pointed out.    The Ukrainian Navy First brigade was set up on 12 April  1994,  on the basis of the dismissed 318th Black Sea Fleet division.  The Ukrainian military leadership undertook this measure after  the division had got involved in the incident with the Cheleken  boat which had withdrawn hydro geographical equipment from  Odessa without the consent of Ukraine. A total of eighteen  servicemen of the division (most of them are officers) refused  to swear the oath of allegiance to Ukraine and expressed their  desire to serve in the Russian fleet.    The Black Sea Fleet command repeatedly stated that it had  warned the Ukrainian authorities about the boat leaving Odessa  and considered this action as a seizure.    Voronkov said former commander of the 318th division,  Captain  First Rank Oleg Feoktistov and other officers unwilling to swear  the oath of allegiance to Ukraine had been transferred to Russia  to continue their service. Feoktistov will serve on Novaya  Zemlya (Arctic Ocean). The others will continue their service  in Novosibirsk.</p>

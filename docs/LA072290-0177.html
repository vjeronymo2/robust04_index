			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUGGED;  </P> <P> TERMITES TURN HOME INTO HOUSE OF HORRORS WHILE FAMILY AWAITS COURT'S RULING  </P> <P> Last month, the Real Estate section ran a three-part series on termites in  Southern California. The story that follows, which outlines the problems of an  extreme case of infestation, was brought to our attention as a result of that  series.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Peggy Rose and her husband, Harvey, thought they had found their dream house  three years ago in Simi Valley. The roomy home at the end of a cul-de-sac had a  view of nearby mountains and a big back yard for their two sons to play in.  </P> <P> Now their dream house is giving them nightmares -- literally.  </P> <P> Peggy and Harvey Rose and their children have frequent nightmares about bugs  coming out of the walls and crawling over their beds.  </P> <P> The Roses' house is so badly infested with termites that at least part of it  must be razed and rebuilt, according to repair estimates, Peggy Rose said. One  contractor said it would cost less to tear it down and start over than to fix  the problems, she said.  </P> <P> Termite damage inside the home is easily visible, with holes dotting several  walls. A subterranean termite tube built from mud, saliva and feces snakes  nearly a foot down the sun room wall.  </P> <P> If you stand near a severely damaged living room wall, the paneling wavy and  pockmarked with termite holes, you can hear a slight crackling, rustling sound  that Rose said is the termites at work. The insects make a noise by bumping  their heads against tunnels in the wood, entomologists said.  </P> <P> Underneath the home, a joist has a jagged chunk missing, as though someone had  taken a big bite out of it. More mud tubes rise from the soil to the home's  underpinnings.  </P> <P> Peggy Rose said she notices new holes every day, along with a musty smell that  seems to come from under the house. The termites are building more mud tubes on  inside walls.  </P> <P> The Roses haven't had the termites exterminated and the damage repaired because  they are embroiled in a legal battle over who is responsible for the problem.  </P> <P> These are the previous owners of the home, two exterminators who treated the  house for termites and the realty companies involved in the purchase. The Roses  allege that the damage is a result of fraud by some, breach of contract and  negligence by others.  </P> <P> The Rose case, while more extreme than most, demonstrates how vulnerable home  buyers are when relying on a termite inspection, and how important it is to  check such reports as much as possible. Trouble can result for others involved  as well if a report is questioned later.  </P> <P> It also shows how difficult it can be to resolve a complex problem with the  system of termite inspection and treatment.  </P> <P> "This could happen to anybody in Southern California," Peggy Rose said.  </P> <P> When the Roses bought their "dream house" in 1987, they did what most people do  -- included a termite report and repair work as part of their purchase  agreement. They bought the house believing everything was fixed.  </P> <P> The couple first noticed a problem about 18 months after moving in, when they  saw insect holes on a living room wall, Peggy Rose said. They had been having  Western Exterminator Co.'s Oxnard office spray monthly for other pests and  asked them take care of the problem.  </P> <P> Western sent an inspector who reported finding subterranean termites (a type  that lives in the soil and tunnels up to food sources) in the wall.  </P> <P> He recommended drilling through the outside wall and applying a pesticide. This  was done March 16, 1989, according to a copy of the inspection report filed  with the state Structural Pest Control Board.  </P> <P> The report also notes that other areas of the house, such as the attic, garage  and foundation were not inspected. The Roses paid for a complete inspection.  </P> <P> Soon after the March 16 treatment, the Roses noticed termite debris in the  home's attached garage. Western was called again, and in an inspection report  dated April 4, 1989, discovered a different type of termite -- drywood.  (Drywood termites live in the wood itself.) Western treated the garage termites  with a local pesticide application.  </P> <P> In July, 1989, the Roses again called Western to examine holes in their bedroom  and adjoining sun room. They were told it was subterranean termite damage and a  local treatment was recommended.  </P> <P> By this time, they had doubts about Western's judgment, Peggy Rose said, and  called another exterminator, M&amp;M Termite &amp; Pest Control Inc. of Newbury  Park.  </P> <P> When they saw M&amp;M's report, listing numerous problems throughout the house,  "we had to be picked up from the floor," Peggy Rose said.  </P> <P> M&amp;M found both types of termites in the attic and substructure, drywoods in  the garage and subterraneans in various spots, including the master bedroom,  living room, floor and floor joists in certain areas, foundation and behind the  water heater.  </P> <P> Poor ventilation, earth-to-wood contact and cellulose debris under the house  were among the discoveries, along with a leaky shower and other moisture  problems -- all of which attract termites.  </P> <P> Recommendations included fumigation for drywood termites and drilling holes  every five feet in the foundation and injecting chemicals for subterranean  termites. Damaged sections of floor and other wood needed replacing. The report  also suggested tearing open sections of floor and removing the shower so that  inaccessible areas could be inspected, and getting rid of soil and debris under  the house.  </P> <P> M&amp;M, who the Roses are not suing, told them to complain to the pest control  board because areas that had been treated before were still infested, the Roses  said.  </P> <P> After they filed a complaint with the board, a state investigator examined  their home. He told them the termites had started chomping several years before  they had bought the house, judging by the amount of damage, Peggy Rose said.  </P> <P> The Roses said they were shocked because a Simi Valley company, Pacific Coast  Exterminating Co. Inc., had treated the house for termites as part of the  purchase agreement.  </P> <P> In his official findings in the Rose case, the investigator held Pacific Coast  and Western each 50% responsible for seven violations where they failed to  report problems, and Western 100% responsible for four other violations,  according to a copy of a September, 1989, letter provided by Western's  attorney.  </P> <P> Board officials refused to discuss the Rose case because it is still pending.  </P> <P> Western, one of California's largest exterminators, with more than 20 offices,  accepts the state's findings and is offering to take care of its share of the  problem, said its attorney, Arthur B. Cook. The worker who inspected the home  has been fired, he said. The company also offered to reimburse the Roses for  their inspection and treatment fees.  </P> <P> However, Western does not think it is fair for the company to pay for damage  that took place before it was hired, Cook said.  </P> <P> The Roses said Western's offer fell far short of what was needed for repairs,  and negotiations faltered. The Roses finally felt that the only way to get  their home restored was to sue Western and the others, which they did in April  in Ventura County Superior Court.  </P> <P> The Roses' attorney, Eric Chomsky, said that if Western had discovered the  extent of the problem in its original March, 1989, inspection, most of the  damage could have been prevented.  </P> <P> He likens the situation to a person who has cancer and is misdiagnosed by two  doctors. Both are liable for malpractice, he said, and they can't claim  responsibility for only half of the patient's body.  </P> <P> When the suit was filed, repair costs were estimated at more than $90,000, and  growing. Later Chomsky asked Western to either buy the Roses' house for  $750,000 or pay them $250,000 in cash (with partial reimbursement if the Roses  collected from other defendants). That offer had been withdrawn, because the  latest estimate shows it would take at least $300,000 to rebuild the house,  plus the legal and other costs, Chomsky said. The Roses paid $318,000 for the  house.  </P> <P> Western offered to make or co-sign a loan so the Roses could afford to fix  their home now instead of waiting for the dispute to end. The loan would not  affect anyone's legal position in the case, Cook said.  </P> <P> But the Roses don't want the financial burden shifted to them with a loan,  Chomsky said, because it isn't their fault the house is damaged.  </P> <P> The Roses are also suing the original exterminator, Pacific Coast, and its  president, Michael Venarde, alleging fraud and negligence. They accuse him of  falsely certifying it was free of active infestation. Venarde did not return  calls for comment.  </P> <P> The Structural Pest Control Board last month asked the state attorney general  for a hearing to suspend or revoke Pacific Coast's registration and Venarde's  liscence. The board also asked that Pacific Coast be required to pay fees owed  to the board and restitution to the Roses.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that Venarde had told the previous owners, Michael and Adele  Gruett, that the home would never be free of termites. The Roses are suing the  Gruetts as well, charging them with fraud and breach of contract. The Gruetts  declined to comment.  </P> <P> The other defendants are Century 21 Finley Realty of Simi Valley, the sellers'  broker, and Century 21 Ambassador Realty of Thousand Oaks, the Roses' broker.  </P> <P> The Roses allege both brokers dissuaded them from obtaining other inspection  reports and misled them into accepting Pacific Coast's report and completion  notice as accurate so that they could get their commissions on the sale.  </P> <P> Century 21 Finley referred inquiries to its lawyer, who did not return phone  calls.  </P> <P> The owner-broker of Century 21 Ambassador, Robert Majorino, denied that his  office did anything wrong. He said two termite inspections were done on the  house -- one by Pacific Coast and a follow-up check by another company -- and  both showed similar findings. Pacific Coast, which submitted a higher estimate  for the extermination and treatment, was selected and paid by the sellers.  </P> <P> Pacific Coast filed the state-required completion notice, certifying that the  property was free of active termite infestation in accessible areas. It treated  the house with chemicals and repaired several areas, including a damaged floor  joist, according to a copy of the August, 1987, notice attached to the lawsuit.  </P> <P> However, it also shows two recommendations not done -- remove cellulose debris  and correct earth-to-wood contact in certain areas. Both conditions attract  termites.  </P> <P> The Roses' agent, Ray Gebeau, said he doesn't remember why those items were  skipped, but such preventive measures as described in the report don't have to  be done, Majorino said.  </P> <P> The state does not require that recommendations be completed, but lenders will  usually insist that any needed corrective work be done so that a home is free  of termites. Buyers also often make it a condition of purchase, as the Roses  did.  </P> <P> However, with preventive recommendations, the parties involved sometimes choose  not to do the work or to do it later, Gebeau said.  </P> <P> It's unclear if anything was done after the August notice, but similar problems  appear on later inspection reports.  </P> <P> The Roses said they don't know why some recommendations weren't done. They were  told the house would be free of termites, and everything would be taken care of  by the time escrow closed, Harvey Rose, 38, said.  </P> <P> If they had known the structure had a serious infestation they never would have  bought it, he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the termites are eating more and more of their home. The Roses have  taken pictures off the walls to keep the termites from chewing on them. They're  treading cautiously over the weak spots in the floor.  </P> <P> And they're getting angrier all the time.  </P> <P> Originally she only wanted her home restored to its previous condition, Peggy  Rose said, and expenses paid when the family moved out for repairs. Now legal  fees, medical bills and emotional distress are added to those costs.  </P> <P> Having their home resemble a horror movie set has "put my family through hell,"  Peggy Rose, 37, said. The stress has strained her 16-year marriage and given  the family nightmares along with severe headaches and stomachaches, she said.  </P> <P> The Roses are afraid that by the time the case is settled there won't be much  left of their house. They said the pest control board has been responsive to  their plight, but its powers are limited. The board can discipline  exterminators and order them to re-treat if their original work was faulty, but  it can't guarantee restitution.  </P> <P> Even if the house is repaired or rebuilt, the Roses aren't sure they still want  to live there. But they're worried that the property would be hard to sell with  its record of termite trouble. And as much as they long to leave the experience  behind them, they also dread going through the process of buying another house.  </P> <P> "We're gun-shy," Peggy Rose said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan should improve its  systems of disclosure and performance assessment for securities  investment trusts to protect investors and implement  self-responsibility principles, a Finance Ministry study group  said Friday [10 June] in a draft report.    The advisory panel to the chief of the ministry's securities  bureau discussed the draft report at a meeting Friday and asked  for minor changes and the issuance of a final report as early as  June 22, a ministry official said.    The official, requesting anonymity, said the draft prepared  by the ministry group aims at "investor protection and  self-responsibility principles," and points out that the current  law enacted in 1951 has failed to "sufficiently" meet changes in  market environment.    Disclosure covers details of investment and portfolio  strategies and periodic reports on performance to meet  complaints that the current system is "insufficient" for  investor understanding, the official said.    As for investment performance, the report calls for a  "benchmark" to facilitate investor understanding and to spur  competition among trust firms that manage funds and among  securities firms that sell such funds to investors.    The report also seeks a review of the current law and  adoption of "fair-trading" rules to revive the functions of  investment trusts that are not at present working, to maintain  stability and to vitalize market activities.    The group has been discussing the reform of Japan's  investment trust business since last November amid waning  investor interest in trusts after the collapse of the "bubble"  speculation boom in the late 1980s.    With stock prices tumbling, investors faced the prospect of  their stock investment funds falling below their initial values  and various problems surfaced such as complaints that brokerage  houses had failed to make clear to investors that they could  also lose money.    The official said the report makes it clear that the panel  remains mixed on many other issues, including the adoption of  U.S.- style mutual funds.</p>

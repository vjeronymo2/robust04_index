			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Australian white goods maker up sharply EMAIL, the leading Australian white goods maker, yesterday reported sharply higher earnings and announced plans for an effective increase in the dividend. Despite static sales of ADollars 1.38bn (USDollars 1.06bn), net profit rose by almost 30 per cent to ADollars 55.3m for the year ended March 1992. The dividend is being held at 17 cents a share, but on capital increased by a rights issue. The increase in earnings was more than accounted for by a reduction in Email's net interest bill from ADollars 28.6m to ADollars 13.6m. Also, the figures excluded extraordinary losses of ADollars 946,000, against ADollars 5.1m previously. Directors said they had reacted early to the recession by divesting uneconomic operations and restructuring productive capacity. 'This resulted in increased productivity in the manufacturing areas,' they said. 'Some of the benefits of these actions were recorded in the current year, but longer-term gains will flow as increased demand lifts production volumes. 'Directors believe any improvement in the economy and growth in employment will remain slow.' Lion Nathan, New Zealand's biggest brewing group, has sold a chain of New Zealand department stores to a management group and a Maori development consortium for NZDollars 32m (USDollars 17.3m), writes Terry Hall from Wellington. The 85 stores employ 2,000 staff. Lion Nathan said the sale marked the final stage of its strategy to focus on core beverage businesses in New Zealand and in Australia, where it is completing the purchase of Bond Brewing.</p>

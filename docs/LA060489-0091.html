			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AS SPEAKER, FOLEY PLANS TO QUELL PARTISAN FIGHTS  </P> <P> Even before Jim Wright officially steps down as Speaker of the House this week,  his likely successor, Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley of Washington, is already  laying plans to quell the partisan warfare that led to Wright's downfall.  </P> <P> Foley, 60, who is virtually certain to be chosen as the nation's  highest-ranking Democrat when the party caucus meets Tuesday, is viewed by  members of both parties as a leader whose congenial personality and keen  intellect make him better suited than Wright to oversee the House during an era  of political turmoil.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sees Bitterness  </P> <P> In an interview, Foley expressed confidence that a new Democratic leadership  team can successfully defuse the bitterness that has developed between  Republicans and Democrats in the House during the furor over Wright's alleged  financial misconduct.  </P> <P> "I think we need to work very seriously at restoring a sense of comity and  confidence between members of the two parties," Foley said. "This is going to  be done only because both parties want it, at least the vast majority of both  parties want it."  </P> <P> As Speaker, Foley's strategy to restore order in the House would be four-fold:  </P> <P>  -- To show more courtesy than his predecessor toward the Republican minority,  which complained bitterly that its rights were denied by Wright's high-handed  style of leadership.  </P> <P>  -- To dissuade his fellow Democrats from seeking revenge against Republicans  -- particularly Assistant Minority Leader Newt Gingrich of Georgia -- who  brought Wright down.  </P> <P>  -- To develop a bipartisan proposal for rewriting House rules that govern  ethical conduct, making them both more stringent and less ambiguous.  </P> <P>  -- To refocus attention on such pressing national problems as reducing the  budget deficit, improving education, aiding the underclass, limiting health  care costs, raising the minimum wage, providing child care, renewing the Clean  Air Act and bailing out the savings and loan industry.  </P> <P> Foley said his efforts will succeed primarily because most House members are  fed up with the partisan battling over personal ethics, which has not only  brought about the resignations of Wright and Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced) in the  last 10 days but also most recently touched Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.),  the leading contender to replace Coelho as assistant majority leader.  </P> <P> "Members on both sides don't seek election and come to Congress for the purpose  of deciding ethical questions or engaging in ethical disputes," he said.  "That's not what they want to do. In fact, if I've heard one thing more than  anything in recent weeks it is -- usually with some expletives -- 'I didn't get  elected to get involved in this kind of thing.' "  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Foley, who in 25 years as a congressman has developed a  reputation as a conciliator, does not underestimate the difficulty of the task  facing him.  </P> <P> "There are people on our side who are very bitter about what they regard as the  crucifixion of Jim Wright," he acknowledged. "There are Republicans that think  they've been unfairly accused of that and the Democratic majority is guilty of  creating a system in which they didn't have an opportunity to present issues  or, indeed, a fair chance at becoming a majority. Somehow we've got to take  care of both extremes."  </P> <P> In Wright's farewell address last Wednesday, the retiring Speaker apologized to  House Republicans for what they viewed as the excesses of his 2 1/2 years at  the helm. It is widely believed that Gingrich would not have brought charges of  misconduct against Wright if he had been more generous in allowing Republicans  to offer more amendments to legislation.  </P> <P> Although Foley emphasized that he does not share Republican criticism of  Wright, whom he staunchly defended throughout the yearlong investigation, he  clearly understands why the GOP is complaining and would feel an obligation as  Speaker to resolve those complaints.  </P> <P> "I don't happen to believe that this has been a long series of oppressive  violations of the rules or torturing of the rules by Democrats," he said, "but  I recognize that many Republicans feel that way. And I also recognize that  there have been cases where we have overreached, if not violating the rules, at  least pushing them."  </P> <P> Oct. 29, 1987, has long been cited by Republicans as Wright's "day of infamy"  -- the day he adjourned the House after narrowly losing a key vote and then  quickly called the chamber back into session, brought up a similar bill and  eked out a one-vote victory by pressuring a fellow Texas Democrat, Rep. Jim  Chapman, to vote his way.  </P> <P> "If we could do that day over, I'd be the happiest person in the world," Foley  said.  </P> <P> But Foley rejected Republican charges that the Democrats have created "an  incumbency machine" that has kept the Republicans in the House minority for the  last 35 years. He noted that 93% of House seats have turned over since he was  elected in 1964.  </P> <P> As Speaker, Foley pledged to protect the rights of Republicans.  </P> <P> "There's a need to establish a sense here that we can have debate, we can have  disputes, they can even be charged with emotion and with conviction, and still  have a sense that after everything is decided, the rules were fair," he said.  </P> <P> In addition, Foley would press ahead with a bipartisan effort that is already  under way to reform House rules. Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), who co-chairs  the rules task force with Rep. Lynn Martin (R-Ill.), said last week he hopes  the panel will produce a proposal for revamping House rules by September.  </P> <P> Foley thinks the effort will heal partisan differences over how the current  rules should be interpreted. "There is no reason to have partisan divisions  over ethical procedure," he said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, even though he disagrees with Democrats who want to avenge  Wright's ouster, he indicated that he would not favor granting "amnesty" to  members currently facing ethics charges. That includes Gingrich, who, like  Wright, has been accused of developing a scheme to disguise personal  contributions from wealthy supporters as book royalties.  </P> <P> Like many colleagues, Foley is looking forward to refocusing the attention of  the House away from ethics and onto policy. But he conceded there is little  opportunity for the current Congress to establish the impressive legislative  record of the 100th Congress, which adjourned last year.  </P> <P> "That Congress, with all credit to Jim Wright's leadership, faced, addressed  and resolved literally dozens of legislative issues, including major ones --  environmental issues, resources issues, civil rights issues, drug enforcement  issues, welfare reform issues and trade issues," he said.  </P> <P> "It tended to exhaust or fulfill the existing capacity for consensus or  resolution. What you have left in this Congress is the residue of that agenda,  which is by definition more difficult, more intractable, farther from  resolution."  </P> <P> In this category he listed the budget deficit, clean air legislation, child  care, the minimum wage, federal health benefits, education and the savings and  loan industry.  </P> <P> "This Congress is struggling with the hard, unfinished business of the  country," he said. "This Congress is going to be more managerial in dealing  with some of these problems than initiating."  </P> <P> While most House members praise Foley's ability to develop bipartisan consensus  on difficult issues, his critics claim he is more of a conciliator than a  leader. As a result, he is often criticized for bringing no clear Democratic  agenda to his new job.  </P> <P> But Foley, insisting he is more than "a facilitator," argued forcefully that he  can do little to alter the heavy agenda of difficult issues already facing  Congress.  </P> <P> "It's not a Tom Foley agenda, it's not even a Democratic agenda," he said.  "What we do has to be within what a Republican presidency and a Democratic  Congress can agree to. We're going to need to find common solutions. Neither  side is going to be able to dominate this agenda."  </P></p>

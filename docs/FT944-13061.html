Mr John Taylor, the parliamentary secretary at the Lord Chancellor's Department, said Mr Walker, who was acquitted earlier this week, had received Pounds 1,152,442 to help fight his case. In a Commons written answer, Mr Taylor said the sum was 'in the form of discretionary interim payments made in respect of proceedings in the Crown Court'. He said it was not possible to estimate, as yet, what the final cost of the court case would be, although the total sum has been estimated at Pounds 5m. Mr Walker had been accused of masterminding the fraudulent boost of Brent Walker's profits by Pounds 19m during the 1980s but was cleared of all charges of theft, conspiracy and false accounting brought against him by the Serious Fraud Office. Mr Taylor also revealed that Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell, the sons of Robert Maxwell, have already received Pounds 400,000 in legal aid payments to help fight charges arising out of the collapse of their father's business empire.</p>

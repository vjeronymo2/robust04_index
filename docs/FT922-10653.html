			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Chemicals If the first quarter figures from the big three German chemical companies are a guide, investors should not expect too much from ICI's results today. None of the three holds out much hope of an upturn in trading. All suffered a bigger percentage fall in profits this quarter than last year as a whole. With luck, ICI should do a little better. Its restructuring started earlier and is perhaps more determined. The German companies also suffer by comparison with a first quarter last year in which the domestic economy was still enjoying the stimulus of unification. All the same, the message from Continental producers is uniform and slightly depressing. Germany is down, the US recovery is patchy and the Far East is getting worse. Bulk chemicals are still taking a hammering. If, as the market expects, ICI's quarterly profits are broadly unchanged, it will have its non-cyclical pharmaceuticals business to thank.</p>

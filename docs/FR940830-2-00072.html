This requirement does not apply if the number of applications from these two groups, respectively, is not sufficient to meet the requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Subject to the above statutory priority for nurses and mental health practitioners, the IHS will give priority in funding among health professionals to physicians in the following priority specialties: anesthesiology, emergency room medicine, general surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology/otorhinolaryngology, psychiatry and radiology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following factors are equal in weight when applied, and are applied when all other criteria are equal and a selection must be made between applicants.

If funds are available, the maximum amount will be funded in this manner and will not exceed the total of the individual's outstanding eligible health professions educational loans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any individual who owes an obligation for health professional service to the Federal Government or to a State or other entity under an agreement with such State or other entity is not eligible for the Loan Repayment Program unless such an obligation will be completely satisfied prior to the beginning of service under this program in the year that an application is made for this program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This program is not subject to review under Executive Order 12372. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number is 13.164. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 19, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael H.

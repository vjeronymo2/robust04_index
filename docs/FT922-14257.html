			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Mixed reaction to Portugal's EMS entry THE Portuguese capital market offered mixed reaction yesterday to the escudo's entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS) at the weekend, and the subsequent announcement of a cut in the central bank's main interest rates, writes Patrick Blum in Lisbon. Prices for government securities rose slightly, but not as much as had been expected, as many investors had anticipated a decline in interest rates. The escudo's entry into the ERM was generally seen as a positive step, encouraging demand for Portuguese-denominated securities. Prices rose slightly, but domestic buyers remained more cautious. 'There hasn't been a big rush to buy now. People are waiting to see what happens with tomorrow's auction of FIPs (government floating-rate notes),' said Mr Luis Nogueira, an analyst with merchant bank Finantia. The issue, for Es15bn with an eight-year maturity and a coupon of 18.6875 per cent, is expected to sell at around 107 per cent. Mr Nogueira said the formal link-up of the escudo in the ERM would make Portuguese securities more attractive. Prices and yields for FIPs remained stable, with more noticeable changes for fixed-rate notes, whose prices rose between 1.1 and 2.4 percentage points and yields by 0.5 to 0.75 percentage points.</p>

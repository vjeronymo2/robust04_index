			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Zurich hopes that the agony is finally over - Ian Rodger on the embattled Swiss equity market Is the agony finally over? That is certainly what dazed investors in the Swiss market are hoping now that the big banks and the pharmaceuticals giant, Roche, have reported their disappointing interim results. But there is little sign of optimism about a quick or substantial recovery from the 14 per cent slide in the all share Swiss Performance index since the beginning of February. The blue chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) of 22 leading shares has tumbled even more, 18 per cent over the same period, because of the heavy weighting of Roche and the bank shares. After so many unpleasant surprises in the first half of the year, many analysts are unwilling to predict a specific target for the main indices over the next few months. Others are cautious. 'I can see the SMI up 10 per cent by the end of the year, with most of the action in the fourth quarter,' says Mr Frederick Hasslauer, of Bank Sal Oppenheim in Zurich. Mr Serge Ledermann of the Geneva bankers, Lombard, Odier has pencilled in a similar rise for the SPI to 1,900, but only if interest rates remain stable and the dollar strengthens slightly. Many analysts say, with varying degrees of conviction, that the market has now found a secure base, with the SMI around the 2,600 level. They point out that since its last downward jag in June, caused mainly by the weakness in Roche, the SMI has moved within a narrow range between 2,500 and and 2,600. But opinions vary enormously on what will happen from here. For Mr Hasslauer and others, the blue chips are unlikely to recover their lustre for some time, so the emphasis should be on the cyclicals and second tier shares. In both categories, selection is crucial. There is much enthusiasm in some quarters for ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the power engineering group, in spite of the dour response to its interim report on Wednesday. The Brown Boveri bearer shares, at SFr1,259 in advance of the results, dropped quickly to SFr1,215, in spite of the 31 per cent rise in net income and a positive outlook. Mr Simon Marshall-Lockyer of Kleinwort Benson in London says he would not be surprised if there was further profit taking in BBC in the near term. But he argues that prospects in the medium term are very exciting because of the huge demand for new electric power capacity in China and other fast growing Asian countries. Mr Marshall-Lockyer also likes Ciba because of its strong chemicals content, the cement giant Holderbank and Swissair. Much maligned in the past two years, Swissair has bounced back in the past few weeks following publication of statistics revealing improved loads and yields. Also, a very bullish report from Union Bank of Switzerland, upgrading the registered shares to a 'strong buy', has helped push them from SFr790 to SFr865 in the past two weeks. Mr Thomas Kalbermatten, the UBS analyst, sees them going to SFr900 'quite quickly'. He says that demand for business class seats is picking up and that Swissair has a better quality business class than some rivals. Also, its cost cutting programmes are beginning to show results, he believes. Second tier enthusiasts got a jolt two weeks ago when the leading department store group, Grands Magasins Jelmoli, bought the controlling interest in an appliance retailer, Fust, from the Fust family. To the anger of a number of analysts and British institutions, Jelmoli offered minority shareholders a lower price for their Fust shares than it offered the family. There were fears that this discrimination, still allowed under Swiss law, would snuff out international investors' enthusiasm for shares of other smallish, family controlled companies. But Mr Marshall-Lockyer, for one, is maintaining a heavy weighting for second tier shares, recommending the mechanical engineer, SIG, the packaging machinery group, Bobst, and the textile machinery groups, Zellweger and Rieter. For other analysts, the play on cyclicals in the main European markets, including Switzerland, is largely over. On Thursday, Thomas Pfyl of Bank J. Vontobel in Zurich revised his BBC rating from buy to hold, saying that after a very good run, the share was unlikely to continue to outperform the market. Some analysts are beginning to suggest that, given the renewed volatility of currencies and interest rates, the defensive qualities of the traditional Swiss market leaders - the pharmaceuticals, Nestle and the banks and insurance companies - could soon return to favour. Mr Marc Polydor, of Banque Scandinave en Suisse, points out that although financials began to slide in February, they have underperformed the market for a year. 'I think we could see some comeback of interest sensitive stocks. Most of the bad scenarios have been discounted,' he says. Among the big banks, analysts generally prefer CS Holding, the group built around Credit Suisse. Its shares performed the worst among the big three in the first half, the bearers falling 22.5 per cent. Yet its interim profits, last Wednesday, were not as badly down as those of its two rivals. 'We think the CS shares have been oversold,' Ledermann of Lombard, Odier says.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hampden warns of worsening trading Hampden Group, the Belfast-based company which operates Texas Homecare stores in Ireland through a franchise agreement, lifted profits to Pounds 202,000 pre-tax in the 24 weeks to June 13. The increase from last time's Pounds 175,000 was achieved on turnover ahead 20 per cent to Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 11.8m). The Texas stores increased both turnover and profits, helped by a relocation of the Bangor store in February and the reopening of the Galwally store in April. Directors warned, however, that trading conditions in Northern Ireland had 'noticeably worsened' since June. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.2p, payable from earnings of 0.91p (0.77p) per share. The shares are traded on the USM.</p>

Western should explain the justification of the allocating of costs from its Washington, D.C., and Golden, Colorado, offices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Western's indirect costs are divided into three categories: Associated direct expense (ADE), administrative and general expense (AGE), and general Western allocation (GWA). ADE consists of undistributed costs and expenses for all types of direct costs which possess a clear relationship to benefiting activities and are recovered in the power rate base. AGE costs are general and administrative expenses benefiting ratepayers and represent primarily costs for nonmanagerial staff and support. GWA is a subset of AGE and includes ADP expenses, general office supplies, contracted administrative services, etc. Independent auditors have determined that AGE and GWA exclusively benefit ratepayers and should be recovered as part of the costs included in the power rate base. The indirect cost distribution system was designed and endorsed by a major accounting firm and is consistent with industry standards. Western does not believe these costs are excessive in the manner in which they are distributed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In light of the extensive replacement and addition program being carried out by Western, O&amp;M costs are not projected to decline in the future as supposedly older, high maintenance equipment is replaced with newer, lower maintenance equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Western feels it is necessary to overestimate operation and maintenance expenses as some sort of safeguard in the budget and planning process. This is most recently seen by comparison of budget to actual numbers for FY 92. We believe a sharper pencil should be taken to those O&amp;M projections in the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  O&amp;M costs are projected in the future in accordance with DOE Order No. RA 6120.2. It is Western's policy, as in section 10, paragraph 2(f) of DOE Order No. RA 6120.2, to estimate O&amp;M costs based on historical cost trends and actual project costs from the past. During the cost evaluation period, O&amp;M expense is based on the FY 1993 budget, and projections for FY 1999 through FY 2047 are held constant based on the last year in the cost evaluation period less extraordinary maintenance. O&amp;M does decline in the cost evaluation period. Western has a cost containment committee which reviews and evaluates the O&amp;M budget. The committee's goals are to achieve the lowest O&amp;M budget possible for Western. Therefore, Western does not believe that projections for the operation and maintenance budgets are overstated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Rate impact analysis was not performed prior to seeking congressional authorization for budgeted O&amp;M expenditures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Western and Reclamation have not attempted to limit O&amp;M expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

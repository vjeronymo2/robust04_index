			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow bounces on rises in bonds, dollar Wall Street US share prices bounced strongly from Friday's losses yesterday, influenced by rising bond prices and a strengthening dollar, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 28.26 at 3,829.73, more than making up for Friday's 20.52 loss. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 3.69 to 466.04, while the American SE composite gained 0.68 at 448.72 and the Nasdaq composite was up 6.06 at 768.18. New York SE trading volume came to 260.6m shares. The market was strengthened in part by gains made by the dollar against the yen and the D-Mark. This boosted bond prices by allaying fears that a declining dollar would drive investors out of US government securities. Volume was modest as investors awaited news on interest rate policy expected to come out of today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. The consensus on Wall Street was that the Fed would boost the Federal Funds target rate by 50 basis points to 5 1/2 per cent. Traders were also awaiting other economic indicators this week for hints of inflationary pressures. Expected today were data on retail sales and industrial production, and tomorrow should see the release of all-important consumer price figures. The biotech sector continued to make strong gains after reports that a major pharmaceuticals company was negotiating to buy a minority equity position in Chiron. After closing Dollars 11 3/4 up on Friday, Chiron added Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 74 1/4 , towing along much of the rest of the sector: Genentech gained Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 48, Amgen Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 58 1/2 and Biogen Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 40 5/8 . Cellpro closed Dollars 1/4 off at Dollars 15 1/4 . Chrysler, which was among the most actively traded securities on the NYSE, jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 48 7/8 amid a tussle between the company and Mr Kirk Kerkorian, its biggest shareholder. Mr Kerkorian said he wanted to increase his holding in the carmaker and called on Chrysler to act to lift the value of the company's shares. Eastman Kodak forged ahead Dollars 2 to Dollars 47 3/4 after an analyst at Prudential Securities upgraded the stock to a 'buy', citing the company's speedy move to return to its photographic roots by selling other assets. Canada The Toronto market finished mixed after light trading ahead of today's US Federal Open Market Committee meeting. One trader said any movement yesterday was likely to reflect position-squaring in advance of the expected rise in US interest rates. The TSE 300 index gained 6.51 points at 4,177.19, but declines led rises by 407 to 314 after volume of 48.3m shares. Venezuela Share prices on the Caracas stock exchange slipped for the 11th day in succession, the Merinvest index closing 2.36 or 1.9 per cent lower at 124.05. Electricidad de Caracas, the market's benchmark stock, shed 12 bolivars more to 230 bolivars. It has fallen steadily from above 330 bolivars since the end of September, following the announcement of a Dollars 65m, one-for-six share subscription. Investors continued to off-load Electricidad shares in the cash market, said traders, to take advantage of the share subscription which runs until December 9.</p>

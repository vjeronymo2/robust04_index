			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Nationwide to close 58 estate agencies NATIONWIDE, the second largest building society, yesterday announced that it is to close 58 of its 361 estate agency branches with the loss of 300 jobs, after a year-long review of its estate agency business, John Gapper writes. Nationwide said the move indicated its continued confidence in the rest of its estate agency business, which last year lost Pounds 12m. The society said it would see whether staff made redundant could be offered jobs elsewhere, but it was not confident that many vacancies would be identified. It said there were likely to be compulsory redundancies. Mr Brian Davis, operations director, said the closure of loss-making branches was a 'reaffirmation' of the society's faith in estate agency. Chains of estate agents acquired by societies in the late 1980s have largely made losses. Mr Davis said the society was continually looking at its costs, although Nationwide's cost-income ratio of 55.2 per cent - the sixth highest among the 25 largest building societies - reflected its wide range of services. He added that the branches identified for closure were not particularly concentrated in any region.</p>

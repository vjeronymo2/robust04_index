			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Good, bad and smudgy - Video 'A movie on video cassette always looks better than it is, but is somehow less interesting, whereas in the cinema films often look worse than they are, but are more interesting. You figure it out.' Gore Vidal, quoted in 'Films On Video: The Essential 100', a Sight And Sound Magazine special supplement.* Dear Gore, I've already figured it out. Like many of your apercus it isn't true, but it is interestingly untrue. It is the remark - pardon me - of a literate humanist and an audio-visual philistine. Movies on video look 'better' in the sense that by snipping screen ratios and blurring pictorial values they direct the viewer's attention almost exclusively onto the main characters and what they are saying or doing. Ergo: the story becomes all foreground and no background. It may seem to have more momentum - even more 'style' - while being less interesting graphically and subtextually. Correspondingly, a film on the large screen can 'look worse' to someone fixated merely on that character interaction. (All those square feet of otiose countryside in John Ford]) Am I being fair? Please get back to me if you think not. Respectfully, NA I was roused to this open letter not just by Mr V's remark but by the place where it was quoted. Sight And Sound's '100 Best' is a good news/bad news enterprise. The good news is that it is a priceless guide to the best classics now available on cassette: everything from Broken Blossoms to Raging Bull via B. Keaton, S. Eisenstein, O. Welles and B. Bertolucci. Short credits and appraisals accompany each film; mini-essays offer guidance to different decades and genres. But the bad news: no one warns you what kind of experience to expect. Critics usually obtain good copies of videos. (So, I imagine, does Mr Vidal). But the average punter can be in quite a different boat. Sticking his pole where'er he can in the video-market waters, he either pulls it up to discover a lot of mud and weeds, or he cannot pull it up at all and falls into the river. The second experience is common. Few video stores stock anything resembling Sight And Sound's august pantheon. 'La Regle Du Jeu, sir? Does that star that Chuck Norris or Jean-Claude Van Damme?' So the punter, especially if he lives far from London or other major cities, tumbles headlong into the compulsive, hopeless, finally drowning search for That Video. Then again he might not want the video when he does find it. Last week at a major London store I bought a copy of a Famous John Ford Film (Pounds 5.99, Video Collection). When I played it, expecting two hours of pictorial uplift, I could not believe what I saw. Filthy, mud-dredged colours; fuzzy resolution; muffled sound. John Wayne was, I think, that pink blob swaying across screen from left to right; and that chestnut-coloured mass beneath him could have been a horse, then again it could have been Maureen O'Hara. We began with a letter, so let us end with one. Dear Sight And Sound, We greatly appreciate your attention to video in general and your new library-building supplement in particular. But as a monitor of our screen culture, you should be more conscientious in warning readers about how debased the video experience can be in the hands of some modern video companies. Why should the customer put up with sound and picture quality that is often far worse in over-the-counter cassettes than in recordings he makes at home from his own TV? Thank you. NA Just time for a postscript on the new releases. Highly commended: Terence Davies's dazzling elegy to a British childhood The Long Day Closes (Curzon). Commended: Ghosts Of The Civil Dead (Electric), menacing avant-garde tale of hi-tech prison life in Australia. Best reissues: Annie Hall (MGM/UA), The Manchurian Candidate (MGM/UA), Zero De Conduite (Artificial Eye). And remember: return all copies that are visually or aurally substandard. I do. *April issue of Sight and Sound, Pounds 2</p>

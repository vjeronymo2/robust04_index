			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / When he dies my dear, all this will be yours: How the life assurance industry, with such a strong position in society, became accused of a breach of trust Ghayur Butt was told how to stand at a pub bar and knock a pint of beer over a fellow customer. Profuse apologies were then supposed to be offered and the victim would be bought another drink. It is an old salesman's trick: you then chat about the victim's life, hopes, ambitions and fears. You gain their confidence and then, as a friend, you let them in on the deal. It was a trick taught to - but not used by - Ghayur Butt. But he was not selling amazing cures for baldness, an elixir of youth or quarter price stereo sets. He was working in a respected financial services industry, controlling Pounds 400bn of funds. Butt was one of 200,000 'financial advisers' helping clients to choose appropriate life assurance and pensions for their security that of their families. At least, that is what they said they were doing and what an array of providers such as Cornhill, Legal and General, Scottish Widows, Colonial Mutual and Guardian Royal Exchange, claim is their mission. Even life offices with respectable names such as these have been embroiled in the industry's recent troubles. All five were fined by the industry's regulator (Lautro) for breaking the rules (though not for practices as extreme as those described by Butt). Norwich Union, another household name, was recently forced to suspend its entire sales force of 800 so that they could be retrained to give proper financial advice. Ghayur Butt has left his job with the once high-profile MI (formerly Merchant Investors) insurance group, for which he worked at around the time of the industry's frenetic expansion at the end of the 1980s. It was then, he says, that he was taught the pub sales trick by a colleague. He says there were other similiar tricks in the industry, for example: 'Some salesmen sent letters to married women, talking about their company and appending a blank form with a piece of paper telling the woman: 'This is what you will get when your husband dies.' In order to get the job with MI he had to convince his future boss that he had a voracious appetite for money: 'I told him my ambition was to own six or seven houses and an aircraft,' Butt says. He is one of 100,000 salesmen who have left the industry since 1990, around the peak of the business's prosperity. Hundreds of those who dropped out have started legal action against their former companies alleging unfair dismissal and poor business practice. The charge against the industry is that in far too many cases it has been filling the pockets of salesmen, senior managers - and in the case of limited companies, of shareholders - by extracting fat commissions from the high pressure selling of schemes which customers did not really want or need. In tens of thousands of cases, policies are thought to have been against the best interests of customers. The industry is in a fearful mess, which would have astonished and saddened the founding fathers of life assurance, who established the first mutual assurance fund in 1762. This was based on a mathematical theory, which ensured that the premiums of members would pay the benefits promised by their policies. The first prospectus, called A short Account of the Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorships, published in 1764, says: 'These considerations induced a number of gentlemen . . . to form a design of establishing a Society for equitable assurances upon lives, with a view to the sole benefit of the Persons Assured, whose interest hath been all along considered as wholly distinct from, not to say incompatible with, that of the Assurers; a society in which the assured being at the same time mutually assurers one to the other, the interests of the one might be the interest of both . . . ' * More than two centuries later, the mutual societies operate in a world in which these principles of self help and mutual support are mixed in with modern ideas of marketing and salesmanship. They compete with profit maximising companies, and have absorbed some of their ethos. Although many independent advisers ensure that clients get good value for money from respectable organisations, there are many others who are forced to sell poor quality products, because they are tied agents trapped in a commission structure which requires them to sell or starve. And many policy-holders are left unaware of how much is being deducted from their premiums. As Jean Lucas, who sold insurance for the Pegasus investment company in Plymouth, Devon says: 'You would see that some prospective clients might have to struggle to pay the premiums, but because your livelihood depended on it, you would play on their emotions to try to sell them something.' Later this summer, the Securities and Investments Board, the main government regulator for financial services, is to publish a report on pension transfers which may require life companies to pay hundreds of millions of pounds to consumers found to have lost out because they were sold inappropriate products. How could an industry with such a proud history and such a strong position in British society become accused of such a breach of trust? Nearly 70 per cent of UK families have some form of life insurance, with the industry paying out about Pounds 10bn a year in benefits. One answer is that not nearly as many people would have bought life assurance if the policies had not been actively sold to them. This is because the benefits are often paid far in the future and are difficult to evaluate. Moreover few consumers have the expertise to compare the benefits and costs of different policies. 'What the consumer buys is all about who gets to him first and how persuasive he is,' says Kit Jebens, chief executive of Lautro. So from the mid-1980s, as the business responded to the surge in interest by cash-rich consumers in investment products, life companies took on tens of thousands of new sales agents. New business was also offered by the government's decision in 1988 to allow people to switch from occupational pension schemes to individually tailored pensions offered by the private sector. These were exciting times. Successful sales people - mainly self-employed - could earn commissions of Pounds 500,000 a year and the very top ones up to Pounds 1m. Few were more successful than Trevor Deaves, the flamboyant founder of Porchester investment group which reversed into Merchant Investors in 1987 and built up a reputation for highly aggressive selling. Deaves was known for his stable of Porsches and his love of the big occasion - he once financed an over-the-top production of Aida in the Earls Court exhibition hall in London. Deaves used to invite his 2,000 sales people to the London Palladium to harangue them, sometimes with colourful language. They called him 'god'. After leaving his job as chief executive of MI in 1991 following management disputes, he is now chief operating officer of LifeCo, a US investment group in Florida. 'Looking back at my time in MI I don't have any regrets,' he says. 'My supporters think I had a dramatic and productive effect (on the life industry), while the old fogeys are glad to see the back of me. I know which side I'm on.' Deaves adds: 'We had few unhappy customers. We were ahead of our time.' But Alan Roberts, a former MI director who worked with Deaves, says that the sales force was 'brainwashed' into maximising sales. 'Trevor could be very hard on them (the sales force),' he recalls. 'You sometimes had to kick people to get them off their backsides.' Although MI would probably carry off the prizes for hard-sell techniques, Allied Dunbar was also well known for its vigorous approach. Patrick Bearchell, who worked for the company between 1991 and 1992, remembers 'strong pressure' from managers. He says: 'We were licensed to give best advice but it wasn't' A superior product offered by another company would not be mentioned, he says. This is standard practice: under Lautro rules, direct salesmen need not discuss competing products. Stephen Day, who worked for the UK arm of Australian Mutual Provident, says: 'It's a very calculating industry, appealing to people's basic instincts. My personality was completely changed during the six months I worked in the business.' Day was alluding to the system of rewards and punishments which continue to characterise the industry's sales efforts. The system was particularly powerful in the 1989-1991 period when the atmosphere in some sales teams could be best described as Wild West mixed in with eastern bazaar. Although product sales were still strong, the market was beginning to become saturated and the first signs of the early 1990s recession were starting to make selling conditions tougher. Sales people were put under increasing pressure and encouraged by a range of incentives, some of them fairly obvious, such as bottles of whisky and holidays in the Bahamas. But in one life office, the manager would loan his Rolex watch for a day to the agent who had made the best sale during the week. Bizarre punishments were also devised for those who had done badly: at one branch of a big insurer, the man who was bottom of the sales league over the previous month would be told to walk round the building for a day dressed in ladies' underwear. A variation of this would be to make the person at the bottom of the pile wear an over-sized nappy all day. This culture was made the more frenetic by a rapid ebb and flow of sales people. One authoritative estimate puts the annual turnover of sales representatives in the early 1990s at nearly 60 per cent, compared with 30 to 40 per cent in more normal times. They included all sorts of people: former airline pilots, computer programmers, students, wine merchants, lawyers and amusement arcade operators. 'In many cases people were told to draw up a hit list of family and friends: after they had sold to them they would often leave to be replaced by others,' says Ray McKay, a former Merchant Investors' salesman. Derek Rogers, a director of the UK arm of the US insurer, Lincoln International and a 30-year veteran of the industry, recalls: 'If you took on 1,000 people you'd be lucky if 100 were any good. It was the mud on the wall principle: you'd throw a lot on but a lot would drop off.' However, he says the industry has changed, with much more attention being paid to hiring the right people, retaining them for reasonable periods and making sure that they give appropriate advice. But can the industry really reform itself in this way? Jebens of Lautro says a series of 'draconian' measures by the regulator - including tougher rules on training, supervision of agents and the degree to which representatives with poor sales records can transfer between companies - has led to much more ethical sales behaviour. 'I am confident the level of abuses (to the consumer) is now at a more acceptable level,' says Jebens. Others from the industry say the criticism has got out of hand. 'The Law Society gets numerous complaints about lawyers but this doesn't get the same publicity,' complains Mike Wilson, a former Allied Dunbar chief executive who is now chief executive of the J. Rothschild Assurance company set up two years ago. Rogers, the Lincoln director, believes the industry is the subject of a media vendetta. He says sardonically: 'Perhaps we will soon do away with insurance companies and leave financial journalists to write about the products people should have. But then 95 per cent of the population wouldn't have proper insurance cover.' But Jon Minchin, head of Pensionline, a company in Cheam, Surrey, which advises on pension transfers, says: 'For the insurance industry, the rules haven't changed anything. The commission structure remains, so does the pressure to sell and the abuses will continue.' One veteran of the industry, who asked not to be named, says: 'Having trained a lot of rottweilers they (company managements) are expecting us to behave like poodles, hoping we won't bite.' *Equitable Assurances, by Maurice Edward Ogborn, George Allen and Unwin, 1962 Life Insurance and you, Page VI</p>

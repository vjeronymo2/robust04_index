			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Advice for new exporters  -In a Nutshell Advice and help for new exporters is fragmented and divided between too many providers, according to a report by the British Chambers of Commerce. Marketing of the services is not focused and does not reach the small and medium-sized companies that should be 'taking up the export challenge', the report says. The BCC says national television programmes should be produced to encourage exporters. Business Link should not be relied on to provide a full service - instead existing services provided by the DTI, Chambers of Commerce and Trade Associations should be improved and better co-ordinated. The government should also back a scheme offering temporary experienced help to companies developing export markets. The BCC says there is 'enormous potential' for many British companies in overseas markets but it says that potential exporters should have been established for more than 18 months, should employ five people or more and have sales in excess of Pounds 250,000.

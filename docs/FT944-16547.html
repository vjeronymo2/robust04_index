			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / World Trade News: US antidumping rules shown to be arbitrary Mexico, a country with no indigenous television technology, now supplies 70 per cent of the television sets imported into the US market. This is the result of the circumvention of US dumping duties on colour picture tubes produced in Japan, Korea, Singapore and Canada, according to Mr Timothy Regan, a spokesman for the Committee to Preserve American Colour Television (Compact). From all sides of the dozens of antidumping and countervailing cases brought each year to the US Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission, there are stories of inconsistent findings, rulings easily circumvented, inept administration of decisions, and inadequate enforcement. Ecuador, last month found guilty by the US Commerce Department, of 'dumping' roses in the US market, says the 50 per cent duty to be levied will leave 10,000 Indian workers without jobs. In the case of Ecuador, that government said the US Commerce Department was 'arbitrary and inconsistent' when it refused to let one of the defendants correct an error on a computer tape and did not follow its usual practices in determining the dumping margin. Mr Edgar Teran-Teran, US ambassador, said the industry received no government subsidies. 'It is inconceivable to think of some kind of dumping from flower growers if they receive no support.' Cases like these form part of the record being scrutinised by the International Trade Commission as it seeks to complete one of the broadest investigations ever conducted on the effects of US antidumping and countervailing duties on the economy. The results of the study are due next June. At a recent ITC public hearing, commissioners heard from foreign suppliers, domestic producers, lawyers and academics, who said the 'unfair trade laws' were themselves unfair. Mr Jon Jenson, president of the Precision Metalforming Association, said duties on foreign steel products had caused shortages of critical raw materials not produced in the US. An effective mechanism had to be devised to permit import of products in short supply. Mr David Gridley, an official at the Torrington Company, a producer of antifriction bearings, said many domestic shortages result from US industry close-downs caused by dumping: 'One manifestation of harm to the domestic industry was the delivery and other problems that flowed from reduced capacity.' The Copper and Brass Fabricators Council said the US Customs Service and the US Commerce Department did not even know whether antidumping and countervailing duties had been assessed and collected: 'Everyone assumes that the duties are being collected, but there is no trustworthy evidence to substantiate this claim or to ascertain the amounts of the duties.' The US antidumping laws were 'a real world example of an existential system', said Mr Michael Finger, World Bank chief economist. 'In antidumping law, existence precedes essence. Essence is no more than a collection of accidents - dumping is whatever you can get the government to act against under the antidumping law.'</p>

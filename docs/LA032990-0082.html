			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALLOT TITLE: CANDIDATE IN 3 WORDS OR LESS  </P> <P> One candidate chose the term "peon."  </P> <P> Another sought the ballot designation "wage slave," but was turned down. He  finally accepted the more prosaic "worker" in its place.  </P> <P> State election officials told a third candidate he could use "poker player" as  his occupation, but not "gambler."  </P> <P> Today is the deadline for deciding candidates' occupational designations that  will appear under their names on the June primary ballot. The chief of the  secretary of state's elections division, Caren Daniels-Meade, reports there  have been more than 120 disputes over the designations, which should be no more  than three words long. Some of the rifts have involved well-known candidates,  others obscure ones. A few cases are in court; a few others remain unresolved.  </P> <P> If there is no agreement between election officials and the candidate, and no  court gives directions by tonight, the candidate will appear on the ballot with  no designation under his or her name.  </P> <P> Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein is already resigned to that  category. When the secretary of state's office turned down her preferred  designation of "former mayor of San Francisco," on grounds it was "too long and  the word 'former' cannot be used," she decided to run without designation.  </P> <P> Ballot designations can be critical. Polls show that some candidates do far  better with one designation than another, particularly in races where many  voters are grasping for straws in making up their minds.  </P> <P> For example, in the most recent Los Angeles County judicial elections, the only  judge who lost was Roberta Ralph, who made the mistake of picking the  designation "incumbent," rather than Superior Court judge. Other candidates  have benefited by designating themselves "disabled veteran" or in some other  way that might elicit voter sympathy.  </P> <P> Those who have held important elected offices, like Feinstein, usually wish to  remind the electorate of it. Angela Buchanan, a Republican candidate for state  treasurer, for instance, told the secretary of state's office she wanted to use  "retired U.S. treasurer" as her designation, thus reminding voters of a  position she held more than a decade ago. This was rejected as "not  appropriate" and the matter is in court.  </P> <P> One of the angriest ballot designation battles this year involves Walter  Zelman, a Democratic candidate for insurance commissioner who wants to use  "director, Common Cause" as his ballot designation, despite the fact that he  resigned that position to run and no longer occupies it.  </P> <P> Election officials accepted this under a policy that says if someone had a job  just before announcing candidacy, that job can be used as the designation. But  Common Cause's national president has denounced Zelman for using his former  Common Cause title, and Common Cause's new state director is seeking a court  order prohibiting its use.  </P> <P> Daniels-Meade said the secretary of state's office had trouble with seven other  insurance commissioner candidates' choices for ballot designation. Only one of  those remains unresolved.  </P> <P> Officials agreed, after documentation was submitted, to accept Democrat Michael  Blanco's desire to be designated as "living trust attorney," and Democrat Ray  Bourhis' desire to be designated as "insurance consumer's attorney." They  reached an agreement with Democrat Bill Press to use "consumer advocacy,  commentator," in place of the "consumer advocate, commentator" that he  originally wanted to use. Peace and Freedom candidate Tom Condit was the one  who settled for "worker" in place of "wage slave." Peace and Freedom candidate  B. K. Duren's wish for "activist for democracy" was changed to "community  development organizer" and Libertarian Ted Brown's choice of "insurance client  representative" was altered to "insurance adjuster/investigator."  </P> <P> But there has been no agreement over Republican Tom Skornia's desire to be  designated "legal reform advocate." A court hearing is set on that today.  </P> <P> Chief Deputy Secretary of State Anthony L. Miller explains that election laws  state that the ballot designation is supposed to reflect the profession,  vocation or occupation of the candidate, and not a statement of belief in a  particular issue or the name of any political philosophy.  </P> <P> Thus, Merle Woo, a Peace and Freedom candidate for governor, was turned town  when she wanted to use "socialist feminist educator" under her name on the  ballot. She settled on "feminist studies educator."  </P> <P> It often seems to be a fairly intricate matter of semantics, and the secretary  of state's office frequently asks candidates to submit documentation or  arguments that will persuade it to go along with a suggested designation.  </P> <P> For instance, in the case of Roger Batchelder, the San Diego state Senate  candidate who wanted to be known as a "peon," election officials were at first  reluctant. But he pointed out that a dictionary definition of the term was "a  member of the laboring class" and convinced them that for him "peon" was  accurate.  </P> <P> Daniels-Meade said that recent heavy attention focused on the abortion issue  led several candidates to try unsuccessfully for designations reflecting both  sides of the issue.  </P> <P> Salomer Honigsfeld, a Peace and Freedom candidate for the 4th District Board of  Equalization seat, for instance, tried to get "pro-choice nurse" past the  authorities. But she settled for "retired nurse."  </P> <P> Republican Jeffrey T. Greene, running for governor, wants to use "family values  advocate and political organizer," a violation also of the three-word limit the  state imposes. This one remains unresolved.  </P> <P> "We won't take it if it implies an evaluation," Daniels-Meade explains.  </P> <P> "But this is a very difficult law to administer," she said. "The candidates are  getting more creative. We spent seven or eight extra hours last Saturday  calling people at home and trying to work some of these things out."  </P> <P> But some, Daniels-Meade said, could not be resolved. John Eastman, for  instance, a Republican congressional candidate from West Covina, wanted to call  himself a "presidential appointee." Told that this was not acceptable to  election officials, he then proposed "Reagan-Bush official, businessman." That  was not acceptable either and there is, as yet, no agreement.  </P></p>

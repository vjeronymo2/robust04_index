			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Management: Tomorrow's leaders need to get up and go - Paul Evans says that experience of working abroad is vital A question companies frequently ask is: 'How can we develop the Euro-manager?' I answer that the idea of a supra-national polyglot is as illusory as that of a supra-national European union. But what the single European market will do is to make it easier for executives to develop the qualities that any business leader needs to cope in a world where things have to be done better, cheaper and faster. And the experience of managing in a different culture may be the best way of developing global leadership talent. The internationalisation of management is not simply a matter of ensuring broad national representation on management teams, though that may be a by-product. Languages help, but that is not the central issue. Nor is it a question of developing some mythical international superperson. The leaders I admire all tell me that they had a stretching assignment at an early age. The time-tested formula is to find good people and then put them in a position where they have to get results through people who think differently from them, and who have more expertise - in other words, a position where they have to lead. Today the emphasis has shifted from cross-functional experience to international experience. Dupont is a good example. Its norm for high potential executives is: 'International experience is obligatory; cross-functional experience is desirable and cross-divisional experience may sometimes be necessary.' That would apply to companies of the calibre of Shell, Unilever, Nestle, Ciba-Geigy and ABB. A study by Kevin Barham and his colleagues at Ashridge Management College in the UK showed that executives who successfully completed international assignments excelled in a number of managerial competences: championing international strategy (visioning the future), cross-border co-ordination (handling international teams) and acting as cultural change agents (digging below the surface and dealing with critical dilemmas). Internationalisation is also a question of ensuring that managers have what my colleague Yves Doz calls 'perspective'. Shell, IBM and Unilever want local managers to run local businesses. But these companies would not trust a local until that person had proven him or herself in a headquarters or regional staff role. But international management development is not just a tool to cultivate individual managers. It can also give a company what Shell calls 'glue' or 'cohesion'. Shell's organisational philosophy is to give autonomy to local operating companies while acting as a tightly co-ordinated group. As Lo Van Wachem, the former chairman of the group, said: 'There are three things that hold these autonomous companies together. The first is the common logo. The second is common financial systems. And the third and most important source of cohesion is management development - close attention to career development.' Most corporations give at least token acknowledgement to internationalising management. However, a 1989 survey of leading US corporations by Korn, Ferry with Columbia Business School found only 6 per cent reporting that foreign assignments were essential for senior executives, with 49 per cent believing foreign assignments to be immaterial. So why the disparity? The answer in part is that few such companies are global and few have understood the connection between international experience and leadership. Another part of the problem lies with today's generation of CEOs, many of whose international experience is patchy. If I and my colleagues read the signals correctly, CEOs will be the next rank in the hierarchy to come under fire. During the 1980s the responsibility for strategy was largely devolved to business units. And in today's flatter organisations, leaders in the middle are assuming ever greater responsibilities. I see a lot of disquiet among CEOs who are confronting issues such as the role of top management in an age of global competition. And how does top management add value to the corporation? Many will be replaced by the new generation of leaders who can answer these questions; whether they are German or British, Bangladeshi or Chinese doesn't matter. These coming top managers will be better leaders, with depth of perspective, breadth of vision and an ability to thrive on complexity, all nurtured and put to the test by their international experiences.

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / N-plant reprocessing delay ordered BRITISH Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) has been told by the UK pollution authority not to load uranium into its new reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria while public consultations on its authorisation are going on. BNFL, which plans to commission its controversial new Pounds 1.85bn Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp) next year, had asked the Pollution Inspectorate if it could begin loading uranium on the basis of an existing authorisation. It said that would not increase discharges, since reprocessing is not due to start until next spring. The inspectorate declined the request, saying it might prejudice consultation on the new draft authorisation, which is due to start shortly. The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate confirmed that the pollution inspectorate had asked it not to give consent to go to the active commissioning stage. BNFL said yesterday that the inspectorate's position still left time for the eight-week consultation period to be completed by the end of this year, when BNFL hopes to begin the commissioning process. The move was welcomed by environmentalists, but Sellafield unions launched a campaign against what they claim is a delay that might threaten several thousand jobs at the site. The unions, who have the backing of local MP Mr Jack Cunningham, believe the inspectorate has been influenced by a 'bluff' from anti-nuclear groups. 'It appears to be all the result of the Greenpeace anti-nuclear brigade who've been conducting a rent-a-letter campaign,' said Mr Alan Westonage, chairman of the Sellafield shop stewards. More than 2,000 contractors are employed on the Thorp site at present, said Mr Westonage. 'All these jobs are at risk.' The unions also fear that if delays drag on, permanent BNFL staff at Thorp may be affected. Mr Cunningham, who met union leaders for talks at Sellafield yesterday, said afterwards he was planning a campaign of action with them at Westminster and Whitehall to put pressure on the inspectorate to start consultation on discharge authorisation. 'I'm extremely concerned about the unexplained delay which seriously threatens several contractors' jobs in the short term and could possibly damage the reputation of BNFL with its customers at home and abroad,' he said. He added that in 1976 Thorp had been subject to a public inquiry lasting 100 days, one of the longest in Britain, which had addressed all the issues in sufficient depth. 'There is simply no credible case for a second inquiry into the operation of Thorp,' he said.</p>

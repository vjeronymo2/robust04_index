			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Letter: Bamboozled Sir, I am one of your readers who is obviously easily bamboozled. I read an article by Arthur Hellyer, whom I almost venerate, about peat (April 20). I then read a letter by Lee St Lawrence (April 27) whom I feel, with that name, I ought perhaps to venerate. He extols, as do some of my favourite authorities, the value of coir. I believe both of them - but as a consumer and a buyer with limited income (albeit sufficient to see the FT) - I don't feel I know enough about the costs. Could perhaps some other knowledgeable reader tell me evenhandedly the economics and perhaps the comparative values as a gardening commodity. J J G Rewick, 1 Oaken Coppice, Ashtead, Surrey</p>

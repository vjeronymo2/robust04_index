			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Special Feature -- The New Macedonian </F> Credits and the Return of the Debts"]    [Text] 1) The first credit Macedonia received after its  independence was the one from Mr. George Soros, last Winter,  which totalled US$25 million. The credit was paid back within  the set deadline, December, last year, and the interest was  libor [London Interbank Offered Rate] + one percent point. Half  of the credit was used to buy petrol, and the other half was  given to the "Stopanska" and "Komercijalna" bank which marketed  the funds to their customers.    2) The next loan was arranged with the International  Monetary  Fund (IMF), up to US$35 million, through a STF arrangement. The  first half of these funds (US$17.5 million) will become  available toward the middle of February, and the other US$17.5  million, toward the middle of this year. The credit is  conditioned with the adherence to the new stabilization program  of the Government and certain conditions in the monetary and  fiscal policy. The credit is disbursed for a 10 year period, a  variable interest and a 4.5 year grace period.    As the Minister Without Portfolio Ljube Trpevski, otherwise  responsible for contacts with the international organizations in  the Macedonian Government, told MIC, the received sum is  important, however, what is more important is that this STF  arrangement with IMF presents a green light for negotiations  with all other international finance institutions with which  negotiations would otherwise progress very slowly.    The first part of the credit, which should be disbursed  toward the middle of February, will be used to pay back the  US$106 million debt to the World bank (IBRD).    3) Since Macedonia became a member of the International  Development Agency (IDA) in December, it became possible to  receive credits both from this agency and the IBRD, which IDA is  part of. The total sum of the two credits amounts to US$80  million.    The credit from IDA is intended for economic reconstruction  (economic recovery loan) and totals US$40 million. It is to be  paid back within 35 years, with a 10 year grace period, which  means that the first installment will arrive in the year 2004.  Beside this, the credit is without interest.    The credit from IBRD, on the other hand, is disbursed with a  pay- back period of 25 years, with a 5 year grace period, and  the interest is variable.    In view of the fact that the IDA credit is far more  favorable, it will be the first to be used. US$32 million will  be used to pay- back the old debt to IBRD, and the remaining  US$48 million will be withdrawn in the following months. They  will be used to support the balance-of-payment and the foreign  currency reserves of the state.    The condition for the granting of these credits is the  presentation of documents for the carried out imports of goods  and services by Macedonia firms. Documents for the import of  tobacco, machines for the processing of tobacco, jewelry, gold,  valuables, nuclear materials, etc. can not be presented in order  to fulfill the condition.    According to Mr. Trpevski, the Government already has  sufficient documentation to immediately draw the first US$32  million, and the documentation for the remaining sum of US$48  million will not present a problem in view of the fact that the  total Macedonian imports far exceed the sum of US$80 million.    These two credits have been accepted by the Government of  Macedonia, and Parliament has also adopted a Law for the  ratification of the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia  and IBRD. Now, when that is over, the World bank is expected to  approve the credit on 8 February, and the first US$32 million  will be able to be withdrawn upon the showing of the documents  for the import of goods in Macedonia.    4) A new credit has been requested from Mr. George Soros,  to the same amount as the previous -- US$25 million. The  pay-back period for this credit is November 1994, in three  installments, and the interest is libor + one percent point.    US$9 million will be used to pay-back the old debt to the  World bank, and the rest will be withdrawn according to the  needs. The Republic is not obliged to use the entire credit,  but only if there is a need.    The Macedonian Parliament has already discussed this  credit, and has decided to ratify the agreement between the  Government and Mr. Soros.    5) A US$33 million credit has been received from the  European  Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). A sum of US$27  million will be used for the construction of a 400 KWH  long-distance power line from the Mining-energetic combine  "Bitola" to Skopje.    The remaining US$6 million will be put to use for the  realization of projects from the government program for the  saving and substitution of energy.    The credit is obtained with a pay-back period of 12 years  and a 3 year grace period. The interest amounts to 7.5%, in  average.    The recipient of the entire credit is the  "Electrodistribution of Macedonia," whereby a part will be  transferred to the Government, for its saving and substitution  program, with an obligation to pay-back the same, which has  simultaneously signed an agreement for guaranteeing the entire  credit.    6) The Macedonian Government will soon mount new  negotiations  with the World bank, to obtain a new credit, which, according to  the Government, is expected to total US$60 million, and would be  intended for structural adjustment (structural adjustment loan).    US$40 million are planned to be received in 1994, intended  for projects of infrastructural importance, such as help for the  restructuring of the companies and the process of privatization,  and partly, for the development of the communications East-West,  or, more specifically, the road (or railroad) Drac (Albania) --  Istanbul (Turkey).    7) New negotiations with IMF for the reaching of a stand-by  arrangement, for which conditions are more difficult to meet,  and much stricter, are expected to begin in the period May-June.  The stand-by arrangement is expected to be financially  supported with a sum similar or exactly like the one of the STF  arrangement, that is, approximately US$35 million.    8) As far as the commercial credits are concerned, the  Turkish bank for foreign trade is offering a credit for the  import of equipment and food from Turkey, valued at US$23-35  million. The bank authorized for the setting of the matters and  the gathering of recipients of this credit is "Komercijalna  banka" from Skopje. Negotiations for this credit are still  underway.    9) Beside all of this, the Government of the Republic of  Macedonia plans to begin negotiations with the Paris club or the  London club, during this year, for the regulation (eventual  writing off or reprogramming) of the debts to these associations.    Connected with almost all these credits is the debt to the  World bank, which is due for payback this month, and which  amounts to US$106.6 million.    The financial construction of the funds for the pay-back of  the debt is the following:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |US$26.5 million from donations:                                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Out of which:                                                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |US$10 million from Holland                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |US$5 million from United States                                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |US$3 million from Switzerland                                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |US$3 million from Austria                                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |US$2.5 million from Italy                                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |US$1 million from Turkey                                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |US$1.8 million from Sweden                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |US$0.2 million from Luxembourg                                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |US$9 million from Mr. Soros' credit                                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |US$32 million from the IDA and IBRD credit                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |US$17.5 million from the IMF credit                                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |US$22.5 million from the foreign currency reserves of Macedonia              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total: approximately US$107 million                                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |* Donations are also expected to be received from other countries, while in  |  |the meantime, US$1.5 million arrived from Belgium.                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      In addition, it should also be taken into account that some  US$ 25 million, which are due for pay-back, consisting of the  principal credit + interest, will have to be paid to the World  bank in 1994. Another US$11 million will have to be set aside  for the private creditors and the EIB and EUROFIMA.</p>

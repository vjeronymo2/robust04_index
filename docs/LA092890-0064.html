			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHIAT'S CREATIVE CHIEF IN N.Y. QUITS SUDDENLY  </P> <P> Chiat/Day/Mojo, the Venice agency whose New York office is already down on its  luck, got another kick in the teeth Thursday. Its mercurial but highly talented  East Coast creative chief abruptly left to start his own agency.  </P> <P> Tom McElligott, who created the current black-and-white ads for Calvin Klein's  Obsession, which feature an off-camera narrator reciting literary passages and  actors from TV's "Twin Peaks," will become chairman of a new Minneapolis  agency, McElligott Wright Morrison White.  </P> <P> The move is a blow to Chiat/Day, which seemed to have pulled a major coup in  November, 1989, when it brought the 47-year-old McElligott on board. Ever  provocative, McElligott is regarded by many as one of a handful of top creative  directors in the nation. Some rank him second only to Chiat/Day's other top  creative head, Lee Clow.  </P> <P> The timing could hardly be worse for Chiat/Day, which has seen a recent flow of  business away from its New York office. This year it has lost much of the  $30-million Reebok business as well as the $20-million account for Royal  Caribbean Cruise Line. Earlier this week, it also lost the $4-million Arrow  shirt ad business. The agency reshuffled management in the New York office  earlier this summer, including appointing a new president.  </P> <P> For McElligott and his partners -- all of whom have worked together at one  point or another -- the timing would also seem to present a problem. The  advertising industry is in a slowdown, and many agencies are struggling to stay  above water.  </P> <P> "Ironically, we believe that the looming recession is a perfect environment for  this agency's birth," McElligott said in a statement. He was en route to  Minneapolis and unavailable for further comment.  </P> <P> The agency, which officially opens Nov. 1, has no clients. But in no time it is  expected to compete head-on with Fallon McElligott, the Minneapolis agency  where he was founding partner. That shop made its mark nationally in the  mid-1980s by winning top awards.  </P></p>

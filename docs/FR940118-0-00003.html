			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons were again afforded an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to comment on the proposed action. Due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration has been given to the five comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters concur with the proposed rule as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter (Collins) states that there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two errors in the part numbers referenced in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD: (1) part number (P/N)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 622&hyph;4540&hyph;022 was referenced as P/N 622&hyph;4540&hyph;22 in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicability section of the AD; and (2) in the chart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in paragraph (c) of the proposed AD, the sentence that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consists of the following words: ``All applicable DME&hyph;700 Units, Converts &hyph;022, &hyph;021, or &hyph;022 to &hyph;023.'' should be changed to ``All applicable DME&hyph;700 Units, Converts &hyph;020, &hyph;021, or &hyph;022 to &hyph;023.'' The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concurs and has changed the proposed AD accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter reports that the Airbus Model A330  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane is not yet certificated, and should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the list of affected airplane models. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA concurs that this airplane is not certificated and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has deleted it from the list of possible affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes. However, the Applicability section of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD is worded as ``DME equipment that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installed on, but not limited to, the following model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category:''. If this airplane would become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificated for operation with the Collins DME&hyph;700  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, then this action would apply to these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter states that these DME units were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> never certificated on Boeing Model B757 airplanes, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should therefore be removed from the applicability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed AD. The FAA concurs and has revised the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This same commenter suggests several minor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> editorial revisions and corrections to increase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understanding of the proposed AD. The FAA concurs that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these changes would improve clarity and has revised the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of all available information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the comments noted above, the FAA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that air safety and the public interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the changes referenced above and minor editorial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrections. The FAA has determined that these changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and corrections will not change the meaning of the AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nor add any additional burden upon the public than was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The condition specified by the required action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not caused by actual hours time-in-service (TIS) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane that the equipment is installed in. There is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no correlation between improper operation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment and the age or number of times the equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is utilized. Based on this, the compliance time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this AD is presented in calendar time instead of hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 518 DME&hyph;700 units installed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this AD, that it will take approximately 7 workhours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per unit to accomplish the required action, and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the owner/operator. Based on these figures, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to be $199,430. This cost figure is based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the assumption that none of the affected airplane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owners/operators have accomplished the required action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial direct effects on the States, on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship between the national government and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, or on the distribution of power and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities among the various levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not have a significant economic impact, positive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or negative, on a substantial number of small entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided under the caption `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Incorporation by reference, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Adoption of the Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

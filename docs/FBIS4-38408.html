			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Interior Minister Viktor Yerin has  emphasized that there are no differences between the Interior  Ministry and the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS) as  represented by some parts of the media. Speaking at a  nation-wide conference in the FCS in Moscow Friday, he called  for combined efforts and coordinated activities by the  law-enforcement bodies in the struggle against crime which had  corrupted many state offices, the FCS public relations center  told Interfax.    The conference was attended by officials of the Prosecutor's  Office, State Customs Committee, Supreme Court, tax police and  border guards.    Yerin said that revealing traitors was equally important for  all agencies. "We struggle for the honor of the law-enforcement  bodies, removing those who cooperate with criminals," he was  quoted as saying.    In Yerin's opinion, supported by the FCS Director Sergey  Stepashin, it is necessary to develop an agreement between the  Interior Ministry and the FCS clearly defining their interaction  in critical and emergency situation.    Acting Prosecutor General Aleksey Ilyushenko said that crime  had expanded in Russia recently. He called for the return of  investigation units which used to be the most professional  structures within the Russian Security Ministry specializing on  specially grave crimes.</p>

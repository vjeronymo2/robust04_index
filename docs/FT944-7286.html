			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Property: Quote, unquote - Are listed companies good value From an international perspective, the structure of the UK property market is unusual. The quoted property sector is valued at Pounds 13.5bn, with assets of perhaps Pounds 16bn held in stock-exchange listed companies. No other country has such a large number of quoted property companies. But are investors right to support such a large quoted sector? Between 1970 and the end of 1993, the Investment Property Databank index showed an average annual total return of 12.4 per cent, excluding development and trading activity. This is the return available to a passive investor owning properties directly. Over the same period, the quoted property sector also showed an average total return of 12.4 per cent. In other words, property companies have - in aggregate, over the long term - added nothing to the performance of their underlying assets. In theory, property companies should add value in two ways: through management expertise and gearing. The performance of the shares suggests these features are, at best, mixed blessings. Management expertise costs money, which means that part of the investors' income is eaten away by executive salaries and administrative costs. According to an analysis by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, on average 8 per cent of property companies' gross rental income is absorbed by administration costs, over and above the cost of maintaining the buildings. This average figure hides a wide variety of performance. The most costly companies to run (usually developers) spend up to 20 per cent of gross rents on administration. 'There are too many property companies and too few with the necessary skills to outperform over the long run. There should be 40 larger property companies rather than 120 smaller ones. The savings in terms of expenses alone would enhance investment performance,' said Mr Marc Gilbard, analyst at Goldman Sachs. Gearing also cuts both ways. During the upturn shareholders see the value of their company rise far faster than an ungeared investment. When property values are falling, though, shareholders' funds can be rapidly eroded. In an ideal world, property companies would borrow going into recovery and repay debts as the market started to peak. Yet the sector has a nasty habit of becoming over-geared at the wrong point in the cycle. For example, average gearing across the sector is now about 60 per cent, low by historic standards in spite of the early stage of recovery. Yet as the market peaked in the late 1980s, average gearing rose to more than 100 per cent. In practice, gearing makes the performance of the shares more volatile than the underlying property market. This volatility is a disadvantage. Most institutional investors are interested in the risk-adjusted return from their assets. Volatile assets have to work harder to justify their place in the portfolio. There are two main arguments in defence of property companies. First, just because property companies in aggregate do not outperform their underlying assets does not mean that individual companies cannot deliver spectacular returns. One of the best performing property companies over the past 20 years has been Helical Bar, the developer run by Mr Michael Slade. The shares have provided an annualised total return of 66 per cent over that period, outperforming both the property market and the wider equity market by a streak. (Incidentally, the company also has one of the highest ratios of expenses to rental income.) Second, and more important, quoted property companies provide investors with liquidity. This allows fund managers to increase and decrease their exposure to the market at speed and low cost. In contrast, buildings are an illiquid asset which are expensive to trade and only available in large packages. Smaller investment institutions and private investors, without the expertise to buy and manage a portfolio, rely on property companies to do it for them. If used effectively, the liquidity of property shares should help fund managers achieve a better performance than from a passive portfolio of properties. A fund which cleared out of the sector in 1989 and bought again in 1992 will have seen impressive gains. Yet fewer, bigger property companies would provide better liquidity at lower administrative cost than the fragmented quoted sector now in evidence. Against this background, it is surprising that so many property companies have managed to flourish. If the underlying property market is in for a dull period, as many forecasters predict, companies which are low on management expertise and high on expenses will struggle to justify their existence. Without a buoyant property market to fall back on, the lacklustre performance of their shares will be all the more obvious.</p>

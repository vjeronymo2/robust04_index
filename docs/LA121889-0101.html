			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> AREA CODE: In two years, when a big chunk of Los Angeles area code 213 gets a  310 prefix, 213 customers in Seal Beach, Los Alamitos and La Habra will join  the new area. . . . Even though the 714 area has not reached capacity -- and  won't for at least a few more years -- company jurisdictions and switching  complications will keep the three cities from joining the rest of Orange  County. . . . "It's just not efficient and cost effective" to shift them to  714, said Pacific Bell's Linda Bonniksen. "Those cities are in a kind of fluky  position." Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

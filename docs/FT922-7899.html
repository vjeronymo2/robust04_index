			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Lloyd's inquiry to end in mid-June SIR DAVID Walker will complete his inquiries into alleged malpractices at Lloyd's of London by mid-June and will hand his report to the insurance market's authorities on July 1. That timetable emerged after a meeting yesterday between the Securities and Investments Board chairman and three Conservative MPs. When Sir David was appointed in February it was stated that he would take at least two months to complete his task. It has also emerged that a report into the loss-making Feltrim syndicates - the first of a number of loss reviews being conducted by Lloyd's - will not be ready until August. It had been expected that the investigations, which are being co-ordinated by Sir Patrick Neill QC, would be ready earlier this year. Yesterday's meeting came as the government was accused by the Labour party of mounting a cover-up of malpractice at Lloyd's in an attempt to protect its 21-strong Commons majority. Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, called for a debate on the market's troubles and said there was evidence that 'the Council of Lloyd's - in discussion with the Department of Trade and Industry - was involved in an attempt using institutional finance to bail out Lloyd's Names including MPs'. A DTI official said yesterday that he had 'absolutely no knowledge' of the discussions referred to by Mr Hain. Mr Paul Marland, Tory MP for Gloucestershire West and a Lloyd's Name, joined Mr Hain in calling for a Commons debate on the ground that there was increasing evidence that the market was breaching the Lloyd's Act. Mr Marland expressed satisfaction with the meeting with Sir David, which he had attended along with Sir Gerard Vaughan, Conservative MP for Reading East, and Sir Michael Marshall, Tory MP for Arundel. In a separate development, Lloyd's Names who benefited from the out-of-court settlement in the Outhwaite case yesterday won another legal victory. After a two-day hearing in the Commercial Court Mr Justice Saville ordered Lloyd's to pay the Pounds 116m directly to the 987 Names party to the settlement agreed in February. Last month Lloyd's blocked direct payment of the settlement to Names by insisting that money be paid to its premium trust funds - the funds into which all underwriting money earned by Lloyd's underwriters is paid. The complication arose because some Names who benefited from the Outhwaite action are also members of loss-making syndicates - such as those managed by the Feltrim and Gooda Walker agencies - and have outstanding liabilities from those separate underwriting activities. In the cases of those Names, Lloyd's intended to offset settlement monies against these other liabilities. Mr Anthony Boswood QC, representing the Names, said that the decision had caused Names 'grievous financial hardship'. Lloyd's said it will not appeal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Moscow in Russian to  Tajikistan at 1700 GMT on 10 May, in a broadcast from the  "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense Ministry, reports  that weapons which the USSR used to supply to Yemen are now  being used in the current fighting.    The unidentified announcer says: "In Yemen there are now  over 1,000 of our tanks. These are T-62, T-55, and T-54 models.  In Yemen at present there are about 800 Soviet-made artillery  combat vehicles and armored transporters. There are tens of our  aircraft -- Su-22, MiG-21, and MiG-23, and even  surface-to-surface missiles, Scud, and SS-21 missiles. The  Yemenis also have some of our Mi-8 and Mi-24 combat helicopters  and our combat vessels." "Slavyanka" will report on how these  weapons perform.</p>

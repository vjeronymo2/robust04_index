			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gao Anming: "Farm Profits Outstripped by Rural </F> Enterprises in '93"]    [Text] Agriculture made impressive gains in China last  year thanks to fine weather and the government's moves to  protect farmers' interests.    The achievements, however, failed to increase farmers'  income  correspondingly, nor did it boost their enthusiasm or investment  in farming. Agriculture continued to roll out less profits than  almost all other rural undertakings did, according to the  economic Green Paper '94 published late last month.    The book was a joint project of the Institute of Rural  Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the  Division of Rural Social Development of the State Statistics  Bureau (SSB).    One of the country's major agricultural accomplishments was  that the output of cereals and oil-bearing crops struck an  all-time high, according to the report.    Localities reported 456.4 million tons of cereal output in  1993, 3.1 per cent more than 1992, despite a decline of 480,000  hectares in sowed acreage. The country reaped 17.6 million tons  of oil crops, up 7.3 per cent, the book says.    However, studies of the Ministry of Agriculture and SSB  estimate the actual cereal output last year to be 2.1 percent  lower than the report. Even so, the yield would still be the  highest in history.    Grain production in 15 provinces in northern China increased  by a large margin whereas that in the South fell. Guangdong,  Fujian and Zhejiang provinces continued to show red ink on  reports of grain output. The drop is a major factor behind the  hefty food price hikes that spread from south to north late last  year.  <H5>  Cotton </H5>   The output of other major farm products also increased  except  for cotton and sugar crops, which fell 16.6 and 13.5 percent  respectively.    The production of cotton had dipped 20.2 percent in 1992  compared to the previous year.    The agricultural sector turned out 1,003 billion yuan ($115  billion) in output value, up 5 percent allowing for inflation.  Farming went up 4.1 percent, better than the 3.2 percent growth  in the previous year. The increase of forestry, animal  husbandry, sideline production and fisheries, however, was  slower than the previous year.    The government spent 7 percent more, or 43 billion yuan  ($4.9  billion) on agriculture last year. However, its direct  investment in rural capital construction dropped, after  deducting for inflation.    Less developed as it is compared with urban areas, the  countryside still saw a net 81.5 billion yuan ($9.3 billion)  flow to cities.    Farming was carried out on a super-small scale. There were  350 million rural labourers in the countryside, each of whom was  entitled to an average of a mere 0.34 hectares of land.  Small-scale farming made it virtually impossible for farmers to  earn the same as their urban workers, the book says.    The growth of rural non-agricultural businesses set a new  record. They turned out 2,721 billion yuan ($313 billion) in  products and services last year, an increase of 67 percent on  1992. The amount made up 40 percent of the country's  nonagricultural output, up by 32 percent over the previous year,  and accounted for 73 percent of gross rural output.    Manufacturing generated the bulk of the output value,  seizing  77 percent of the total. The building industry constituted 10.2  percent, transportation 5.4 percent and the catering business  7.3 percent.    Although the share of rural industry was still overwhelming,  it was 2 percentage points down from the previous year. On a  brighter note, the building industry, transport and services  gained 2 percentage points.    The book recognizes the change as a welcoming sign of an  increasingly rationalized industrial structure.  <H5>  Gap </H5>   The gap between the coast and hinterland, which had been  widening since the mid-1980s, has started to close, another  welcome sign, the book says.    Rural non-agricultural businesses in Central and West China  grew 70 per cent, faster than the national average. They turned  out 33 per cent of the country's products and services, up 1  percentage point on the previous year. Rural enterprises  invested heavily in updating equipment. They boasted 593  billion yuan ($68 billion) in fixed assets by year end, up 34  percent on 1992, the highest in history.    "The increase is beneficial to sharpening rural businesses'  competitive edge before China rejoins the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade and before State-owned enterprises accomplish  their market-oriented restructuring," the book says.    State firms have also become a major investor in rural  development. In 1993, they pumped 42 billion yuan ($4.8  billion) into assisting agriculture and rural infrastructure  construction, almost the same as the government did, and 30  percent more than 1992.    Rural firms created 6.24 million new jobs. They employed  109.5 million people, roughly the same as State-owned  enterprises did, and 24.4 per cent of total rural labour.    Private businesses became a major absorber of surplus rural  labour. They hired more than 50 million people last year, and  provided 62 percent of new non-agricultural jobs.    Yet in proportion to their output increase, rural firms have  been taking on fewer labourers. Instead, they have become more  capital intensive. Last year, they recruited only half the  people who would otherwise have been hired, considering the  employment elasticity of the previous year.    The Green Paper blames the decrease on the country's  sluggish  urbanization, which hindered the development of the largely  labour-intensive tertiary industry.    The increase in farmers' income significantly slowed last  year. An average rural resident made 921 yuan ($106), an  increase of 3.2 per cent allowing for inflation, down from 5.9  per cent for the previous year.    Compared with their urban counterparts, rural folks, who  made  up 70 percent of the population, earned 60 percent less. The  income ratio between the two stood at 1:2.5, even smaller than  the level for 1978, when rural reforms were inaugurated.    Meanwhile, the prices of agricultural materials, such as  fertilizer diesel oil and farm machinery, jumped from 10 to 70  percent during the first three quarters. This led farmers to  cut 10 percent of their investment in agriculture, and the sales  volume of farm materials dropped 8 percent, allowing for  inflation.    The sluggish income growth was also to blame for the drop of  rural market share from 52 percent in 1992 to 48 percent last  year.    The book estimates that 49.2 million farmers sought jobs  outside their home villages, of whom 38.7 million people worked  in cities or towns.    Transient farmers worked 205 days a year outside their homes  on the average. They made 3,649 yuan ($419) from work,  significantly higher than the 2,280 yuan ($262) they would earn  if working in rural enterprises. They sent or brought an  average of 2,009 yuan ($231) back to their families.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: KNP BT plans rights issue KNP BT, the Dutch paper and packaging group, is to launch a one-for-five rights issue as part of plans to boost to 90 per cent its stake in Leykam-Murztaler, the loss-making Austrian paper group. KNP BT said the malaise in the European paper industry had prompted it to accelerate plans to integrate Leykam, in which it has owned a 50.4 per cent stake since 1989. The Austrian bank Creditanstalt-Bankverein owns 25.2 per cent of Leykam, and the rest is publicly-traded. Under the deal, KNP BT will merge its two paper-producing divisions into Leykam, which will then issue new shares. KNP BT will eventually own 90 per cent of the enlarged company, including the shares now held by Creditanstalt, which the Dutch company intends to acquire. The remaining 10 per cent of Leykam's shares will continue to be traded in Vienna and Frankfurt. The company declined to give financial details, but noted that the merger of the paper divisions would be carried out on a non-cash basis. Talks will be held on acquiring Creditanstalt's shares. Details of the KNP BT rights issue will be announced in the next few weeks. The company currently has a market capitalisation of some Fl 3bn (Dollars 1.7bn). MacMillan Bloedel of Canada, which owns 17 per cent of KNP BT, says it will take up its shares. KNP BT said the rights issue would ensure that its solvency ratios remained unchanged, counteracting the deterioration that would otherwise have occurred through the full consolidation of Leykam. Leykam, the biggest paper maker in Austria, is a leading producer of coated wood-free paper. KNP BT, whose own results have come under pressure from difficult market conditions in Europe, said the move would increase its flexibility to produce at lower costs. One immediate consequence is that it will be closing down a smaller paper-producing machine at its plant in the Dutch town of Nijmegen, with the loss of 250 jobs. Creditanstalt-Bankverein has said it will not sell its 25.5 per cent stake in Leykam back to KNP until next year. This, however, would not affect the merger plan, said Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chief executive, writes Ian Rodger in Vienna. The bank has a put option to sell most of its stake to KNP, but does not want to exercise it this year for tax reasons. At the Sch340 at which Leykam shares traded yesterday, the Creditanstalt stake was worth roughly Sch800m (Dollars 70.6m). The bank, Austria's second-largest, also has a 2.5 per cent stake in KNP, and intends to take up its rights in the forthcoming Fl 500m issue to finance the takeover.</p>

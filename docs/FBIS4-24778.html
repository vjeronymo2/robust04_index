			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F> Zhenying (0491 2182 5391), RENMIN RIBAO reporter He Jiazheng  (0149 0502 2973), and XINHUA reporter Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987  2639)]    [Text] Beijing, 31 May (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, CPC  Central Committee general secretary, delivered an important  speech at Zhongnanhai's Huairen Hall today at the closing of the  fourth theoretical study class for senior leading cadres at  provincial and ministerial levels. He emphatically pointed out:  China is deepening its reform in an all-round way and the  various tasks of establishing a socialist market economy are  swiftly unfolding. This has presented a good opportunity for us  to further our study of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, to raise our capability  in applying theory to get a correct grasp of the overall  situation, and to properly resolve our immediate problems. The  more occupied leading cadres are, the more they should try to  set an example in studying theory. We should study theory with  our current problems in mind and use the theory as a guide in  solving the problems. We should exert ourselves in creating a  strong atmosphere of studying theory -- and applying them in  studying and solving real problems -- among all party members.    The session was presided over by Hu Jintao, member of the  Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat  of the CPC Central Committee and president of the Central Party  School. Present at the session were Ding Guangen and Wei  Jianxing, members of the Political Bureau and Secretariat of the  CPC Central Committee; Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the  Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat; and Ren Jianxin,  member of the Secretariat.    Following a decision of the CPC Central Committee on setting  up theoretical study classes for principal leaders at the  provincial and ministry levels, four such classes were conducted  according to plan between 4 October last year to 31 May this  year. Leading cadres at provincial and ministry levels,  principal leaders of the major units of the People's Liberation  Army, and comrades with leadership responsibilities on the  propaganda and theoretical fronts -- 175 in all -- have attended  the classes. Of the 175, 121 are members or alternate members  of the CPC Central Committee. Comrade Jiang Zemin had informal  talks with members of the first and third classes. At the  conclusion of the first class and the start of the second, the  members also heard a mobilization report by Comrade Jiang Zemin  on earnestly studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping.    Jiang Zemin pointed out in his speech today that for the  purpose of accomplishing the task of arming the whole party with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, the CPC Central Committee has run four  theoretical study classes for principal leaders at the  provincial and ministry levels. The responses from various  quarters have been quite favorable and we have attained our set  goals. After affirming the achievements of the study classes,  he said that a good beginning has been made in terms of study by  leading cadres. We must, however, refrain from overestimating  the progress, thereby resting our laurels and coming to a  standstill. To truly accomplish the task of arming the whole  party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, we need to further enhance our  understanding, intensify our studies, and work harder in using  theory as a guide for practice. Party organizations at all  levels still have a great deal of painstaking and meticulous  work to do.    Jiang Zemin stressed: The party's position and its  historical mission in the new period have made it essential, now  more than ever before, for cadres at all levels, leading cadres  at all levels in particular, to attach greater importance to the  study -- and attain a deeper understanding of -- theory. Only  by becoming clear-headed and firm theoretically will it be  possible for cadres to be firm and clear-headed politically, to  become more conscientious in comprehensively carrying out the  party's basic line, and to achieve our socialist modernization.  The Marxist theoretical level of leading officials is, to a  considerable extent, essential to the administrative and  leadership levels of the ruling party and to the success of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Bearing in  mind the overall situation and looking toward the next century  with a strong sense of historic responsibility and mission, all  cadres, veteran and young, must continue to study Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory assiduously and lead party members in studying  Deng Xiaoping's theory persistently, thoroughly, and  efficiently. We must not slack in our studies.    Discussing ways to continuously deepen theoretical study,  Jiang Zemin said: We have accumulated some experiences from  seminars and study sessions sponsored by the Central Committee  and local party committees recently. The most important of  these experiences, and the one most worth popularizing, is the  need to earnestly implement the principle of integrating theory  with practice in close conjunction with the situation and tasks.  We must persist in studying theory in the light of practical  problems and must carry forward a good study style which  combines study with application. We must pore over the original  text of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, firmly  grasping the theme of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and concentrating our minds on the party's basic  line in order to thoroughly understand the quintessence of  emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts, and to master  comprehensively the theory's scientific system. Meanwhile, we  must go deep into the realities under the guidance of the  party's basic theory and basic line, adopt a scientific world  outlook and methodology to conduct investigations and study, and  seek correct answers to the questions that have arisen in the  course of reform and economic construction, especially in  building a socialist market economy.    He said: The Central Committee has decided that the overall  situation of the work of the whole party and the entire nation  calls for seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up  wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability. This  decision -- which was made after earnestly analyzing the  situations at home and abroad, thoroughly studying various  contradictions in everyday life, and extensively soliciting the  opinions from various quarters -- reflects the requirements of  the basic line of "one center, two basic points" as well as the  party's deepener understanding of the objective laws having led  the socialist modernization drive for more than a decade.  Senior cadres in charge of important matters and the overall  situation, must thoroughly understand the Central Committee's  guidelines and, always bearing in mind and grasping the overall  situation, proceed from the overall situation in considering,  analyzing, and solving problems, so as to continually enhance  their ability to grasp the overall situation and promote  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy.    Speaking of how to correctly grasp the overall work of the  whole party, Jiang Zemin first called for the use of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's exposition on reform, development, and stability  to educate and unify the thinking of large numbers of party  members, cadres, and people. While studying and publicizing  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, particular attention had to be paid to  combining theory with practice in studying and publicizing the  dialectic relations between reform, development, and stability;  and to educating and guiding cadres and people inside and  outside the party to conscientiously safeguard the overall  situation, to persist in taking development as the objective,  reform as the motive force, and the safeguarding of social and  political stability as the precondition, thereby organically  combining the three and promoting each with the others. Second,  it is necessary to realistically assess and judge the current  overall situation. This is the prerequisite for grasping the  overall situation and ensuring good work. Leaders must stay  sober-minded and, above all, make a sober assessment of the  situation. Third, it is necessary to solve in a positive and  appropriate way prominent problems adversely affecting reform,  development, and stability. We must carefully study such  problems, identify their root causes, differentiate the  circumstances, and strive to properly solve them through  well-conceived plans in the course of deepening reform. Fourth,  it is necessary to unswervingly follow the party's mass line and  give play to the initiative of all sectors of society. We must  deepen reform, promote development, and maintain stability.  Herein lie the fundamental interests of the masses, which can  be realized only by closely relying on the masses. The more  crucial the time is, the more necessary it is for our party to  bring into play our advantage of close ties with the masses. So  long as we have the support of the masses, we can safeguard the  overall situation and successfully carry out the work in all  fields of endeavor.    Jiang Zemin stressed: The establishment of a socialist  market economic structure and the deepening of comprehensive  reforms have made it imperative to strengthen and improve party  leadership and party building, and to bring the role of party  organizations and members into full play. It would be wrong to  slacken our efforts in party building or to fail to bring the  role of party organizations into full play. It would be an even  greater mistake if we dilute and weaken party leadership by  separating party leadership and party building from reform,  opening up, and the modernization drive, or setting the former  in opposition to the latter. Party organizations at all levels  must uphold the principle that the party must handle party  affairs. This principle requires that all party members,  leading cadres at all levels with party membership in  particular, care for party building, that the party committee  take the lead, and that the party secretary set a good example  in handling party affairs. In regard to party building, the  Central Committee has formulated plans that call for, among  other things, making persistent efforts to arm the whole party  with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, improving party conduct, building a  clean government, and making unremitting efforts in carrying out  the anticorruption drive. We must earnestly implement them. In  building up party organizations, it is essential to strengthen  democratic centralism. The fundamental way to solve problems in  this regard is to improve rules and regulations, instituting new  rules or amplifying existing ones as required. Where sound  rules are already on the books, they must be followed earnestly.  We must work hard to strengthen grassroots party organizations,  institute a system of responsibility in this undertaking, and  give different guidance to suit different conditions. In close  connection with the task of deepening reform, promoting  development, and maintaining stability, we should build up the  fighting capacity of party organizations and work hard to  deliver some party organizations from their state of  incompetence and slackened morale. We must uphold the principle  of making the ranks of cadres more revolutionary, younger in  average age, better educated, professionally more competent, and  with both professional ability and political integrity. We  should work hard to build leading bodies at all levels into  leadership collectives that unswervingly implement the party's  basic line, dare to deal with concrete matters relating to work,  innovate, maintain close ties with the masses, and set a good  example in performing their official duties honestly. Meanwhile,  we must devote earnest efforts in training and promoting younger  cadres so they will be able to assume leading responsibilities  beyond the year 2000.    In conclusion, Jiang Zemin pointed out: Ours is a party in  power. The party committees at the provincial, prefectural, and  county levels are the central leading force for other  organizations at the corresponding levels and over all our  undertakings. The party committee must exercise effective  leadership over economic work and other undertakings and, at the  same time, improve its method of leadership. This year is a  crucial one for China to deepen reform, promote development, and  maintain stability. There are heavy responsibilities on the  shoulders of leading cadres. It is hoped the rank and file will  be of one mind, rally closely together, work cautiously,  conscientiously, diligently, and exert themselves in an earnest  and down-to-earth manner and with a pioneering spirit to  continuously advance the cause of reform, opening up, and the  modernization drive.    At today's session, two members of the fourth study class,  Gu  Jinchi, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regional Government chairman, and  Mao Zhiyong, Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee secretary,  delivered reports on their studies. Wang Jialiu, Central Party  School executive vice president, delivered a summation on the  four study classes on behalf of the work group for the study  classes.    Present at the session were officials from relevant central  departments including Zeng Qinghong, Lu Feng, Wang Weicheng,  Zheng Bijian, Zhao Zongnai, Pang Xianzhi, Su Xing, Gong Yuzhi,  Zheng Keyang, and Chen Fujin.</p>

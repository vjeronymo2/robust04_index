			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE EXPIRY of the May FT-SE 100 index option took centre stage yesterday in trading in derivatives, writes Joel kibazo. The mid-morning expiry of the FT-SE option, which coincided with the end of the account was the main feature. Strong selling was noted ahead of the expiry, which led both the cash market and FT-SE futures lower and generated much of the day's turnover in the index option. The FT-SE option traded 13,987 contracts, with the day's options total reaching a healthy 36,339 contracts. Midland Bank was the most active stock option, trading 2,284 lots. Stock index futures were relatively quiet. June traded at a modest premium to fair value for most of the session and the rolling out of June and into September was particularly noticeable. June closed at 2,719, around 6 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 8. Turnover was 7,640 contracts.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Markets Report: US PPI figure awaited The dollar traded in a fairly narrow range yesterday ahead of the release today of the US May producer price inflation figure, write Philip Gawith and Motoko Rich. The US currency gained some support, however, following concerns about escalating tensions in the Korean pen-insula. The dollar closed in London at DM1.6721 from DM1.6698 and against the yen at Y104.155 from Y104.030. But in New York it declined to end at DM1.6672 and Y103.985. Markets were generally fairly quiet in the absence of any new developments to latch on to. European election results will not be known until Monday, and the decision of the Bundesbank council to leave interest rates unchanged was widely expected. Sterling finished firmer against the D-Mark at DM2.5206 from DM2.5163. It was barely changed against the dollar at Dollars 1.5075 from Dollars 1.507. The market is expecting a fairly subdued PPI figure today of about 0.2 per cent. But Mr Peter Osler, economist at brokers GNI, warned that 'the risks have to be stacking towards the fact that at some stage a shock high monthly figure will be seen, and we expect the market will take this very badly'. He said factors such as higher crude oil and commodity prices, as well as increased capacity utilisation, can be expected to feed through into higher inflation. The implications for the dollar are unclear. Recently the dollar and the US treasury bond market have traded in tandem. But Mr George Magnus, chief economist at SG Warburg, has pointed out that 'the positive correlation between the dollar and the T-bond market has rarely been strong for long periods of time and is mostly negative'. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said the dollar/ D-Mark rate was likely to stay in a narrow range unless a 'major surprise' came out of the PPI, or CPI number next Tuesday. On the dollar/yen axis, however, Mr Hannah said he believed there had been a definite shift in attitude recently. In spite of Mr Brown and Mr Kantor still talking tough, he felt the administration 'did not see a weaker dollar as a way of getting around this problem'. 'There is a lot of hesitation among speculators to push the yen too much towards the Y103 level,' added Mr Hannah. The market is expecting the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey of industry, released today, to show a modest rise in business optimism. A better than expected outcome could bolster the yen. In Europe, currencies paid little attention to the European elections, with results not expected until after the weekend. 'There has been no adverse effect on the Scandinavian economies which have been the main targets of speculation,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, international economist at UBS. 'It seems to be an issue that was a focus earlier in the week.' The D-Mark continued on its weak trend of the past 48 hours. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), attributed this to diminishing faith in the credibility of the Bundesbank. 'The D-Mark's weakness is something of a surprise, given the strength of manufacturing and inflation data,' he said. 'The German currency's weakness must to some extent relate to fresh concerns about the Bundesbank's poor performance on the M3 indicator.' Mr Cunningham said Sunday's Austrian referendum on joining the European Union may cause the D-Mark to 'pull back some of its losses against the Scandinavian currencies'. The D-Mark closed at FFr3.405 against the French franc from FFr3.408. It also lost ground against the Spanish peseta, which finished at Pta81.71 from Pta81.84, while the Swedish krona recovered some of its recent loss to end at SKr4.740 from SKr4.754. Mr Cunningham said sterling had benefited from the weakness of the D-Mark. He predicted that European and by-elections would probably have little effect on the pound because forecasts in the last 24 hours had anticipated 'less than devastating results' for the Tories. Futures markets were quiet, with the December short sterling contract trading only 15,000 lots. It closed at 93.77 from 93.79. The futures market is thus discounting short-term interest rates nearly a percentage point higher by the end of the year than the present 5.25 per cent. But many economists believe interest rates may well finish the year at current levels, or only marginally higher. Mr Ostler of GNI, however, notes that at the last six settlement dates for short-sterling contracts, the difference between the settlement price and the base rate was less than 10 basis points. This suggests that the futures market is currently over-pessimistic about the outlook for UK interest rates. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 524m assistance after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 500m. Overnight money traded between 3 1/2 and 4 5/8 per cent. In Germany, call money eased to 4.95/5.05 per cent from 5.05/5.15 per cent.</p>

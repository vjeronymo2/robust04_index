			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: WAITING FOR TRAVOLTA  </P> <P> "The Experts" -- John Travolta's first film since the 1985 bomb, "Perfect" --  won't be coming soon to a theater near you. After brief playdates in Texas and  Oklahoma last month, the Paramount pic is headed for video -- due on shelves in  early June, according to Paramount Home Video.  </P> <P> That news took co-producer Jonathan Krane by surprise. Krane -- also Travolta's  personal manager -- thought that "The Experts" was merely on hold, until after  the late summer release of Tri-Star's "Daddy's Home," a romantic comedy with  Travolta opposite Kirstie Alley.  </P> <P> Krane, who produced the latter pic, told us "it would make good marketing sense  for Paramount to release 'The Experts' after 'Daddy's Home' generates  attention. . . "  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> DIFFERING VIEWS OF COSMIC DEBATE  </P> <P> Cosmos and Metacosmos by Robert Wesson (Open Court: $26.95 hardcover, $11.95  paper; 157 pages)  </P> <P> Some people -- those of the scientific turn of mind -- look at the order and  complexity of the world around us and say it's all an accident, a matter of  chance. Other people -- those of the religious turn of mind -- look at the same  facts and conclude that a Creator must be responsible for all this.  </P> <P> Both of these views are matters of faith -- they can't be proved.  </P> <P> Robert Wesson, a political scientist with a keen interest in matters  philosophical, believes there is a third approach, which he calls "nontheistic  nonmaterialism": "This lies midway between . . . the belief that the world is  the work of a great personality who watches over it and perhaps intervenes on  occasion to set things right, and the theory that material particles are the  totality of existence."  </P> <P> In Wesson's view, there is a metacosmos, a ground of being, if you will, that  underlies the material world and makes it possible. "The material world is not  the totality of existence but a derivative of something primordial," he says.  It's not God, but purpose.  </P> <P> Now, regular readers of this space have perhaps noticed that on this most basic  of all issues, I side with the reductionists. It is as clear to me as the nose  on your face that biology is a branch of chemistry, that chemistry is a branch  of physics and that the impersonal, uncaring, undirected laws of science can  ultimately explain the universe and everything in it.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, although I disagree with its premise, Wesson's book was a delight  to read. In 139 well-written, well-argued pages, he displays mastery of and  deep thought about a stunning range of subjects -- physics, biology,  civilization, progress, mind and ethics among them.  </P> <P> In each case, he claims the reductionist model doesn't work.  </P> <P> "Reductionism, however attractive as theoretical simplification, is to a large  extent only theoretical and programmatic, giving an illusion of deeper  understanding than we have," Wesson writes.  </P> <P> For example, he challenges Darwinian evolution as a plausible account of how  living creatures evolved from single-celled organisms to us. Not that he thinks  Darwin is wrong, mind you. Rather, he asserts, Darwin is incomplete. There must  be something else at work in addition to natural selection to account for the  development of organs and other complex structures, including instincts.  </P> <P> Evolution can explain small changes, but not large ones, Wesson asserts. "If  mutations are like typos, it is easier to imagine them producing new words than  new chapters. Natural selection is certainly a proofreader of the book of life,  perhaps an editor; to give it credit for full authorship is too much."  </P> <P> Rather, he says, "It is reasonable to guess that the patterns of life, while  conforming to physical and chemical laws, go beyond them in the realization of  the order-making capabilities behind and in the universe, incorporating what we  can fairly call a higher, or more creative level of being."  </P> <P> Similarly, he finds no explanation of why evolution alone created minds that  like to play chess or that like to think about consciousness or philosophy.  Where is the survival value in reading book reviews? Or is that just an extra  that got thrown in along the way?  </P> <P> The trouble is that it's difficult to distinguish what Wesson calls "purpose"  from what theologians call "God." Wesson says they are not the same --  "nontheistic nonmaterialism" -- but it's not clear what's different other than  a different name.  </P> <P> Wesson's "third way" is no more provable or unprovable than theism or atheism  or any other world view. Those who are convinced will say it makes sense; those  who are unconvinced will stay unconvinced. But it makes you wonder.  </P></p>

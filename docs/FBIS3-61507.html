Ulyanov; UDC 579.24.083.1]    [Abstract] The multiple stage microorganism development  nature whereby each stage is characterized by certain  morphological, biochemical, antigen, and pathogenic properties  resulting in diverse clinical manifestations and the failure to  apply modern hardware and light transmission and absorption  methods to studying the stage-by-stage microorganism evolution  prompted the development of a procedure of using a  photo-electrocolorimeter to determine the microorganisms'  development stages and examine their properties at each stage.  The procedure is based on using a KFK-2MP  photoelectrocolorimeter since the bacteria are only 0.6-3 m  in size, and their study calls for an instrument whose  dimensions are several times smaller than the subject of  inquiry. The proposed method is thus quite suitable because the  luminous flux wavelength falls within a 315-980 nm range which  is smaller than the bacterial cell by two- to threefold. A day  old Escherichia coli culture cultivated at a 37C  temperature is the subject of investigation. The experimental  procedure is outlined. The bacterial population reproduction  curve plotted by traditional microbiological and  photoelectrocolorimetric methods are cited. The difference in  the curves is attributed to the latter method's higher  resolution (by 240 times). The findings confirm the possibility  of using the photoelectrocolorimetric method for analyzing  bacterial life and demonstrate its obvious advantages, e.g., the  higher resolution (making it possible to trace the bacterial  life changes at a 5 s interval), promptness, high sensitivity,  and low labor outlays.

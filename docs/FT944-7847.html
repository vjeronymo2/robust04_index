			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Channel One gears up for 24-hour London cable service Sir David English, chairman of Associated Newspapers, described himself yesterday as the nanny 'arriving before the birth and staying for a few weeks after'. The birth is that of Channel One, a 24-hour television news channel for London, and Sir David is overseeing the November 30 launch from the former headquarters of Channel 4 television in central London. The channel, which will be exclusive to the 39 cable television franchises in the London area, will have 29 one-person camera units - or video journalists - covering the capital. Channel One, which is expected to cost Associated up to Pounds 40m before break-even, is important for both the newspaper group and for the cable television industry. For Associated it is a way of trying to sidestep cross-media ownership rules that severely limit newspaper groups' involvement in conventional television. For the cable industry Channel One is part of plans to develop cable-only programming to differentiate cable from satellite television and reduce the dependence on channels provided by British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television network in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. Mr Julian Aston, managing director of Channel One, believes the channel will be available in about 285,000 cable homes at launch - all the London cable franchises except Westminster, which is owned by British Telecommunications. Channel One said it has been unable to reach a deal with BT so far. At the outset the audience will be tiny but the channel's business plan assumes break-even by 1998. By then it hopes cable will have expanded to such an extent that it will be available in 1.3m homes in London and 11.5m in the rest of the country. Mr Aston said: 'By this time next year we hope to be in the Midlands.' He noted with satisfaction that one of the first brands to inquire about advertising was Porsche, the upmarket car manufacturer. Associated has a 10-year agreement with the cable industry. It is believed the operators will pay Associated 25p a month for each subscriber. Mr Aston said yesterday: 'Ultimately we want to be a Sky for cable with four or five cable channels.' More than 3,000 people applied for the video journalist jobs and most of those chosen came from radio or weekly journalism. They had eight weeks' training from Mr Michael Rosenblum, who trained the journalists on New York I, the successful US news channel that helped inspire Channel One. Mr Nick Pollard, Channel One's director of programmes and a former editor of ITN's News at Ten, said he was thrilled by the progress. He said the channel's crime correspondent had already produced a programme suitable for a 15-minute slot on national television. Channel One will cover everything from news and sport to fashion and finance with an emphasis on travel news and weather updates in the morning.</p>

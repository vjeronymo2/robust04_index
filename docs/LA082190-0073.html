			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: TOKYO;  </P> <P> JAPAN'S NEXT STEP  </P> <P> Japan is expected to decide on additional measures to support international  peace efforts in the Middle East after Saturday's scheduled return to Tokyo of  Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, who has been on a tour of the region.  </P> <P> Japanese officials say new measures will include "more than just money,"  although added financial aid is nevertheless expected to be approved for  Turkey, Jordan and Egypt -- three nations which stand to be particularly hurt  as a result of gulf tensions. Some kind of assistance is also expected for the  multinational forces that have been sent to the region by the United States and  others.  </P></p>

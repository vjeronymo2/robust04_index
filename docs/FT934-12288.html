			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Missile merger plan on target MATRA, the French defence company, yesterday confirmed the claim by Mr Dick Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace (BAe), that the two companies were on target to merge their missile businesses by the end of this year. BAe also confirmed the report, saying that talks between the two companies had made 'significant progress' and that a deal by the end of the year was possible. In an interview published yesterday in Les Echos, the French economic daily, Mr Evans said that 'we have agreed on the structure of the business and the range of products' of the planned joint venture. The aim is for Matra, the defence wing of Matra-Hachette, the missiles-to-magazines group, to merge with BAe's missile division, in a joint venture. Voting rights would be split 50-50, but the ratio of share capital and management control would reflect a valuation exercise. This should be completed by the end of this year, Mr Evans said yesterday. The valuation involves the two companies revealing the state of their respective order books to each other. Mr Evans added that the eventual aim of the merger was to create 'a big European missile group', with other companies like the UK's GEC-Marconi possibly joining in later. However, it was only possible to have two founder companies, BAe and Matra, he said. Talks by Matra and BAe on merging their missile activities started before Thomson, the rival French defence electronics group, linked with Shorts, the Belfast-based aerospace group.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> D.A. SAYS POLICE WERE JUSTIFIED IN 3 FATAL SHOOTINGS  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office has determined that law  enforcement officers were justified in the shooting deaths of three men in  March and April, including two who were unarmed.  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said Saturday that an investigation of the  shootings proved that the officers involved had "no criminal liability" in the  deaths. In the two cases involving unarmed victims, the district attorney's  review concluded that the officers had reason to believe the men were reaching  for weapons.  </P> <P> The fatal shootings investigated were those of Eric Parga, 22, of Santa Ana on  March 16; Kenneth Wade Collins, 28, of Garden Grove on March 28, and Jose de  Jesus Ramos Gonzalez, 27, of Santa Ana on April 4.  </P> <P> Parga was fatally wounded during a parking lot brawl outside the Carnivale Club  in Fullerton. The incident, which occurred about 2 a.m. on March 16, involved  seven people fighting in the parking lot, during which some shots were fired,  according to police reports.  </P> <P> Two off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officers were working as private  security guards and heard the gunshots in the parking lot area, according to  investigators. The officers, Randy Garcia, 34, and David Navarro, 32, went to  the scene and saw Parga with a .22-caliber pistol, the investigators said.  </P> <P> Garcia ordered Parga to drop the gun, but Parga fired the weapon at the group  of fighting men around him, investigators said. Officer Garcia then shot Parga,  according to the investigation. The district attorney's office said residue of  powder burns was found on Parga's hands, proving that he had fired a gun.  </P> <P> Collins was fatally shot about 10:45 p.m. March 28 outside a Circle K store in  the 2200 block of Chapman Avenue in Stanton. A deputy sheriff, who was not  identified, shot Collins after two struggles with him and after Collins refused  to stop running, according to investigators.  </P> <P> Collins was unarmed when he was shot, but Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan Brown said  Saturday the deputy fired "because the officer thought he was going for a gun."  Earlier, while the two men were struggling, Brown said, a big, combat-style  knife fell to the ground from Collins' clothing. "It was one awesome knife,"  Brown said.  </P> <P> The deputy had tried to stop Collins for questioning, and Collins began  fighting him, Brown said.  </P> <P> Brown said Saturday that he investigated the incident and found that Collins  was carrying "a large amount of methamphetamines" at the time of the shooting  incident. Brown said Collins also had taken some of the drug himself.  </P> <P> The fatal shooting of Gonzalez occurred about 2 p.m. on April 4 outside a  7-Eleven market on the corner of Williams and Main streets in Tustin. Orange  police officers approached Gonzalez in his car to arrest him on suspicion of  selling drugs, investigators said.  </P> <P> The victim, who was unarmed, was shot when one officer said he saw Gonzalez  reaching underneath his car seat, possibly for a weapon, investigators said.  </P> <P> The officer then fired one shot, investigators said. Another officer then fired  four more shots, according to the investigation. The officers were not  identified.  </P> <P> Gonzalez did not have a weapon, but Capizzi said the investigation determined  that both police officers had reason to believe their lives were being  threatened.  </P></p>

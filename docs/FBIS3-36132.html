The statement notes that "the earliest organised return of  refugees to their homes in Abkhazia without any preliminary  conditions and restrictions is among the main issues for  restoring mutual trust between Georgia and Russia".    The government asks the Russian leadership "to declare  unequivocally its negative attitude to statements by the Gudauta  leaders on the establishment of an independent Abkhazian state  or its accession to Russia".    The government "hopes that the visit by President Boris  Yeltsin to Tbilisi, the signing of a package of documents and  planned measures will help to achieve a large-scale settlement  in Abkhazia, unity and integrity of Georgia in the interests of  its multinational population as well as to ensure stability and  peace in the Caucasus as a whole, in Russia and throughout the  world".</p>

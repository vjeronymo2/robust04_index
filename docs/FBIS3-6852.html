Stressing that  acts of violence must now come to an end, the president issued  the directive during a three-hour meeting with the members of  the three peace panels headed by Professor Alfredo Tadiar and  former Ambassadors Howard Dee and Manuel Yan.    Based on their reports, the chief executive noted that the  panels are too cautious about possible legal implications that  may arise from the their actions thus slowing their conduct of  the peace process. Let me make it very clear that the objective  of the peace talks is to stop the violence and the bloodshed,  while maintaining our traditional and permanent position of not  compromising Philippine sovereignty, the president reminded the  group. To achieve that objective I think we should not be too  legalistic at this point in time, the important thing is to  accomplish the first step which is to stop the violence, he said.    Some of the panel members expressed concern that the  Congress  might question in the future, the legality or the  constitutionality of their decisions. However, Ramos gave them  the authority to pursue whatever they think will expedite the  conduct of the peace process, saying that whatever legal  questions might arise could probably be resolved later on.    The president also assessed that the government's efforts to  stop [words indistinct] long and lasting peace have borne  significant results. I think we are achieving the result that  we want which is the reduction of violence but we should not  lose sight of the fact that although violence has been reduced,  it is a fact that there are still people dying out there in the  field, he pointed out.    The chief executive called on every local government  official  to fully support the initiatives of the peace panels. He  specifically asked the local officials in Mindanao to coordinate  their actions with the group of former Ambassador Yan. He  received reports that certain governors and other local  officials are making moves without consulting the Yan panel.  There are still possible clash points and if we are not  careful, they might undermine the peace process he said.    During the meeting the president was briefed by the panels  on  the progress of their respective peace talks. Tadiar said that  his group will have an informal meeting with the RAM-SFP-YOU  [Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan; Nationalist  Revolutionary Alliance-Soldiers of the Filipino People-Young  Officers Union] which is tentatively scheduled tomorrow, 23  March. He said the meeting will be the first after the talks  stalled last December.    Yan reported that his panel and the MNLF [Moro National  Liberation Front] mixed-committee are scheduled to resume their  meeting tentatively on 4 to 6 April. He said the venues are  still being worked out.    Dee said that the National Democratic Front [NDF] has  backtracked from the planned Vietnam exploratory talks because  of their demand for the withdrawal of Executive Order 125.  Executive Order 125 signed by the president on 13 September of  last year defined the approach and administrative structures for  the government's comprehensive peace efforts. They also  demanded that preliminary talks be conducted in Europe prior to  the Vietnam meet last 16 March. The Dee panel sent a letter to  the NDF pressing for the meeting and informing the leadership of  a possible amnesty proclamation. They have yet to respond to  our letter, Dee said.</p>

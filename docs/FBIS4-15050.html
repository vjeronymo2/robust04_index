			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mekhman Gafarly report under the "Turkmenistan" rubric: </F> "Russian Border Guard Arrested on Charges of Misuse of Office"]    [Text] According to INTERFAX, last weekend the Turkmen law-  enforcement agencies arrested Andrey Titov, commander of the  13th border post of the 3d border unit of the Russian Border  Troops operations group in Turkmenia [Turkmenistan]. The  Turkmen Military Prosecutor's Office has brought a criminal  lawsuit against the officer under Article 240 of the Turkmen  Criminal Code (misuse of office). The circumstances of the case  are still uncertain, the sole report saying that the officer's  arrest was preceded by the suicide committed by Private  Geldyyev, a Turkmen citizen, upon being exposed as a thief by  fellow soldiers.    Andrey Titov is currently being held in an investigatory  cell  in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat]. The Russian side thinks the arrest and  legal action against Titov by the Turkmen law-enforcement  agencies to be unlawful and plans to insist that the criminal  case and the defendant himself be turned over to it.    In accordance with the Russian-Turkmen treaty on the joint  protection of Turkmenia's state border and also on the status of  the Russian Federation border troop servicemen on the territory  of the republic, all military crimes committed by Russian border  guards fall under Russian jurisdiction and must be considered by  Russian law-enforcement agencies.    It should be recalled that in 1993 the Turkmen authorities  attempted to start legal proceedings against 15 Russian  servicemen. The Russian side, however, managed to make sure that  their cases were turned over to it to be tried in Russia.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director finds the proposed provisions for haulroads at subdivisions 139(a)(2) (A) and (B) are substantively identical to and no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 761.5(b) (1) and (2). The proposed provision at subdivision 139(a)(2)(C) does not have a direct Federal counterpart. The Director finds the Indiana language to be consistent with the Federal provision at 30 CFR 761.5(d)(1) which provides for VER if, on the date an area comes under protection pursuant to section 522(e) of SMCRA, a validly authorized surface coal mining operation exists on that area. The Director is, therefore, approving the proposed language at subdivision 139(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Indiana language at subdivisions 139(b) and (b)(1) is similar to the counterpart Federal language at 30 CFR 761.5(e). The Federal language, however, provides that the interpretation of the terms of the document relied upon to establish the VER shall be based on either applicable State statutory or case law concerning interpretation of documents conveying mineral rights. Also, the Federal language provides that where no applicable State law exists, the interpretation of the terms of the document relied upon to establish VER shall be based upon the usage and custom at the time and place that it came into existence. The counterpart Indiana language at subdivision 139(b) is silent concerning applicable State statutory law. The proposed language only provides that if there is no applicable common law the provisions at subdivisions 139(b) (1) and (2) apply. Therefore, the Director finds the proposed language at subdivision 139(b) no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 761.5(e) except to the extent that the proposed Indiana rule is silent concerning the applicability of State statutory law. In addition, the Director is requiring that Indiana further amend 310 IAC 12&hyph;0.5&hyph;139(b) to provide that the interpretation of the terms of the document used to establish a valid existing right shall be based either upon applicable State statutory or case law concerning interpretation of documents conveying mineral rights, or where no applicable State statutory or common law exists, the interpretation is based upon the provisions at subdivisions 139(b) (1) and (2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed subdivision 139(b)(2), concerning a required showing by the applicant that the parties to the document contemplated the right to conduct the same mining activities for which the applicant claims VER, has no direct Federal counterpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed language, however, is not inconsistent with the Federal requirements contained in the 1979 VER rule, at former 30 CFR 761.5(c) and is, therefore, approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed subsection 139(c) has no direct Federal counterpart. The Director finds the proposed language to be a valuable clarification of VER and not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Federal VER regulations. In addition, the language is substantively identical to the language contained in the 1979 VER rule at former 30 CFR 761.5(d). Therefore, proposed subsection 139(c) is approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed subsection 139(d) is substantively identical to the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 761.5(d)(1) and is, therefore, approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director finds the proposed definition of VER, except as discussed above, to be consistent with an no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 761.5 and the 1980 test (the 1979 VER rule with the ``good faith, all permits test'' interpretation) as discussed in the November 20, 1986,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (51 FR 41954). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Revisions to Indiana's Regulations With No Corresponding Federal Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. 310 IAC 12&hyph;0.5&hyph;72&blank;Litter <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> litter <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is defined to mean the detached recognizable portions of the plants under evaluation that cover the ground surface. The Federal regulations use the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> litter <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ground cover <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , but a Federal definition of the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> litter <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is not provided. In its submittal of this amendment, Indiana stated that its definition of the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> litter <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is based on the terms  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> litter <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and ``crop residue found in the ``Resource Conservation Glossary,'' Third edition, Soil Conservation Society of America, 1982, page 188, and the needs and conditions of the Indiana program. The Director finds the proposed definition to be consistent with and no less effective than the Federal use of the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> litter <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as it appears in the definition of ``ground cover'' at 30 CFR 701.5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. 310 IAC 12&hyph;0.5&hyph;111&blank;Shelter Belt <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This term is defined to mean an area used for protection from wind or snow and which is subject to proof-of-productivity standards for fish and wildlife habitat. In its submittal of this definition, Indiana stated that its definition of the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> shelter belt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is modeled after the definition of the same term as found in the ``Resource Conservation Glossary,'' Third edition, Soil Conservation Society of America, 1982, page 145. There is no direct Federal counterpart to this definition. However, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3) use the term ``shelter belts'' in the regulations for the standards for success for postmining land use of fish and wildlife habitat. The Director finds the proposed definition to be consistent with and no less effective than the Federal use of the term ``shelter belts'' at 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

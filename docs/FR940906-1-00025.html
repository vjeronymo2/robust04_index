			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of base year emission inventory submittals in order to determine approval or disapproval under section 182(a)(1) (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566, April 16, 1992). The EPA is proposing to grant approval of the Texas ozone base year emissions inventories based on the Level I, II, and III review findings. This section outlines the review procedures performed to determine if the base year emission inventory is acceptable or is disapproved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's action describes the review procedures associated with determining the acceptability of a 1990 base year emission inventory, and discusses the levels of acceptance that can result from the findings of the review process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Following Discussion Reviews the State Base Year SIP Inventory Approval Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Level I and II review process is used to determine that all components of the base year inventory are present. The review also evaluates the level of supporting documentation provided by the State, and assesses whether the emissions were developed according to current EPA guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Level III review process outlined below consists of 10 points that the inventory must include. For a base year emission inventory to be acceptable, it must pass all of the following acceptance criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. An approved Inventory Preparation Plan (IPP) was provided, and the Quality Assurance (QA) program contained in the IPP was performed and its implementation documented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Adequate documentation was provided that enabled the reviewer to determine the emission estimation procedures and the data sources used to develop the inventory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The point source inventory must be complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Point source emissions must have been prepared or calculated according to the current EPA guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The area source inventory must be complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The area source emissions must have been prepared or calculated according to the current EPA guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Biogenic emissions must have been prepared according to current EPA guidance or another approved technique.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The method (e.g., Highway Performance Monitoring System or a network transportation planning model) used to develop vehicle miles travelled (VMT) estimates must follow EPA guidance, which is detailed in the document, ``Procedures for Emission Inventory Preparation, Volume IV: Mobile Sources'', U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Mobile Sources and Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, December 1992. The VMT development methods were adequately described and documented in the inventory report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The MOBILE model (or EMFAC model for California only) was correctly used to produce emission factors for each of the vehicle classes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Nonroad mobile emissions were prepared according to current EPA guidance for all of the source categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The base year emission inventory will be approved if it passes Levels I, II, and III of the review process. Detailed Level I and II review procedures can be found in the following document: ``Quality Review Guidelines for 1990 Base Year Emission Inventories'', U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, July 27, 1992. Level III review procedures are specified in a memorandum from David Mobley and G.T. Helms to the Regions, ``1990 O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /CO SIP Emission Inventory Level III Acceptance Criteria'', October 7, 1992, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and revised in a memorandum from John Seitz to the Regional Air Directors dated June 24, 1993. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Memorandum from J.

The Following is a Summary of the Review of the Texas 1990 Base Year Submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The TACB submitted the HGA, BPA, ELP, and DFW inventories on November 17, 1992. EPA Region 6, EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards Emissions Inventory Branch, EPA's Office of Mobile Sources (OMS), and contractor's reviewed the inventories. Comments were sent to the TACB, and the TACB responded with a resubmittal. The resubmittal underwent a second review. The review directive comments were given to Texas and discussed during an on-site visit to Austin, Texas, on September 2, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas addressed the final directive comments and the OMS comments and submitted revised submittal documentation to Region 6 on October 25, 1993, along with documents responding to the directive comments and the OMS comments. Region 6 compared the Texas responses with the deficiencies noted in the final directive review and OMS comments and concluded that Texas had adequately addressed the remaining deficiencies so that Region 6 could verify that Texas had satisfied the Level III criteria for the HGA, BPA, ELP, and DFW ozone nonattainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> CLOUDS CLEAR FOR PARADE;  </P> <P> EVENTS: TV WEATHERMAN "DR. GEORGE" FISCHBECK WILL BE GRAND MARSHAL OF THE SIMI  VALLEY DAYS TRADITION, SAVING THE DAY FOR PLANNERS.  </P> <P> The Simi Valley Days parade will have a grand marshal after all, organizers of  the event said Thursday.  </P> <P> Television weatherman George Fischbeck, also known as "Dr. George," has  accepted the role, said festival chairman Andy Macek.  </P> <P> "I'm honored to have been asked," said Fischbeck, of KABC-TV. "I've got a lot  of friends out there, and I hope they will be watching."  </P> <P> Fischbeck, 69, said he has served as grand marshal in parades before but cannot  remember the cities they were in.  </P> <P> "I don't recall them," he said. "I've been in one or two out here in the last  19 years. It's always nice to be asked."  </P> <P> "We were very lucky to get him," said Tom Brown, special events coordinator for  the parade. "He was very enthusiastic to help us out. And he promised clear  weather."  </P> <P> Some festival officials had worried earlier this week that they might be  without a grand marshal for the Sept. 22 parade.  </P> <P> Since they began their search for a grand marshal several weeks ago, festival  officials were turned down by actress Sally Struthers, comedian Tim Conway,  weatherman Fritz Coleman and a number of Los Angeles disc jockeys.  </P> <P> Actor Claude Akins and another television weatherman, Christopher Nance, were  also among the candidates being considered.  </P> <P> Macek said many of the people who were asked about serving as grand marshal  were unable to commit to the parade because of conflicting schedules.  </P> <P> Macek, who earlier in the week said "we'll take anybody," admitted that the  comment had caused him some trouble with other festival officials.  </P> <P> "I took some heat for that statement," Macek said. "But everything worked out."  </P> <P> He said after reports were published about the organizers' troubles in finding  a grand marshal, KABC officials called and offered to help.  </P> <P> "It wound up perfect for us," Macek said.  </P> <P> The parade, which will feature more than 170 entries, including high school  marching bands and floats, will begin at 9 a.m. and run west along Los Angeles  Avenue between Erringer and Sinaloa roads.  </P> <P> The Simi Valley Days festival kicks off Saturday with a chili cook-off at the  Simi Valley Drive-In, a barn dance at Strathearn Historical Park and a horse  show at the Simi Arroyo Equestrian Center.  </P> <P> The sixth annual event -- which will also feature a carnival, a rodeo and a  tractor-trailer pulling contest -- runs through Sept. 23. A related golf  tournament is scheduled Sept. 28 at Simi Hills Golf Course.  </P> <P> Most of the events will take place on a 70-acre plot at the corner of Madera  Road and Los Angeles Avenue.  </P></p>

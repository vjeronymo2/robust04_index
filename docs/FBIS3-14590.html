A responsible source in the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry denied  that the first deputy prime minister and minister of foreign  affairs, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, had indicated during a press  conference in Cairo yesterday that the subject of some GCC  states' relations with the Iraqi regime would be discussed by  the council.    In a statement to Kuna, the source said "that Shaykh Sabah  had explained in reply to a question in this regard during the  above-mentioned press conference that diplomatic relations  between these states and Iraq had not been severed at all so  that they could be restored" and that this was exactly what  Sabah had said.    On the other hand, the source expressed his regret at  Sudan's  continued failure to condemn the Iraqi regime's aggression  against Kuwait and its failure to demand that Iraq should abide  by the legitimate UN resolutions related to that aggression.    The source said that Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's meeting in  Cairo  yesterday with Sudanese Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Abu Salih  was confined to a discussion of the item on the agenda of the  Arab League meeting which was concerned with the southern Sudan.    Here the source was commenting on what Radio Monte Carlo had  broadcast quoting a Sudanese diplomat in Cairo who said that the  meeting had dealt with the subject of what he claimed to be one  hundred thousand Sudanese who had been working in Kuwait.</p>

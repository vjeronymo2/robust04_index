			<p>BFN     [Text] An (as yet) unknown hand has touched up the Italian  edition of the European Parliament motion, proposed by the  Socialists, on the next Italian government's "loyalty to the  values of the European Community." The original text contained  no reference to fascism and Nazism, whereas this reference is  clear and explicit in the version drafted in our language. How  come? It is a mystery. The least one can say is that there is  something suspicious about it. The document itself, even without  the most offensive phrase, clearly interferes in the life of a  sovereign state, and the president of the Republic and the  speakers of both houses of parliament were therefore right to  protest strongly.    It must also be said that while the resolution voices no  explicit attack on the National Alliance [AN], we cannot close  our eyes to the fact that the "warning" is unacceptable in view  of the fact that neither the AN nor the other members of the  future government alliance have ever shown hostility to the  values underlying the European Union.    It follows that both this little mystery and the overall  smoke screen of polemics that is being fanned day after day in  Europe around events in Italy have but a single source: The  Left in our country is conspiring with the Left in the whole  continent to do all it can to demonize a government willed by  the people (as even [former Prime Minister] Ciriaco De Mita has  emphasized).    However, as Gianfranco Fini has said, the "affair" can only  die down once the new executive has assumed its full powers and  can set to work in the country's interests. Leaving aside the  progressive and pseudocommunist papers and circles of the old  continent, Europe will then realize that no threats to free  institutions can come from National Alliance ministers, who will  not fail to win acclaim for the respect in which they will hold  the values of democracy, tolerance, peace, and solidarity.    So let us note with deep concern that the Left is working at  all levels not to exert its legitimate, normal opposition, but  to poison the political and social atmosphere in Italy and  elsewhere. The outcome of the work of the professional  intriguers is always unpredictable. We hope that the country  will boycott them. For the general good.</p>

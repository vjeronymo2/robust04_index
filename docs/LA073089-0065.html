			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> MORE CHERNOBYL EVACUEES  </P> <P> Soviet scientists say 106,000 people should be evacuated from their villages in  Byelorussia due to contamination from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident, not  11,000 as the government recommends, the news agency Tass said. The cost of  such a large resettlement would reach $15.6 billion, well beyond the financial  capabilities of the republic just north of the power plant, which is in the  Ukraine, the Byelorussian republic's legislature was told. The estimate exceeds  the $12.5-billion official figure for the cumulative cost of the Chernobyl  cleanup. The explosion at the Chernobyl plant resulted in the death of 31  people and spread radioactive fallout over a wide area.  </P></p>

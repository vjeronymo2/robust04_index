			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COSTA MESA'S TEAM TO POLICE DRIVERS  </P> <P> Today I had the opportunity to read the article by Patrick Mott about the Costa  Mesa Police Department's driving under the influence team that was printed in  the Dec. 16 edition of the Los Angeles Times.  </P> <P> Mr. Mott's article was informative, very well researched and portrayed an  honest example of the Police Department's efforts to reduce the trauma caused  by "drunk drivers."  </P> <P> Please thank Mr. Mott for taking the extra time and effort to write the story.  </P> <P> David L. Snowden,  </P> <P> Chief of Police  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

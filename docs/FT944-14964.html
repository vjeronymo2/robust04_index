			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Healthcare's dash for growth - Prospects for a market valued at more than Pounds 7bn While economists argue over the impact of the UK's demographic time-bomb, one market is already evolving to cope with the inexorably rising demands of old age. The combination of an ageing population and a shift in government healthcare policy has helped to create a residential and nursing care market which is conservatively valued at more than Pounds 7bn. Forecasts suggest that demand will rise by 15 per cent before the year 2000, adding between 60,000 and 80,000 beds to today's stock of 540,000. In the wake of community care legislation and the closure of long-term NHS beds, the healthcare sector has reacted in a piecemeal fashion, with thousands of small operators concentrating on supplying local needs. The traditional image dominates the market for caring for the elderly: a cottage industry of husband-and-wife teams offering small numbers of beds in converted houses. Corporate groups account for just 8 per cent of the sector. However, they are attempting to establish themselves with a series of acquisitions, which analysts expect to continue for the foreseeable future. This week shareholders approved APTA Nursing Services' reverse takeover of Midland Assets to create a 628-bed company specialising in sub-acute care. The new company, APTA Healthcare, predicts that its number of beds will grow to 898 by April 1996. Court Cavendish, which came to the market in July 1993, spent Pounds 13.5m on acquisitions last year, almost doubling its number of beds to 1,200. The company plans to add another 500 beds under its acquisition programme. In July, CrestaCare paid Pounds 12.5m for Scotcare, the Scottish nursing homes group, boosting its beds by 32 per cent to more than 2,800. Meanwhile, the larger companies, including Westminster Health Care and Takare, are concentrating on building their own homes. 'I expect a lot of takeover and merger activity in the future. There are too many small groups,' said Mr Roger Hardman, healthcare analyst at UBS. 'I see the existing quoted companies doing a lot of capital raising to build new premises, buying other people's premises, and merging with others to get the maximum benefits of scale.' Ashbourne Holdings, one of the UK's largest nursing homes businesses, last month announced plans for a stock market flotation, which it hoped would give it a value of between Pounds 80m and Pounds 90m. Ashbourne aims to raise up to Pounds 50m to clear its debts and launch an ambitious expansion programme, which includes the construction of three homes next year. However, Mr Harald Hendrikse, analyst at Smith New Court, warned that the market might be reluctant to invest in another nursing home business. 'Although Ashbourne is a very high quality company, they are going to find it tough to come to the market, because people think there are too many companies out there.' Professional care is costly for both the state and the individual. Fees for those on welfare benefits average close to Pounds 290 per week, but private patients pay an average of 10 per cent above that. State support only begins when the patient's assets dip below Pounds 8,000. The cost of insurance can also be prohibitive. PPP Lifetime charges Pounds 117 a month to a 65-year-old man who wants cover for weekly fees of Pounds 300. Last month, Bupa, the UK's biggest private health insurer, announced that it was moving into the long-term health-related insurance market. Westminster Healthcare is considered the favoured stock in the sector at the moment, thanks to its 50 per cent rate of private residents. The company is seen as a high quality operation; its homes boast such extras as jacuzzis. Some 85 per cent of Takare's patients, on the other hand, are cared for out of public funds, which means the company is restricted by the fee limits imposed by local authorities. It has to rely on a low-cost system to secure its long-term future. However, shareholders can expect nursing homes companies to demand yet more cash over the next two years as the dash for growth continues with acquisitions and new building projects. 'It is going to get more competitive as housebuilders come back into the market, making it tough to find new sites for nursing homes,' said Mr Hendrikse. 'In 18 months' time it is probably going to be quite difficult, but if they scale down their expansion, nursing home companies can basically become utilities.'</p>

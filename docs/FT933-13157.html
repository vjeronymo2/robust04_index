			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / UK earnings inequality increases THE UK saw the biggest increase in earnings inequality of any OECD country in the 1980s but remains considerably less unequal than the US and at about the same level as France, according to an analysis in the organisation's Employment Outlook, writes David Goodhart. The 1980s saw earnings inequality rise in 12 out of the 17 countries for which data were available in marked contrast to the 1970s where inequality generally fell (with the exception of the US). Small rises in inequality were recorded in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden. Large increases were recorded in the UK and the US. Levels of inequality remained stable in Denmark, Finland, Italy and Norway and inequality continued to fall in west Germany. The OECD says the growing gap can be ascribed to highly-paid workers doing better than average rather than to poorly paid workers doing worse. Australia, Canada and the US were the only countries seeing falls in the real value of the bottom earnings decline.</p>

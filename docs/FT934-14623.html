			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Chillington advances to Pounds 0.8m AN IMPROVED performance from the tropical agriculture division enabled Chillington Corporation, the conglomerate with interests in plantations and engineering, to record a rise in interim profits from Pounds 319,000 to Pounds 808,000 pre-tax. The improvement came on turnover from continuing operations of Pounds 25.1m (Pounds 24m). The figures included Pounds 489,000 (Pounds 261,000) from Anglo-Eastern Plantations. Chillington is selling most of its 49.2 per cent stake in Anglo-Eastern to Genton International of Hong Kong for Pounds 8.57m. Chillington, which has other plantation interests in Indonesia and Africa, said the profits growth was achieved in spite of losses of Pounds 639,000 in its forge and foundry division. The group sold its Manchester-based forge, formerly Eva Brothers, for Pounds 285,000 in August and the directors are considering proposals for a management buy-out at Thomas Seager, its foundry. Earnings per share rose from 0.1p to 2.08p and interim dividends are restored via a 0.75p payment. Chillington is proposing to convert each existing deferred share to one ordinary share. The deferred shares represent about 31 per cent of total issued share capital. A 1-for-12 scrip issue is also proposed.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Kenya denies rift with donors THE Kenyan government has dismissed claims of a rift with donors and denied allegations of malpractice in the country's banking sector. 'The government is continuing the dialogue with the IMF and World Bank and other donors, but on the basis of more rational and sustainable measures,' Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the minister of finance, said in a statement at the weekend. Donors and bankers had expressed deep concern over the government's decision last Monday to suspend or reverse key elements of its economic reform programme. President Daniel arap Moi had earlier accused the IMF and the Bank of forcing 'dictatorial and suicidal' measures on the government. Last week's decision was 'intended to save the economy from collapse, it was not intended to result in a break with the Fund or the Bank,' said the minister. The minister denied allegations of fraud in connection with an export compensation scheme. He also rejected reports that certain banks said to have political connections received favoured treatment. 'It is true that a few banks have run overdrafts with the central bank due to liquidity problems resulting from financial liberalisation, adverse publicity and other underlying problems,' said the minister. But he stressed that the banks were not insolvent, and had 'substantial fixed assets which are in the process of being liquidated to generate liquidity'. To deny them overdrafts would have caused 'upheavals' in the financial system and 'untold suffering to innocent depositors', he explained. 'The running of overdrafts was considered the lesser evil,' he added, 'especially considering that the banks involved were being restructured to eliminate the need for overdrafts.'</p>

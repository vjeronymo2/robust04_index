			<p>BFN     [Text] The number of registered unemployed continued to  fall in May. This transpires from the statistics published by  the National Labor Affairs Center. The district centers  registered 570,600 unemployed in the fifth month of 1994, some  22,000 fewer than in April 1994. Thus, unemployment fell to  11.4 percent from the 11.8 percent in April.    The number of registered unemployed has been steadily  falling  for more than a year, and the latest fall was the biggest so  far. According to the Center's statistics, there were 100,000  more unemployed in May 1993 than in May 1994. Together with the  newly registered people starting their careers, the Center  registered 33,400 new unemployed in May; at the same time,  55,600 people were taken off the unemployment list. Like the  national trend, unemployed fell in the counties too. The fall  in unemployment even exceeded 5 percent in the Veszprem, Somogy,  Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen, Heves, and Zala counties. The smallest  fall in unemployment occurred in the Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg and  Fejer counties, and in Budapest.    Demand for manpower increased by 4 percent compared with  April, with employers offering 70,800 jobs in May 1994. Job  opportunities increased in the construction industry but  continued to fall in the agricultural sector and in industry,  and did not change in the other sectors. A total of 74 economic  units announced in May that they were planning lay-offs,  affecting a total of 4,240 jobs. This is 40 percent fewer than  the forecasts made in April. Together with the predictions made  in previous months, a total of 24,000 employees are expected to  lose their jobs in the near future.    A total of 230,300 people were receiving unemployment  benefit  at the end of May 1994; the non-social form of this benefit was  used by 279,000 people in May. According to the data from the  last day, 20 May, there were 149,000 unemployed who were not  receiving any kind of unemployment benefit.    The total average sum of unemployment benefit and support  for  people beginning their career stood at 10,658 forints in May.  Some 48.7 percent of the unemployed were receiving less than  9,000 forints.</p>

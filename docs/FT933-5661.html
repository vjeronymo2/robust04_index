			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / People: Sir Len Peach moves into Coutts Consulting Coutts Consulting, the career consultancy, outplacement and residential training group, (formerly DC Gardner), has appointed Sir Len Peach as a non-executive director. Sir Len has an extensive background in the field known as human resource management. In his 30 years with IBM between 1972-92 he held a host of posts in the personnel and corporate affairs fields, including running the company's European, African and Middle East personnel affairs from Paris in the mid-1970s. Latterly he has shifted more towards the public sector. In 1992 he became chairman of the embattled Police Complaints Authority. He had been chief executive of the National Health Service's management board between 1986-89. His experience helping staff go through rough times will be useful at Coutts itself. Not only is the group in open dispute with Barry Topple, its former chief executive, over the amount of compensation he received for having his contract terminated in 1992; Coutts also made pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.24m for the first half of its current financial year.</p>

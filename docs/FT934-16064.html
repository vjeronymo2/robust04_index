			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Dublin supports plea for public inquiry on Thorp THE IRISH government has thrown its weight behind those calling for a public inquiry to be held before the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield is granted revised authorisations for radioactive discharges. In its second submission to the UK authorities, the Irish government says there is 'no sound economic case' to be made for going ahead with the project. Mr Brian Cowen, Irish minister for transport and energy, yesterday said he was publishing the submission due 'to the concerns and fears held in this island regarding Sellafield'. He added: 'I wish to highlight and reinforce with our European Community colleagues the Irish government's concerns and misgivings regarding the British nuclear industry and the Sellafield plant in particular.' The report says: 'There are no demonstrable overall economic or security benefits arising out of Thorp's operation which would justify it or balance out possible and likely risks to public health and environmental damage. A narrow base of benefits to BNFL (British Nuclear Fuels) or the UK economy alone is not a sufficient justification.' The Irish government says that 'important points of substance specifically related to the draft discharge authorisations' made in its first submission 'had not been adequately addressed' by UK authorities. The submission says 'the bringing on-stream of Thorp represents an additional and unnecessary risk to the health and safety of the population'.</p>

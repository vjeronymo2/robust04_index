			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Credit Suisse ahead CREDIT SUISSE, Switzerland's third-largest bank, said its revenue in the first nine months was ahead of last year's level, and it expected net profits for the year to be comparable with last year's record SFr848m (Dollars 689.4m). Although the slack demand for credit was hurting, commission income was showing a marked rise. 'Swaps and derivative financial instruments again account for a significant part of the increase in trading revenue,' said Mr Robert Jeker, chief executive. Mr Jeker warned that provisions for bad debts could be higher than last year's SFr1.1bn because of the persistent weakness of the world economy, but he said that Credit Suisse, the main subsidiary of CS Holding, was in 'a very good position' with a capital ratio of 9.8 per cent under the Basle norms. He also quashed occasional speculation in Switzerland that the bank might abandon the retail sector in its home country. Mr Jeker said it was 'essential to maintain our strong position in the retail banking sector'.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED MEAT IMPORTANT IN WOMEN'S DIETS;  </P> <P> DISDAINED BEEF A FACTOR IN IRON ABSORPTION, STUDY SHOWS  </P> <P> I have recently sensed an interesting conflict in people's attitudes toward red  meat. Some proudly boast that they never eat meat anymore. Others defiantly  proclaim they will never give it up. And those in the middle struggle to do  without, but sometimes succumb to the seduction of a big, juicy burger or a  tender filet.  </P> <P> Should you give up red meat? The answer may be different for men and women.  </P> <P> If you are a woman in childbearing years, consider carefully before deciding to  go cold turkey.  </P> <P> As usual, national recommendations for people of all ages to reduce fat and  cholesterol intake are based on statistics collected from men. But  premenopausal females have a very low risk of heart disease, believed to be due  to a protective factor related to their hormonal system.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Three Groups of Women Studied  </P> <P> Furthermore, a study done in Seattle showed that low blood cholesterol levels  during the reproductive years are not diet-related. That study compared three  groups of women: those who ate red meat at least five times per week, those who  used fish and poultry as their main protein source and those who used only  lacto-ovo-vegetarian (milk and eggs) sources of protein.  </P> <P> Despite the fact that the red-meat group ate considerably more cholesterol and  saturated fat, their total blood cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good)  cholesterol and triglycerides were the same as in the other groups.  </P> <P> The difference was their iron status. Despite the fact that dietary iron intake  was similar for all groups, the red-meat group had higher blood levels of iron.  Low iron levels among the other two groups placed them at higher risk of  iron-deficiency anemia (that's right: "iron-poor blood," a common problem among  women in mid-life).  </P> <P> Red meat seems to contain a factor that improves the absorption of iron from  the meat, as well as from other foods eaten at the same time, such as bread,  cereal, grains, beans and vegetables.  </P> <P> So mid-life women are at low risk for heart disease, but high risk for  iron-deficiency anemia. This means that moderate amounts of lean red meat could  be a real nutritional bargain for this group.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Points to Consider  </P> <P> But there are other points to consider. High-fat diets increase the risk of  cancer, regardless of age. And fat is high in calories. Eating fat makes you  fat. Then menopause wipes out the protective hormones, rapidly increasing the  risk of heart disease. So lifelong good habits remain important.  </P> <P> What's a woman to do?  </P> <P> Choose the leanest cuts of beef. Lean, trimmed top round contains only 6  saturated-fat calories per ounce compared to 12 for sirloin, 17 for chuck or  rib roast, or 25 for lean ground beef.  </P> <P> If you cannot resist an occasional hamburger, try mixing ground beef with  ground turkey to cut saturated fat in half.  </P> <P> Watch out for other sources of fat. Many women trade iron-rich meat for  high-fat foods of lower nutritional value.  </P> <P> Three ounces of top round (18 saturated-fat calories) on two slices of  whole-wheat bread (8 saturated-fat calories) equal 26 saturated-fat calories  plus the "meat factor." Three ounces of white-meat turkey (3 saturated-fat  calories) on a croissant (32 saturated-fat calories) for a total of 35  saturated fat-calories is not as benign as it first appears.  </P></p>

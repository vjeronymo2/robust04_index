			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MASSACHUSETTS;  </P> <P> U.S. WON'T RETRY ACCUSED BOMBERS  </P> <P> Prosecutors in Springfield, Mass., said they will not retry three alleged  revolutionaries charged with trying to overthrow the government, ending one of  the longest and costliest criminal cases in U.S. history. A mistrial had been  declared after a jury cleared the three of charges they tried to overthrow the  government by force. It deadlocked on whether alleged bombing exploits  constituted racketeering. Defendants Raymond Levasseur and Richard Williams are  serving 45-year sentences for some of the bombings. Levasseur's wife, Patricia  Levasseur, served 3 1/2 years for harboring a fugitive, her husband.  </P></p>

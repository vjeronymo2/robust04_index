			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Buoyant recruitment market boosts BNB BNB Resources, the recruitment, training and consumer communications group, yesterday announced sharply increased first half profits as it consolidated the recovery shown in 1993. Mr David Norman, chairman, said that continuing increased demand across the group's activities was behind the pre-tax line improving from Pounds 344,000 to Pounds 1.38m for the half year to June 30. Turnover rose 33 per cent to Pounds 42.2m. The human resources recruitment side lifted its contribution to operating profits by 73 per cent to Pounds 3.07m. The senior management and professional recruitment market displayed a solid improvement in the UK, Mr Norman said, with Norman Broadbent's revenue ahead 31 per cent. In the US, income at NBI rose 39 per cent, helped by the Chicago office coming on stream. Mr Norman praised an 'outstanding' performance from NBI Hong Kong with 'business booming' at its new Beijing office with revenue more than doubled. NB Selection, which specialises in management recruitment, has expanded from its UK base on to the Continent with offices opening in Paris and Madrid. Revenue jumped 63 per cent, outperforming a market showing volume growth of about 30 per cent. Margins on the training side remained under pressure, with the seasonal operating deficit widening from Pounds 395,000 to Pounds 721,000. Market share had improved, however, and Mr Norman anticipated an advance on last year's overall profit of Pounds 497,000. Earnings per share emerged at 4.2p (1.1p); the interim dividend goes up to 1.77p (1.6p).</p>

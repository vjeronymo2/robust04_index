			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / The Markets: Testing time for coffee and metals - Commodities Leading commodity markets enter this week with some serious question marks hanging over them. After the recent fireworks, coffee prices have been settling back and traders will be looking for signs of consolidation to stave off a feared major sell-off by the US investment funds whose buying was so influential in the gains of the past month or so. At the London Metal Exchange meanwhile, the copper and aluminium markets will be watched with interest, not to say anxiety, following recent retreats from long-time highs. Now that the Brazilian industry and commerce ministry has issued its assessment of the damage done to the country's coffee crop by the frosts of June 27 and July 11, and with fears of further frosts in growing areas receding, the coffee market has to prove that it can thrive in the rarefied atmosphere above Dollars 3,000 a tonne. So far the retreat from last month's Dollars 4,000-plus highs has not threated to carry the London Commodity Exchange September futures position below the Dollars 3,076 a tonne ruling immediately before the second frost - last week's low was Dollars 3,362. But with the Brazilian coffee frost season now entering its final month, speculators, while remaining reluctant to go 'short' in this market, could be looking for opportunities to take profits. The LME copper and aluminium markets are in a comparable position. Copper last week continued its retreat from the previous week's two-year highs, while aluminium, having broken through support at Dollars 1,500 a tonne for three months delivery, dipped below Dollars 1,450 at one point. Both markets steadied towards the end of the week, however, and they remain within reach of the highs. Analysts are for the most part cautiously bullish about the price prospects for these metals once the current consolidation phase is completed. But, as in the coffee market, the potential weight of investment fund selling is seen as a serious threat in the short term.</p>

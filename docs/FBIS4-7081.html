			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata called Friday [22 April] for a resolution of Japan's trade  dispute with the United States by July, when the Group of Seven  (G-7) industrialized nations is set to hold a summit in Naples.    Hata, who is certain to become the next prime minister, told  a press conference he believes Japan and the U.S. could solve  the trade row because he and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor were able to understand "what the problems are" when they  met last week in Marrakech, Morocco.    Japan will hammer out the second package of market-opening  measures by June and the U.S. also has been making efforts to  create products meeting Japanese demands, he said.    Hata said Japan must spontaneously take steps to open its  markets because this will not only reduce its huge surplus with  the U.S. but will also contribute to the improvement of people's  lives and inject dynamism into the domestic economy.    Tokyo and Washington have been unable to resume the trade  "framework" that broke down in February over failure to iron out  differences on the "objective criteria" for foreign access to  Japanese markets.</p>

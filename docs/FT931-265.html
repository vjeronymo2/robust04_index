			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Call to Seoul MPs to quit South Korea's ruling party said yesterday it would ask six of its MPs, including the present and former speakers of the National Assembly, to resign for alleged corruption, writes John Burton in Seoul. The action follows asset disclosures made by the MPs of the Democratic Liberal Party under the order of President Kim Young-sam. Some have been criticised for possessing 'excessive' wealth and are suspected of tax evasion. Mr Park Jyun-kyu, the speaker, resigned from the party on Monday in protest at its attempt to force him from parliament. But his predecessor, Mr Kim Jai-son, agreed to leave. Another five MPs have been reprimanded and are unlikely to be renominated for 1996 parliamentary elections.</p>

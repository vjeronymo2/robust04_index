			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FATHER WONDERS WHY HE SURVIVED SHIPWRECK THAT KILLED HIS SON  </P> <P> Barry Holmberg's son died in his arms late last week in the chilly,  storm-stirred ocean off British Columbia as the lights of their would-be rescue  ship flickered just minutes away.  </P> <P> For several hours, the Studio City man and his 23-year-old son, Rob, had clung  to a piece of floating plywood, a pair of life jackets and each other after  their tuna seiner capsized in heavy seas around 1 a.m. Friday, about 200 miles  offshore in the Queen Charlotte Sound.  </P> <P> Of the five crew members of the 69-foot Quicksilver, on a six-month tuna run  out of San Diego, only father and son remained alive -- barely -- as dawn  approached Friday.  </P> <P> "We thought we were dead, it was all over," Barry Holmberg said in a telephone  interview from a Vancouver hospital, where he was recovering from hypothermia  and trying to figure out why he, alone, survived.  </P> <P> "It was raining and it was storming, and there were 20-foot swells and 50-knot  gusts," he recounted. "It was like trying to fight Godzilla with a fly swatter.  You couldn't do anything but pray."  </P> <P> For Rob Holmberg, who lived in Huntington Beach and was in his second year on  the tuna runs, it wasn't enough.  </P> <P> Hearing an incomplete "May Day" call from the tuna boat, as many as seven  vessels combed the area for survivors. As the Holmbergs floated in the  54-degree water, they could spot the ships' taunting lights -- close enough to  offer hope of a rescue, but uncertain enough, through the dark, pounding rains,  to keep them discouraged, Holmberg said. Finally, hours into the ordeal, Rob  decided he had waited long enough -- he would find the ships.  </P> <P> "I told him, 'don't do it, don't do it. You've got to save your energy.' But he  panicked, he wouldn't listen. He was going to save us," the father recalled.  "He was a hero."  </P> <P> Scrapping his life jacket to make swimming easier, Rob ventured toward the  ships' lights. But, about 10 minutes later, he returned unsuccessfully.  </P> <P> Exhausted, the young man clutched his father, his head hanging heavily. Barry  Holmberg said he tried to hold him up, but his son's body was like a heavy  weight.  </P> <P> " 'Dad, I don't think I'm going to make it,' " Barry Holmberg heard his son  whisper. "Then he just died right there in my arms."  </P> <P> Almost immediately, a large ocean swell rolled through, splitting the two,  Holmberg said. He said he tried frantically to find his son's body, but he was  beginning to lose consciousness.  </P> <P> According to Canadian Coast Guard officials, another fishing boat found  Holmberg -- incoherent, but alive -- around 6 a.m., probably just a few minutes  later.  </P> <P> "It's really remarkable that he survived that long," said Capt. Bob Morris, who  directed the search mission from the Victoria Rescue Coordination Center, run  jointly by the Canadian Coast Guard and Armed Forces.  </P> <P> The captain said the water temperature -- about 10 degrees above seasonal norms  -- certainly helped keep Holmberg alive. But, he added, the rough storm  conditions, along with the man's slight build and light clothing -- underwear  and a T-shirt -- made his survival extraordinary.  </P> <P> Except for his son, Holmberg and the other three crew members were all asleep  when the boat began to sink -- apparently because of a broken line on a "sea  anchor," a water parachute used to maintain position through wind direction.  </P> <P> There was little time to do anything but flee, Holmberg said. A part-time  stuntman who said he has worked on films with Burt Reynolds, Holmberg signaled  to two men below deck to get out, but they apparently never made it.  </P> <P> The two -- identified by Holmberg as Manuel Faldala, in his 50s, originally  from Guadalajara, Mex., but who had been living in the Southland, and Bill  Taylor, 43, of American Samoa -- are presumed drowned, authorities said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Holmberg, his son and the ship's captain -- Charles LaGamma, 42, of  San Diego -- tried to reach a life boat on deck. But with the larger vessel  about to capsize, they failed and were forced to jump ship, Holmberg said.  </P> <P> In the water, the three grabbed a 4-foot-by-4-foot plywood hatch cover, riding  out the waves and praying for help. LaGamma, wearing nothing but a life  preserver, was the first to die, apparently the victim of hypothermia, Holmberg  said. Then, after another large swell, LaGamma's body and the plywood cover  were gone.  </P> <P> A short time later, Holmberg's son would be lost, too.  </P> <P> "God must have wanted me for something," Holmberg said of his survival. "I  don't know what, and I don't know why. I just wish He had taken me and not my  son."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Ivan De Vadder report over video introduced </F> by newscaster Martine Tanghe]    [Text]    Tanghe: Belgium will now sign the London  Convention which forbids the dumping of low levels of nuclear  waste into the sea. Over 60 countries signed this agreement  late last year while Belgium abstained. The government has  decided to sign the convention but wants to find a solution  before the end of the year so that radioactive waste can be  disposed of on land.    De Vadder: [video shows dumping of  radioactiuve waste] Belgium was one of five countries last  year that did not sign the international ban on the dumping of  nuclear waste into the sea. France, China, Great Britain, and  Russia also abstained. Until 1982, Belgium dumped low levels of  radioactive waste in the Gulf of Biscay [off the Spanish coast].  A moratorium was introduced a year later and imposed a halt for  10 years. When 67 countries declared themselves in favor of a  ban on such dumping late last year in London, the Belgian  Government decided to extend the moratorium until the year 2000.  This decision was dictated by the problems of nuclear waste  processing with which the Belgoprocess plant in Dessel [northern  Belgium] is now dealing. The objective is to get rid of part of  the nuclear waste for good somewhere in our country. As long as  no decision had been made on this subject, the government  hesitated in signing a ban on sea dumping, not because it  intended to resume dumping waste into the sea but because it did  not want to rule out this option. Belgium will now adhere to  the ban and Environment Minister Sentkin wants to find a final  solution to the disposal of low-yield radioactive waste in our  country by the end of the year.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Johnson Cleaners hits Pounds 8.7m SHARES IN Johnson Group Cleaners rose 13p to 835p as the dry cleaning company reported a 17 per cent jump in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.44m to Pounds 8.7m. The results for the six months to June 26, struck on a 9 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 81.7m (Pounds 74.8m), were largely due to currency gains and the acquisition of a workwear rental company earlier this year. The interim dividend is maintained for the fourth consecutive year at 7p, while earnings improved from 22.54p to 28.04p per share. Mr Terry Greer, chairman, said trading in both the US and UK remained difficult, with dry cleaning sales and margins under continuing pressure. Mr Greer was slightly more upbeat on prospects than in recent years, however, hinting that the group might be ready to return to the acquisition trail in the next year or so. 'There are signs of a tentative economic recovery, which must make us more optimistic.' Yet, he added the caveat that Johnson had not seen 'evidence of anything sustainable'. Exchange rates added Pounds 290,000 to operating profits, while Imperial &amp; Queen Laundries, acquired in January for Pounds 2.9m cash, contributed Pounds 260,000. These helped increase operating profits by 7 per cent to Pounds 9.2m. The pre-tax figure was further helped by a Pounds 464,000 drop in net interest charges to Pounds 591,000. Mr Greer said the dry cleaning business in the US had been hit by the severe winter and summer flooding. The franchise business continued to incur losses, although lower than last year. Workwear rental, which had improved in the first half, would be the focus of growth in the US. This was likely to mean acquisitions in the next year.</p>

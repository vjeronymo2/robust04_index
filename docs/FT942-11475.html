			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bayer may buy healthcare unit from Kodak Bayer, the German chemicals group, is considering acquiring the over-the-counter medicines business of Sterling Winthrop, the healthcare products division of the Eastman Kodak group, Reuter reports from Leverkusen. 'Bayer . . . will examine the possibilities of acquiring the self-medication business of Sterling Winthrop,' Bayer said. On Tuesday, Kodak announced plans to sell its pharmaceutical business, including Sterling Winthrop. Mr Manfred Schneider, Bayer chairman, has stressed that expansion of self-medication activities, especially in the US, was one of Bayer's corporate aims. Sterling Winthrop has the rights to the Bayer name and its cross symbol in the US and Canada. Bayer trades in North America under the name of Miles, its US subsidiary. Sterling obtained the rights to the Bayer cross and many other trademarks in 1918. Bayer bought back the rights worldwide with the exception of the US and Canada in 1970. Elf Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals group, has also expressed interest in Sterling, saying Kodak's decision to sell presented an opportunity to merge Sanofi and Sterling.</p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (4): Notebooks claiming lion's share - The European Market / European makers' best hopes may lie in niche markets EUROPEAN companies have still to make much of a mark in the fastest growing segment of the personal computer market. Some 48m personal computers should be installed throughout Europe by 1994 of which almost 20 per cent will be portable, according to the market research consultancy, Romtec; and notebooks will account for 73 per cent of the portable market, equivalent to about 6m units. Mr Bolko Kast, marketing executive director for Siemens Nixdorf's reseller division, argues that notebook machines are already claiming the lion's share of the portable market and will soon, through superior ease of use, put paid to the bulkier laptop machines. But the world and European leaders in portable machines are the same: Toshiba of Japan, Compaq of the US and Zenith Data Systems, a US company now owned by Groupe Bull of France. European-owned companies may have a strong presence in their home markets, but it is not reflected across the continent. Amstrad, for example, leads the UK laptop market with a 32.5 per cent share by volume ahead of Compaq with 18.5 per cent and Toshiba with 17.5 per cent according to the latest figures from Romtec. (By value, Compaq leads and Toshiba is in second place). The challenge to European-owned suppliers, however, remains to learn to compete with the major US and Japanese producers. And they will be fighting on their own territory. Toshiba not only sells computers in Europe, it manufactures there as well. Its Regensburg, Germany, production facility makes about one third of the Toshiba portables sold in Europe. The company's investment in the Regensburg plant now comes to about DM80m; it has just begun production of printed circuit boards there. The plant includes research and development facilities. According to Toshiba, 'by situating such research and development departments directly in Europe, Toshiba has made sure that despite recent pressure in the portable market, it will continue to retain leadership of the European market in terms of technology as well as market share.' Compaq has been manufacturing systems for European distribution since 1988 at its 530,000 sq ft manufacturing plant at Erskine near Glasgow in Scotland. It makes its most advanced portable computers there, partly, it seems to avoid onerous US duties on 'active matrix' colour flat panel displays. The US government's decision to place a duty on the expensive TFT colour displays gives Compaq and other US manufacturers of high performance laptops a curious problem. The duty, designed to protect a handful of US manufacturers of similar displays, applies only to separate displays. It does not apply to complete systems. If a display fails, the company would have a dilemma. Whether to ship the machine out of the country to replace the faulty part, or simply to replace the whole machine so great would the cost be to import and fit a new display. The problem has a echo in the 14 per cent duty charged on semiconductors imported into Europe. Organisations like the European Association of Manufacturers of Business Machines and Information Technology Industry (Eurobit) argue that the duty is damaging European competitiveness, adding an average 2.5 per cent to manufacturing costs. Semiconductors can make up to 60 per cent of the total cost of a personal computer or workstation. Eurobit is asking for the duty to be abolished, arguing it reduces investment and the competitiveness of European manufacturers. What prospects are there for European-owned makers? There is no shortage of innovation. The UK company DIP, whose handheld miniature computer is the basis of the Atari Portfolio, showed that, as did Psion with its notebook-style Mobile Computer. Both companies may have been somewhat ahead of the market. Psion, in particular, was unfortunate in failing to co-ordinate the launch of hardware and software for the Mobile Computer. The result was a missed window of opportunity; Psion is now concentrating on its core expertise in handheld devices for personal and commercial use. Innovation in personal computing is, however, rapidly giving way to standard technology - microprocessors from Intel, operating software from Microsoft, tiny but high capacity disk drives. The secret of success is volume production and effective distribution. Groupe Bull of France bought its position in portables through the acquisition of Zenith Data Systems of the US; the company has since suffered from distribution difficulties and from declining sales in the US. A deal with IBM giving Bull access to IBM technology in exchange for equity and a promise to take substantial numbers of Zenith portables may prove a turning point for the company. Olivetti of Italy designs and manufacturers laptop and notebook computers through its Triumph Adler subsidiary. Features include a common 'docking station' - a desk-top unit into which portable computers can be fitted to give communications and other facilities. There is also an integral mouse pad to drive the screen pointer. The Triumph Adler machines are sold under the Olivetti label but also under the DEC logostyle in Europe. Philips of the Netherlands retained its personal computer interests when it sold most of its computer business to DEC last year. Now, according to the market consultancy Dataquest, it is fifth in Europe in notebooks. It is also a pioneer in systems which substitute input by finger or stylus for conventional keyboards. It intends to announce a product using this technology before 1993. Siemens Nixdorf announced a high end notebook computer at the end of last year; it has been working with Matsushita of Japan to develop what Mr Kast of Siemens Nixdorf describes as a 'mobile desktop' - a docking unit in which the notebook machine can be securely locked to prevent theft. Mr Kast believes that this kind of computer system will eventually replace conventional desk top computers. Europe's best hope may lie in niche markets. The UK company Husky, for example, specialises in ruggedised handheld computer for use in the field; The Prudential has bought 7,600 to equip its field sales force. Logitech, an international company with its headquarters in Switzerland, is developing devices to humanise the computer; it markets a range of mice and trackerballs specially suited to portable computers. It claims its 'Trackman Portable' mouse is the most ergonomic available.</p>

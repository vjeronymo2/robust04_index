			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article including interview with former Environment </F> Minister Per Stig Moller by Steensgaard; place and date of  interview not given: ``They Have Never Seen Anything Like It in  the Ministry''--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE AFTEN introduction]    [Text] ``Only afterwards is one truly free,'' said Per Stig  Moller. After his two years as environment minister, he is  lashing out at environmental doomsday prophets and their  alarmist movements. Growth is the way forward, we must not run  screaming backwards. Yet another provocative book from a  nonsocialist former minister.    First, Anders Fogh Rasmussen hurled his angry,  uncompromising  book about the Danish society of grumblers and whimperers onto  the table. Now, another former minister, Per Stig Moller, has  put some weighty ideas into print. The 51-year-old Ph.D. and  gifted humanist writer was the nonsocialist government's last  environment minister--in 1991 and 1992--and he cannot forget it.    ``I sat at my desk during Easter, some months after the  government was out of power,'' he said. ``There were no papers,  no matters to be taken care of, no ringing telephones. Being a  minister is like being on drugs, you work from 0800 in the  morning to 2200 at night, every day of the week. You suffer  withdrawal afterwards. I thought: I can't stand this, I will  write a book!    ``A minister cannot do this because then the prime minister  and the whole government must be agreed upon your point of view.  You might as well be writing the party platform. Only afterwards  is one truly free. So it is tempting, as Anders and I have done,  to lean back and focus all of one's personal knowledge on  setting things into perspective.''    Moller has an agreeable manner of boasting. He does not try  to conceal his compliments to himself behind something else.  They come out with a bang. He manifests an unabashed joy in his  initiatives--''they never saw anything like it at the  ministry``--in his industry, in his results. He can say  `dialectic' and other nonendemic words without blinking and  quotes French philosophers in French. People at Christiansborg  say this has always been his problem in Danish politics, that he  thinks--in this way. An unusual man of affairs.''    Today he has nothing to do with environmental policy, as the  Conservative Party has decided that everyone is to change  places. ``We have seen for ourselves how our predecessors came  to appear either lax or pathetic, if they remained within their  ministerial area,'' he said. ``If they were critical, it was  labeled bitterness. If they supported the new ministers, it was  insipid. It hurt them as politicians.''  <H5>  Ecologists and Nazis </H5>   One of Mollers important objectives in the book is to shoot  down the so-called ecohumanists, who condemn growth. It is not  only that he disagrees with their desire for minus growth. He is  also afraid that some of them will begin to tamper with  democracy in the name of the environment. He worries they will  brush aside democracy as too weak to do anything effective about  the looming catastrophes.    Among Moller's ecohumanists is found the poet, Thorkild  Bjornvig. In the 1970's, he began a campaign against  industrialism, capitalism, market economics, and democracy,  Moller says. Bjornvig rejected the democracies ``with their  antiquated materialistic concepts of freedom'' and espoused  ecological socialism.    This pessimistic line was taken up by David Rehling,  director  of Denmark's Nature Conservancy Association, who last year in a  feature article criticized democracy's incapacity to act. Knud  Vilby, chairman of International Cooperation, is also counted  among the group. Moller cites him for wanting to use  ``consciousness-raising'' to save the earth. And, for those  people who are unable to raise their consciousness, he would use  ``the force that is necessary to get the last ones to go along.''    ``The ecohumanists imagine that they are angels who have  seen  the ethically correct path. That we must abandon growth and clad  ourselves in sackcloth and ashes,'' says Moller. ``Yet if  poverty were to come, people would not put money into nature,  they would want social programs instead. The East Germans, who  have the biggest environmental problems, give the environment  lowest priority. West Germans, who have the fewest problems,  give it the highest priority. This is an excellent argument for  concurrent growth and environmental policy, for only when you  have the funds, do you have the means to look around and view  your surroundings.''    Steensgaard: Aren't you seeing phantoms? Not a  single society is run by the ecohumanists you warn about.    Moller: They are few, but they color political  life--also here in Denmark. In my time as minister, the Social  Democrats, Radicals, and Socialist People's Party, during an  inquiry debate, proposed that growth should be stopped. Jan  Sjursen of the Christian Party is out there right now with very  much the same kind of thing, in which he says that we have  enough growth and should slow down our pace. Politicians do not  act in a vacuum. The humanists create the mental imagery, the  expectations, and the doom. The Nazi gas chambers did not come  from the technicians, but from racial conceptions, which came  out of philosophy, God help us.  <H5>  Fear Is the Engine </H5>   Steensgaard: Is ecology suitable as a new ideology  for all those who are searching for one?    Moller: Yes. Ecology is a modern expression for  nature worship and some would use it politically. The power they  did not achieve over society by means of Marxism and socialistic  theories, they can achieve through ecology. The engine is fear  of catastrophe.    In his book, Moller writes that environmental catastrophe  has  become an issue that mystics and demagogues can use to draw  people in. Now that the cold war is over and the ideologies have  collapsed, we are immediately able to make another: The old  confrontation between capitalism and Marxism has been supplanted  by something between liberalism and ecologism. Just as in the  1970's, the Marxists sought to win control over production and  gain supremacy over bourgeois democracy with the object of  creating a socialist egalitarian society, in the 1990's, the  ecologists aspire to do the same. The goal has simply been  changed, in this case, to a ``balanced'' society.    One of the worst, in the opinion of the former minister, is  the German-American religious philosopher, Hans Jonas, who is  influential in ecology circles.    ``Jonas says that those who understand what this is all  about  must halt growth. This elite will determine what will be  produced and make sure that it is distributed. Democracy is then  abolished and a big threat provides the means to do it: The end  of the world. In such circumstances, it is a small thing to  abolish democracy. Fear is a prop. It paralyzes people and  causes them to buy indulgences from the environmental  organizations.    ``At the other end, you have the right-wing ecologists. They  never did like growth and feel that industrialism destroys the  soul. They would lead us back to a time of self-reliant  households, ancient virtues, and a life without haste or hurry.  It is a longing for continuity. They would stop time.''    ``The middle, in which I find myself, does not wish to offer  up democracy on ecology's alter. My point is that those who have  acquired absolute power to solve a problem have damn well never  done it! They have created even greater problems, but in the  meantime they entrenched themselves pretty well. There are no  extreme solutions.''  <H5>  The End of the World </H5>   Moller is neither more or less extreme than a Radical  Liberal  minister or a Social Democratic one. They are surprisingly  united in their concrete policy. Why go to the bother of writing  a book when they are all in agreement?    ``It is quite irrelevant whether we are agreed or not, as  the  others have not set down their ideas comprehensively. This is  the first environmental book in Danish that was not written by a  Green. I try to view the environment humanistically,  historically, culturally, and technologically. There are hard,  concrete chapters and also historical ones--for example the one  on doomsday prophets. That one was fun to write!''    Steensgaard: You poke fun at doomsday prophets  from the past, in that each maintained that the end was drawing  nigh. Yet, you yourself say that about our situation....    Moller: Yes, I am saying: They have been wrong so  many times. This is my message about what we presently know. A  colossal number of catastrophes are waiting out there. We have  never had so many that dovetailed into one another. They must be  solved generally in the same time frame with different solutions  that point in the same direction. It is something mankind has  never before encountered, because it is the first time the  catastrophes have been global.    Steensgaard: Where shall we begin when there are  so many catastrophes to choose between?    Moller: In Denmark, our three greatest problems  are: too much waste, a question of adequate ground water, and a  lack of knowledge. We simply do not know enough about how nature  reacts. Globally, the irreplaceable things must be dealt with  first. That is, those things that cannot be restored again:  climate changes, the hole in the ozone layer, and the fact that  whole species of plants and animals are vanishing. But, above  all this hangs the biggest problem of all: the threat of  overpopulation. You can go around and solve all of the other  environmental problems one after the other--it will not help one  bit if you do not at the same time tackle the problem of  overpopulation.    Steensgaard: The world's biggest environmental  problem--that is the others?    Moller: The Third World is very frightened of our  ecoimperialism. The fact that we come to them and say: You must  fix the rain forest. You must not cut the few trees that prevent  the desert from expanding--sure, thanks for the advice. But then  they cannot survive. Consequently, it is necessary for both  parties to understand that they are the ones doing injury. The  Third World may not lean back and say: You have created all of  the environmental problems, as you use 40 times as much energy  as we do. It is you who are overpopulated.    There is no reason for the rich countries to be too  complacent, Moller feels. We put major hindrances in the way of  the poor in every possible way: We invent fanciful trade  barriers to keep their goods out. We demand huge sums in  interest and fees on loans. And we shut our labor market off so  that they cannot come up here and earn money to live on. There  is no sign that things are moving in the right direction.    That is the most disheartening thing. We bring home more  money from the poor nations in interest on loans than we send  down there. The GATT negotiations are still not successful, and  with all our trade barriers, we chain them to poverty. The West  still does not give even 1 percent of its money to the  developing nations. But the fact is we have a choice: Either we  purchase their goods, or else, we will need to employ them here,  and that is something we do not desire either. My joyous message  is that it is permissible to produce so as to promote growth,  but not to pollute. And that is something the Third World must  be part of.</p>

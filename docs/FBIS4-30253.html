			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporters Yi Chang-won, Kwon Kyong-on, and Pak </F> Sun-uk: "National Federation of University Student Councils  Plans To Send Delegation to Pyongyang"]    [Excerpts] Following the forcible stoppage of trains and  radical demonstrations by the Federation of University Student  Councils in Kwangju and South Cholla Province Area  [Namchongnyon], the National Federation of University Student  Councils [Hanchongnyon] is pushing ahead to send its delegation  to Pyongyang. This is timed to coincide with discussion of  holding a North-South summit and with the North Korean side's  pushing for a "15 August pannational meeting" as part of its  united front strategy. If Hanchongnyon sends a delegation to  Pyongyang, it will cause considerable disturbances to  North-South relations.    Hanchongnyon (chairman Kim Hyon-chun, president of General  Student Association of Pusan University) on 22 June announced  that "Hanchongnyon has been preparing to dispatch a delegation  to North Korea for two months in compliance with the proposal of  the joint secretariat in Berlin of the Pannational Alliance of  Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification  [Pomchonghangnyon]." Hanchongnyon also revealed that "since the  atmosphere for a North-South summit has ripened recently, the  decision to push for dispatching a delegation has been discussed  cautiously." It was learned that Hanchongnyon has discussed  in-depth the cancellation of sending its delegation to North  Korea in consideration of the situation, which has changed  significantly from last April, and criticism that its  delegation's North Korean visit might possibly hinder the  realization of a North-South summit.    Hanchongnyon revealed that in the event that it finally  decides to send a delegation to the North, it will dispatch Choe  Chang-nam (25, co-secretary of Pomchonghangnyon and a Seoul  National University student temporarily out of school) to North  Korea to call for the holding of a North-South summit at an  early date through talks with President Kim Il-song. As agenda  items for the summit, he will propose an early settlement of the  nuclear problem, methods for national reunification, and  formulation of a North-South commonwealth before the  reunification. Hanchongnyon is also pushing ahead with talks  between Kim Hyon-chun, Hanchongnyon's chairman sought by the  police, and President Kim Yong-sam, in which Kim Hyong-chu will  explain positions of Hanchongnyon to the president. [passage  omitted]    According to material from the prosecutor's office,  Pomchonghangnyon, where Choe Chang-nam is working as its  co-secretary, has three headquarters, including the South side's  headquarters, the North side's headquarters, and overseas  headquarters. Each headquarters has a congress (composed of 200  members); central committee (25 members), and joint secretariat  (5 members). The secretariat of Pomchonghangnyon is made up of  Pak Song-hui and Song Yong-song, the South side's delegates who  visited North Korea in 1991; Choe Kyong-chol, the North side's  delegate; and Cho Son-o and Hwang Yong-chi, delegates from  overseas headquarters who are living in Japan. Realizing that  the Pak Song-hui--Song Yong-song team is too weak, Hanchongnyon  additionally dispatched Choe Chang-nam to the secretariat.    A relevant official from the prosecutor's office revealed  that Pomchonghangnyon planned to hold a congress in Pyongyang  from 27 to 29 May, timed with Hanchongnyon's inauguration  ceremony, and to dispatch Choe Chang-nam to the North as the  South side's delegate. However, in the wake of Hanchongnyon's  inauguration ceremony, public law enforcement authorities  blocked Hanchongnyon's contact with the North side through  telephone and facsimile, and raised Hanchongnyon's nature as  benefiting the enemy. As a result, there is an unfavorable  attitude toward Hanchongnyon, and its congress has been  postponed until 15 August.    Choe Chang-nam left for Berlin without informing his parents  and friends and sent a letter to his parents in Kwangju on 4  November 1993, writing that "he will grandly launch the work for  national reunification," and informed them of his recent  activities, writing that "he is attending an educational  institute with Song Yong-sung to learn German."    Hearing about his son's visit to North Korea, Kim Si-u (58),  Choe's mother, said absent-mindedly that "all this would not  have happened if he did not go to the college. I hope he comes  home safely without visiting the North."</p>

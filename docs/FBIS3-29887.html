			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government announced on 21 February its plans  to fully invalidate the Korea Phantom Upgrade (KPU) project in  which the F-4E Phantoms were to be upgraded to improve Air Force  capabilities.    In this regard, the government is considering to use the  budget allocated for this project in other projects, including  the purchase of additional F-16s which is selected as the  next-generation fighter.    The government's policy is based on the judgment that the  project lost its meaning because the actual upgrading work of  the F-4E's has not been carried out properly up to now since the  KPU project began six years ago in 1988 and the F-16's will soon  be purchased and deployed in actual combat as the  next-generation fighter.    In addition, the technologies to be transferred from the  United States were considerably reduced and the project is  evaluated to be of little benefit to the development of the  domestic aerospace industry.    The KPU is an over 3 trillion-won project to upgrade some 40  F-4E's by the year 2010 at the cost of 80 billion won each. Two  upgraded test aircraft are expected to be deployed in 1995.    According to a high-ranking government official, the KPU was  suspended because the F-16's, which have been selected as the  next-generation fighter, will be delivered year by year and  deployed from October 1994, thus, the reinforcement of Air Force  capabilities will actually begin. A total of 120 F-16's will be  delivered by 1999 at the cost of 3.9 trillion won.    In the meantime, the government is studying ways to fully  compensate Samsung Aerospace for the 14 billion-won investment  it made for the KPU project.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Liffe bows out of US bond contracts THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is to suspend its US Treasury long-dated bond futures and options, due to low turnover in these contracts. The US Treasury market is the largest bond market in the world, but trading in US bonds and notes has become increasingly concentrated in US trading hours in recent years. 'No one needs the Liffe contracts any more,' said one trader. 'You either wait to do the business until the Chicago Board of Trade opens, or you use Globex.' The CBOT recorded an average daily volume of 293,000 contracts on the long bond future in April, while Globex, the after-hours electronic trading system developed by the CBOT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, traded just over 1,000 contracts per session. Meanwhile, Liffe's US bond futures, first listed in 1984, traded just two contracts in the whole of April. 'The writing was on the wall when the CBOT started to open at 1.20pm London time, instead of 2pm,' according to Mr Hugh Morshead, a director of GNI, the futures arm of Gerrard &amp; National. Because US economic data is released at 1.30pm UK time, London-based traders can position themselves in the futures market ahead of the economic news. While admitting that the US contracts 'had lost some volume' to Globex, Mr Daniel Hodson, chief executive of Liffe, attributed the lack of activity in Liffe's US Treasury bond futures and options to the general decrease in trading interest in dollar-denominated securities in the European time zone over the last five years. Traders said London-based firms were concentrating on European bond markets. Trading in Liffe's Eurodollar contract fell to less than 1,000 contracts a day in April, compared with more than 2,500 daily a year before, while volume on the Euromark contract has more than doubled in the past year. Meanwhile, Liffe is still in discussions with the CBOT about a possible cross-listing of products, including US Treasury note futures and options.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Revamped UK Estates cuts losses UK Estates, which changed its name from Sheafbank Property Trust in March following a financial restructuring, reported reduced pre-tax losses for the year to June 30 and said that dividends, halted in 1992, were likely to be resumed in the new year. Gross income improved to Pounds 2.89m (Pounds 805,000) including Pounds 1.64m from money broking; discussions for a management buy-out of the latter are under way and disposal would complete the group's withdrawal from financial services. Operating profits were Pounds 384,000 (Pounds 260,000). Net interest charges of Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 600,000) left the pre-tax loss at Pounds 650,000 (Pounds 1.76m). Losses per share were 2.58p (10.41p). March's reconstruction included a placing which more than doubled the equity base; shareholders' funds at end-June amounted to Pounds 16.6m, up from Pounds 6.45m a year earlier. Since the period-end the group has sold its Parkway industrial estate at Trafford Park, Manchester, for Pounds 3.6m, 20 per cent above valuation in February. This had underpinned the outcome according to Mr David Gradel, chairman, and would allow the resumption of dividends, starting with the preference distribution scheduled for January 1.</p>

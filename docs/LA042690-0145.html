			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL OKS LOAN PLEDGE FOR HOUSING PROJECT  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council committee Wednesday approved a $1.1-million loan  commitment for an 85-unit housing project near Lincoln Park in East Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Despite concerns by residents that the site contains toxic pollutants, the  council's Community Redevelopment and Housing Committee approved the loan after  a hydrogeologist who prepared the report testified that the cost for cleaning  the chemicals should amount to no more than $75,000.  </P> <P> More than 75 residents of the Hillside Village neighborhood urged the committee  to reject the loan agreement with Charo Community &amp; Resources Inc. because  of an environmental engineering report that revealed arsenic and hydrocarbon  contaminated soil on the site in the 4300 block of Valley Boulevard.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH JANICE;  </P> <P> THE REMATCH AT OAK TREE  </P> <P> I lost $50 on Friday when Wingless Flyer had his wings clipped in the second  race. I could blame my two-day slump on a lack of competition, but that would  be mean so I won't mention SURELOCK's race to bankruptcy.  </P> <P> So, today, I'm betting $50 to win and place on Shinko's Lass in the fifth and a  $25 show parlay from Chelsea's Pick in the second to Meadow's Interco in the  third to Summer Sale in the fourth to Shinko's Lass in the fifth to  Thisonesforyoumike in the sixth.  </P> <P> Janice Goldinger's Fri. bankroll: $2,070  </P> <P> Friday's Loss: $50  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $2,020  </P> <P> </P> <P> SURELOCK's bet for today is a $6 early triple, I Can Do That-Valiant Pete-Linda  Card.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SURELOCK's Fri. bankroll: $21  </P> <P> Friday's Loss: $9  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $12  </P> <P> Note: Janice Goldinger, a horse owner, does not bet on races her horses run in.  SURELOCK does not own horses.  </P> <P> Both players started with a $2,000 bankroll.  </P></p>

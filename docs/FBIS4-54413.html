			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- The time has come to  demand early parliamentary elections, since the results of the  last elections (held in June 1992) are, according to the  Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), steadily being  challenged, KSCM Deputy Chairman Zdenek Klanica told journalists  today.    The KSCM believes that after modification by the  parliamentary budgetary committee, the draft amendment to the  law on political parties, which is now being discussed in  parliament, entirely ignores the results of the June 1992  elections. KSCM Chairman Miroslav Grebenicek said that the  ruling right-wing parties, along with some opposition parties,  wanted the amendment to weaken mainly the KSCM. "Those who  support the amendment in its present form, will be well paid by  right-wing parties for their accommodating move," Grebenicek  added.    Vojtech Filip, a KSCM expert on legislation, criticized the  efforts to ban political parties from running any businesses,  and described them as attempts to impair the "constitutional  equality of all forms of property". Parties should be allowed  to at least edit and publish, Filip said.    He added he was convinced that the aim of the discussed  amendment was mainly to restrict funding of the KSCM and weaken  it in the forthcoming local and Senate elections.    Grebenicek said that in the elections, the KSCM would be  also  paralyzed by a ban on editing activities, as it would cause it  difficulties with the printing of advertisements during the  pre-election campaign. In contrast to this, the right-wing  parties would remain intact, as they "have a considerable  majority of the media at their disposal, and their  representatives have enough financial opportunities to publish  any documents," Grebenicek said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] NATO defence ministers said today that the deadline  for Serbs to withdraw their big guns from around Sarajevo by  midnight remained firm -- but they hoped air strikes would not  be needed.    Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind joined ministers from the  United States, France, Italy and Holland in issuing a statement  after meeting at Aviano air base in northeast Italy to assess  the situation in Sarajevo. They also heard air strike  contigency plans from NATO commanders.    The ministers were told that snow would prevent the Bosnian  Serbs from meeting the deadline in full. And Mr Rifkind said it  would take time to establish whether there had been compliance,  probably after the deadline. "It will not be possible to come  to the conclusion until after midnight," he said. "It will up  to those on the ground to advise as soon after midnight as is  physically possible as to whether they are satisfied compliance  has occurred or not occurred."    Their statement said: "It is the hope of the ministers that  the terms set by the NAC (North Atlantic Council) will be met  and that no air strikes will be necessary. However, they are  determined to support actions to end the slaughter of innocent  civilians in Sarajevo and to reinvigorate the peace  negotiations."    The statement said the ministers were confident that NATO  forces were "ready and able to carry out their mission" in  coordination with the UN "should that be necessary."    In Sarajevo, meanwhile, a senior UN officer said the Serbs  had withdrawn their guns to the extent that they could no longer  capture the city. And the UN commander in Bosnia,  Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, was optimistic that all the  artillery would be removed from the exclusion zone or be under  UN control by the deadline.    Later today, Mr Rifkind was expected to fly on to Gioia del  Colle from where British strike aircraft would be deployed if UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali were to give the go-ahead  to bomb.    Meanwhile, a unit of 60 British soldiers -- men of the 1st  and 3rd Royal Horse Artillery -- was today preparing to take up  positions in Sarajevo with their five Cymbeline radars,  sophisticated equipment which can pinpoint artillery and missile  launch sites to within 10 yards.    Major Peter Wright, 32, regiment spokesman, said: "They are  good troops, well trained. They have really put their backs  into getting ready. The spirit is very good and they're all  raring to go. They're delighted to be going out. The situation  out there is likely to be quite confused, judging by news  leaking back."</p>

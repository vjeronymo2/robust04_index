			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Norway No to EU opinion polls predict Two election day opinion polls last night predicted that Norway had rejected membership of the European Union in a national referendum yesterday, but the outcome was expected to be close. One poll on the state NRK television network forecast a 52.6 per cent majority for the No side, while a survey for the commercial station TV2 predicted a slim No victory with a majority of 50.2 per cent. Both sides said the surveys were not conclusive pointers, and the results in favour of the No campaign came despite expectations of a late swing towards the Yes side. Officials said turnout had been high among the 3.6m voters, despite blizzards in the north. They said it could reach 85 per cent, which would be the biggest participation in any Norwegian vote since 1965. Both camps claimed high turnout was crucial to their chances of victory. Norway is the last of four countries from the European Free Trade Association, due to expand the EU to 16 members next year, to hold a referendum on the issue. Austria, Finland and Sweden have voted to join. After Sweden approved membership earlier this month, the Yes side began making gains as the Labour government, led by Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister, urged Norwegians not to leave the country isolated. Mrs Brundtland has made the reversal of Norway's rejection of membership of the European Economic Community in 1972 her central goal over the past four years. Despite the traditional reluctance of Norwegians to embrace Brussels - many fear it will erode the country's independence and control of petroleum and other natural resources - Mrs Brundtland has sought to persuade the nation that, after the Cold War, Norway must playa full part in Europe's political and economic mainstream. The government faces a problem in the event of a narrow Yes victory. The opposition Centre party and Socialist Left party, the leaders of the No campaign, have threatened to block ratification of EU entry in parliament unless a large majority is in favour. Mrs Brundtland has suggested she will dissolve parliament and call new elections if that happened.</p>

Recently, Jinan labor market in the capital city of Fuzhou,  the largest labour market in Fujian, celebrated its success in  finding the 10,000th job since 1992.    Sample statistics show that there are now more than 300  job-finding agencies in the province, which have found jobs for  more than a million people.    In contrast, job-finding agencies were unknown in China  before it initiated its market economic reform in the early  1980s. People were then allocated jobs instead of finding them  and had little freedom of choice.    The year 1988 saw the establishment of the Fujian Company of  Talent Development and Service of the provincial personnel  bureau, the first job-finding agency in the province. Over the  past five years, it has found jobs for thousands of job seekers,  including returned students from overseas.    The majority of the job-finding agencies are sponsored by  labor departments. By June 1993 some 255 such agencies had been  so sponsored. The markets play an important role in the  distribution of labor resources.    The job seekers in the markets have to show their I.D. cards  and other relevant certificates and the markets have a list of  employers and job-seekers, to match them up. The agency is paid  both by the employer and the job-seeker.    In the second half of last year, the provincial government  decided to give greater support to non-governmental bodies and  individuals in opening job-finding agencies.    The decision gave a boost to the prosperous service.    in quanzhou, a coastal city where the non-state-run economy  dominates, 93 job-finding agencies had been set up by the end of  last year.    At present, nearly a million laborers needed by the  foreign-funded, township and private-run enterprises in the city  come mainly from the labor markets.</p>

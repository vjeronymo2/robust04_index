			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / An Internet for business users: IBM sees global networking as the new trend in IT International Business Machines has put global networking to the fore. The US computer company is setting up business units for networking services and applications, signalling its intention to leap-frog competitors in what it believes is a new trend in information technology. 'Network-centric computing will be the next big thing in information technology,' says Mr James Cannavino, IBM senior vice-president of strategy and development. Like previous shifts from centralised data processing to desktop computing in the 1980s and later to distributed computing, the trend to network-orientated computing could shape the industry for years to come, IBM believes. It sees this change as an opportunity to reassert its competitiveness, and is moving quickly to avoid a repetition of its failure to keep pace with market trends such as the shift to client-server computing. The 'IBM Global Network' business unit will pull together the activities of its networking services groups around the world. The new group will initially offer voice and data services for business-to-business communications. IBM already provides data network services in about 700 large cities around the world. These networks are being linked to provide worldwide communications capabilities. IBM sees its networks as a platform for a broad range of services. Today, most information processing applications are based on a company's computers - word-processing on desktop computers or payroll processing on a mainframe computer, for example. Increasingly, however, networks provide generic services such as electronic mail and Mr Cannavino maintains that more sophisticated and customised applications will be provided via networks. 'The computing environment of the future is one where networks will do much more than transport information. It is one where applications and services are embedded in high-speed voice and data networks. In IBM's vision of network-centric computing, users have access to information anytime, anywhere, in the form that they want.' For example, 'intelligent agents' will be a boon for office computer users and consumers. These are programs which can search for information on databases linked to a network and automatically sort and deliver such information to pre-arranged computer addresses. In the workplace, intelligent agents might perform different kinds of searches. 'They will enable you to follow up ideas - things that you don't have time to do yourself,' says Mr Cannavino. With such network applications 'you can create very powerful new mechanisms for increasing business and personal productivity'. IBM's recently formed Network Applications Services division will create applications such as directory services, electronic marketing, trading and shopping for networks. In addition, IBM's new vertical market groups will develop network applications for specific industries. In the public domain, the Internet has demonstrated the value and popularity of global computer links, with millions of computer users subscribing to services providing Internet connections. The IBM Global Network will become 'the business person's Internet', says IBM. It says it will provide ubiquitous access like the Internet without the shortcomings, such as lack of security. But IBM is not alone in seeing the potential of high-speed multimedia networks and is likely to face competition from telecoms and cable TV companies as well as traditional rivals. Mr Cannavino concedes that the telecoms and computer industries appear to be on a collision course as each moves into the other's traditional territory. He maintains, however, that IBM approaches this market with the benefit of experience in data processing. Moreover, unlike the telephone companies IBM does not aim to build a vast physical network infrastructure. Instead, IBM will focus on providing information services via its own and other networks. 'Are we itching for a fight with AT&amp;T? No, but we are not going to run away either,' says Mr Cannavino.</p>

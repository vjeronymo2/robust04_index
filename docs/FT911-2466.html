			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Money Markets: An optimistic tone SHORT STERLING futures rose on Liffe and wholesaleinterest rates eased in London as optimism increased about another cut in UK bank base rates. This view was not encouraged by the Bank of England however. The central bank took out the full underlying credit shortage on the money market, but not until late in the day, tending to keep the short end tight. Traders on Liffe pointed out that before yesterday's move June short sterling was discounting no more than a cut of 1/2 point in base rates over the next six week's. But a weak UK economy and speculation about an early general election point towards the possibility of more. Thursday's local government elections are expected to provide important guidance on the timing of a general election. June short sterling opened firmer at 88.66. This was also the day's low, with the contract moving outside its recent tight range, to touch a peak of 88.76 before closing 88.75 against 88.62 previously. Three-month interbank eased to 11 13/16 -11 from 11 7/8 -11 3/4 per cent, with 12-month money quoted at 11 11/32 -11 5/16 against11 7/16 -11 5/16 per cent. The Bank of England initially forecast a day-to-day credit shortage of Pounds 700m, but revised this to Pounds 650m at noon and back to Pounds 700min the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 767m was provided. Before lunch the authorities bought only Pounds 85m bills outright, by way of Pounds 21m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 64m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon another Pounds 317m bills were purchased, via Pounds 242m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 75m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Late help of around Pounds 365m was also provided. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,401m, with bank balances below target absorbing Pounds 135m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 265m to liquidity and a fall in the note circulation of Pounds 570m. In Frankfurt call money was steady at 8.95 per cent, waiting for the result of this week's securities repurchase agreement tender by the Bundesbank. A two-tranche tender has been set, with 34-day money available at an unchanged fixed rate of 8.60 per cent and 62-day funds on offer at variable bid rates.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring plans halve Beauford shares SHARES IN Beauford, the manufacturer of material handling equipment and machine tools, halved to 7p yesterday after the announcement of a capital reorganisation. The company is proposing to split its 10p ordinary shares into one 1p ordinary and nine 1p deferred shares. The 7p convertible preference shares will be converted into four ordinary and six deferred shares and all arrears of the preference dividend will be eliminated. The deferred are considered valueless and application to cancel them will be made as soon as possible. The plans would leave preference holders with 86.9 per cent of the new capital as against 44.2 per cent under the existing conversion rights. Beauford warned that without the restructuring there would be limited scope for future development. The company reported losses in 1991 and the first half of 1992. In September 1992, after the sale of its interest in EW Bliss, borrowings were Pounds 13.3m against net assets of Pounds 7.3m. By the end of the year borrowings had fallen to Pounds 11.7m but the company expected to have to make substantial write-downs in the value of its assets and make provisions for restructuring costs in the accounts for the year. Gearing is considered too high and a debt reduction plan in conjunction with the company's banks is being pursued. It has not paid preference dividends since July 1991, leaving arrears at January 1 of Pounds 1.9m, or ordinary dividends since November 1991. Taking into account the trading and financial position the board thinks that there is no prospect of paying the arrears or resuming dividend payments of the preferential shares in the foreseeable future. In addition, the ability to redeem the preference shares by July 1 2003 would require an extraordinary and sustained improvement in the trading performance throughout the period to redemption.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (16): Smaller but more powerful - Printers, concerned about scale THE trend to downsizing where applications previously carried out on a mainframe can now often be done on a mini; and the power that one expected from a mini now being available in today's top of the range PCs is having a profound effect on the market for printers. On the one hand, advanced features and performance is required and yet, at the same time, the market will not bear prices which appear to be out of all relationship with the falling prices of the PCs to which the devices will be connected. Some users want colour, others need improved quality such as higher resolution (in dots per inch) while many departments need to handle multi-part forms. Furthermore, a growing proportion of users need a graphics capability to handle a variety of text fonts and sizes as well as charts and more complex images. This is a facility which is widely available, especially in the non-impact page printers. One long-felt business need is colour to enable, for example, profits/losses to be more readily seen in a spreadsheet. The simplest way of achieving this is to use a printer with a two-colour ribbon as was used in a manual typewriter. Where this would be too slow, colour ink jet and thermal transfer printers come into their own. 'The market for high quality colour printers is one which, until now, has been supplied with high priced machines,' says Mr Richard Bright of Mannesmann Tally, printer manufacturer. 'By introducing a sub-Pounds 2,000 thermal transfer page printer we have significantly reduced the cost of colour page printing, without sacrificing print quality. What was a specialist piece of equipment is now available to general business users.' According to BIS CAP International the European colour printer market is set to expand from 170,000 units in 1990 to 500,000 in 1994 and will be worth about Dollars 1.3bn by 1994. The UK printer market is likely to grow from 45,000 units in 1990 to 180,000 in 1994. It will be worth Dollars 400m by 1994. While, no doubt, some of this growth will come from normal business users, a growing proportion will be in computer-aided design (CAD) and desktop publishing where users will be able to get a colour representation of their documents before going out to print in high volume. The widely-used laser printer with its 300 x 300 dots per inch (DPI) resolution is frequently not considered adequate for DTP. Hence, once the work has been completed on the Macintosh (or PC), the actual camera-ready artwork is prepared on a higher resolution printer often of more than 1,000 DPI. Bridging the two markets is the Qume CrystalPrint Express. Not only does this 12 page per minute (appreciably faster than the average laser printer) provide 600 x 300 resolution which is adequate for many applications it incorporates a number of interfaces (including AppleTalk) and emulations which together offer the compatibility required when the printer is a 'shared resource' on a local area network (LAN). Also vying for this market are other versatile printers such as the Kodak Ektaplus 7016 and the HP Laserjet III Si from Hewlett-Packard, the market leader in the non-impact market. While both of these are 16 pages per minute (PPM) the former incorporates a 6 PPM photocopier 'designed for those simple one or two copies tasks common in the busy office environment thus increasing productivity by reducing waiting time at the photocopier'. The latter, using HP's resolution enhancement technology together with microfine toner, is claimed to give resolution akin to that of a 600 DPI printer. One of its options is that it can have a direct high-speed connection to a LAN, such as Novell, so obviating the need for a separate PC as a printer-server. This is far more cost-effective than with many networked printers. Laser and ink jet printers are 'non-impact' unlike dot-matrix machines which tend to have a low-tech image and are often derided for their lower quality and high noise level. In spite of this they are the workhorses of industry and commerce and are able to handle multi-part forms which the other technologies cannot handle. According to Romtec, the market analyst, for those reasons plus cost they still account for 57 per cent of the UK market with laser and inkjet holding for 27 and 11.7 per cent respectively. For example, Epson which tends to be identified as the world's predominant supplier of dot matrix printers (in spite of claiming to take a growing share of the non-impact market) produces both general purpose and specialised products. A good example of the latter is its DFX-1000. This is a heavy duty system printer which will handle high-speed printing of multi-part forms at up to 300 lines per minute making it, they believe, the fastest serial impact printer in the world. However, Romtec also reports that, during the fourth quarter of 1990, Epson and Hewlett-Packard had 29.2 and 23.6 per cent respectively of the printer sales (in units) to business end users via dealers, distributors. Retailers direct sales by the manufacturers only accounted for a very small proportion. But, as the Epson business is largely in the lower-cost dot matrix market, the value of HP's sales is higher. The dot matrix market is facing tough competition - especially from inkjet printers - as users become more conscience of the image that their own printed output creates. Ms Nicky Ayre, product manager at HP says the Deskjet HP DJ500 is 'the better alternative to the dot matrix and that there is no longer a price-penalty to pay for higher quality'. She says HP is focusing on the higher quality that is being expected by the discerning users. The HP DJ500 is ideal as a personal printer where the requirement is for about 50 pages per day and is increasingly being installed in people's homes. It can be seen that there is no universal requirement. As a result, the variety of printers continues to grow. Unfortunately, it is not easy to find the collection of features that are needed at an affordable price.</p>

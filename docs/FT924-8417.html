			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Economic war ECONOMIC POLICY must come first, says Mr Bill Clinton, the US president-elect. To prove the point, he has promised to create an economic security council on the model of the national security council. Since economic insecurity can hardly be desirable, who could possibly object to the idea? But things are not that simple. Mr Clinton may harbour the dangerous notion that the US is engaged in economic warfare with 'enemies' such as Japan and the European Community. What the economic security council would do remains obscure. Mr Vernon Jordan, chairman of his transition team, has said that Mr Clinton himself intends to chair the new council. Since Mr Clinton has also said that he will focus on the economy 'like a laser beam', the council is presumably intended to ensure presidential leverage over economic policy, along with greater co-ordination of its disparate elements. So far, so harmless, though it should be noted that the proposed council may not improve co-ordination. The tensions between the national security adviser and the secretary of state in previous administrations need only be recalled. More worrying are the connotations of the title. It might mean a greater focus on domestic problems. But it might also mean that Mr Clinton views economic policy as a war fought by peaceful means. If so, the idea would be more than wrong. It could prove dangerously wrong. Economic intercourse among market economies is not war. The foreigners with whom Americans do business are their customers and suppliers, as well as their competitors. The Americans who are presumably to be mobilised for the fray are one another's competitors, not just fellow citizens. Economic life is far more complicated than suggested by the myths of economic nationalists. Nor can a people can be mobilised for economic war, as American troops were mobilised for the desert. When Americans go to work, they do so for themselves, not for their country. Moreover, foreigners are not responsible for making the American savings rate the lowest among leading industrial countries or for impairing their performance at school. Pursuit of the goal of 'economic security' might, in fact, be used to justify the search for foreign scapegoats. But nobody would gain from such a strategy. Superior co-ordination of economic policy would be one thing; an American ministry for mercantilism quite another. Clarification is urgently needed from Mr Clinton.</p>

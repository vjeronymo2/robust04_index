			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: LIG back in black with Pounds 1m - A 'meaningful' final dividend forecast if recovery continues London International Group, the condoms and gloves manufacturer, yesterday heralded a return to the dividend list as it swung back into the black with interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 1m, against losses of Pounds 5.1m last time. Mr Nick Hodges, chief executive, said LIG intended to pay a meaningful final dividend if progress achieved in the first half continued. 'It will not be a nominal dividend,' he said, 'but nor will we be looking to return to the levels of previous years.' Dividends in future would be covered at least twice by earnings. LIG came close to collapse last year as a result of its disastrous foray into photo processing, a business which has since been sold. In the year to March, the company incurred losses of Pounds 174m. It was then forced to call on shareholders for Pounds 115m to repair the balance sheet. Mr Hodges said LIG was not yet out of the woods. While the right steps had been taken, he said, 'we now have to prove that we can grow the business organically and deliver the profits everyone is expecting of us'. LIG's return to profit in the first half showed it had made good progress, Mr Hodges said. Costs had been cut, with staff numbers down from 10,250 to 4,360, and operating cashflow had improved. LIG was on track to achieve net margins of about 15 per cent by 1996. Operating profits for the six months to September 30 had also almost doubled from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 4.7m. Sales fell by 18 per cent from Pounds 197.1m to Pounds 161.4m because of the sale of the photo business. Excluding discontinued businesses, sales rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 130m. At the pre-tax level, profits were helped by a Pounds 1.6m drop in interest charges to Pounds 5.9m and the exceptional Pounds 2.2m gain on the sale of the Wright's Coal Tar Soap business. The condoms business grew 10 per cent in the first half. LIG reversed a long-term decline in the US by adding 1 percentage point to its market share, giving it 24 per cent. Mr Hodges was optimistic of further progress after the launch of the new Avanti condom, made of polyurethane. The surgical gloves division improved sales by about 31 per cent. Gearing fell from 137 per cent at the-year end to 69 per cent. Earnings per share were 0.32p, against losses last time of 3.93p. The shares closed 5p ahead at 85p. COMMENT This appears to be the turning point for a company that has had somewhat of a rollercoaster ride over the last year. Management is taking all the right steps and the value of the core businesses is beginning to show through. The question now will be whether LIG can fund the promotion of its strong brands internationally. If it cannot, then with a share price still a long way from last year's 272p it is vulnerable to takeover. These results, however, may be the first indication that LIG should be given the chance to go it alone. Forecasts are for between Pounds 13m and Pounds 15m this year, with an equally wide dividend range of 0.5p to 1p. On the low-end p/e of 33 times this is still only a stock for the risk-takers. However, those already in might want to hang on for what could be an interesting ride.</p>

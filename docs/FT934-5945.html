			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / General strike paralyses Belgium: Nationwide stoppage aims at reversing new austerity plan Belgium yesterday was brought to a virtual standstill by a one-day general strike - the first for 58 years - aimed at rolling back the austerity plan announced last week by the Christian Democrat-Socialist coalition government. The action comes after localised strikes launched by the two main trade unions on November 15 and 24. It is is the first general strike in Belgium since 1936, when workers halted the country to demand a week's paid holiday a year. The two main targets of the unions are a BFr75bn (Pounds 1.4bn) cut in forecast social security expenditure and a pay increase limit of 2 per cent for the next three years, which amounts to a freeze on wages once inflation is taken into account. The public sector was almost totally paralysed yesterday, with the railways, post office, and schools all mostly shut down, and skeleton staffing of hospitals. Most large private industry was at a halt. In Namur and Liege, even the police came out in sympathy. Sabena, the struggling national airline, claimed two thirds of its employees were at work and reported delays but only two cancellations because of fog. The port of Antwerp was at a standstill, according to the Belga news agency. This was partly the result of effective use of flying pickets, which kept such companies as BASF, Bayer, and General Motors closed, and early yesterday blocked traffic using the southern approaches to Brussels. The Belgian employers' federation put the cost of this week's strikes at BFr12bn, which they said was equivalent to 11,000 jobs over a year. The BFr75bn saving, achieved by making eligibility for items such as child allowances dependent on income levels, is intended to keep the social security budget in balance. Had the government of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene not made it, officials and economists expected renewed pressures on the Belgian franc, because of the budget deficit of over 6 per cent and unsustainable public debt equivalent to 130 per cent of national output. The franc, which shadows the D-Mark, has been severely tested by the markets since the August 2 European Union decision to float currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism within wide bands. The wage freeze was as far as the centre-left coalition could go without risk of collapse, even though leading economists point out that pay has increased much faster than productivity over the past three years. The unions and, initially, the Socialist members of the government wanted to offset the cuts and the wage freeze by increases in property tax and withholding tax on investment income. Mr Dehaene has offered to meet the unions but shows no signs of backing away from the austerity package.</p>

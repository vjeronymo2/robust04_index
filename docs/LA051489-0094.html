			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ALLEGATIONS AGAINST JUDGE WHO OFFENDED GAYS MADE PUBLIC  </P> <P> The state Commission on Judicial Conduct has made public allegations against a  state judge who enraged gay activists and civil rights groups with his remarks  about homosexuals.  </P> <P> After a court hearing Thursday, lawyers for District Judge Jack Hampton and the  commission said they had agreed to release the contents of "formal proceedings"  sparked by more than 2,000 complaints against the judge.  </P> <P> The allegations cite comments Hampton made in December to the Dallas Times  Herald and the Associated Press, and remarks court personnel in Hampton's  office allegedly made to callers protesting the judge's statements.  </P> <P> Hampton told the newspaper that he gave a lighter sentence to convicted killer  Richard Bednarski, 18, partly because his two victims were "queers."  </P> <P> The commission charges allege that Hampton's remarks violated the Code of  Judicial Conduct, which prohibits a judge from publicly commenting on a pending  case. Hampton is also charged with violating the code that requires a judge to  conduct himself in a manner that promotes public confidence in the impartiality  of the judiciary.  </P> <P> Bednarski was convicted of killing Tommy Trimble, 34, and John Griffin, 27, and  was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He could have received a maximum life  sentence.  </P> <P> "I do not care much for queers cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys,"  Hampton told the Times Herald. "I've got a teen-age boy."  </P> <P> The same day that was published, he told AP Network News: "The victims were  homosexuals. They were out in the homosexual area picking up teen-age boys. Had  they not been out there trying to spread AIDS around, they'd still be alive  today."  </P></p>

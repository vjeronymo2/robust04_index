			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Philby's belongings to be auctioned British master spy Kim Philby, who betrayed western intelligence to the Kremlin for 30 years, narrowly missed exposure as a committed communist, documents to be auctioned on Tuesday show. Books, papers and personal belongings of Philby, who died in 1988 in Moscow aged 76, are expected to fetch up to Pounds 90,000 for his widow Rufina at a London auction by Sotheby's. One of the 128 lots includes Philby's trade union pass from an early trip to Austria and papers documenting his links with the Viennese Socialist Society, which would have raised suspicions if they had been discovered by British intelligence. Philby, part of a spy ring formed by leftwing Cambridge University intellectuals in the 1930s, became a double agent working for British intelligence and supplying military secrets to the former Soviet Union. Named as 'The Third Man' after suspected traitors Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean fled to the Soviet Union in 1951, Philby himself fled to Moscow in 1963, when he was on the verge of being exposed. Sotheby's had second thoughts about the good taste of selling Philby's homburg hat, his ties, cufflinks and cocktail shaker which are now to be sold privately, art experts said. It is offering a collection of about 50 photographs, including one of Philby and Markus Wolf, the famous head of East German intelligence. His wallet, containing a press clipping from Izvestia announcing his defection, is also for sale. There are many KGB tributes to him, as well as a trophy for his 75th birthday depicting a globe circled by a Soviet spy satellite with a hammer and sickle shield behind.</p>

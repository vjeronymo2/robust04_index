You will recall that after  the concept of the constitution was adopted, I first made a  speech when the constitution was submitted for nationwide  discussion for the first time and then the second speech was  made by Ivan Stepanovich Plyushch. Thus, according to the  constitution, three speeches were made: one on the concept, and  two on the draft of the constitution itself. Thus, we may say  that the Supreme Council and the commission on elaborating the  new constitution which it created worked actively for two years.  A large number of proposals were received. Some of them were  taken into account and more than 2,000 proposals were received  after it was published. If one were to give a short description  of them, they relate to the problems of organizing power and  most of them relate to the problem of the territorial  organization of power and local self-government.    The main aim of preparing the adoption of documents which we  are now discussing lies in the urgency of improving and  stabilizing the system of organizing power that is naturally an  indivisible condition for further political and economic reforms  in Ukraine: the creation of a stable legal basis for the  activity of the Supreme Council of the new convocation and other  bodies of power, and the speeding up of the constitutional  process and finalizing work on the new constitution of Ukraine.  The form of the adoption of this document by means of a  referendum establishes firm legal foundations for the legitimate  and evolutionary process of organizing power structures, holding  it with the agreement of the highest bearer of power: the people  of Ukraine. Without doubt this will become an important  condition of accord, social peace, and partnership in our  society.    Other ways of resolving constitutional issues were examined  at an extended session of the constitutional commission. In  particular the talk was about the possibility of working out a  mechanism for elaborating the draft new constitution of Ukraine  and submitting it as a whole to a referendum. The talk was  about the possibility of the Supreme Council again directly  adopting a constitution and about a Ukraine-wide referendum  adopting a prepared draft law on the organization of authority  in Ukraine. Documents were submitted, I repeat, on all of these  aspects, and were discussed. But it was agreed that the most  legitimate and productive path is for the Supreme Council to  approve the basis for constitutional principles and for it to be  submitted to a referendum.    And now briefly about the content of the document submitted:  It is based on principles determined by the Declaration of State  Sovereignty of Ukraine and on the corresponding principles of  the new draft constitution of Ukraine, which, as has already  been said here, have been frequently examined in this hall. The  fundamental constitutional clauses contain guiding principles  and powers and mechanisms of restraint and counterbalance, which  make it possible to create an efficient system of organizing  state authority and local self-government.    It is also important that they provide answers to questions,  which people's deputies and representatives of local bodies of  authority are proposing and have proposed be put to the  referendum in a separate bloc. That is, questions on  constitutional order, on the form of state government, and on  the territorial organization of power and local self-government.  That is, this document, in our opinion, resolves the  fundamental issue as a whole. It does not tear them away from  the general political and state context and does not create an  atmosphere of social tension in society.    The substance of the fundamental constitutional clauses  gives  grounds for determining a democratic, lawful, and social nature  of the state and social order, where universal values are  determined without any "-isms"; the priority of human rights and  freedoms are also determined this way, as are political,  economic, and ideological variety and equal protection for all  forms of ownership in a socially oriented market economy. The  fundamental clauses establish elements of the form of government  that are the most acceptable under current conditions by  determining the authority of the branches of power, and these  clauses determine the territorial system and territorial  organization of power, specifically unitary decentralized power.    As you see, the document is composed of seven chapters, the  first of which deals with the general basis of the organization  of state power and local self-government, proceeding in  particular from the principles of democracy, the supremacy of  law, and the division of state power into its legislative,  executive, and judicial branches. These principles are further  developed and enforcibly realized in the draft's further  chapters.    The second, third, fourth, and fifth chapters contain the  main provisions on the status, plenary powers, functional mutual  relations, and organization of central branches and  establishments of state legislative, executive, and judicial  power, as well as the plenary powers of the Ukrainian president.    The second chapter emphasizes that the people exercise  legislative power by way of an all-Ukrainian referendum and that  the only body of legislative power, that functions permanently,  is the Supreme Council of the Ukrainian parliament. Also  determined here are the main legislative, institutional  supervisory functions, and plenary powers of the Supreme  Council, its capabilities in respect of the operation of  budgetary and taxation policies, appointment, and election of  the president, and his impeachment, formation of the government,  etc.    The draft's third chapter establishes the status of the  Ukrainian president as the head of state, who is removed from  the system of executive power and placed with various branches  of power, acting in relation to all of them as a guarantor to  ensure that the Constitution of Ukraine is abided by, human and  civic rights and freedoms are complied with and state unity,  sovereignty, and the national security and territorial integrity  of Ukraine are preserved. It is in connection with this that  the relevant functions and plenary powers are also vested in the  president.    The fourth chapter defines the system of executive power in  Ukraine and the status of the supreme organ of state executive  power, the Cabinet of Ministers, that is accountable and  responsible to the Supreme Council and is under the Ukrainian  president's control. The preparation of this chapter was based  on the need to raise the level of the government's independence  and strengthen executive power and discipline at every level in  all.    The fifth chapter, as you see, is on the subject of an  authoritative system of judicial power.    A separate provision in the draft's sixth chapter is on the  territorial reorganization of power and local self-government.  It is about this, as has already been said, that discussions  were particularly acute. This chapter's agreed version proceeds  from the direction of the territorial organization of power and  local self-government toward uniting state, regional, and local  interests under the unitary decentralized construction of a  single system of Ukraine's territorial structure.    This is particularly pressing because of the situation which  today surrounds the Crimean issue. It is completely  understandable that it cannot be further left undefined. That  is why section six outlines the status of the Crimean Republic  on the principles of autonomy, of Kiev as the capital of  Ukraine, and Sevastopol as a city that has a general state  significance, bodies of state power of the Crimean Republic, and  bodies of local self-government. Local interests will be  represented by heads of oblast, rayon, and town and village  councils that will be directly elected by the population and  will be headed officially by the executive bodies of the  appropriate councils. In order to avoid centrifugal and  separatist tendencies and also with the aim of strengthening  executive discipline on issues of powers delegated by the state,  they will be answerable to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.  In the event of a blatant violation of Ukraine's constitution  or legislative acts they may be removed from their posts.    Cases are envisaged when the powers of the Supreme Council  of  the Crimean Republic and also of respective local councils may  be terminated ahead of time by Ukraine's Supreme Council. This  relates to the adoption of decisions directed at violating the  territorial integrity of Ukraine, an arbitrary change in its  state territorial system, the blatant violation of Ukraine's  Constitution and laws, and not bringing their own decisions in  line with them.    The draft's final seventh chapter points out that this  document lays the foundation of the completion of work on  Ukraine's new constitution and that the organs of state power  and local self-government across the whole territory of Ukraine  are formed after the fundamental constitutional provisions are  brought into effect, which is quite essential in order to  understand and overcome the differences between the current  constitution and this document which will be implemented as  relevant laws are worked out and Ukraine's new constitution is  adopted.    As for the possibility of the issues of state symbols,  citizenship, linguistic policy, and so on being included in the  fundamental constitutional provisions, this was the subject of  every session. All of them are undoubtedly very important and  of consequence and cannot be ignored. We all very well know,  however, that there is no uniform perception of them today in  various regions of Ukraine. Including them in the fundamental  provisions and putting them up for a referendum -- on top of all  this at the time of holding the elections -- can lead to  exacerbating the political struggle and further increasing  enmity in society. That is why raising these issues now is  inexpedient. They could well be settled either in a new  constitution or constitutional legislation which will be dealt  with by a newly-composed Supreme Council.    Since the fundamental constitutional provisions on the  reorganization of state power and local self-government in  Ukraine have also been appropriately approved, endorsed, and  recommended for a decision to be taken on them, with approval  given by the conference of councils at all levels, and are based  on the provisions of the draft new constitution of Ukraine, it  is proposed that a discussion should be held about them, that  changes and amendments, if any of course, should be introduced  and that then the decision drafted should be taken.    In view of this, we have every ground to propose this  document and include it in a referendum at the time of the  elections on 27 March 1994.    Esteemed People's Deputies: Here in this hall, fateful and  some of the most responsible decisions were made. I hope that,  its historical mission taken into consideration, the Supreme  Council today will, on the basis of its experience, open a new  page in the development of nation-building in Ukraine, of new  prospects, treating their electorate with great respect and  enabling them to make their conclusive pronouncement on the  organization of power in Ukraine. Thank you for attention.</p>

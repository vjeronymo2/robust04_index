			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Gold slips after stalling at Dollars 400 THE GOLD price slipped back towards the end of the week after twice failing to breach strong resistance at Dollars 400 a troy ounce. And it took the other precious metals with it. The attempts at the Dollars 400-an-ounce hurdle were made on Wednesday and Thursday and the first came closest to succeding, the price peaking at a post-Gulf War high of Dollars 399.50 an ounce. The following day's advance ran out of steam at Dollars 399.30 an ounce. Both failures prompted sharpish retreats and the second seemed to have knocked the stuffing out of the bull market. Further selling yesterday took the price down to Dollars 392.75 an ounce, and although that was still Dollars 2.75 up on the week dealers were generally in agreement that a nervously bearish tone had replaced the confidence that the market had maintained in recent weeks, even in the face of temporary setbacks. 'There weren't too many buyers around yesterday (Thursday) and those that were sold this morning,' one dealer told the Reuter news agency yesterday. Gold's ups and downs were shadowed by the other leading precious metals. Silver climbed to Dollars 5.08 1/2 an ounce before settling back to Dollars 5.03 1/2 , up 11 cents on the week, while the platinum price was fixed in London yesterday afternoon at Dollars 403 an ounce, down Dollars 5 on the day but still Dollars 8 up on the week. Palladium had been out-shining the other precious metals in recent weeks as its price was boosted to a four-year high in response to strong physical demand from Japanese and US electrical goods manufacturers and worries about Russian supplies. But some of the froth was skimmed off this week and the price was fixed yesterday at Dollars 135.75 an ounce, Dollars 10.25 below last Friday's peak. Like gold, the copper market has been chasing successive upside technical targets in recent weeks, in defiance of a fundamental picture that looks unequivocally bearish. Having broken resistance at Dollars 1,900 a tonne for the three months delivery position last week London Metal Exchange traders this week set their sights on the Dollars 2,000-a-tonne barrier. Apart from an options-related bear raid in mid-week, the traffic was all one-way until that goal was reached yesterday morning. But after forcing the price to Dollars 2,020 a tonne the buyers appeared to decide that enough was enough. Profit-taking set in as investors were reminded by a sharp rise in LME warehouse stocks that fundamentals had changed little since the market bottomed in April at Dollars 1,705 a tonne. Analysts are unanimous that supply will continue to outstrip demand this year and professions of concern about production problems at Chile's Codelco and labour contract negotiations in the US have a hollow ring. The technical nature of the latest bull move was underlined, moreover, by the fact that the New York market stopped short of the round figure of 90 cents a lb, while the LME pushed on to the even rounder figure of Dollars 2,000 a tonne, equivalent to 90.75 cents a lb. Other LME markets were weaker as economic gloom weighed down prices. Nickel prices hit six-year lows and lead prices seven-year lows. Sentiment deteriorated on the aluminium market in the continued absence of follow-up news from other producers following Aluminum Company of America's recent announcement of further big production cuts. Three months aluminium closed yesterday at Dollars 1,244.50 a tonne, down Dollars 18 on the week. The oil market was also in a decidedly downbeat mood. Concern about the possibility of the Iraq/UN talks in New York resulting in a one-off sale of Dollars 1.6bn-worth of crude to finance humanitarian aid put further pressure on a market that was already struggling under the weight of overproduction by other members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. At the London International Petroleum Exchange the nearby August delivery position dipped to Dollars 16.50 on Thursday, the lowest level for the nearby position since February 1991. It steadied slightly yesterday to reach Dollars 16.58 in late trading, but that was still 16 cents down on the week. At the renamed London Commodity Exchange robusta coffee futures put in the strongest performance since mid-May after being given a flying start by news of agreement over the weekend by Latin American producers to withhold 20 per cent of their exports from the start of October - although some analysts were dubious about the likely effectiveness of the scheme. And the market finished with its tail up as prices were given an extra lift yesterday by reports that frost was possible in Brazilian growing areas this weekend. The first factor helped to lift the September delivery position to Dollars 1,000 a tonne at one point, and the second encouraged the reversal of a subsequent fall. The price ended yesterday at Dollars 982 a tonne, up Dollars 54 on the week. After a quiet week cocoa futures moved up quite sharply yesterday, the September position closing at Pounds 764 a tonne, up Pounds 17 on the day. Dealers attributed the rise to good buying interest in New York, which allowed the market to break upside resistance. June turnover in the London cocoa market was up 84 per cent from the same month last year at 222,691 lots (10 tonnes each), the LCE announced this week. That helped to lifted overall LCE June turnover by 40 per cent to 337,513 lots.  --------------------------------------          LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS       (As at Thursday's close)  -------------------------------------- tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium  +2,650 to 1,903,725 Copper     +7,600 to   454,500 Lead         -225 to   261,375 Nickel       +996 to    90,804 Zinc       +4,250 to   701,725 Tin           +50 to    20,415  --------------------------------------</p>

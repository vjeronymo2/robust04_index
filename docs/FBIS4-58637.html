			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] A state of anxiety and mourning has spread  throughout the occupied Arab territories and a state of  rejection prevailed for the signing of the agreement  implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord. Cities, villages, and  townships in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip witnessed a  complete closure as a sign of rejection of the plans to  liquidate the Palestinian people's cause and squander their  legitimate national political rights. All this shows that the  Cairo agreement does not express this people's will and does not  fulfill their national and pan-Arab aspirations.    This agreement has come as a natural result of the Oslo  agreement which stipulates the perpetuation of the occupation,  and Israel maintaining its control over the occupied Arab  territories.    There is no doubt that the agreement to implement the  autonomy rule that Rabin and 'Arafat signed in Cairo yesterday  will have many complications, dangers, and harmful dimensions  for the Palestinian people and their cause, and will have  complex ramifications not only on the state of affairs in the  occupied Arab territories but also on the state of affairs in  the entire region. In addition to the fact that the self-rule  agreement does not give the Palestinians any prerogatives or  responsibilities in the fields of defense, foreign affairs, and  political affairs, it also makes the Palestinians dutybound to  protect the security of the Israeli settlers and others. It  also gives the Israelis the final say in deciding who who enters  and leaves the self-rule territories, stipulates that the  Israeli army will keep its complete control on the settlements,  and that instead of withdrawing, the Israeli forces will  redeploy and control roads, bridges, and passageways.    Looking at all this, one realizes that this agreement does  not in any way whatsoever constitute a step on the road to peace  but further complicates the peace process and saves Israel from  a burden under which it nearly collapsed in view of the  escalation of the intifadah. Many Israeli officials admit that  the signing of the self-rule agreement has guaranteed a partner  for Israel and for its security and that a security alliance has  been established between the PLO and Israel to confront and  terminate the intifadah.    By firmly and angrily rejecting the self-rule agreement, the  Palestinian people reaffirm that they will never give up the  goals for which they launched their intifadah against the  occupation to completely eliminate it from their occupied  territories. This is because they realize that any partial  solutions, phased settlements, or partial deals cannot but be in  the interest of Israel and its occupation and not in the  interest of their national rights and that of rergaining them.    All indications show that the wrath which spread throughout  the occupied Arab territories while 'Arafat was signing the  agreement is the best proof that Israel has dragged the  Palestinian party into potentially dire consequences and to more  concessions which first started with the Oslo agreement,  continued to be made over a period of seven months, and finally  resulted in a flimsy agreement that is not in the interest of  the peace process, that gave Israel many gains, particularly in  the security field, and that transformed the Palestinian police  force into tools to protect the occupation and the settlements.    We in Syria want just and comprehensive peace and have never  accepted and will never accept separate and amputated solutions.  We cooperated and will cooperate for the sake of such a peace.  Only a just and comprehensive solution will bring about a  viable peace that will be accepted by the people, that will  last, and that will safeguard the dignity and interests of all  the parties.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Blacks Leisure recovers to Pounds 928,000 Blacks Leisure Group, the camping, sports and fashion company,returned to profit with a pre-tax figure of Pounds 928,000 for the year ended February 26, against losses of Pounds 10.3m, which included Pounds 7.68m for goodwill already written off. The retail division performed well as an aggressive national marketing strategy pushed sales up 20 per cent to Pounds 45.2m (Pounds 37.7m). Retail operating profits rose to Pounds 2.7m, against losses of Pounds 991,000. Within the retail division, the Blacks Camping chain traded well. A new store was opened in Aberdeen and the company plans to open a further six this financial year. Turnover in the distribution division was down from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 15.1m, pushing down group turnover from Pounds 65.1m to Pounds 60.3m. Group operating profits from continuing operations rose to Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 9,000) on turnover of Pounds 58.5m (Pounds 53.6m). The distribution side incurred operating losses on continuing activities of Pounds 516,000 (Pounds 1.58m profits) on turnover of Pounds 13.4m (Pounds 15.9m). Mr Simon Bentley, chairman and chief executive, said a major cause of this fall in turnover was the deterioration in the performance of the company's Fila distribution operations. Although the American-designed sports fashion footwear remained popular in the US, there was a sharp drop in UK sales. The company has also had difficulties with its own soccer brand, Quaser. This reported a loss, mainly due to poor sales in the UK, which accounts for 60 per cent of sales. However, the brand continued to sell well in foreign markets. The board is recommending an unchanged final dividend of 1.5p per share, making a same-again total for the year of 2.25p. Earnings per share stood at 2.4p compared with losses of 31.8p.</p>

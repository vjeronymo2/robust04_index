			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / UK Gilts: Dealers adjust to rush of new issues GILT PRICES dipped at the long end, as the market adjusted to a rush of new gilt issues and last week's expected cut in UK base rates. However, with few indications that significant inflationary pressures will reappear over the next few months, the fundamental outlook for the securities appears strong. The gilt market will focus over the next few days on a spate of economic data related to the UK, in particular on inflation. The most frequently used measure of headline inflation is expected to show an increase for last month. However, other ways of examining price rises indicate that demand levels in the economy remain weak, in a conclusion that should sustain buying interest in gilts. Some gilt analysts disagree with this conclusion, pointing to relatively high increases in average earnings across the economy in recent months. Another worry for some economists is the high level of inflation as measured by the prices of services, in contrast to those of merchandise goods. However, last week concern on this score appeared muted. The main reason for the general softness in gilt prices was the effects felt by the market in digesting roughly Pounds 9.5bn worth of gilts issued by the Bank of England over the past five weeks. However, indicating some investors' preoccupation with inflation, the index-linked sector of the gilt market performed well. The 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock payable in 2016 saw a yield drop of 17 basis points (0.17 percentage points), with the bond yielding 4.55 per cent on Friday night. The overall lure of gilts to many investors was underlined by last week's absorption by the market of Pounds 1bn worth of gilts, made available by the Bank on Tuesday. That took the form of a Pounds 800m tranche of 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bonds maturing in 1997, and Pounds 200m of 2 1/2 per cent index linked stock payable in 2013. The Bank is also issuing today a further Pounds 200m of index-linked gilts, in the form of two equal tranches of 2 1/2 per cent Treasury stock. One of these tranches is due in 2011 and available at a price of 134 1/16 , and the second matures in 2016 and is being priced at 117 1/2 . Last week's cut in bank base rates - from 10.5 to 10 per cent - was well flagged in advance by the Bank. It led to a small fall in yields at the shorter end of the yield curve, while gilts with maturities beyond the 5-year range base experienced a yield increase of about 3 basis points, with a corresponding small fall in prices. As for inflation, attention will focus on the Central Statistical Office's release on Friday of the rise in the retail prices index in the year to April. This is expected to be some 4.4 per cent, as compared with 4 per cent in March. Much of the likely increase, however, can be explained by technical factors related to distortions in the RPI as measured in April 1991. According to an index constructed by Greenwell Montagu, underlying inflation, stripping out factors such as seasonal food and other distorting influences, is likely to measure 5.1 per cent in April, as opposed to 5.5 per cent in March. The gilt market will also fix its eyes on Thursday's figure for the underlying rise in average earnings across the economy in the year to March. There will be some disappointment if the figure fails to come down from February's 7.25 per cent year-on-year level.</p>

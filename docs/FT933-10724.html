			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Egyptian oil investment The International Egyptian Oil Company (IEOC), a subsidiary of Agip of Italy, will invest Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.54bn) in oil and gas development projects in Egypt over the next four years, the Middle East Economic Survey (Mees) reported yesterday, Reuter reports from Nicosia. The specialist newsletter quoted Mr Hamdi El-Banbi, Egyptian oil minister, as saying the new investments would be used for maintaining output levels from existing fields and developing new finds, especially gas. Mees said some of the main oil producing fields, operated by Petrobel, a joint venture between IEOC and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation, were ageing and needed maintenance work to increase recovery yields. Mees also reported that the return of Iraq to world oil markets would probably be delayed because of Baghdad's attempts to link oil talks with UN weapons negotiations. However, Iraq's resumption of oil exports was not totally ruled out, it added.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Observer: Intrepid Walker Get on the right side of Jack Walker, the Blackburn businessman who sold his steel stockholding business to British Steel for Pounds 330m, and he'll see you right. Yesterday, the 63-year-old Walker popped down to London on the way to watch his beloved Blackburn Rovers play at Norwich, and launched his latest adventure - a low-cost, high-security anti-fraud system called Datastrip. It's far too complicated to explain in this column but Ed Mallory, ex-Eastman Kodak and managing director of Datastrip, likens its potential impact to that of Microsoft, the computer software firm. Heady stuff. Walker, who already owns an airline, a lot of property and a football club, admits that he's no high-tech expert. However, he has known John Watt, one of Datastrip's founders, since the early 1970s, when Watt headed the Northern Ireland Finance Corporation and Walker was keen to provide the steel to build factories there. When Watt, now an expert on credit cards, suggested the idea, Walker had a 'gut feeling' that he was on to a winner. Given the size of his fortune, Walker could afford the punt. But less fortunate entrepreneurs, tired of trotting round timid venture capital firms, must wish there were more Jack Walkers around.</p>

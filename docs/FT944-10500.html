			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Quest for monetary credibility Sir, The Bank of England appears to have greater weight in the setting of interest rates, a change designed to enhance the 'credibility' of monetary policy in the UK ('Bank reports improved outlook on inflation', November 2). The search for 'credibility' also extends to the idea of a 'pre-emptive' rate rise, designed to tighten policy at an early stage in the inflation cycle. Ultimately, the success of the new policy regime will be judged by the path of inflation over the next few years, but one can also form an immediate impression by examining any change to inflation expectations wrought by the regime shift. Fortunately, a good proxy for expectations of future UK inflation is at hand, in the yield difference between nominal bond yields and the real yield as paid on index-linked stocks. Unfortunately, the evidence to date suggests the market has yet to be convinced that inflation is well and truly under control. The inflation rate implied by the current yield spread between index-linked and nominal bond yields is some 4.65 per cent, against 3.50 per cent in January. Moreover, this implied expectation is no different now from what it was on September 12 (the date of the first 'pre-emptive' tightening). Perhaps most worrisome of all for the Bank of England is that the level of inflation expectations is virtually twice that of its own forecast of 2.5 per cent. Presumably, true 'credibility' will have been achieved when the two forecasts coincide, ideally with the market expectation falling to meet that of the Bank.

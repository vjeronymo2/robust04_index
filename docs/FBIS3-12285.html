			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] 25 Feb, (SANA)--Nayif Hawatimah, the secretary  general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine  [DFLP] has denounced the massacre perpetrated by the Israeli  settlers in Hebron's Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn today. In a press  statement today, Hawatimah asserted that the crime will not go  unpunished. He said that withdrawal of occupation forces from  the occupied territory and giving the Palestinian people the  right of self-determination will put an end to the tampering of  the settlers and occupiers with Palestinian blood.    Earlier today, the DFLP called for general and comprehensive  strike in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and Jerusalem.    In a similar statement, Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid, the secretary  general of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, said that the  crime perpetrated by the Zionists in the Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn  today is one of the most grotesque crimes against civilians in  this age. The crime he said, is part of an Israeli scheme to  terrorize and expel our Palestinian people from the occupied  territory. He called on the UN Security Council and all world  states to take measures to ensure the Zionists will not commit  massacres against the Palestinian people.    The Palestinian Forces Alliance leadership has issued a  statement in which it denounced the mosque massacre and called  for escalating the intifadah against the occupiers and unify the  ranks of our people in and outside of the occupied territory to  confront the crimes of the occupation and the settlers.    The statement, which was issued following an emergency  meeting held by the alliance to discuss the massacre, appealed  to peoples of the world and international organizations and  establishments to put an end to the Zionist arrogance and the  settlers' recklessness and tampering with Palestinian blood.    The statement called for a general strike and national  mourning for the martyrs in the massacres and saluted the  steadfast people in the occupied territory who came out in  Hebron, Nazareth, and the Golan to confront the enemy forces.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Reform puts body into Cape wine industry - Trends towards quality and export marketing THE ANNOUNCEMENT last month of the abolition of the notorious quota system in the South African wine industry was only the latest symptom of an industry, literally, in a state of ferment. With South Africa's political isolation now over, local winemakers are anxious to reclaim the Cape's status as one of the world's leading wine-growing regions. During the 18th and 19th centuries Constantia desert wines were favoured by the European nobility, being drunk by Napoleon, Frederick the Great and Metternich, and written about by Dickens and Jane Austen. Mr John Platter, South Africa's best known wine writer, wrote recently of the 'abandon and exuberance everywhere in the winelands', adding that 'not since Constantia (a wine growing area just outside Cape Town) has the Cape grown such magnificent wines'. The present ferment in the industry has three main strands: reform of the institutional framework, the opening of world markets and the entry into the industry of a new class of professional winemaker. Considerable further impetus is being provided by the political reform process under way in the country since early 1990. At the marketing end of the industry, the return of South African wines to the world's shelves is a wonderful opportunity - literally, a relaunch of the country's wines. Mr Platter notes: 'We're slightly sexy at the moment. The world is quite curious about us'. The initial reception has been good. Supermarkets, which account for the bulk of wine sales in the UK, are restocking South African wines, and wine merchants are scouring estates for good wines to add to their lists. For the first time in many years major South African wine-tastings are being held on both sides of the Atlantic. On the quality front, experts agree there is no doubt that South Africa can make good wines. Mr Simon Loftus of Adnams, the respected Suffolk wine merchant, which for many years refused to stock South African wines, says that although the wines are not universally up to international standards, 'the best South African wines are exceptional'. The relaunch of South Africa's wines raises two issues: what sort of wines should South Africa be trying to make, and what sort of image should it be trying to project. Many international observers think South Africa should concentrate on trying to make a good Pinotage, a red wine cultivar distinctive to South Africa. South African producers, however, seem intent on competing head on with classical-style French wines, like Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. As to image, the shining example of the successful export of an agricultural product from South Africa is right on the wine industry's doorstep - the deciduous fruit industry. The unrelenting focus on quality is something with which the Cape brand name has become synonymous. Wine makers need to ensure that they do not jeopardise the achievement of a premium reputation by selling too much cheap wine. The KWV, the big producer co-operative that supervises the running of the wine industry has traditionally been by far South Africa's largest wine exporter. Mr Jannie Retief, international marketing manager at the KWV, says it has made tremendous progress since the easing of South Africa's isolation. Branded natural wine exports rose by 46.2 per cent in 1991, albeit from a low base. The KWV's target is to sell 1m cases a year into the UK by 1995. Sales are currently about half that level. Also boosting the export effort is a new initiative launched by Unifruco, the export marketing arm of the deciduous fruit industry. Vinfruco is a joint venture between Unifruco and a consortium of co-operative wineries and independent estates in the Stellenbosch region. It has launched a range of wines that will be aimed at the supermarket trade. Smaller independent growers are also targeting the export markets. Mr Tim Hamilton Russell, one of the country's leading producers, says he plans to export about 30 per cent of his annual production of 17,000 bottles. Insofar as South Africa does manage to produce quality wines, it is in spite of the regulatory framework which controls the industry. Basically, the industry has two tiers, with only about 2 per cent of the 5,000 producers actually making wine. The rest are commodity grape growers, concerned primarily with growing the highest yielding cultivars they can find. About 85 per cent of the crop is crushed at co-operative cellars. 'It is the total antithesis of what you do if you want to make a quality wine,' says Mr Hamilton Russell. Against this background, the announcement last month by the KWV that it was scrapping quota requirements was a very significant development that has certainly enhanced the country's prospects of producing good wines. The KWV has long functioned as a sort of trade union favouring the interests of commodity growers. This latest decision, however, is likely to be of advantage only to those at the top of the industry. Apart from lowering the value of existing farms, new entrants are only likely at the quality end. Previously anybody wanting to make and sell wine had to have a quota, which attached to certain land. This presented a considerable - sometimes absolute  -barrier to entry: buying quotas was very expensive, and if there were no quotas available in the district where you wanted to farm, then the aspiring grower simply had to look elsewhere. Despite the latest initiative, the industry has some way to go before it is free. The KWV still operates a minimum price mechanism that is little more than a subsidy wine drinkers must pay to keep inefficient grape growers on the land. And Mr Hamilton Russell, a leading critic of the KWV, was recently prosecuted for unauthorised use of French terms - such as Burgundy and Bordeaux - to describe his wines. The prosecution was in terms of an arcane agreement between South Africa and France whereby the French would buy South Africa's crayfish if South Africa refrained from using certain French names. Allied to the slow trend towards liberalisation in the industry is the entry of a new generation of winemaker - those, like Mr Hamilton Russell, who have come to the industry through the glass rather than the soil, as he puts it. He describes these people, who have featured prominently in the development of the Californian and Australian wine industries, as wealthy individuals, seeking 'second order' activities and committed to excellence. Mr Hamilton Russell himself remains non-executive chairman of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in South Africa. These winemakers have also been trailblazers in opening up the new, cooler viticultural areas, such as Elgin, Hermanus and Mossel Bay, which are considered to have more favourable micro-climates for making quality wines. They have also been at the forefront of new production developments, such as the use of small barrels for wood maturation. Access to international markets will improve the prospects of these producers producing top quality wines. Wiser heads in the industry recognise that South Africa's isolation caused its producers to be left behind, particularly in terms of production techniques. There is also recognition that the novelty factor from which South African wine sales are benefitting at the moment will soon wear off if quality is not delivered at affordable prices. These are the challenges the local industry is now facing up to.</p>

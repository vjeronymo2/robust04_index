			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statistical Communique on Shanghai's Economic and Social </F> Development in 1993, by the Shanghai Municipal Statistical  Bureau (9 February 1994)"]    [Text] In 1993, all people in Shanghai Municipality  implemented the guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress  in an all-round manner; conscientiously carried out various  measures adopted by the central authorities on strengthening and  improving macroeconomic regulation and control; emancipated  their minds; sought truth from facts; and seized the opportunity  to do their work in a down-to-earth manner and to forge ahead  under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and  Municipal People's Government and under the guidance of the  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  Reform of the economic system deepened day by day over the past  year. Meanwhile, Shanghai quickly opened its doors wider to  other localities at home and to the outside world; achieved  sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development [guo min jing  ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170  4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455]; accelerated Pudong's  development; sped up the construction of infrastructure projects  in urban areas; continued to develop science, education,  culture, public health, and various other social undertakings;  and kept improving the living standards of the people in both  urban and rural areas. According to a preliminary estimate, the  municipality produced 150,993 million yuan's worth of gross  national product [GNP] in 1993. Calculated in terms of  comparable prices, the figure posted a growth rate of 14.9  percent over 1992.    The main problems existing in social and economic  development  were as follows: some enterprises' economic returns dropped due  to various cost-push factors; commodity prices increased by a  comparatively large margin; a number of households with low  income found it difficult to make ends meet; and transportation  remained a conspicuous problem for urban residents.  <H5>  1. The Primary Industry </H5>   In 1993, the municipality's primary industry increased its  output value by 3.5 billion yuan, down 3 percent from 1992. The  percentage it captured of the GNP declined from 3.1 percent in  1992 to 2.3 percent.    Also in 1993, Shanghai continued to readjust the internal  structure of its agricultural sector and develop agriculture in  the suburban areas of large cities. The added value of the  agricultural sector for the entire year stood at 9,487 million  yuan, down 4 percent from 1992. Among them, crop farming  industry churned out a total output value of 4,016 million yuan,  down 6.5 percent; the animal husbandry posted a total output  value of 4,341 million yuan, a figure basically at the same  level of 1992's; and the fishery industry posted a total output  value of 1,079 million yuan, down 6.7 percent from that of 1992.  Shanghai maintained a relatively high level of production and  supply of major agricultural and sideline products. However,  due to a decrease in sown areas and other reasons, the output of  some farm and sideline products was lower to a various extent  than 1992.    The output of major agricultural and sideline products is  listed as follows:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1993                     |percent of growth rate f-|  |                         |                         |rom 1992's               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |grain                    |2,081,000 tonnes         |-8.0                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |cotton                   |9,000 tonnes             |-40.0                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |oil-bearing crops        |132,000 tonnes           |-39.7                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |vegetable (marketed quan-|1,450,000 tonnes         |10.0                     |  |tity)                    |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |meat                     |439,000 tonnes           |2.1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |pork among meat output   |219,000 tonnes           |-3.9                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |poultry (marketed quanti-|108 million heads        |6.8                      |  |ty)                      |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |eggs (marketed quantity) |131,000 tonnes           |-11.5                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |milk                     |243,000 tonnes           |-12.3                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |number of butchered pigs |4,105,000 heads          |1.3                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |number of pigs on hand   |2,007,000 heads          |-15.2                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |watermelon, muskmelon    |277,000 tonnes           |-16.8                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |fruit                    |179,000 tonnes           |21.6                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |aquatic products         |237,000 tonnes           |-4.8                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |seawater aquatic products|124,000 tonnes           |-9.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |freshwater aquatic produ-|113,000 tonnes           |0.9                      |  |cts                      |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      As of the end of 1993, counties in suburban areas owned farm  machinery with a total motor power of 1.703 million kilowatts  and 10,400 large and medium-sized tractors. In 1993, a total  quantity of 195,000 tonnes (converted quantity actually used) of  chemical fertilizers were used; the figure showed an increase of  14 percent from 1992. Rural areas consumed 5 billion kwh's  electricity in 1993, up 17.4 percent from 1992.    2. The Secondary Industry    In 1993, the city's secondary industry increased its output  value to 90,286 million yuan, up 16,7 percent over the previous  year; the industrial sector to 85,401 million yuan, up 16.8  percent; the construction sector to 4,885 million yuan, up 14.3  percent; and the proportion of secondary industry's output value  dropped to 59.8 percent from 60.8 percent of the GNP in the  preceding year.    Industry: The city's industrial sector seized the good  opportunity of economic development to accelerate transformation  of enterprises' operating mechanisms. They firmly set their  eyes on the marketplace, took demand as the guide, linked up  manufacturing with marketing, and experienced sustained and fast  growth. Industrial output for the whole year was 327,214 million  yuan, up 18.3 percent over the previous year. The sales volume  for the whole year was 323,744 million, up 20.1 percent. Of the  total industrial sales volume, that of state-owned enterprises  was 173,389 million yuan, up 2.3 percent over the previous year,  and of collectively- owned industry 60,711 million yuan, up 31.6  percent. The industrial sales volume of other types of  industrial establishments was 89,644 million yuan, up 51.9  percent; of which, the industrial sales volume of  foreign-invested enterprises accounted for 54,356 million yuan,  up 65.4 percent. The sale rate of industrial products for the  whole year was 98.9 percent, up 0.8 percentage point over the  previous year; of which, the rate for heavy industry was 98.9  percent and of light industry 99 percent. The value of export  goods delivered during the year was 38,848 million yuan, up 27.4  percent over the previous year.    Industrial restructuring picked up pace. Spurred by demand,  heavy industry displayed a momentum of accelerated development.  Heavy industry and the chemical industry became more pronounced  in Shanghai. The sales volume of light industrial goods for the  whole year was 136,953 million yuan, up 16.2 percent over the  previous year. The sales volume of heavy industry was 186,791  million yuan, up 23.6 percent. Pillar industries such as  automobiles, communications, power equipment, computers, and  home appliances grew quickly. The sales volume of automobiles  for the whole year was 31.1 billion yuan, up 41.8 percent over  the previous year. In communications, a new structure was  dominated by products in five categories -- program-controlled  telephone exchanges, fiber-optic communications, mobile  communications, faxes, and satellite communications. The sales  volume of the communications sector for the whole year was 6,814  million yuan, doubling that of 1992. The output of digital  program-controlled telephone exchanges, large- scale integrated  circuits, air conditioners, and VCRs rose sharply.

             |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Industrial economic efficiency was steadily upgraded. In  1993, the profit rate of the municipality's industrial sectors  was 15.26 percent, up 1.42 percent over that of the previous  year; and the overall labor force productivity was 25,400 yuan  per person, up 58.2 percent over the previous year. The total  profit of the municipality's industrial enterprises with  independent accounting was 38.296 billion yuan.    Enterprise reform continued extensively. State-owned  industrial enterprises comprehensively promoted various reform  experiments, with the majority implementing labor, personnel,  and distribution systems reform. About one-third of state-owned  enterprises reached their initial goals of changing operating  mechanisms. At the end of the year, the municipality had 56  shareholding industrial enterprises. In various localities,  1,118 state-owned industrial enterprises, or 82.9 percent of the  total number, implemented the overall labor contract system or  job contract system; and the number of workers involved was  1,492,200, or 97.5 percent of the total number. In 1993,  bankruptcy tests were carried out for enterprises; over 100 with  poor economic efficiency or which were incapable of competing in  the market were annexed. The change in enterprise operating  mechanisms quickened the pace of gearing enterprises toward the  market.    Construction industry: In 1993, following the promotion of  Shanghai's large-scale urban construction and Pudong's  development, the scale of investment was further enlarged.  Shanghai's construction enterprises seized the excellent  development opportunity, further deepened their internal  restructuring, and quickened the speed of construction projects,  resulting in a comprehensive growth of various major production  indices. In the municipality, the total output value of the  construction industry was 17.879 billion yuan, up 51.9 percent  over the previous year. Of these, state-owned enterprises'  output value was 12.322 billion yuan, up 50.6 percent; and that  of collective-owned enterprises was 555.7 million yuan, up 54.7  million yuan. The total construction area of the municipality's  building enterprises was 27.3644 million sq m, up 6.5283 million  sq m; and the construction area completed was 10.8911 million sq  m, up 2.2862 million sq m.    The construction industry took measures to deepen reform and  raise efficiency. The municipality's building enterprises had  14,000 construction projects, and various kinds of contract  responsibility systems were applied for 10,300 of them, or 73.5  percent of the total number of construction projects. Of the  contract responsibility systems, the bidding system was used for  4,935 projects, or 35.2 percent of the total. Economic  efficiency further improved. Overall labor productivity,  calculated on the basis of total output value, was 41,500 yuan  per person, an increase of 52.1 percent over the previous year.    3. The Tertiary Industry    Shanghai's tertiary industry entered a new round of  accelerated development in 1993. Its output value for the whole  year was 57,207 million yuan, or 13.2 percent over the previous  year, which accounted for 37.9 percent of Shanghai's gross  production, up 1.8 percent over the preceding year.

Post and telecommunications business volume  for the whole year of 1993 reached 2.86 billion yuan, an  increase of 54.4 percent over the previous year. A total of 391  million pieces of mail were delivered, an increase of 23.3  percent. Of the total, 886,000 were domestic express delivery,  up 77.9 percent, and 397,000 were international express  delivery, up 39.3 percent. Newspapers and periodicals totaling  1.09 billion copies were distributed, an increase of 2.2 percent  over the preceding year.

Telephone pager subscribers totaled 322,000, an increase of  166,000.    Domestic trade: Shanghai stepped up cultivation and  construction of large modern markets and deepened the reform of  enterprises in the circulation area in 1993. It initiated  "six-decisionmaking" reform in the municipality's 700 large and  medium-sized commercial enterprises and set up three  multi-purpose corporations, 28 group companies, and 19  stockholding companies. Having established a metal exchange, a  coal exchange, and other capital goods exchange markets, the  municipality successively established a number of other capital  and consumer goods exchange markets, including a petroleum  exchange, grain and edible oil exchange, agricultural capital  goods exchange, meat commodity wholesale market, chemical  commodity exchange, vehicle exchange, and building materials  exchange. Business was brisk in these large markets, with the  metal exchange reporting a transaction volume totaling 388.9  billion yuan for the year. These markets were not only capable  of handling large transactions but also became more standardized  in their operations. As a result, they were able to play a  better resources distribution role in the development of the  socialist market economy. Some of them even began to serve as a  "barometer" of the economy and a "monitor" of commodity prices.    The supply of consumer goods was ample, and the market also  brisk. The total value of retail sales of commodities for the  whole year reached 65.351 billion yuan, an increase of 33.5  percent over the previous year. The real increase was 14.4  percent if price increases are deducted. Of the total retail  sales of commodities, the retail sales of agricultural means of  production totaled 2.92 billion yuan, an increase of 19 percent  over the previous year, and the retail sales of consumer goods  reached 62.431 billion yuan, up 34.3 percent. Of the total  retail sales of consumer goods, the sales in urban areas totaled  48.772 billion yuan, an increase of 35.9 percent over the  previous year, and in rural areas reached 13.659 billion yuan,  up 28.9 percent.

Of the  total amount of retail sales of consumer goods in 1993, the  amount of institutional consumption was 11.845 billion yuan, an  increase of 18.8 percent over the previous year; and the amount  of residents' consumption was 50.586 billion yuan, an increase  of 38.6 percent over. The proportion of residents' consumption  rose from 78.5 percent in 1992 to 81 percent last year. The  total amount of food products consumed in 1993 was 24.513  billion yuan, an increase of 28.5 percent. The real increase  was 6.1 percent if price increases are deducted. The total  value of sales of clothing items was 9.39 billion yuan,  increasing by 40.1 percent, with the real increase being 17.5  percent if price increases are deducted. The total value of  sales of consumer goods other than clothing and food products  was 28.042 billion yuan, an increase of 38.3 percent, with the  real increase being 24.8 percent if price increases are  deducted.

At the end of 1993, the total amount of savings  deposits increased by 35.669 billion yuan as compared with that  at the beginning of 1993. The total balance of bank loans at  the end of 1993 was 29.483 billion yuan more than at the  beginning of 1993.

Foreign exchange earnings  from tourism totaled 4,541 million yuan (in Renminbi foreign  exchange certificates), an increase of 43.7 percent.    Science and technology, education, and culture: New progress  was made in science and technology. According to initial  estimates, Shanghai's 1993 research and development expenditures  accounted for 1.36 percent or so of its gross production. As of  the end of 1993, Shanghai's state-owned enterprises and  institutions had 888,800 technological personnel in different  categories. The municipality scored 1,995 major scientific and  technological achievements in 1993, of which five were first in  the world, 729 reached or approached advanced international  levels; 551 were the first in the country; and 661 were at  advanced domestic levels. Six scientific and technological  achievements in Shanghai won the State Invention Awards at the  national science and technology competition; seven won the State  Natural Science Awards; 33 won the State Scientific and  Technological Progress Awards, and four won the State Spark  Awards. Science and technology became more integrated with  production. Of the 1,995 scientific and technological  achievements, 1,833, or 91.9 percent, were applied in various  fields. Technology markets also made new advances. A  technology exchange was set up during the year. Some 25,500  technology contracts worth 2,032 million yuan were signed; the  amount represented an increase of 33.3 percent over the  preceding year. The municipality also accelerated the pace of  reforming Shanghai's science and technology management  structure, and adopted better policies and measures to  industrialize its scientific and technological achievements.    Shanghai achieved new developments in educational  undertakings. To meet the needs of various personnel due to  socialist market economic development, institutes of higher  learning and middle-level special schools continued to quicken  the readjustment of their operations and courses. Various types  of on- the-job training at various levels and further education  developed well; educational management system reform continued  to be deepened; new progress was made in student enrollment and  graduate employment system reform; and various kinds of school  operational systems were further improved. In the whole year,  Shanghai recruited 4,282 graduate students, up 16.7 percent over  that of the previous year; and its general institutes of higher  learning recruited 43,600 students for regular and professional  courses, up 16.5 percent.

At the  Seventh National Games, Shanghai's athletes won 29 gold, 22  silver, and 16 bronze medals, placing them third overall in the  number of gold medals won and total group points.    4. The Development of Pudong    In 1993, the construction of infrastructure facilities and  development of functional facilities were stepped up in the  Pudong New District. Various economic indexes rose rapidly,  with the extent of increase significantly higher than the  average of the whole municipality. The gross national product  in the district reached 16.4 billion yuan during 1993, an  increase of 30.2 percent based on comparable prices. Of which,  the value of tertiary industry was 4.743 billion yuan, an  increase of 46.6 percent. The gross sales value of industrial  output during 1993 was 57.78 billion yuan [as published], an  increase of 28.7 percent over the previous year, and the total  value of sales of industrial products reached 57.207 billion  yuan, an increase of 30.5 percent. The total amount of retail  sales of commodities in society was 4.192 billion yuan, an  increase of 40.1 percent. The total amount of fixed assets  investment was 16.5 billion yuan, increasing by 120 percent.  With the exception of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant, the 10 major  infrastructure construction projects of the first phase were all  completed two years ahead of schedule. The goal of developing  selected key areas was also overfulfilled. The area of "seven  through and one flat" ["qi tong yi ping 0003 6639 0001 1627"]  was expanded to 11.8 square kilometers. The first phase  2-square kilometer development project at the Waigaoqiao free  tax zone has been completed for operation. The construction of  50 buildings at the Lujiazui financial and trade district was  started. The number of foreign and domestic investment projects  in the Jinqiao export processing zone has exceeded 200. The  functions of the export- oriented economy can now be seen in the  Pudong New District where special stress is laid on the  development of finance and trade, and processing of items for  export. The number of direct investment projects by foreign  businessmen reached 924 in 1993, an increase of 73 percent over  the previous year. The total amount of foreign capital absorbed  in the district reached $1.729 billion, an increase of 34  percent. The total amount of foreign trade export reached $1.02  billion, an increase of 13.2 percent.    The vigorous functional development and further improvement  of the investment environment in the Pudong New District have  also promoted the development of enterprises with lateral ties  at home. In 1993, 1,727 projects which have links with other  enterprises at home were approved with a total investment of  13.59 billion yuan. Of which 12.93 billion yuan was invested by  enterprises in other localities, accounting for 95.6 percent of  total investment.  <H5>  5. Fixed Assets Investment </H5>   In 1993, stress was laid on adjusting the structure in the  municipality and great efforts were made to improve the  investment structure. The total amount of investment in 1993  reached 62.495 billion yuan, an increase of 74.9 percent over  the previous year. Of which, state owned enterprises invested  50.639 billion yuan, an increase of 92.6 percent over that of  1992; collective enterprises invested 7.713 billion yuan, an  increase of 20.2 percent over 1992; and private investment  totaled 1.913 billion yuan, an increase of 9 percent. The  amount of investment for commercialized houses was 1.23 billion  yuan, an increase of 75.5 percent. Of the fixed assets  investment in the municipality, 12.417 billion yuan was invested  for central level projects, an increase of 77.2 percent over the  previous year and 41.769 billion yuan was invested for local  projects, an increase of 94.9 percent over the previous year.    In restructuring the investment pattern, preferential  treatment was given to: 1) Tertiary industries: In 1993,  29.608 billion yuan, or an increase of 110 percent over the year  before, was invested in tertiary industries; 2) the New Pudong  District: During 1993, 16.5 billion yuan, or an increase of 120  percent over the year before, was investment in the New Pudong  District; and 3) major construction projects: 14.222 billion  yuan, or 26.2 percent of the city's total investment, was  invested in 46 ongoing major construction projects, which  accounted for 0.8 percent of the total number of construction  projects in the city in 1993.    Better results were achieved from investment restructuring.  In 1993, state units completed 2,385 projects of fixed assets  and 47.1 of them were commissioned into operation; the floor  space of assorted buildings completed reached 11.246 million  square meters, and 29.2 percent of buildings were completed. Of  the newly completed fixed assets, which worth 31.476 billion  yuan, 58.1 percent of them were commissioned to use.  <H5>  6. Municipal Construction </H5>   The building of the municipal infrastructure for improving  municipal communications proceeded in a big way in 1993. A  total of 16.419 billion yuan, or an increase of 94.7 percent  over that of the preceding year, was spent on building the  municipal infrastructure, such as roads, power and gas supply  systems, sewage treatment system, and postal and  telecommunications systems. Major municipal construction  projects completed one after another were the Yangpu Bridge,  main structures of 13 stations of the route one subway, Luoshan  Road overpass, Longyang Road overpass, Wusong Bridge, expansion  of the Jiangsu Road, second-stage reconstruction of the traffic  system along the bund, Pudong section of the inner ring,  first-stage construction of the Puxi overpass of the inner ring,  extension of the eastern section of the Shanghai-Jiaxing  Expressway, first-stage construction of the main sewage  treatment project, Waigaoqiao port project, Lengqiao waterworks,  and Rihui Port reclamation and pipeline installation projects.    The reconstruction of the old district was expedited in 1993  owing to the funds raised through various channels. Unsafe  buildings and shelters with a total floor space of 1.36 million  square meters were pulled down and removed.    The development of public municipal services made new  headway. By the end of the year the city had 450 public  transportation routes, or 14 more than those at the end of 1992;  7,037 vehicles, or 200 more than those at the end of 1992, for  public transportation; and 31,000 rental cars, or 13,000 more  than those at the end of 1992. However, because road  construction lagged behind the needs of social and economic  development for a long time, as well as the increase of vehicles  and sizable road construction projects in downtown areas,  traffic congestion remained an outstanding problem in urban  areas. In 1993, public means of transportation transported a  total of 5.6 billion passengers, or 15.34 million passengers  daily on the average; 1.351 billion tonnes of running water --  including 714 million tonnes of running water for household use  -- were provided, or an increase of 4.7 percent over that of the  preceding year; and coal gas and liquified natural gas were  delivered to an additional 237,710 households through pipelines,  setting a new record of annual increase. In 1993, a total of  15.7 billion cubic meters of coal gas, or 6.9 percent more than  that of the preceding year, was supplied.    More wooded areas were developed in urban areas. By the end  of 1993, urban areas had 927.81 hectares of public parks as  result of the development of 157.54 hectares of wooded areas of  all types.  <H5>  7. Commodity Prices </H5>   To keep pace with the development of the socialist market  economy, new headway was made in reforming the pricing and price  management structures in 1993. More authority of price  management was released, the scope of state-set prices became  even smaller, and the market played a bigger role in regulating  prices. In 1993, the purchasing and selling prices of grain and  cooking oil were decontrolled, the use of coupons for purchasing  grain and cooking oil was eliminated, and prices of coal gas,  electricity, and waters and public transportation facilities as  well as certain services were readjusted.    In 1993, the price index of consumer goods in Shanghai was  117.5 -- 121.1 for food, 119.2 for clothing, 108.5 for goods of  daily use, 99.2 for educational and recreational goods, 105.5  for books and magazines, 107.6 for pharmaceuticals and medical  goods; 159.7 for building and decorating materials; and 157.3  for fuels.    The index of people's living cost in 1993 was 120.2, and the  index of service charges was 138.3.    8. Population and the People's Livelihood    Preliminary statistics show that, by the end of 1993, 12.94  million people had had their domiciles registered in Shanghai  (but according to samplings conducted among permanent residents,  the number of population by the end of 1993 should be 13.49  million), the birthrate was 6.5 per thousand, the mortality rate  was 7.3 per thousand, and the natural growth rate was minus 0.8  per thousand.    By the end of 1993, Shanghai had 4,902,400 workers and staff  members, a decrease of 209,600; collectively-owned units had  910,700 workers and staff members, a decrease of 68,100; units  of other forms of ownership had 235,500 workers and staff  members, an increase of 68,500; and the number of independent  workers in cities and towns had reached 62,700, an increase of  2,800. In 1993, 170,900 people were given jobs in Shanghai or  nearby towns.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 21 (AFP) -- The U.S. firm Sheffield  Medical Technologies and a French government research institute  announced Tuesday [21 June] they would join forces to develop a  French-conceived AIDS vaccine.    Tests using a prototype of the vaccine on monkeys have been  promising, said Jean-Claude Chermann, head of the National  Institute of Health and Medical Research and a co-discoverer of  the AIDS virus in 1983 when he worked at the Pasteur Institute.    If all goes well, tests on humans will begin in mid-1995  under the supervision of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,  he added.    The vaccine is designed to be taken orally along with the  polio vaccine, which is relatively low-cost and easy to use, and  thus make the AIDS vaccine widely accessible in Africa, he added.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Volosov, candidate of economic sciences and </F> sector head at Russian Institute of Strategic Studies:  "Russia-United States: Partners or Rivals?"]    [Text] One of the distinctive features of  Russian-U.S. economic relations at this time is their  development under qualitatively new military-political and  economic conditions, which are having a decisive effect on the  interaction of the two states.    The end of the "cold war" minimized the importance of  military potential as a factor determining a country's position  in the international arena and assigned priority to indicators  of economic, scientific-technical, and financial strength. As a  result, Russia, which had been the United States' equal as a  leader in world development and which had essentially determined  the course of this development in conjunction with the United  States, turned into one of the large but economically weak  states with claims to only a "secondary role."    The collapse of the USSR, the severe economic crisis in  Russia, and the uncertainty of emergence from it made our state  even more vulnerable in world politics and international  economic relations. Members of the U.S. military-political,  business, and scientific communities, however, know that Russia  still has significant economic and scientific-technical  potential in addition to nuclear strength and political  influence. If the reforms are successful, this could turn it  into one of the United States' principal competitors in the  international arena and the world market, particularly in  several advanced fields. This is one of the main factors  motivating the United States to become actively involved in the  reform of the Russian economy according to guidelines convenient  for the United States.  <H5>  Freedom of Choice? </H5>   One of the main elements of the present U.S. policy on  Russia  is the encouragement of the Russian Government to choose  patterns of economic reform meeting the long-term economic and  political interests of the West. In this context, the United  States was instrumental in imposing the IMF stabilization  program on Russia. This program has obvious foreign economic  goals in addition to internal economic objectives. The  experience of other states with comparable programs proves that  their main results are "favorable" economic conditions for the  servicing of foreign debts and the rapid growth of energy and  raw material exports, which have always been convenient for the  United States and the other leading nations that are the largest  creditors and consumers of fuel and raw materials.    The results of Russian economic development since 1992 prove  conclusively that the United States and other leading Western  nations managed to create the necessary conditions for Russia's  integration in the world economy as a country specializing in  the export of fuel and raw materials and of finished goods  requiring only the slightest processing. Serious negative  tendencies of a structural nature, resulting from the IMF  stabilization program, are already apparent in the Russian  national economy. One of these tendencies is the "weight gain"  of the Russian economy, in which the processing industries'  share of physical production had already decreased to 64.5  percent in the first half of 1993 in comparison to 65.6 percent  in 1992 and 67.9 percent in 1991. This was accompanied by the  noticeable growth of the fuel and raw material sector, which  accounted for 25 percent of physical production in 1993 in  comparison to 11.3 percent in 1991.    Besides this, the accelerated decline of industrial  production as a result of the "shock therapy" also made  additional fuel and raw materials available for export, which  more than compensated for the reduction of output in various  industries. When aluminum production in Russia decreased by 8  percent in 1990-1993, for example, its domestic consumption was  reduced by a factor of almost 2.2, which allowed for a more than  3.7-fold increase in exports of this metal. Exports of crude oil  from Russia increased by more than 20 percent just in 1993, in  spite of the 6-percent reduction in output. As a result, exports  of fuel and raw materials already exceed 80 percent of the  Russian total.    The expansion of Russian exports of fuel and raw materials  to  the world market is in the long-term and short-term interests of  the United States and other developed Western countries. Russian  shipments in recent years were the main factor destabilizing  these markets and lowering prices. The index of world prices of  nonferrous metals, for example, had reached its lowest level in  the last eight years by the end of 1993--40 percent below the  1990 indicator. Comparable tendencies were apparent in the  markets for energy resources. These price dynamics are extremely  convenient for the industrially developed countries, stimulating  their economies and helping them surmount economic difficulties  of a cyclical nature.  <H5>  Welcome, or Off-Limits to Outsiders </H5>   The United States' attempts to accomplish the Russian  economy's integration in the world economy as a fuel and raw  material appendage of the industrially developed nations are  also evident from the development of trade and economic  relations between the two countries. Raw materials are clearly  prevalent, for example, in Russian exports to the United States:  The overwhelming majority of export shipments to the American  market consist of nonferrous metals (aluminum, nickel, zinc,  copper, and others), metals of the platinum group, silver and  precious stones, petroleum and petroleum products, inorganic  chemicals, and fertilizers. Russian fuel and raw materials have  been of the greatest interest to American private businessmen,  who invested around 400 million dollars in Russia in 1993. It is  no coincidence that the biggest project will entail a consortium  of U.S. oil and gas companies investing a total of 3.4 billion  dollars in the exploration and development of new oil and gas  deposits in West Siberia and on the shelf of Sakhalin Island.    All of this has been accompanied by U.S. attempts to crowd  Russian exporters out of traditional markets and to keep Russia  out of the world markets in which it could compete, particularly  the markets for high-tech goods.    In the last seven years Russia's share of world arms exports  decreased from 38 to 17 percent, while the United States managed  to increase its share from 30 to 58 percent. In the last two  years alone, the United States almost doubled its own arms  exports. Meanwhile, the United States, which has a monopoly in  the world market for space services, is constantly spreading  rumors about Russian dumping in this field, although this  industry is no longer subsidized by the state in Russia, and the  low overhead costs of production are due to effective technology  and cheap manpower. A similar situation is taking shape in the  world uranium market, where Russian shipments still account for  only 4 percent of the total, although the Russian output  represents around 25 percent of the world total.    Furthermore, the United States is in no hurry to make any  cardinal improvements in the trade and economic status of  Russian goods. Most-favored-nation status in trade was extended  to Russia for only one year, the Jackson-Vanik amendment is  still in effect, and anti-monopoly legislation is still being  applied vigorously to Russian goods.    Integration processes on the North American continent are  having an increasing effect on the development of foreign  economic relations between the two countries. The more active  recent steps to form a North American free trade zone (NAFTA)  created even more difficulties for Russian goods in American  markets. The sale of Russian motor vehicles in the United States  with minimal customs duties, for example, would require  two-thirds of the components to be produced in the NAFTA states.  There are even more serious restrictions on textiles. The  exporter of Russian linen fabrics to the United States has to  prove that the goods have no analogues in the North American  countries. The perceptible relaxation of CoCom [Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Control] controls on exports  of several high-technology goods to Russia was dictated  primarily by competition in the world market. The findings of a  study by the U.S. Department of Commerce, in particular,  indicated that existing restrictions were ineffective because  high-power computers could be obtained in the world market in  circumvention of all controls. According to statements by  American officials, the liberalization of computer exports will  enhance the competitiveness of American companies substantially  without hurting U.S. national security.    In spite of Russia's increasingly severe socioeconomic  difficulties, most of the West's financial aid is being extended  in the form of comparatively expensive credits from  international financial institutions, and not in the form of the  nonrefundable aid that was extended to, for example, Japan and  Germany during their periods of economic reform in the 1940s and  1950s. This provides more evidence that the West has no  intention, or even the potential, to offer Russia sweeping  economic assistance comparable to the famous Marshall Plan (the  American aid in the restoration of the postwar economy of  Western Europe), which would amount to 60-75 billion dollars in  today's prices.  <H5>  The `Triangle' Will Not Become a `Square' </H5>   This approach to the Russian reforms is a reflection of the  way in which the United States and other Western powers see the  new balance of power in the world economy and international  relations after the end of the "cold war." At present there is  an obvious tendency toward more vigorous efforts by the leading  Western countries to set up an effective system for the  collective regulation of world economic processes and  international relations, which should be based on the three  "poles" of economic strength--the United States, the European  Union, and Japan, which account for around two-thirds of the  world GDP. As Director F. Bergsten of the distinguished  Institute of the World Economy remarked in this context, the  "big three" should begin acting like an unofficial managing  committee of the world economy. Under these conditions, Russia's  many attempts to become an equal member of the group of leading  Western countries for the collective resolution of global  problems will not win any support. We must not forget that the  harsh laws of competition were always at work in the world  economy and international politics, and there was always the  determination to secure national interests, frequently by  infringing the national interests of others....</p>

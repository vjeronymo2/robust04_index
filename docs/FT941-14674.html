			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Alexanders stages recovery to Pounds 512,000 Alexanders Holdings, the Glasgow-based Ford main dealer, achieved a pre-tax profit of Pounds 512,000 for the year to end-September, against a deficit of Pounds 691,000. The recovery was struck on turnover down from Pounds 88.8m to Pounds 87.2m, and provided the first tangible evidence of improving fortunes for the company, according to Mrs Aleksandra Clayton, chairman. Alexanders' Ford main dealerships raised total new vehicle sales by 6 per cent over the previous year, while the parts operations continued to strengthen. Used vehicle sales, however, suffered from the general collapse of prices during the last quarter of 1992. A single dividend of 0.5p (nil) is proposed, payable from earnings per share of 1.25p (1.39p losses).</p>

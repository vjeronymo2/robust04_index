			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils wanted Better first quarter results than expected from Shell Oil, Shell Transport's US subsidiary, prompted renewed heavy US buying of the UK's two oil majors. Shell Oil's profits of Dollars 239m compared with Dollars 183 for the same period last year and were seen as best set of quarterly numbers since 1989. The shares, unsettled earlier in the week as a number of big US institutions switched out of the stock and into BP, staged a modest rally yesterday to close 3 1/2 up at 554p on turnover of 5.8m. But specialists said they felt a closer scrutiny of Shell US's numbers would trigger a strong response in Shell shares when the London market reopens on Tuesday. 'These are super figures,' said Mr Nick Clayton, oil analyst at Smith New Court, who said Shell's streamlining is now coming right after years of poor performance by the company. Mr John Toalster at SGST, the French-owned stockbroker and renowned bear of BP, said: 'The true recovery story in the oil majors is not BP but Shell.' BP boosted earlier this week by big switching from Shell, nevertheless continued to gain ground following renewed US support. 'What's good for Shell is good for BP,' said another oil analyst. BP set to announce first quarter figures next Thursday rose 7 to 292 1/2p.</p>

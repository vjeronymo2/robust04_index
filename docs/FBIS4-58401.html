			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Syria's Principles," AL-THAWRAH  says: Damascus is a primary stop on U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's current tour of the region. This is in  view of Syria's effective role in the peace process since the  Madrid conference, which essentially got off the ground when  Syria agreed to take part in it, thus opening prospects for  peace. The paper adds that despite Israel's desperate attempts  to belittle the importance of Syria's role, all observers now  publicly acknowledge the importance and centrality of this role.  Observers are fully aware of the credibility of the Syrian  stand on the peace process and the need for a comprehensive  peace. They know that Syria has responded to the will of  international legitimacy and the calls for implementing UN  resolutions to establish peace and stability in the region in  accordance with the land-for-peace formula.    The paper explains that, in light of Israel's intransigence  and endeavors to turn the peace process into a series of  partial, separate agreements and secret deals contravening the  requirements and conditions of peace, the peace process has come  to a dangerous impasse. The paper says that Syria has been well  aware of Israel's deceptive methods and has dealt with them  appropriately. Syria has also supported the efforts of the  cosponsors of the peace initiative, especially the efforts of  the U.S. sponsor, to get the peace process out of the bottleneck  into which it has been pushed by the Tel Aviv rulers.    Stressing Syria's adherence to the prerequisites of peace,  the paper says that Syria reaffirms the credibility of its  stands and its acceptance of all that leads to the enforcement  of the bases of the peace process and any efforts to advance it  in accordance with its requirements and the hopes pinned on it.  As leader al-Asad stressed in his meeting with the U.S.  President in Geneva -- during which al-Asad proposed the formula  of full peace for full withdrawal -- peace is a strategic part  of Syria's policy. That stance won the admiration and support  of the world and placed the ball in the Israeli court, as  President Clinton himself put it.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says that Syria will continue to  support just, comprehensive peace within the framework of  international legitimacy and resolutions. Syria will never  bargain over the Golan Heights, southern Lebanon, or other  occupied Arab territories. Under no circumstances will Syria be  dragged to half-solutions.</p>

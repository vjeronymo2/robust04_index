			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Household and business debts could slow economic growth High levels of household and company debt will curb borrowing, investment and employment growth during the present economic recovery, the Bank of England warns today. The Bank calculates that in the first quarter of this year more than 1.29m households were affected by negative equity, with their mortgage borrowings exceeding the value of their property. The total value of negative equity was Pounds 7.6bn, representing an average of Pounds 5,900 per affected household, the Bank says. At its peak in the first quarter of 1993, the negative equity of home-buyers totalled nearly Pounds 12bn and affected about 1.8m households, of which more than half were in the south-east. In an article, released before publication tomorrow of its Quarterly Bulletin and Inflation Report, the Bank says the continuing effects of high debt levels are likely to lead to cautious borrowing patterns and moves to reduce debt in the months ahead. In the longer term the Bank expects households and corporations to be willing to take on debt again. In the personal sector, income gearing - the ratio of net interest payments to disposable income - is back at the levels of the mid-1980s while the corporate sector as a whole has reduced its indebtedness sharply since 1992. But, says the Bank: 'In the recent recession, debt had a much greater impact on both sectors' behaviour than in the recession of the early 1980s.' House price falls and debt deflation 'left many recent house-buyers - a substantial minority of all homeowners, and often young, first-time buyers - with negative net wealth'. In the corporate sector, the Bank found that smaller companies were especially badly hit by high levels of debt. Many companies became vulnerable to recession through over-expansion in the 1980s when they had high profit expectations that were not fulfilled. The Bank says the financial hardships experienced by households have changed spending patterns and affected the economy as a whole. For example, lump sum repayments to mortgage lenders rose by 140 per cent between 1989 and 1993 to reach Pounds 2.5bn, or nearly 5 per cent of personal sector saving last year. This increase, at a time of falling mortgage rates, almost certainly reflected concern among borrowers about debt levels being too high.</p>

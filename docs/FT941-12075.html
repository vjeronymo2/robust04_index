			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Restatement cuts Embassy to Pounds 1.25m Embassy Property Group, the development and construction company, has published restated figures for the year to end-March 1993. The outcome is a reduction in the previously reported pre-tax figure from Pounds 1.67m to Pounds 1.25m and a drop in earnings per share from 3.03p to 2.3p. In September last year, when reporting its results, the USM-quoted group announced it was examining ways to refinance part of its debt and to raise additional funds. The shares were temporarily suspended pending details of the refinancing. As part of the negotiations, the company considered it appropriate to have a formal valuation on some of its properties. The valuation highlighted reduced net realisable values, and the resulting deficit has been incorporated in the 1993 accounts.</p>

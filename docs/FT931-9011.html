			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Hands-on venturers take new course - The transformation of DCC into a holding company LAST DECEMBER, as the minds of Dublin's corporate financiers were focused on more seasonal matters such as the state of household budgets and the office party, two deals were suddenly sprung on the market. Behind them was DCC, a private company founded and headed by Mr Jim Flavin, a maverick figure who in 16 years has built a local IPounds 1m venture capital operation into an industrial holding company with pan-European ambitions and net assets in excess of IPounds 130m (Pounds 135m). The two December deals involved a total of IPounds 20m being offered to buy out Wardell Roberts, a health and snack foods company, and Printech, one of the largest computer documentation printers in Europe. DCC, and those acting in concert with it, already held 34 per cent and 66 per cent of the two companies respectively. Both offers have since been declared unconditional. The offers attracted sharp criticism. They were 'pathetically derisory' and 'represent a threat to the long term viability of the Irish Stock Exchange if sound second line companies can be taken out like this,' said Mr John Lawrie, chief investment manager at Scottish Provident. He believed the lack of a market for second line companies had grossly undervalued them. Mr Flavin would not disagree, perhaps giving a clue to his success and to his switch away from venture capitalism. DCC was responsible for bringing both firms to the stock market. Printech was admitted to the Official List only in May 1991. Speaking at his headquarters, set characteristically in leafy suburban surroundings on the south side of Dublin away from the huddle of corporate head offices in the overcrowded city centre, Mr Flavin said that a change in corporate strategy had coincided with a secular downturn in the performance of the smaller companies quoted on the Irish market. 'Around the end of 1990, we decided that if we were to grow, we would have to expand outside of Ireland. Given the tough time that venture capital companies have had in the US and mainland Europe, we felt it would be difficult to compete in this field. We therefore decided to become an industrial holding company' he said. Since then there has also been 'a relative underperformance of smaller companies' quoted in Dublin, which he said 'has been more savage than the normal cycle'. A slowing of funds into the market, combined with the disappearance of exchange controls and the diversification of institutional portfolios into overseas equities and gilts has resulted in the market 'doing nothing for shareholders or the corporate entities concerned', Mr Flavin said. Although private, more than 90 per cent of DCC shares are held by financial institutions and pension funds. The largest holders are Bank of Ireland with 20 per cent, and Irish Life Assurance with 13 per cent. He set up the company in 1976, after managing Allied Irish Banks' venture capital fund for several years. 'I knocked on the doors of 13 institutions and received a 'yes' from 11 of them', Mr Flavin said. He said the new strategy would concentrate on five core areas - food, healthcare, office automation, printing and energy. Besides the Printech and Wardell Roberts deals, DCC has bought two thirds of the 11m Fyffes shares sold by the McCann family last December, taking its stake to 11 per cent. Through its 77 per cent holding in Fannin, it has a strong foothold in the medical and surgical supplies field and the specialist microsurgery sector, which Mr Flavin sees as strong growth areas. Through its 30 per cent stake in Flogas, DCC is entering the natural gas distribution sector in the UK. In its last full year results DCC reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 13.5m and earnings per share of 76.5p. Since 1990, the investment portfolio has been steadily reduced from 42 to 19 companies. In its quest for European expansion, it plans to become a plc within two to three years. 'We have built up cash from the disposals, but we are seeing a lot of opportunities to add value and we are thinking of a flotation to build up the coffers,' Mr Flavin said. 'Five years ago we were predominantly trading in Ireland. Now 60 per cent of our business is done in the UK. Five years from now I expect 20 per cent will be in Ireland, 40 per cent in the UK, and 40 per cent on mainland Europe with some in the US.' As one of Ireland's leading venture capital companies in the eighties, where does DCC's change of strategy leave the venture capital sector now? 'I think the Unlisted Securities Market experiment has been a failure. Although there have been some successes, there have been a lot of duds. With hindsight, small companies should not go to the stock market until one has built up an enduring record. 'Small may be beautiful but big is strong, and the smaller companies can end up pretty vulnerable without a broad market base and strong in-depth management'. He also criticised the lack of a clear industrial strategy by the government. 'I am in favour of a government interventionist approach to industry. Not in ownership, but to research, to guide and to prod along. There needs to be more policy research. Even the big corporations tend to stick to what they know best. 'An industrial policy is paramount and the ad hoc, scattergun approach, creating a factory at every crossroads, is not a formula for a sound industrial development strategy,' he said. DCC has set up its own research unit to plan an acquisition programme 'which will take us into Europe' he said. 'As a venture capital company we have had experience with a wide range of sectors and we are now focused on the ones we find the most interesting'. In defying the trend of the move away from broad-based holding companies, Mr Flavin believed DCC's strategy would work because 'we were always a hands-on venture capital company, so we felt comfortable with becoming an industrial holding company'. He added: 'Divisional managers have a lot of autonomy and plenty of incentives to achieve competitive results. In 16 years we have developed good financial and strategic planning skills, and we have good operating management skills. We are now in the process of fusing the two.'</p>

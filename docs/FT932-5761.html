			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Orchestrators of a classic change of tempo  -The background to the rapidly improving fortunes of Cray Electronics SIR PETER Michael is not only busy getting Classic FM, the radio station where he is the single largest shareholder, off to a flying start. He and his fellow board members at Cray Electronics are orchestrating another unexpected success story. Cray, no relation to the US supercomputer maker, is the former high technology wonder stock brought low by mismanagement and controversial accounting policies. The 1989 debacle resulted in the injection of a new management team led by Sir Peter as chairman and his colleagues, Mr Roger Holland and Mr Jon Richards, as deputy chairman and managing director respectively. The three made their collective name turning round UEI, an engineering group they sold in 1989 to Carlton Communications for Pounds 508m. Cray, a diverse collection of electronics-related companies burdened by heavy debt, looked a stiffer challenge. Sir Peter said at the time that the company was in serious trouble and that recovery would take two to three years. Analysts were understandably cautious: 'A speculative investment' was one conclusion; 'not for the risk averse', another. Now the music has changed tempo. Cray's share price stands at 154p, up from a low of 32p, giving a market capitalisation of about Pounds 300m. Net debt, which at one stage in 1989 amounted to almost Pounds 50m, has been eliminated through margin improvements, cost reductions and the disposal of 14 of the company's rag-bag of businesses. There is net cash of Pounds 10m. Turnover in the year to April 1993 is likely to be Pounds 200m and the City is estimating taxable profits at Pounds 17m: 'The group will not disappoint market expectations', says NatWest Securities in a bullish note this month. Mr Holland has now taken over as chairman; Sir Peter remains a non-executive director. Cost cutting and disposals sowed the seeds of Cray's recovery but with interests ranging from aerospace systems to sonar equipment, the business lacked focus. The key to Cray's new-found credibility seems to be the Pounds 50m acquisition in July last year of Dowty IT, the information technology interests of the Dowty engineering group. What Cray bought in Dowty IT was principally Case Communications, a small UK-based data communications company with a good reputation for technology but an indifferent business track record. The Dowty acquisition enabled the management to group its various businesses into three more or less natural divisions - Cray Communications, Cray Systems and Cray Technology. Cray Systems, turning over 20 per cent of group revenues, includes the software products and services; the company is the leading supplier of software to the European Space Agency and is the market leader in systems for tour and ferry operators. Cray Technology, generating 15 per cent of group revenues, is, as group managing director Mr Jon Richards accepts, a disparate bundle of electronics concerns most of which are related to the defence industries including high resolution computer graphics displays and high security power supplies. They are, he says, non-core businesses, but the individual activities are profitable; the strategy is to drive down costs while building long-term partnerships with customers. Cray Communications, however, with likely sales last year of Pounds 130m, or 65 per cent of group turnover, is the principal plank in the group's strategy. Formed by merging the activities of Cray's own communications division with Dowty Case and Dowty Information Systems, its products and services are at the heart of the one of the fastest growing areas of business technology. Companies are increasingly connecting their personal computers together in local area networks (lans), going on to create enterprise-wide communications by linking lans together using wide area networking (wan) technology. According to the market consultancies IDC and Dataquest, the market for wan access and lan interconnect products is expected to grow from Dollars 1.9bn in 1986 to Dollars 10.1bn (Pounds 6.5bn) in 1996, or 500 per cent growth in 10 years. Products where growth of more than 50 per cent a year is expected include lan hubs, data communications using asynchronous transfer mode (atm) rules, a likely standard for future high capacity networks and frame relay, a high speed, low cost communication technique for voice and data. Cray is active in all these technologies. It claims to be the European market leader in wide area networks and number three in the world after Motorola and Racal. It also reckons to be number eight in the intensely competitive lan business behind new stars of the communications business like Novell, Cisco and 3Com, all of the US. The strategy seems sound but execution, especially in the frenetic world of electronics, is another matter. Mr Richards says his business imperatives are to invest further in manufacturing, exploit the strength of the company networking products and unify worldwide operations. The objective is to raise gross margins to the 14 per cent level some time next year. The company continues to suffer, however, from a lack of visibility. If potential investors recognise it at all, they remember the dodgy accounting saga or the abortive bid for SD-Scicon, where it was pipped at the post by EDS. A spectacular success in the marketplace would underscore its claim to be one of the UK's leading IT companies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Kozlov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 8 Jun -- Russia favors the unconditional  observation of the provisions of the UN Security Council  resolution of 1 June this year on banning weapons' supplies to  Yemen. The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this today by  Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's  department of information and the press. He said that it was in  the common interests of the world community "to deprive the  internecine conflict of fuel." The warring sides, he said,  should finally heed the voice of reason, cease the senseless  destruction of their own country, and return to the path of  political dialogue.    Despite the efforts to stop the bloodshed, the official  spokesman of the Russian foreign policy department said, reports  are continuing to come from Yemen about large-scale combat  actions and more deaths and destruction. In this connection, he  stressed, Russia welcomes the efforts to achieve a normalization  of the situation by the UN Security Council, the League of Arab  States, the countries of the Persian Gulf, and other  international mediators, and Russia confirms its readiness to  coordinate actions toward the soonest possible cessation of the  fratricidal conflict.</p>

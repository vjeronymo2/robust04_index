			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nelson Franco Jobim] </F>   [Text] If the economic stabilization plan of Finance  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is successful, it will be the  first timid and restrained step by Brazil to face the greatest  challenge of its foreign policy at the end of this century: to  integrate itself with the system of commercial blocs which  characterizes the new economic world order and to take advantage  of the opportunities of growth by preserving the diversification  of its economy and the multilateral policy of its foreign trade.    President Itamar Franco and Foreign Minister Celso Amorim  have already defined the Brazilian strategy: to strengthen the  Common Market of the South (Mercosur) and to attract other  countries toward a Latin American free trade zone, and only then  negotiate with the United States the creation of a Free Trade  Hemispheric Area (AHLC) as proposed in 1990 by U.S. President  George Bush upon launching the Americas Initiative.    The creation of a South American free trade zone, as  proposed  by President Itamar Franco to the Rio Group in Chile last  October, will be discussed by the finance and foreign ministers  of the Mercosur on 9 and 10 March in Buenos Aires.    Paulo Nogueira Batista, the Brazilian representative before  the ALADI [Latin American Integration Association], said: "First  it is necessary to bring South America closer together, to  integrate the Mercosur and the Andean Pact, and also to attract  Chile," adding: "We will try to transform the Mercosur into a  customs union and at the same time create a South American free  trade zone."    Environment Minister Rubens Ricupero, former ambassador to  the United States and former Brazilian representative before the  GATT, said: The first condition is the stability of the economy.  To win and expand markets it is necessary to have an industrial  and investment policy, adding: "The 14-percent investment rate  in 1992 was the lowest in history. In the 1970's investments  amounted to 25 percent of the GDP."    Ricupero said: The investment in the 1970's is what made  Brazil the third country in export growth in 1992, only slightly  behind Hong Kong (20 percent), and China (17 percent), and next  to Malaysia (15 percent). He indicated: "If we are unable to  curb inflation, we will not be a trustworthy partner and there  will be no distribution of profits. The opening of the market  demands competition and investment."    Economist Yves Chaloult, a professor of the University of  Brasilia, said in Bulletin No 9 of the Latin American  Integration publication of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry:  Globalization has strengthened the irreversible trend toward the  regionalization of the economic and political areas, and the  formation of blocs. He added: "Brazil is going through a  profound state crisis" with "constant oscillations in  macroeconomic policies" and "an uncontrolled inflation with a  very high social cost."    Ricupero said: "Brazil must maintain the diversification of  its exports" through regionalization without exclusions by  maintaining its good presence in European markets, and by  expanding its trade with Asia. Pure and simple support for  NAFTA makes no sense. It would be better to negotiate within  Mercosur. He added: "There is no advantage in an overall  negotiation with the United States. They make more money than we  do. Negotiation should be selective, partial, gradual, and  progressive like in the GATT."    According to a World Bank study, the 47 percent of all  Brazilian exports that go to the United States have to compete  with Mexico, which is in a privileged position both because it  is a member of NAFTA and also because of its geographical  position. This is one important factor, in addition to the  complementation of their economies, in the success of  international trade. For example, Brazilian orange juice may be  a loser.    A relationship with NAFTA is threatening to destroy  Mercosur.  In June 1991, Mercosur and the United States signed in  Washington a four plus one agreement creating a consultative  council to discuss trade and investments. Argentina now wants  to become a member of NAFTA, as well as Mercosur, by the middle  of this year. If Brazil has its way, it will have to wait.    Paulo Nogueira Batista finds it very difficult to negotiate  a  free trade agreement with the United States, which has an  economy 11 times larger than Brazil, in addition to a world  leadership that puts its interests in relation to Asia, for  example, way in front of hemispheric integration. Nogueira  Batista said: "Latin-American countries have production and  trade that are of no great importance for the United States.  The United States has an income per capita 10 times greater and  a solid integration can only exist if there is a minimum of  equilibrium."    Nogueira Batista added: "In fact the free trade agreement  between the United States and Mexico is meant to separate rather  then to unite. Manpower transfers have been excluded. The idea  is to foster Mexico's development with U.S. investment and an  increased entry of Mexican products into the U.S. market so that  Mexican manpower will not migrate to the United States."    NAFTA formalizes integration among the United States,  Canada,  and Mexico that already existed in practice. In 1990, the  United States purchased 75.4 percent of Mexican exports. In the  1950's, the United States purchased 75 percent of Brazilian  exports. Today, it barely purchases 19.9 percent of Brazilian  exports.    The Brazilian representative to ALADI noted: "The signing of  this type of agreement does not represent a priority for Brazil,  or for the United States, which intends to remain a world power.  It will not resign itself to becoming a regional power. Chile,  Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, and other Latin American  countries are experiencing an economic adjustment process. They  view negotiations with the United States as a recognition that  will afford them international prestige with financial  repercussions. It will help them finance their balance of  payments requirements."    This view coincides with that of Paula Stern, an economic  adviser during Clinton's electoral campaign, who endorses the  possibility of Chile and Singapore joining NAFTA "and thus  remove Asia's fear that NAFTA will discriminate against Asia or  that the United States has decided to ignore Asia." In fact the  situation is quite the contrary, as U.S. State Secretary Warren  Christopher said: "The 21st Century will be the century of the  Pacific."    Brazil has always used low-cost manpower and its abundant  natural resources to compete on the international market. But  following the great changes that occurred during the past  decades, Brazil must invest much more in science, technology,  and professional qualifications. While the ROK is ready to  become the first country to widely spread secondary education,  the average Brazilian studies for a total of three years and  eight months.    Ambassador Rubens Ricupero notes: "We export  semi-manufactured products to the Asian tigers that process them  into much higher value-added products." He noted: "We have lost  ground following the failure of the protected computer market  policy. In textiles, we have lost ground to China, India, and  Pakistan that have lower cost manpower. Concerning steel,  oranges, iron ore, and soybeans, we rather depend on quantity.  Nowadays, many products exported by Brazil come from  competitive areas like the Tupi motors from Santa Catarina State  or Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company] planes.    Brazilian exports grew from $1.654 billion in 1967 to $27  billion in 1984 due to the promotion policies and the domestic  consumption decline caused by the recession of the early 1980's.  Ever since, Brazilian exports have been damaged by declining  investments and economic instability, thus becoming vulnerable  to competition from Asian and East European countries that have  abundant natural resources and low-cost manpower.    In issue No.23 of the BNDES [National Bank for Economic and  Social Development] Studies [Estudos BNDES] -- An introduction  of Brazilian exports into the international trade of goods: An  area study -- Jorge Chami Batista from the Foundation of Foreign  Trade Studies Center [Fundacao Centro de Estudos de Comercio  Exterior], recommends "increasing the industrial manufacturing  ratio through modern technology and better qualified human  resources" to reduce this vulnerability.    This study confirms that Brazil has "a relatively  diversified  exports structure" and that participation in the international  markets is directly linked to the use of natural resources,  which grows commensurate to the use of these resources.  Nevertheless, the demand for those products for which Brazil  has competitive advantages is growing very slowly.</p>

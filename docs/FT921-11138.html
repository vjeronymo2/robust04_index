			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / (CORRECTED) Arts: Site specific artists - When is an installation a work of art? Lynn MacRitchie finds out Correction (published 4th February 1992) appended to this article. PEOPLE HAVE trouble with unfamiliar art. Installations, for example: they have a lot of trouble with them. They have even more trouble when familiar words like 'site' and 'specific' are dragged in by way of explanation. Put these together, offer site specific installations - that is, work that might not be painting or sculpture (although it could be), made for a setting which does not even offer the comparative security of an art gallery - and you are asking for at best a 'what does it all mean?' and at worst a 'So what?' response. In Rose at Rose Court, Southwark Bridge, until March 14 (Thursday to Saturday, 12.00-19.00), the Wise Taylor Partnership do all of this, in collaboration with CE Property Developments (an Ivy Holdings Company), the BRITEL Fund Trustees and an award from the government Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme. So - what does it all mean? It means that five young artists have the opportunity to work in the unlet spaces of the office development right across the road from the FT building. The catch is that they must in some way address the nature of the site in the work they make for it. The five were carefully selected, invited by curator Georgie Wise because of her feeling that these artists and this building could offer each other something. Rose Court, however, is no romantic setting. A speculative development, like our own home across the road, it offers little that is distinguished or inspiring in its design or layout. Its present predicament, as unwanted or at least unlet office space, and its historic associations - built on the site of the Elizabethan Rose Theatre - are the themes that the works respond to. For the audience, the catch is that, try as we might to cling to art for art's sake, the setting catches us out. Is the unfinished lift, with 'Mirror Here' stencilled on its padded canvas walls, an art work? It could be. It is certainly a successful concept. Is the empty top floor, which offers a panorama of the city spread beneath our feet, an artwork? It is now part or one, 'Evidence' by David Griffiths, which by day draws attention to sections of the view by sticking strips of rose tinted film on the windows. By night, special lighting installed by Griffiths links the interior space with the floodlit city outside. The viewer cannot escape what this building is, what its emptiness implies: the artworks, created with their setting as part of their conception, heighten our response to the whole. The piece by American artist Robert Millar demonstrates this process very clearly. Working on the first floor, his chosen space lies directly above the Rose Theatre remains. Preparing the piece, in which he originally intended to use video, he listed all the questions his musings on the site had raised. Their urgency changed his approach to the work. Now, pushing open the door to his space, rows of questions confront us, painted straight on to the floor in a red and white pattern which corresponds to the plan of the ancient theatre beneath. 'How can we use a site? Who should question? What is value? Who owns history? . . . ' On and on they go, a field of conundrums. 'What Robert did was resurrect all the questions we had tried so hard to bury,' was the candid response of the man from Ivy. Their interest in having artists work in their building is straightforward. Controversial art is a talking point, and could stimulate business. Letting the space is their objective, and if artworks lend tone and attract clients, then art works they are happy to have. Robert Millar hopes that future tenants might leave his work in place - under the carpet, of course. That such challenging art can both survive and grow more meaningful over time is well demonstrated by the Bruce Nauman exhibition now in its last week at the ICA (until 2 February). This American artist, who has exhibited for nearly 30 years, addresses himself to the human condition using just about every technique both familiar and unfamiliar from drawing, painting, sculpture, film and video to installations and works involving his own body or using other performers. Seeing such a wide range of his work confirms the view formed at large survey exhibitions such as Metropolis and the Whitney Biennale of last year, that this is an artist who takes on the big issues, who is neither afraid of his own humanity nor scornful of that of others. That his works may seem bleak does not mean that they are uncaring. Their rigorous construction forces us to contemplate both the grotesqueries of the flesh and the pitifulness of our attempts at communication, our efforts to make contact stumbling into violence and horror. The video pieces are particularly affecting, exploring the nature of the body and its processes, and of language and communication. Early works concentrate on simple actions performed by the artist. Later tapes such as 'Clown Torture' or 'Violent Incident' show scenes endlessly repeated, the performers' words and gestures transformed into metaphors for futility and violence. Nauman's great strength is that, despite the clinical appearance of many of his pieces, be uses difficult media such as video and installation - as well as, and superbly, the traditional tools of drawing and printmaking - for a very simple purpose. He makes us look at and listen to ourselves, he makes us see that flesh is weak and that words can hurt. Bruce Nauman is shown in conjunction with Damien Hirst, an obviously irresistible combination of the old master and the new boy. Hirst's installations are impressive, their components well chosen, their arrangements beautifully realised. I can see what I am supposed to be thinking about, such as in 'Sometimes I avoid people' with its oxygen cylinders and glass cases or surgical paraphernalia or 'The acquired inability to escape' which sets an office chair and work table empty but for cigarettes, lighter and filled ashtray in another huge glass and iron case. 1 can see it all right, but I cannot feel it. This is work as demonstration rather than enquiry, showing rather than exploring. Nothing is shared, and the pieces' perfection forbids further enquiry. Correction (published 4th February 1992).

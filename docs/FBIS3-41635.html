			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Olena Egorove: ``Where Is the National Program of </F> Energy Conservation?'']    [Text] Sergey Kurikin, a member of the political council of  the Party of Greens of Ukraine, told our correspondent his  opinion on the Chernobyl atomic power plant.    Middle and high level officials whose work is connected with  the continuation of operations at the Chernobyl nuclear power  plant are anxious about the prospects of its possible closing.  First, they launched their attack in the fall of 1990, in the  times of the erstwhile USSR. A high commission from Moscow,  checking the security of the blocks, proposed that the safe  blocks that had not exploded in 1986 continue working. That was  just the beginning. A direct attack began in 1992 when nuclear  scientists forced the Ukrainian president to say: ``Nuclear  power engineering has no alternatives.'' Having received  ``carte blanche,'' the nuclear lobby launched a campaign  against antinuclear forces and supported the president through  various seminars and conferences. On 21 September, our deputies  only had to sum up the numerical superiority of the influential  lobbyists.    Will the Supreme Council decisions help us live through a  cold winter? I doubt it since the Chernobyl nuclear power plant  produces only 2 percent of the electricity, and the three  recently closed nuclear blocks are not going to start operating  before spring 1994. At the same time, I can guarantee that the  cost of their repairs will twist the inflation spiral. In  addition, I want to remind you that our losses from operating  the Chernobyl nuclear power plant stand at 200 billion  karbovanetses [K] (in 1990 prices). The work on this power  plant and its operation will cost us K12 billion additionally.  This financial prognosis was prepared by former plant manager  Shcherbina.    Our deputies often cite Russia as an example of safely  operating nuclear power plants. However, why not take the  United States which has not been constructing nuclear power  plants for decades now?    As for United States citizens, they learn from their  mistakes. After the Three Mile Island accident, they do not  identify technical progress with the development of nuclear  power engineering.    Mankind has not yet created wasteless nuclear power  engineering. V. Mikhaylov, Russian minister of nuclear power  engineering, explained this tactfully at a Tokyo press  conference. Thus, the waste from Russian nuclear power plants  will be poured into the Sea of Japan and, according to  Mikhaylov, it is no more poisonous than the Japanese nuclear  waste. So, no problems....    Where are we going to spill our nuclear waste? Into the  Dnieper River or the Black Sea?    Currently, our children's destiny is in the hands of the so-  called Chernobyl reanimators.</p>

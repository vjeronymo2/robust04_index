			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Change of ownership MY SON and I own a three-bedroom holiday house in Wales. But I am 91 and my wife 90 and we are no longer able to go. I am considering giving my half share to my daughter-in-law. How should I do this? Also, I have two sons, five grand-children and one great grand-child. Are there advantages in forming a family trust? You could give the home to your daughter-in-law, or in trust for your children and grandchildren. For inheritance tax purposes, if you gave it away but continued to use it without paying rent, you could be caught by the 'gift with reservation' rules. But if you can no longer use it, you are no longer getting a benefit from it and the gift can be made without these rules applying. The effect of the gift with reservation rules would be that the property would stay in your estate for IHT purposes even though you had given it away. Should you die within the next three years, the value of the gift will become chargeable to IHT. But if property values increase over the next few years, then the increase in value will escape IHT. Once you have survived for three years, then tapering relief would apply. But this might not be helpful as the gift could be covered by your nil rate band, so other assets in your estate would be subject to IHT at the full rate. For the gift to create the IHT savings you propose, you would need to live for seven years so that the gift becomes exempt fully. It might be worth considering other assets in your estate which could be gifted. It would be possible for these to be transferred into a trust for the benefit of your children/grand-children. One of the drawbacks of giving property is that, if the value of the property increases in the future, there could be capital gains tax disadvantages. If your daughter-in-law were to sell the house at some future time, the probate value might be higher than the present value so less CGT would be payable. You need to weigh possible IHT savings against potential CGT disadvantages. This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of Stoy Hayward.

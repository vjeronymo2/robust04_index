			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: The pre-Christmas rally finally runs out of steam - Market report There was a distinct shortage of genuine trading activity on the London equity market yesterday as the City wound down for the Christmas holiday. However, there was no shortage of anguish around the trading desks which, the Stock Exchange insisted, had to stay open until the usual 4.30pm close. 'Everyone was happy to work the half-day, which would have tied in perfectly with the futures market closing at 12.10pm. But to keep the cash market open until 4.30pm was simply silly,' said the head dealer at one of the big European banks. He said most of the large marketmaking firms cut manning levels to the minimum after lunch, leaving only a skeleton staff. Earlier in the session there was talk that a large OTC option was due to expire at the official close and that the market could have been driven sharply higher pre the expiry. It was a series of OTC expiries that were deemed responsible for the steep rise in the FT-SE 100 index between Christmas and the New Year last year, when the index jumped almost 50 points in a single session. In the event the market went out with a whimper, with equities never appearing to struggle but simply lacking any upward impetus and suffering from an acute attack of turnover starvation. Turnover for the whole session crept up to 291.8m, with non-FT-SE stocks accounting for almost 70 per cent of the total, well ahead of the usual ratio between leaders and second-liners. Disgruntled dealers pointed out that turnover in the truncated pre-Christmas session last year was 242.1m. The FT-SE 100 index ended the day a net 8.3 off at 3,083.4, its first decline in six trading sessions, but remained 69.8, or 2.3 per cent, higher on the week. The driving force behind the market this week has been the emergence of the much expected agreed bid for Portals, the security paper manufacturer, from De La Rue, and the Trafalgar House bid for Northern Electric. The Northern bid triggered a wave of takeover speculation throughout the utilities areas. Second-liners, strongly outpaced by the leaders, held up reasonably well, with the FT-SE Mid 250 managing a modest 1.4 improvement at 3,487.3, for a week's gain of 50.2, or 1.5 per cent. The 100 index kicked off the session around 4.4 lower at 3,087.3, and ignored the latest good showing from the US, where the Dow Jones Average closed 13 points higher. Dealers were impressed with the Dow's performance. They said it came in spite of a poor outcome to the latest bond auction, of five-year notes, and worries about Mexico and other South American countries. But with very little genuine business being offered to the market, share prices did no more than drift easier throughout the day. Another firm opening by Wall Street, had little impact on sentiment in London, and the City's dealing desks were vacated the second the market closed. Features in equities were few and far between, but the property sector continued its recent strong showing and provided the FT-SE 100 with its two best individual performers, MEPC and Land Securities. Property stocks have raced higher since Barings, the merchant bank acting on behalf of an investment consortium, made a Pounds 1.5bn takeover bid for St Martins Property, owned by the Kuwaiti government. BAT Industries was the second-heaviest traded FT-SE stock, and edged higher after its acquisition of American Tobacco was given the green light by the US authorities. Kleinwort Benson shares continued to stand out in the merchant banks, with murmurs around the market suggesting that the bank could well attract the attentions of an overseas predator anxious to expand its presence in European equities.</p>

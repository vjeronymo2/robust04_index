			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Analysts revise Kingfisher forecasts Shares in Kingfisher, the retailing group, fell 37p to 678p after the company warned that trading conditions were still 'patchy', and announced that total sales for the 24 weeks to January 15 were up 4 per cent. After Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer which rushed out a profits warning earlier this month, Kingfisher is the only leading retailer to have issued what analysts called a 'disappointing' trading statement. Analysts cut their profits forecasts for the full year from between Pounds 300m and Pounds 320m to about Pounds 290m to Pounds 300m. Like-for-like sales, which exclude store openings and closures, were up 4.4 per cent at B&amp;Q, 3.9 per cent at Superdrug, and 3.3 per cent at Woolworth over the same period. But sales were down 3.3 per cent at Comet, and 7.1 per cent at Darty, France's biggest electrical chain which Kingfisher acquired for a total of Pounds 1bn last February. Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman, said Comet, like Dixons, had suffered from the price war in the computer games console market, but said that should not have come as a surprise. 'This is a perfectly normal pattern with high-growth fashion products of this type,' he said. Sir Geoffrey added that Darty had suffered from the French recession and he suspected the recovery in France 'might be a bit later than we originally thought a year ago'. He pointed out, however, that Darty's figures were 'not dramatically out of line' with expectations. He said operating margins were lower than the year before, but the fall had been planned and was part of Kingfisher's strategy of investing in providing better prices, range and service. 'You expect the investment has to come a bit ahead of the volume increase,' he said. 'I am confident that value retailing is the best way forward for Kingfisher.' See Lex</p>

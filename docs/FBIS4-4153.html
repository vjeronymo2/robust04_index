			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Chen Muhua,  vice-chairman of China's National People's Congress Standing  Committee (NPC), left here today for New York to attend a  ceremony for the presentation of 1994 Maurice Pate Award of the  United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).    Chen is also president of the All-China Women's Federation.    The UNICEF has decided to confer the award on the All-China  Women's Federation in recognition of its role in promoting the  Chinese urban and rural women's involvement in development,  helping them learn culture and technology and raising their  social status and improving the survival, health and development  of women and children.    The award was set up in 1965 in commemoration of Maurice  Pate, the first executive director of the UNICEF. The All-China  Women's Federation is the first recipient of the award as a  non-governmental organization in China.    Seeing Chen off at the airport were Huang Qizao,  vice-president of the federation, Wang Shuming, deputy  secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee, and Dr. Robert  Parker, senior programme officer of the UNICEF.</p>

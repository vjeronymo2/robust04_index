			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / People: Michael Dowdall Dairy Crest, the processing arm of the Milk Marketing Board, has announced the appointment of Michael Dowdall as chairman. Dowdall will see the company through its flotation next year after the abolition of the board in November and the deregulation of Britain's Pounds 3.3bn milk business. Dowdall, 64, is currently chairman of the Gaymer group and Geest, the bananas and food processing company. He is also a director of BPB Industries and NFU Mutual Insurance company. He succeeds Geoffrey John who has presided over Dairy Crest's transformation over the past six years from a government organisation into a commercially-run company and who will remain as deputy chairman to oversee the hand-over. John says he was unable to devote enough time to issues concerning the flotation. Dowdall will bring strong operational skills to Dairy Crest. He retired as a director of Unilever in 1991, but while there built a reputation as a strong manager. As detergents co-ordinator, he was responsible for merging all of the company's European national detergent businesses into one operation. 'He'll do a bit more than just chair meetings,' says one former colleague.</p>

As yet, and  after nearly one month, this document remains unsigned. When  will it be signed and where.?    [Al-Iryani] Really, it is regrettable that one month has  passed and the document is still unsigned. The reason is that  some wish to sign it abroad. This principle is welcomed. But,  unfortunately, it has delayed the signing of the document more  than needed. We thank God that we reached a final agreement  that it will be signed on 20 of this month in the capital of the  fraternal Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.    Personally, I had hoped that this document would be signed  24  hours after it was adopted.    [Birru] Will President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice  President 'Ali salim al-Bid leave for Amman to sign the document?    [Al-Iryani] This is what has been agreed. I believe this  will  take place.    [Birru] After this, will Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid  return to Sanaa?    [Al-Iryani] First of all, the document of pledge and accord  is a document to end a crisis. The crisis with all its  manifestations and consequences is known to all, specifically by  the Yemeni people. Thus, the signing should end this crisis that  has disturbed the people. One of the most important  manifestations as to the end of the crisis, or the most  important obligation resulting from the signing is that the  state institutions, the Presidential Council, the Council of  Ministers, and the House of Representatives should meet with all  their members. If any of the present partitioning manifestations  remains, this means a violation of the document and an evasion  of its implementation.    [Birru] The Yemeni Socialist Party has asked for security  guarantees before signing the document and before Vice President  'Ali Salim al-Bid returns to Sanaa. What are these guarantees?    [Al-Iryani] These are arrangements on which agreement will  be  reached, God willing, before the departure. In my opinion,  these will be specific arrangements that will be immediately  implemented upon the signature of the competent official  quarters. These quarrters, of course, cannot start  implementation, except after the state bodies meet to give them  instructions for implementing them. There is no dispute about  the adoption of security arrangements and implementing them.  However, the present division obstructs the implementaton of  these guarantees. God willing, agreement will be reached on the  measures that will lead to implementation. All of this, in the  end, depends on signing the document and on the state officials  reassuming their duties to implement these guarantees.    [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, it is noted that the  Socialist Party and all its officials, including the prime  minister, have moved to Aden. They are making decisions and  appointing officials in south Yemen, the last of which was  appointing a governor for Abyan area. How do you interpret this  escalation?    [Al-Iryani] I do not consider it as evidence of goodwill.  But let us assume that the crisis atmosphere imposes some  inappropriate and unacceptable behaviors. The signing of the  document is sure to end all these practices, otherwise, all  efforts made to conclude this document will be useless. The  document now belongs to the whole Yemeni people, and no one can  claim that he possesses it or that he is authorized to implement  it by himself. Likewise, no executive authority party can avoid  implementing it. Let us view all the regrettable developments  and all the practices that are going on with good intentions.  Let us consider them as imposed by the atmosphere of crisis  although these practices are unconstitutional.    What is important is the implementation after signing of the  document. The first and most important test is the unity of the  political leadership in words and deeds as stipulated by the  document of pledge and accord. If this was not realized, I say  that from now that the responsibility will be shouldered by  those who did not commit themselves to its text.    [Birru] You mean that the current escalation is a temporary  one and, in your view, will be over after the signing of the  document of pledge and accord?    [Al-Iryani] This is true if we consider good intentions for  bad behaviors.    [Birru] Dr. al-Iryani, how do you view the situation? What  is on the horizon?    [Al-Iryani] I believe the signing of this national document,  that belongs to the Yemeni people now, will be the test of  commitment to the implementation and to adherence to unity and  democracy. Any action that prevents the state's establishments  from implementing the text of the accord will be a hostile  action toward the Yemeni people as a whole.    [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Thank you.</p>

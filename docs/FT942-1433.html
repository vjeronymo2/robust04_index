			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Pensions - The White Paper: Inflation-link guarantee to disappear - Deborah Harrison on the 'double blow' proposed changes in the administration of schemes may deal to consumers In April 1997 the government will remove an important inflation-linked guarantee - known as the guaranteed minimum pension or GMP - provided by the majority of UK company pension schemes. Experts say the change will simplify company scheme administration, but the consumer will lose out. The measure will create a long-term net saving to the Exchequer of Pounds 1.5bn in the year 2050. The vast majority of final salary schemes in the UK contract the entire scheme membership out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps) and in return pay a reduced rate of National Insurance contribution. They also have to guarantee to provide a replacement pension that is at least the equivalent in value to Serps. However, at present contracted-out members do not forfeit the entire Serps pension but retain an element of inflation-linked top-up from the state scheme. This Serps-matching requirement is particularly valuable for early leavers because the deferred Serps pension entitlement is increased each year in line with earnings inflation, unlike most private schemes. Serps pensions are based on 20 per cent to 25 per cent of NI 'band earnings' - that is, earnings between Pounds 2,964 and Pounds 22,360 for the current tax year. Personal pensions and group money purchase schemes contracted out of Serps, which provide a pension based on investment returns rather than on the individual's final salary, do not have to provide a GMP. After 1997 final salary schemes will no longer have to provide the GMP in order to contract members out of Serps. Instead there will be a general test based on the 'overall quality of the total benefits offered' which, the government said, 'should be superior to those offered in Serps'. Ms Penny Webster, partner with actuarial consultants Bacon &amp; Woodrow, said: 'Scheme members will suffer a double blow. They will lose the valuable top-up between the value of the GMP and the value of Serps that is currently provided by the state scheme. 'They will also lose the full inflation-linking of the GMP, particularly where it is deferred for early leavers. 'The government has simplified the system but at the expense of the consumer.' Ms Joanne Segars, pensions officer at the Trades Union Congress, said: 'In light of (Robert) Maxwell and the personal pensions scandal, the government should be taking the lead in providing more pension security, not weakening it.' The government said the change, which severs the link between contracted-out occupational schemes and Serps, will simplify and speed up the move to equal pensions for men and women - a requirement of European Union law. GMPs are based on the value of Serps and therefore increase at a different rate for men and women because men are able to draw the state pension at 65 and women at 60. The white paper also changes the terms for the rebate of NI contributions paid to contracted-out schemes. The rebate is calculated as a percentage of band earnings and for the current tax year is 4.8 per cent (5.4 per cent with tax relief). Those with personal pensions, who are aged 30 or over, receive an extra 1 per cent. The government said that all money purchase schemes would in future be entitled to the bonus for older members but that final salary schemes will continue to receive a flat-rate rebate. Moreover, when the government actuary sets the new rebate level in 1997 it is expected to be higher than the existing figure. The government hopes this will encourage more people to opt out of Serps to reduce the long-term financial pressure on the state scheme. The white paper also introduces changes to improve the flexibility of personal pensions. First, by extending the limited age-related rebate system the government aims to make it attractive for employees of all ages to opt out of Serps whether they have an individual personal pension or are members of a contracted-out group money purchase scheme. A second boost to personal pensions is the measure to give investors greater flexibility over when they convert their investment into an annuity. The measure would allow individuals to keep their pension fund fully invested and to postpone the annuity purchase to any age up to 75, instead of immediately on retirement as at present.</p>

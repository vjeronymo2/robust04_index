			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pendragon helped by revived demand for new upmarket cars A revival in demand for new upmarket cars lay behind a 32 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.06m at Pendragon, the executive and luxury car dealer, in the six months to June. Mr Trevor Finn, chief executive, explained that with used car values rising towards the levels for new cars, people were more likely to buy new. New car sales contributed Pounds 6.2m of gross profits, against Pounds 4.6m last time. He suggested that 'principals of industry' were giving signals that the recession was now over and that they were making car purchases they had previously postponed. This, Mr Finn said, helped to explain why the group's total new registrations grew by 20 per cent over last time, against a 14 per cent rise in the whole car market. Group turnover climbed 56 per cent from Pounds 119.6m to Pounds 186.9m, including Pounds 2.46m from acquisitions. Growth in operating profits was less dramatic at 39 per cent, from Pounds 3.57m to Pounds 4.94m, including Pounds 68,000 from acquisitions. Mr Ian Wheeler, finance director, said the margin slippage was due to the addition of Ford, Peugeot and additional Rover franchises, which added Pounds 25m turnover to last time's Pounds 5.5m in the group's EC volume car sector. This greater turnover at smaller margin, he said, had a dilutive effect across the group. Gross profits from used car sales were flat at Pounds 2.2m, while after sales business contributed Pounds 12.4 (Pounds 9.4m). Mr Finn said that luxury cars owners were more likely to return to the seller than turn to Kwik-Fit or the like. Contract hire chipped in Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 900,000), illustrating the rise in values in the used car market. Interest payable rose to Pounds 888,000 (Pounds 495,000) on borrowings up at Pounds 13.4m (Pounds 8.2m at end-December). The interim dividend is lifted to 2.7p (2.4p), payable from earnings up 20 per cent to 7.3p (6.1p) per share.</p>

Initially, the  plant was equipped with two hydroelectric units with RO123-V-84  turbines; the new power station employs commercially produced  pump units serving as turbines and induction motors running as  generators. This design has advantages both from the cost and  delivery schedule viewpoints. Data on the power plant equipment  option costs in 1990 prices are summarized. The range of factors  which must be taken into account is selecting the pump is  outlined. Analyses show that pump impellers have a 75%  efficiency within a broad head range, which is lower than that  of turbines, but this is compensated for by the low cost of  equipment which is cheaper by close to tenfold. The particular  features of induction motors make them especially suitable at  small power plants with a low head. The power plant overhaul was  financed by the Vitebsk electric grids under the leadership of  G.I. Kubarovskiy; plant construction and erection were conducted  by the Girdotekhnik Association (Lithuania) and Belyy Ugol  enterprise under the direction of N.V. Shanin.

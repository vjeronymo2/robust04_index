			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Roving Wallenbergs stay true to home - Overseas expansion will not jeopardise family's commitment to Sweden The sweeping industrial domain built up over 140 years by Sweden's Wallenberg family is entering a new phase after overcoming most of the debilitating effects of a long recession. With profits again flowing fast in most of the companies under the family's control, the Wallenbergs are looking to strengthen their presence in growth industries and are eyeing investment opportunities overseas. Individual companies, such as Astra, Ericsson, Electrolux and the forestry group Stora, have the income to support long-term development strategies, both in new technologies and new markets. 'Now the defence is over. We think the ship is in very good order and it is time to be a bit more offensive again,' says Mr Claes Dahlback, chief executive of Investor, the holding company that forms the core of the Wallenberg sphere. He says Investor 'has the radar on' for new investments, especially overseas. The trend is set to move the empire away from its traditional dependence on low-growth cyclical industries towards technology-based industries, such as pharmaceuticals, medical technology, telecommunications and, perhaps, the media. Senior family members, however, will not be drawn on speculation about individual companies - for example, whether they might sell out of SKF, the ball-bearings maker, or float some of Investor's 100 per cent holding in Saab-Scania, the vehicle and aircraft maker. The emphasis, however, will be on evolution, rather than dramatic changes of direction. They also stress that any move to build up holdings overseas will be limited  -not more than 10 per cent of Investor's total portfolio - and will not jeopardise the family's commitment to Sweden. That commitment and the management capabilities of the Wallenbergs are now more than ever important for Sweden, given the unprecedented dominance the empire exerts over the country's industry. In annual turnover terms, Wallenberg companies account for more than SKr500bn (Dollars 65bn), more than the combined total of the next three largest owners, the state, Volvo and Svenska Handelsbanken. But the issue of how effectively the Wallenbergs have wielded their power and whether such a hegemony is healthy for Sweden's industrial economy, is seldom debated in public in Sweden. There are, however, serious concerns that the Wallenberg record, though impressive, has not always been flawless and that in the long term it is perilous for the country to be so dependent on one family. The LO, the federation of blue-collar trade unions, has voiced its concern. 'We need strong industrial leaders and we need stable ownership in Sweden, but we have too few groups and too little competition,' says Mr Per Olof Edin, chief economist at the LO. 'It would be good if more foreign owners came to Sweden and established themselves as strong leaders of industrial companies.' There is also the criticism that the results of Wallenberg companies - like those of all Swedish exporters - have been exaggerated by devaluations in 1982 and 1992. 'The situation is like a runner who sets a world record for the 100 metres,' wrote Mr Per Afrell, business editor of the newspaper Dagens Nyheter. 'The problem is he had a downhill slope, the wind behind him and he ran only 80 metres.' Critics also say the Wallenberg investment performance has been unspectacular and would have been worse than the overall market without the phenomenal performance of Astra, the high-flying pharmaceuticals group. There are examples of questionable judgment within the empire. In the pulp and paper industry, the Wallenbergs made expensive acquisitions just when the cycle was turning down - most notably that of the German group Feldmuhle by Stora in 1990 for DM4bn (Dollars 2.6bn). They also took full control of Saab-Scania in 1991, just as it was heading into a trough. More recently, Incentive, a Wallenberg industrial group, agreed in June to sell its stake in Esab, the welding equipment supplier, to Charter, a UK company, at SKr345 a share. Institutional shareholders maintained the price was too low and forced Charter to raise its bid to SKr380. 'The Wallenberg dominance is very dangerous because nothing develops without competition,' says a senior Swedish businessman. 'When things get too intertwined it's like a group of children playing - nobody sticks their neck out except one or two leaders. That will not lead to creative solutions which Sweden badly needs at the moment.' In spite of such reservations, the majority view in Swedish business is that the Wallenberg record of successes over four generations, which is unmatched by any other family dynasty, comfortably outweighs the failures. SKF, which invented ball-bearings in the 1920s, and Electrolux, which first produced a vacuum cleaner in 1912, were launched during the heyday of industrial innovation. These companies have continued to evolve and hold their own as market leaders. Electrolux has grown to become the biggest supplier of household appliances in the world. In the forestry sector, the Wallenbergs have transformed Stora, through acquisitions and divestments, from a diversified group into Europe's biggest pulp and paper company. In the cases of Astra, the pharmaceuticals group, and Ericsson, the telecommunications company, the empire has produced successes based on modern technology. Profits growth at Astra has outstripped turnover growth for each of the past 16 years. Ericsson ran into trouble in the 1980s as it got bogged down in the computer business, but it sold out of computers, refocused on telecommunications and has become a world leader in mobile telephony. The Wallenbergs also steered Asea into the merger with Switzerland's Brown Boveri in 1988, creating the engineering giant ABB. Half controlled by the Wallenbergs, ABB was recently voted Europe's most respected company in a Financial Times poll. There is a strong belief in Sweden that without the Wallenbergs' commitment to the country and their willingness to invest for the long term, Sweden would not have produced such an array of international companies. Wallenberg companies have invested heavily overseas in recent years, in some cases retaining as little as 10 per cent of their production in Sweden. But, unlike family concerns, such as the Ikea retail organisation of the Kamprad family and Tetra Pak, the packaging group owned by the Rausing family, their headquarters and ownership remains in the country. Some fear that without the Wallenbergs much of Swedish industry would migrate. Hence, there is widespread anxiety in Sweden over moves within the European Union - at present dormant - to rule against the kind of weighted share structures that allow companies to be tightly controlled by minority shareholders. Such a ruling would force the Wallenbergs to restructure their empire dramatically. 'We simply don't have the capital to be able to control our own companies, so we would face an exodus of ownership,' says Mr Magnus Lemmel, chief executive of the Federation of Swedish Industries. As long as that threat remains buried in the pile of shelved initiatives in Brussels, the principal task remaining for Mr Peter Wallenberg, the keeper of the fourth generation of Wallenberg entrepreneurship, is to manage the smooth transition of the inheritance to Jacob and Marcus Wallenberg, his son and nephew. And he does not consider that inheritance to be any kind of burden on the nation. 'As long as we perform at least as well or better than other equivalent industries; as long as we behave as genuine Swedes in Sweden, meaning that we live here, we pay this country's taxes and we fulfil all our duties more than just the minimum, then we will do nothing that will be against the best interests of the country.' This is the last in the series on the Wallenbergs. The previous articles appeared on September 1 and 2.</p>

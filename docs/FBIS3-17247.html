At Workers' Request, Naturally"]    [Text] At the briefing for journalists Sunday morning,  Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, the head of the kray administration, and  the Vladimir Ignatenko, the president's Maritime Kray  representative, announced that the date for elections to the  Maritime Kray Duma and local self-rule bodies has been changed.    Yevgeniy Nazdratenko said that on 19 March he signed Decree  No. 116, which moves the date of elections from 27 March 1994 to  23 October 1994. Point 3 of this decree instructs the kray  administration's financial services to redirect the money  appropriated in the kray budget for conducting elections to  Maritime Kray cities and rayons to be used for social protection  of low- income citizens.    Nazdratenko said the cost of these elections to the Maritime  Kray budget amounts to R3 billion. The Central Electoral  Commission allocated only R600 million. "We absolutely cannot  take R2.4 billion out of the local budget on the threshold of  spring sowing," said Nazdratenko and, in reply to journalists'  questions, added: "If there is no money for elections in the  fall, we will have to move them again."    In addition, Nazdratenko reminded the gathering that a  succession of court actions by a number of Maritime Kray  political parties against the kray administration had been  caused precisely because the parties considered it necessary to  move up the elections. The kray court rejected the claims, but  the parties which did not agree with the outcome appealed to the  Supreme Court. "Therefore," said Nazdratenko, "we accommodated  the wish of these people."    It was especially emphasized at the briefing that Decree No.  116 had the concurrence of the Central Electoral Commission.    At the same time, in the opinion of Ye. Nazdratenko and V.  Ignatenko, the rights of already-nominated candidates for  deputies are not violated in any way. In the fall they will have  the same legal status as now, but in addition will be able to  familiarize the voters much better with their views and  programs. "This time will allow us to avoid the element of  chance that was present in the short State Duma election  campaign," said Nazdratenko.    In short, the election campaign continues.    As was announced at the briefing, Maritime Kray is not alone  in its decision to move up the elections--17 Russian oblasts  already have done so.    Presidential representative Vladimir Ignatenko said that  postponement of elections was to a considerable extent also  prompted by forecasts of lower political activity of the  population, which already had manifested itself during the 12  December elections.    Ignatenko particularly emphasized that the decision to move  the elections is not linked in any way to official charges the  kray procuracy had brought against some officials in the  Vladivostok administration and their suspension from their job  for the time of inquiry. Moreover, in Ignatenko's opinion, those  who are registered as candidates for deputy seats now get an  excellent opportunity to explain in detail their political views  and programs.</p>

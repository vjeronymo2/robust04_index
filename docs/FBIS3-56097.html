[Gamov] Georgiy Grigoryevich, are you in the hot seat?    [Lukava] I certainly am....    [Gamov] When you opened the Duma session many people drew  attention to your slight Georgian accent...    [Lukava] I am indeed a Georgian by nationality.    [Gamov] Since Stalin not a single Georgian has held such a  high post in Russia.

[Lukava] Certainly not... Although I am in reality a member  of the Russian Communist Party I was nominated to the Duma by  the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia on the grounds that in  July last year I took part in that party's scientific and  practical conference at which I delivered a report entitled  "Spiritual Readiness and Its Role in Overcoming the Crisis."  But having found myself in the chair I am trying to be  absolutely impartial and I am giving all deputies irrespective  of party allegiance the opportunity to speak. [Lukava ends]    Yesterday several deputies suggested that Georgiy Lukava  surrender his seat to a more competent deputy. But Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, from a  microphone, gave the provisional speaker categorical  instructions not to go anywhere, to turn off the microphones,  and not to allow anyone onto the platform and if necessary to  "call the militia."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A Foreign Ministry official has stated the  following to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY:    The Iraqi Foreign Ministry is amazed at the unwarranted  decision of the U.S. Department of State to ask the head of the  Iraqi interests section to leave the United States. By way of  justifying its inexcusable decision, the Department of State  contended that the Iraqi diplomat, who has since returned to  Baghdad, had been engaged in diplomatic and media activity  incompatible with the agreement under which the two sides opened  sections for looking after Iraqi and American interests in  Baghdad and Washington.    Our interests section head in Washington, the Foreign  Ministry statement went on, never engaged in any action,  conduct, or activity incompatible with the most basic principles  of diplomacy. Our interests section head in Washington was not  involved in anything beyond the kind of activities that occupied  his predecessor, to whom the U.S. Department of State never  objected. We, therefore, think that there is no real  justification for the American Department of State's decision.  The decision may have been motivated by political or  psychological factors that have no connection with the  activities of the head of the Iraqi interests section in  Washington.    In any case, we will increase the staff of our interests  section in Washington in accordance with the bilateral  agreement. The American interests section in Baghad operates  out of the Polish Embassy under the Polish flag.</p>

Scientific research is concentrating on  telecommunications. Four projects that require a global  investment of 42 billion lire have been accepted for facilitated  contributions from the IMI [Italian Institute for Financing Real  and Personal Property] fund. The OK came after approval from  University and Scientific Research Minister Umberto Colombo.  The companies concerned are Telespazio (of the IRI-STET  [Institute for the Reconstruction of Industry - Turin Telephone  Finance Company] group), Ericsson Fatme, FIAR (IRI-Finmeccanica)  and ARE [Electrical Radio Applications] (Racal Electronics).  The goal of the Telespazio project is to develop an automation  systems network for telecommunications equipment at a total  budgeted cost of four billion lire. On the other hand 20  billion is to be invested in Ericsson Fatme. In this case  systems should be constructed for digitizing telecommunications  networks. FIAR's applied research plan provides for an  expenditure of 15 billion in the remote sensing sector.    The fourth project that has been given the go-ahead for  facilitated funding concerns the activation of apparatus for  subscribers and network terminals for ISDN [integrated services  digital network] telematic services. It will be perfected, with  an investment of 3.2 billion lire, by ARE (Electrical Radio  Applications), a company based in Legnano and connected with the  British group Racal Electronics.    Meanwhile, Italsiel of the Finsiel group will participate in  the realization of the "Care Telematics Projects," for a  European information system for food safety. An international  consortium (that Italsiel is part of) will manage the project  that will be coordinated by the World Health Organization. The  Care telematics projects form part of the larger program called  ENS (European Nervous System) that the EU [European Union] has  launched for the diffusion of telematic exchanges between the  administrations of EC countries.</p>

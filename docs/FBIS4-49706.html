			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- As construction of the  many transport infrastructure projects is beginning to switch  on, a huge investment market is being shaped in China's  railways, highways, ports, civil aviation and other sectors,  providing a rare chance for foreign investors.    The Chinese Government has placed great expectations on  overseas funds in its attempt to ease up the strained  transportation capacity, which has been a major bottleneck  hampering the development of the national economy in recent  years.    In its general outline for the last decade of the century,  the Chinese Government has attached prime importance to the  construction of transport infrastructure.    At the beginning of the 1990s, the central government  defined  nearly 400 large and medium-sized transport infrastructure  construction projects, with a predicted budget of over 700  billion yuan. Among the 151 key construction projects for 1994,  which were announced last week by the State Planning Commission,  33 belong to the field of transportation.    In the past few years China's construction of transport  infrastructure has experienced a fairly fast development. At  present the country has 54,000 km of railways, 1.075 million km  of highways, over 300 deep-water berths and more than 40 large  and medium-sized civil airports.    However, experts estimate that the existing infrastructure  is  capable of carrying only about 60 percent of the country's total  transport demand. Railways and highways have been much more  intensively used than called for by their designed capacity.  Meanwhile, in important ports ships have to queue up for days  for a berth to load or unload.    According to plans of related departments, by the end of  this  century China will have 70,000 km of operating railways, 1.2  million km of highways, and the number of deep-water berths in  coastal ports will exceed 600, basically alleviating the tight  transport condition.    To make sure that these plans are fulfilled, while expanding  the state investment, the Chinese Government actively encourages  foreign investors to participate in these fields, with  preferential policies drafted to ensure profits for foreign  businessmen.    Foreign funds have, in fact, played a significant role in  China's construction of transport infrastructure in recent years.    Since 1979, the country's rail construction has used loans  of  some 2.06 billion U.S. dollars from the Japanese Overseas  Economic Cooperation Fund, and 1.62 billion U.S. dollars from  the World Bank. With the help of which more than 5,700 km of new  railways have been constructed and 6,500 km of old rail lines  relaid.    To date more than two billion U.S. dollars in overseas loans  has been used to construct more than 50 deepwater berths of  10,000-ton class, largely promoting the handling capacity of  China's inland and sea ports.    So far foreign funds going to China's transport  infrastructure have mainly come from the World Bank, the  Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and the Asian  Development Bank. To raise more construction funds, the Chinese  Government is actively exploring even more extensive foreign  fund sources, including foreign governments, financial groups,  investment institutions and entrepreneurs.    China has instituted preferential policies on tax exemption  and reduction, rational sharing of profits and some other  aspects for foreign investors. Moreover, many restrictions have  been lifted to open a much wider investment field for overseas  businessmen.    Sources said that all civil aviation infrastructure, except  for the air surveillance system, are open to foreign funds;  foreign businessmen can invest exclusively to build docks and  open navigation channels and are allowed to construct and manage  special port areas and docks on the tracts of land they have  invested in.    In addition, China's transport infrastructure construction  has also introduced the "build, operate and transfer"  arrangement, which refers to a scheme in which foreign  businessmen invest in the construction of a project, manage it  for a fixed time, then hand over the management and ownership to  the local government. Due to its huge potential profits, this  arrangement has aroused deep interest among foreign investors.    Most of China's basic industries have defined a recovery  rate  higher than the credit interest rate on the international  financial market. Experts indicate that China's transport  infrastructure has the characteristics of low risk and a high  recovery rate, where foreign funds will surely have bright  prospects.    At present, the planned Beijing-Shanghai express railway,  the  national trunk highway network, and a large number of big port  and airport projects have become the focus of foreign investors'  attention, who are trying to negotiate with related Chinese  departments and competing with each other for a share in the  huge investment market.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / ICI wins engineering prize ICI yesterday won the Royal Academy of Engineering MacRobert Award, the UK's premier prize for innovation in engineering, for developing a new refrigerant to replace ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), Andrew Baxter writes. The Pounds 50,000 award, which attracted more than 50 entrants, was presented at the Science Museum in London by the Duke of Edinburgh. It recognises ICI's achievement in developing KLEA 134a and opening three production plants worldwide - a Pounds 250m investment that has given the company a leading share in a worldwide market potentially worth more than Pounds 1bn. ICI brought together engineers and chemists for the project in 1987, using teamwork to accelerate the development process. Its latest plant, in Japan, opened last week only five years after the team identified the refrigerant's molecule. The engineers sharing the award were (from top) Frank Maslen, John Scott, team leader Denis Henderson and Rachel Spooncer.</p>

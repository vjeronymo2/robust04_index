			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: US economy Fears of bubbles and market crashes are all the rage this season, though it is a little hard to understand why. True, money has been shifting from low-risk bank deposits to bonds and shares, stretching valuations somewhat. But while there has been a shift in the mix of financial assets held, there is little sign of the margin-trading and grotesque overvaluation which characterises genuine speculative booms. Indeed, a moderate asset-price inflation may be beneficial. Private-sector balance sheets were severely strained by high borrowings and falling asset prices in the recession. To the extent that rising asset prices increase wealth, that problem is eased. Such asset-price rises only become a general inflationary threat if they encourage consumers to use their increased wealth as collateral for unsustainable borrowing and consumption. Such an outcome looks extremely unlikely. The current level of asset prices thus gives little reason for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. With the US economy still growing below its long-run productive potential, and demand in the world economy subdued, near-term inflationary fears look overdone. Indeed, disappointing first-half, and potentially third-quarter, US growth figures might argue for a further easing. Hopes of stronger growth will, however, probably keep Fed policy on hold until 1994. A rise in interest rates then as the economy grows is a more credible threat to market valuations than a bursting bubble now.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Leading Article: New patterns in Europe Anyone who points out that the so-called European elections are in reality no more than 12 separate national opinion polls almost invariably goes on to deduce some Europe-wide pattern or moral from their results. This time even the almost universal expectation, that voters would use the occasion to express disgust with their incumbent governments, proved only very patchily true. But something like a general law on that point can be deduced, namely that governments do worst when elections are genuinely mid-term. The nearer voters are to a general election, whether behind or in front, the more indulgent they may be towards governing parties, presumably because they are thinking harder about the alternative. Thus while the Spanish electorate no longer felt any obligation to stand by its year-old support for the scandal-ridden Socialists, Greek and Italian voters did re-endorse their more recently elected governments (of left and right respectively), while German voters gave a sharp warning to the opposition Social Democrats not to count on a general election victory in October. The Luxembourg government found the ideal solution: it held its general election on the same day as the European one, and did handsomely in both. If all member states followed that example the European election would get less media coverage, but more people would vote in it; and it would be a striking affirmation of European unity, since all EU citizens would be choosing their national parliaments on the same day. But national governments would probably find it even more difficult to synchronise their political calendars than to agree on a single European time zone, or indeed a single currency. Other ways of imparting a sense of common destiny to the peoples of Europe need to be found. One of the more obvious, prescribed in the Treaty of Rome but still not implemented, would be to elect the European parliament on an EU-wide system. Proportional system That would of course have to be a proportional system, which is why the Conservative party has resolutely resisted it for mainland Britain (even while imposing it on Northern Ireland lest the Catholic population go unrepresented). Reduced today to 18 MEPs, and only one north of the Wash, that party should now realise the error of its ways. The argument that PR for Europe would be the thin edge for Westminster is bogus - unless one expects the European parliament to produce a disciplined majority for a single-minded European government, which is not exactly Conservative policy. The actual purpose of the European parliament is to reflect the different strands of public opinion throughout the EU. By sticking to a single-member system, which gets less proportional as constituencies get larger, the UK ensures that this reflection is seriously distorted - in the present case giving the dominant Socialists an artificial boost to offset the net loss they suffered in terms of votes. Federalist vision In the Union-wide popular vote, these elections were in fact a victory for the moderate right. The far right was happily defeated in Germany, and fell back slightly in both France and Italy. The European People's party (Christian Democrats and allies) did well in Spain, where it benefited from Mr Gonzalez's decline, and in the successor states of the Holy Roman Empire  -Germany and Benelux, to which one might add Austria, where the referendum result was above all a triumph for Mr Alois Mock. This central core of Europe, it seems, is still wedded to a federalist vision, while in France and Italy conservatives of a more Euro-sceptic bent are on the rise. When all that is said, the difference between the results in the UK and Germany remains striking. Both countries have been piloted through gruelling recessions by conservative leaders who have taken a battering from both media and opinion polls, not least for their alleged willingness to sacrifice national interests and sovereignty on the altar of Maastricht. But while John Major has tried desperately to appease the Euro-sceptic wing of his party, Helmut Kohl has ploughed resolutely on, tirelessly inciting his countrymen to lift their eyes from the small print and remember how much is at stake in the success of the European enterprise. The results speak for themselves.</p>

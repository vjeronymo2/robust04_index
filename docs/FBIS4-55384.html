			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 12 (CTK) -- "It is theoretically  possible that Slovakia will not sign the stability pact, but I  can imagine such an extreme situation only with difficulties,"  Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan told journalists today.  The pact of European stability and security, based on a plan of  French Premier Edouard Balladur and approved by the European  Union (EU), counts on the participation of the EU "Twelve", the  USA and Canada. The pact's main goal is to preventively settle  problems concerning borders and ethnic minorities in former  post-communist countries.    Kukan confirmed that Slovak diplomacy "has hardened its  position" and wanted to push through the inclusion of Slovak  interests into the pact. Slovakia's main reservation concerns  the provision that Slovakia and Hungary should settle mutual  problems with EU assistance. "We do not want anybody third to  dictate to us what to do about our bilateral relations. The  pact clearly says that the agreement is to be concluded under EU  sponsorship, and sets a concrete date. This would mean that we  (Slovakia and Hungary) cannot negotiate on a bilateral level,  but must ask a third side. We do not like this and want to  change it," Kukan said. He added Slovakia was willing to accept  a more compromising wording of the relevant document.    Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik, who is to leave for a visit  to  France on Monday [16 May], is expected to hold talks on the  pact. Kukan said he would like Slovak diplomats to push through  an acceptable wording of the document before Moravcik's visit.  Asked if Slovak representatives would attend a Paris conference  on the project to be held later in May, Kukan said: "If the pact  does not fully correspond to our interests, we will consider on  which level we will take part in it."</p>

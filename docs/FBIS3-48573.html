Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas [Central Bank of the  Philippines]  reported yesterday that the wider deficit was due to the faster  growth of imports compared with exports. The country, however,  was importing more capital goods and raw materials for  re-export. For the month of October 1993, total merchandise  exports reached $1,002 million, up 16.5 percent over the  year-ago level of $860 million.    This brought aggregate exports from January to October 1993  to rise by 12.8 percent to $9,121 million compared to the level  for the same period last year.    The $1,034 million increase for the first 10 months can be  traced primarily to the hike in shipments of manufactured goods,  particularly electronics and electrical equipment and parts  ($608 million); garments ($132 million); and, machinery and  transport equipment ($72 million).    Semi-conductor devices remained the country's leading export  product with earnings amounting to $904 million. Other leading  exports include finished electrical and electronic machinery and  parts manufactured from materials imported on consignment; other  electronic integrated circuits and micro assemblies; consigned  women's wear; and, consigned children's and infants' wear.    During the review month, total imports amounted to $1,647  million, 23.7 percent higher than the $1,331 million recorded a  year earlier.    Imports for the 10-month period amounted to $14,291 million,  up by 19.7 percent from the year-ago level of $11,939 million.    The upturn was attributed to the increase in arrivals of all  major commodity groups except mineral fuels and lubricant.  Imports of capital goods expanded by $1,108 million with power  generating and specialized machines contributing the highest  growth of $541 million, followed by telecommunication equipment  and electrical machinery, aircraft, ships and boats, by $339  million and $183 million, respectively.    Raw materials and intermediate goods imports rose by $952  million on account of increased arrivals of materials and  accessories for the manufacture of electronic equipment ($347  million), metal products ($173 million), and iron and steel  ($137 million). Likewise, arrivals of consumer goods rose by  $260 million attributed to higher demand for passenger cars and  motorized cycle, and miscellaneous manufactures.    Petroleum crude maintained its position as the country's top  leading import commodity notwithstanding the $183 million drop  in its import value of $1,154 million. Other leading imports  included dice on consignment basis [as published]; materials and  accessories for the manufacture of other electrical machinery  and equipment on consignment basis; parts of electronic  integrated circuits and micro assemblies; and, fabrics for the  manufacture of outer garments on consignment basis.    The country's merchandise trade balance in October 1993  resulted in a deficit of $645 million, $174 million higher than  the level a year ago. Based on the cumulative levels for the  10-month period, the gap widened to $5,170 million or by $1,318  million from the $3,852 million in the previous year.</p>

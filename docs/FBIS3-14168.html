			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Interior Minister Selim Saadi in Blida on 23 </F> March -- live or recorded]    [Text] Peace upon you all. On the occasion of my visit to  this region, I would like to talk about a number of issues,  especially regarding the situation in the country in general,  and the security angle in particular.    My initial intervention will deal with three fundamental  points, which should be addressed in order to comprehend the  current situation in the country. These points are:    How did the general situation in the country evolve since  the  halt of the electoral process?    Second, how did this situation develop during the term of  the  HSC [Higher State Council]?    Third, what are the measures that the current power in  office  intends to take to achieve security, order, and to create the  necessary conditions to establish a genuine democracy?    Regarding the first point, I believe that it will be  essential to remind you, albeit briefly, of the situation that  had prevailed in the country before the halt of the democratic  process. Algeria went through a decade during which the affairs  of the state were mismanaged and the resources of the country  were squandered, a matter that resulted in a multifold crisis  that reached its peak during the 1988 October demonstrations.    The message that young people, who were demonstrating, tried  to put across was absolutely clear. These young people  expressed the desire for a change in the political leadership,  which led the country to bankruptcy. Unfortunately, this  message was not grasped. For the sake of clinging to power, that  regime decided to establish a suspicious democracy. Also, it  laid down the 1989 Constitution that defined the rules of the  democratic game and it frankly prohibited the creation of a  party based on religious, linguistic, or regional basis. Such  measures were implemented against a party that was founded on  one of these criteria.    In other words, values shared by all the Algerian people  were  monopolized for political purposes. When the regime got  entangled into its contradictions, it started gradually making  concessions to the forces of darkness [reactionary forces] that  had quickly laid their hands on public means [as heard] that  existed in the municipal and provincial people's councils, the  mosques, etc. They were getting ready to seize all the power  despite the fact that they only represented a tiny minority in  Algerian society.    This movement, Islamic Salvation Front, [FIS] never  concealed  its intention to eliminate the democratic system for good the  day it seized power in view of the fact that this system, in its  view, is a heresy and emanates from other civilizations strange  to us. In other words, it used the democratic game as a means  to seize power indefinitely.    Parallel to this, the security situation had experienced a  continuous deterioration. Public order became threatened and  the public authority trodden upon. Anarchy and confusion  prevailed in all sectors.    The very rapid deterioration of the political, social, and  security climate led patriotic forces aware of the fatal danger  facing the country to make a decision that consisted in putting  a stop to the destructive tendency and declare a state of  emergency.    Regarding the development of the situation since the  installation of the HSC, we can say the following: The HSC had  endeavored since its creation to achieve two things: First, the  recovery of state authority and the creation of appropriate  conditions for the return to a democratic path.    Regrettably, in its search to have dialogue with the various  social and political forces, it came across obstacles set up by  some political parties out of politicking far away from the  higher interests of the country.    Despite all this, all the important social forces that  represented millions of citizens took part in the national  dialogue march that was crowned with a platform which clearly  determined the rules of transition to a true political democracy.    The stretched-hand policy of all the Algerians who were  attached to the constitutional system and respected the  fundamental national values was interpreted as an indication of  weakness by forces that have always endeavored to impose by  force and terror on the Algerians a suspicious and fictitious  system that can only lead to the destruction of the country. We  all know what happened in the countries in which similar systems  were imposed: Comprehensive regression in all fields, civil  wars, flight of the elite, division, explosion, etc.    In our country, these forces perpetrate on a daily basis  under the cover of our noble religion, which they interpret as  they like, destructive, barbaric, savage terrorist acts.    How can one justify in the name of Islam the killing of  innocent men and women of all ages, children, young people, and  mothers, the killing of those who are in the service of the  state, which is one of the major gains of the Algerian  revolution that enabled Algeria to resist colonialism, the  killing of veterans and the sons of the martyrs who are one of  the major symbols of the recovery of national sovereignty, the  assassination of foreign nationals who came to Algeria to help  it in its development, the assassination of genius,  intellectuals, men of science and culture, and even religious  men and ulemas.    How can one use Islam to justify the destruction, sabotage,  and burning of establishments, and public as well economic  institutions that represent a national heritage, and which  belong to all Algerians?    How can one use Islam to violate the sanctity of places of  worship? How can one use religion to justify acts of assault  and robbery against financial premises; and robbing citizens of  their possessions? What is more serious than this, is to launch  an attack against the honor and dignity of citizens, as whole  families have become targets of vile deeds whose victims are  women and girls.    How can one describe such barbaric acts as relating to Islam  or what is called the jihad, considering that they are acts  committed by an extremist, barbaric, and ignorant gang, who have  been joined by offenders; criminals, thieves, drug addicts, and  a number of youngsters who belong to families known for their  dishonorable behavior during the revolution of liberation?    Unfortunately, there are some youngsters, among these gangs,  who have been fooled by false propaganda and have agreed to deal  in crime. This has caused great regret for their families and  parents.    These crimes, which are committed in the name of Islam, are  in fact crimes against Islam itself. It is true that a large  number of people, among them people close to us, have expressed  their sympathy with this tendency and have expressed their  support for it. They believed its promises and held high hopes  that it could usher in a better future. However, the sad course  of events presented them with a chance to realize that these  promises were actually deceitful, as their hope for a better  life was turned into a horrible nightmare. The majority of them  turned against this behavior whose perpetrators managed to learn  from the Khmer Rouge, who were known for the destruction of  their country and the annihilation of their peoples.    The majority of Algerians know what would have happened to  Algeria had the election process not been stopped at the  appropriate time. The leadership of this movement was also on  the verge of experiencing an internal explosion under pressure  from the armed groups whose hard core was hit abroad when  working for the benefit of foreign causes, which would have led  the country to destruction, similarly to what is happening right  now in some of the regions of the Islamic world.    Regarding the political side of the crisis, the head of  state  had defined more than once the framework within which dialogue  should take place with the social and political partners who  abided by the fundamental national values that had led our  revolution and also the constitutional system.    Today, our fundamental and priority task consists in the  rapid consolidation of state authority and public order, as well  as guaranteeing the citizens' security and properties. In the  eyes of the state, this is not just a sacred demand, but also a  fundamental popular demand.    This is what made us understand that our people had become a  chosen target for terrorist acts. It insists on public  authority to eliminate this plague. We will take this task in  charge.    The means mobilized so far to combat terrorism have fallen  short of the seriousness of the situation. We are also  determined to further mobilize the human and material resources  of the country. We are also determined to use a radical remedy  to eliminate for good this plague affecting Algerian society.    In addition to the enormous means that the state started  mobilizing, the citizens are also called upon to take part in an  effective way in this fateful battle, within the framework  defined by the public authority.    Our people are now aware of the danger facing their future.  We have no doubts that they will wage the battle against  savagery and barbarism. We are fully convinced that the  Algerian people and its state will come out victorious after  this test, as the people had always proven during its long  history.    We will be victorious because we are determined that Algeria  will recover its respectable position among nations, which it  should not have lost in the first place, and that it Algeria  returns to the path of its cultural, economic, and social  development. We have every chance of success, and we will  succeed with God's help. Peace be upon you.</p>

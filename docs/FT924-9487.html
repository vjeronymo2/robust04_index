			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Trading system enters dangerous waters - Analysts fear Gatt talks could well be blown off course in next two months THE international trading system entered dangerous uncharted waters yesterday, though the failure of EC-US talks in Chicago on reform of subsidised farm trade contributes as strongly to the danger as the election in the US of a Democratic president with uncertain trade priorities. If the Chicago talks had succeeded, officials both in the US and the EC felt optimistic that wider negotiations under the Uruguay Round on world trade liberalisation could at least be anchored, for President Clinton to take up once he takes office in January. Failure in Chicago means a Clinton administration inherits no binding obligations from President Bush's trade negotiators; it is hard to believe he will reject the chance to impose his own (as yet barely defined) trade priorities on the long-delayed Round talks. More immediately, failure means yesterday's meeting in Geneva of the 105-country Gatt Council was asked by the US to sanction retaliation against the EC for its refusal to reform its oilseeds subsidy regime so as to eliminate damage to US farmers, amounting to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) a year. The oilseeds row, rumbling on for more than five years, and the subject of two Gatt panel rulings in favour of the US, was apparently the single remaining obstacle in Chicago to a wider farm trade accord. Why has the oilseeds dispute been so intractable? Is the US entitled to demand sanctions, as it did yesterday? How would sanctions affect EC farm exporters? Would the EC be entitled to retaliate? What would the danger be of this localised conflict escalating into a fully-fledged international trade war? On the first of these questions, the dispute is at the heart of US frustration with the EC's fiercely protective, and trade distorting, farm subsidy regime. Significantly, US complaints have been backed by Argentina, Australia, Brazil and Canada, all significant oilseeds exporters. The EC, wrestling with powerful internal resistance to reform of the subsidy regime, is refusing to brook external interference in its reform plans, finalised in a Common Agriculture Policy package pushed into EC law in July. But there is little question the US demands are legitimate. Gatt dispute panel rulings in January 1990 and March this year found in favour of the US, and urged the EC to 'act expeditiously' to eliminate the damage being done to US oilseed exporters. US negotiators argue the EC has since then shown no sign of acting in any way expeditiously. On this basis, Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, urged countries represented at yesterday's Gatt Council to 'authorise the US to suspend the application to the European Community of concessions under the General Agreement in the amount of Dollars 1bn.' He said yesterday the US intended for the time being to target 'less than the full annual amount of the Dollars 1bn', and would delay action for 30 days, hoping the EC would meanwhile agree with the US a 'mutually satisfactory resolution'. Noting the dangers involved in the US taking unprecedented action against a Gatt contracting party, Gatt observers were relieved yesterday that the US had chosen to move with caution. By keeping the dispute inside Gatt, the US has stopped erosion of Gatt's authority as the supreme arbitrator in international trade disputes. By seeking support from the Gatt Council for action, it reduced the danger of action being seen as unduly inflammatory, and eliminated any grounds on which the EC could legitimately counter-retaliate. Mrs Carla Hills, US Trade Representative, has insisted that if GATT rules are to mean anything at all, the EC must get permission from Gatt to counter-retaliate, and that they have no grounds to get it. At present, it is not possible to gauge how damaging to EC farm exporters US retaliation would be. Total EC farm exports to the US amounted last year to around Dollars 4bn. In the US administration, it has been agreed to aim a first 'tranche' of sanctions (prohibitive tariffs on roughly Dollars 300m-Dollars 350m worth of products) against the French, who are seen as the primary cause of the row, and the Germans, viewed as aiding and abetting them. The detailed list has been kept under wraps so far, but targeted goods are likely to be wines and liqueurs such as cognac (though Scotch whisky has been left off the list), cheeses, and cereals. The EC has repeatedly warned it would be forced to counter-retaliate if the US imposed sanctions. Officials say they have drawn up a list of targeted products, but have released no details. Dangers involved in the EC retaliating are great, since if it moved without Gatt sanction, it could trigger the much-feared escalation into trade war. Other disputes that could quickly become the focus of sanctions involve steel, cereals, timber, salmon and beef. 'The EC should think extremely carefully before making any precipitate move,' one Geneva-based observer said yesterday: 'It would push us hard down the slippery slope towards trade war.' Escalation would be doubly dangerous at a time of political transition in the US, when great uncertainty exists over the trade priorities of President Clinton when he assumes power in January. Among the few trade signals Mr Clinton has given have been hints he could be much more assertive, and potentially protectionist, than his predecessor. Whether this proves to be the case or not, trading partners would arguably be rash to inflame international trade relations during the hiatus between administrations in the US. 'The Uruguay Round is drifting rudderless for the next two months,' one analyst said. 'It will almost certainly be blown off course during that time, and it would be rash of the EC at the same time to blow the oilseeds row up into a storm.'

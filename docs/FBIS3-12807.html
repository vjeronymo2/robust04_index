			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following review of the 24 February  issue of Cairo AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH summarizes articles that  are Islamic in nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1.

Western Intentions in Bosnia Doubted  <H5>  GOVERNMENT VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS </H5>   In its 24 February issue, the opposition AL-USRAH  AL-'ARABIYAH publishes on page 7 an approximately 1,500-word  report by 'Ala' Tawfiq on human rights violations in Egypt,  which the writer says "cannot be worse." Against pictures of a  bearded Islamist behind bars and defendants being led to court,  the report cites several human rights activists on torture of  detainees, forced confessions, application of emergency laws,  and degradation of man's humanity. Najad al-Bura'i, secretary  general of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization, refutes  government allegations that human rights groups defend criminals  and ignore the rights of victims. He says: "We defend and urge  protection of defendants as humans. We do not seek to prevent  their trial or punishment, nor do we want to affect trials. We  demand protection of defendants as human beings; we want to  protect their human and legal rights." Asked whether Egypt  observes human rights in a satisfactory manner, al-Bura'i --  according to the writer -- "was content with only a sarcastic  smile."    Muhsin 'Awad, assistant secretary of the Arab Human Rights  Organization, notes violation of rights such as arrest and  torture of workers on strike and the existence of laws  conflicting with international conventions. He concludes: "I  tell those who say that human rights in Egypt are observed well  that they are illusioned, tendentious, and deviants from the  truth."    Dr. Ahmad al-Majdub, of the National Center for Criminal  Research, urges fair trials in civilian courts, "not by a  military judge who takes orders." Challenging official  statements on respect for human rights, al-Majdub rhetorically  asks: "Do attacking houses without strong incriminating  evidence, referring cases to military courts, preventing defense  lawyers from seeing documents, denying defendants the right to  appear before civilian judges, and applying the emergency law  for many years indicate respect for, or even presence of, human  rights?"    --In a separate 1,000-word column on the same page, the  paper  publishes "examples of torture victims," giving names and cases  of a number of people who were tortured in police centers, some  of whom died as a result. The paper cites official forensic  medicine reports to substantiate its claims.    --In a related 200-word news report on page 1, the paper  says  security campaigns in the southern governorate of Asyut have  been seeing "brutal practices and serious excesses against  women, old men, and children." The paper says raids on houses  are carried out at random, with police breaking down doors and  forcing young men to leave their houses and take off their  clothes amid floods of harassment and oaths to force them to  give information. The report says that in their raids, police  forces arrest hundreds of innocent people and detain them in  camps in Asyut without giving reasons. The police reportedly  seize private passenger vehicles to use in their campaigns. The  report cites a National Democratic Party official in Asyut as  warning against the repercussions of these security campaigns,  noting that they make people sympathetic to the Islamic Group's  violence. "The barbaric police acts have only increased  violence," the official is quoted as saying.    --Another 100-word news report on page 1 says security  forces  raided a girls' high school last week to force veiled students  to remove their veils despite a court decision allowing the  practice. The report notes that the education minister had  objected to the court decision and decided to appeal.   <H5>    RECOGNITION OF MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD URGED </H5>   A 300-word article by Mahmud Yasir Ramadan, the newspaper's  board chairman, urges that the Muslim Brotherhood be included in  the national dialogue due to take place in April because the  group, whether the government likes it or not, "is an  influential political force" in the country. Noting that all  opposition parties recognize the Muslim Brotherhood as a  political force, not as a charity or service society, Ramadan  says it is high time the ruling National Democratic Party did  the same. "If we want the dialogue to succeed and effectively  achieve results to save the homeland and its citizens from the  negative consequences of extremist ideas, then we must accept  moderate political forces, no matter what their inclinations,"  he writes. To support his call, Ramadan maintains that "failure  to grant the Muslim Brotherhood official or semi- official  recognition is the primary reason for the emergence of the  political violence groups, which we call terrorist or extremist  groups."  <H5>  ISLAMISTS WIN, CONTEST TRADE UNION ELECTIONS; WRITER COMMENTS </H5>   On page 9, which is devoted to news of trade unions and  professional associations, the paper reports a "major victory"  for the Islamic trend in the election of the Agronomists  Association. It says that for the first time in the history of  the association, the Islamic trend won the majority of seats in  the mid-term renewal elections in most of the country's  governorates. The paper comments: "The big victory reflects  the people's genuine longing for the Islamic solution." It  claims that the victory was achieved despite administrative  pressure from Agriculture Ministry officials and threats to  supporters of the Islamic trend.    --Other reports say that the Islamic trend will lead the  Lawyers Association elections in Cairo and al-Jizah on 17 March,  and will contest the Pharmacists mid-term renewal elections on  29 March.    --An approximately 800-word article by Dr. Faruq  'Abd-al-Salam on page 4 comments on the Islamic trend's  successes in trade union elections. He notes the failure of the  government's effort to curb these successes when it introduced a  professional associations election law "that was especially  designed to combat the Muslim Brotherhood trend" under the  pretext of serving the general interest. 'Abd-al-Salam argues:  "Today, the Islamic trend sticks in the throat of the ruling  regime. The Islamic trend is exposing the regime's claims of  democracy, and the ruling party's claim that it enjoys a  majority." "It is futile, ridiculous, and surprising," the  writer adds, "for the ruling party to claim any majority of any  kind when it cannot, no matter what influence and deviant  methods it uses, win one-tenth of what the Islamists win in the  professional associations." The writer sees irony in the fact  that while the regime is claiming democracy, "the trend enjoying  true majority in these sensitive positions is the only trend  denied the right to form a political party."  <H5>  WRITER NOTES PLANS TO IMPROVE TIES WITH ISRAEL </H5>   An approximately 1,500-word article by Fathi al-Mansuri on  page 7 discusses prospects of Egypt's Middle East policies in  the near future as concluded from articles published in  government newspapers. The writer particularly summarizes or  gives excerpts from two lengthy articles by AL-AHRAM Chief  Editor Ibrahim Nafi' on 11 and 18 February calling for joint  projects and warmer relations with Israel to serve Egypt's  interests.    The writer, making little comment, says such articles  normally reflect official policy and pave the way for certain  future measures. He says Nafi' articles stress that "what was  being discussed as merely a possibility and  speculation--normalization with Israel, removal of the boycott,  and the Jewish entity playing its role, especially through  economic Middle Eastern projects--is virtually becoming true."  <H5>  CONSPIRACY AGAINST ISLAMIC EDUCATION </H5>   An approximately 1,000-word report by Hani al-Makkawi  reviews  what the writer terms a "conspiracy against education" to  obliterate Islamic identity and entrench Western culture. The  report also contains tables showing the percentage of Islamic  material deleted from textbooks. It cites an al-Azhar  educational official as saying that "under the current education  minister, everything related to Islamic, Arab, and national eras  has been deleted from textbooks." He gives examples of several  deletions from Islamic and pan-Arab subjects to show that the  purpose is "to open the door wide to the Americans and Jews."  An Islamic history professor is also cited on attempts "to  distort Islamic history under the pretext of modernization" of  the educational curricula.   <H5>    AL-GHAZALI URGES ISLAMIC UPBRINGING </H5>   A 2,500-word report by Yasir al-Dukkani on page 8 discusses  a  seminar on Islamic culture attended by Islamic preacher Shaykh  Muhammad al-Ghazali and several other Islamic scholars. The  report cites Shaykh al-Ghazali as stressing the importance of  Islamic upbringing to solve the Islamic nation's problems and  stop its defeats. Al-Ghazali also stresses that Islam must not  be viewed narrowly where marginal differences and minor details  not affecting the essence of Islam are highlighted. Al-Ghazali  is cited as saying: "I used to fight on two fronts: communism  and stagnation, and today I am also fighting on two fronts,  secularism and extremism." He adds: "This nation must return  to its origins and first culture. Islam does not know  nationalities or imported ideas. Anyone taking Islam or the  return to it lightly is an apostate."  <H5>  WRITERS REFUTE SECULARISTS CLAIMS </H5>   Two articles of about 1,500-words each on page 8 react to  "slanders" by secularist writers and their accusations that the  Islamic culture is closed-minded. The first article, by Yasir  al-Rikani, cites some Islamist thinkers as defending Islamic  thought, its openness to other cultures, and its call for using  the mind.    At the end of the second article, in which writer Dr. Ahmad  'Abd-al-Rahman refutes a claim by secular writer Dr. Fu'ad  Zakariya that the principles of Islam conflict with the  causality theory, the writer says: "We know for sure that  Western media will not stop their attacks on Muslims until they  abandon Islam and embrace the infidel materialistic philosophy,  thus losing their intellectual independence and distinguished  identity and becoming submissive slaves to the West, like the  Red Indians."  <H5>  WRITER URGES CONFORMITY BETWEEN LAWS AND SHARI'AH </H5>   A 500-word article entitled "The Citizen and the Law" by Dr.  al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Sattar al-Miliji on page 4 notes that citizens  are living in fear most of the time because they wonder whether  things they do violate some law or another. This is a result of  much harassment and accusations, he says. "We hope that the  laws, legislated in dark ages to oppress and frighten citizens  into becoming tools in the hand of rulers, will be realigned,"  he writes. He adds: "There is hope that the laws will be put in  harmony with our [Islamic] creed so that there will be no  conflict between what we believe and what is imposed on us under  the so-called laws."  <H5>  ISLAM AND THE FAMILY </H5>   Page 3 features a report and two columns on the Muslim  family  and the importance of keeping it cohesive. Writers maintain  that Islam protects women's rights and safeguards their status  in society. The approximately 3,000-word report by Hisham Khadr  laments the fact that Egyptian men are allowing their wives or  daughters to travel abroad for work. It cites experts and  specialists as saying that this helps in the collapse of  families and other social problems. Contending that Islam does  not allow women to travel abroad unaccompanied by a male member  of the family, the writer wonders how men could possibly allow  their wives, sisters, or daughters to travel abroad on their  own: "Where is dignity, gallantry, manhood, religion?" he  bitterly asks.  <H5>  WESTERN INTENTIONS IN BOSNIA DOUBTED </H5>   A 500-word article by Muhammad Jamal 'Arafah on page 5  argues  that the Western intervention in Bosnia is aimed at stopping the  successes that the Muslim Bosnians have recently been making.  The writer says the NATO threat basically aimed at preventing  Muslims from using their main weapon--heavy artillery--while  only collecting the Serbs' heavy weapons in certain places where  they can be used against Muslims in other Bosnian cities.    In another 600-word article on page 10, Chief Editor Mahmud  'Atiyah also casts doubts on Western intentions in Bosnia but  mainly assails the position of Russia, which he says wanted to  revive its lost glory "at the expense of the cheap Muslim  blood." He also attacks the UN secretary general's position on  Bosnia and urges Muslim peoples to give donations for their  Muslim brothers in Bosnia.</p>

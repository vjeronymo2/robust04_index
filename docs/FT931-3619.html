			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / The deal they were condemned to do: The state of the German economy helped drive the politicians to agree a solidarity pact Delight, relief and exhaustion were apparent in almost equal proportions on the faces of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Bjorn Engholm, the German opposition leader, on Saturday night. After two and a half days of almost unrelieved negotiations over the fine details of the long-awaited solidarity pact to finance German unification, a deal on the central component - public finances and burden-sharing - had been done. When it comes to analysing the figures, the holes in the pact are certain to emerge. But at 8pm in the chancellor's office in Bonn, where they had been shut away so long from a gloriously sunny, premature spring weekend, nobody was picking holes. It was time for mutual congratulation. The entire German top political establishment - the chancellor and his principal ministers, the leading figures in all the main parliamentary parties, and the 16 prime ministers of the German federal states - had thrashed out a political agreement on the soaring cost of subsidising east Germany for the foreseeable future. They had agreed on how to split the cost between the central government and the wealthy western states. And they had done it at a time when the overwhelming majority of observers doubted their ability to do so, and had even begun to question their very powers of leadership. Mr Kohl, that master of the understatement, called it 'a good result' and 'a very considerable achievement'. Everybody had had to compromise, he said, and all had been willing to do so. Mr Engholm, leader of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), who had put his own political credibility at stake in the exercise of reaching cross-party agreement, went further. 'We have taken a huge stride towards the realisation of German unity,' he said. 'That was the aim, and that is the result. Seldom before have I found two and a half days so useful and so fruitful.' As for the prime ministers of the German Lander, whose budgets face a critical squeeze from unification in the coming years, they were also overwhelmingly positive. Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the Christian Democrat prime minister of Saxony, the industrial heartland of east Germany, called the deal 'a success for the federal Germany, and a success for a united Germany. 'Many doubted whether it was possible for 16 Lander to agree with the federal government on such a complex deal,' he said. 'We have succeeded in cutting the Gordian knot and in reaching a tolerable conclusion.' Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD premier of the Rhineland Palatinate in the west, said it was above all 'a success for the major parties and perhaps a signal that the endless to-ing and fro-ing is at an end'. The deal they have done is certainly less than ideal. The aim of the package was to squeeze western Germany - both the central government and the states  -in order to finance a transfer to the eastern states in 1995 of DM110bn (Pounds 46.6bn), including DM40bn for servicing the accumulated debts of the east. That has to be done while the western economy is in recession, after a sharp downturn in the last quarter. Mr Kohl and Mr Theo Waigel, his finance minister, wanted to cut western spending, including the bloated social security budgets; to postpone any tax rise until 1995, to allow the economy time to recover (and the 1994 elections to take place); and to keep any call on the capital markets to a minimum, to encourage the German Bundesbank to carry on cutting interest rates. Mr Engholm and the SPD wanted no cuts in social spending and a much earlier tax rise to meet the immediate spending gap. In the event, the deal will raise taxes from January 1995 by a painful 7.5 per cent surcharge on income tax, and an increase in the wealth tax: the amount is about double what Mr Waigel had intended, but at least it will not come into effect until 1995. He has agreed to give the Lander nearly DM20bn in extra tax revenues, to help them pay for transfers to east Germany, by raising their share of value added tax receipts from 37 to 44 per cent. That will relieve them of what they all regarded as quite unbearable pressure on their spending plans. Public sector borrowing will rise significantly, thanks to an increase in the borrowing limit of the Treuhand privatisation agency by DM30bn, to allow it to finance further restructuring of 'core industries' which it cannot sell, and to clean up the ecological havoc they have caused. At the same time the Bank for Reconstruction will be allowed to raise its borrowing limit from DM30bn to DM60bn to finance housing modernisation in the east. As for savings measures, Mr Engholm won an absolute commitment that there would be no cuts in social spending. So the two sides simply agreed on a figure for savings - DM9.2bn at the central government level - and instructed the finance ministers to identify the necessary cuts. However, if they fail to meet the target, the Lander will have to forfeit the corresponding amount from their VAT revenue: that is Mr Waigel's secret weapon. It all seems to fall well short of what the Bundesbank was looking for: a clear commitment to budget cuts, and no increase in the overall public sector indebtedness. Last night, the Bundesbank was studiously, if somewhat sceptically, refusing to comment on the deal. Yet it would be wrong to underrate the importance of the deal, for it is, above all, a political as opposed to purely financial agreement. 'This is a vital step in bringing unification into our consciousness,' Mr Biedenkopf said yesterday. It will also provide certainty and reassurance for the private sector, at a moment when the investment climate is gloomy, Mr Scharping said. 'That is of decisive importance for the Bundesbank.' The state of the German economy was decisive in driving the negotiators towards a deal, and in reinforcing the government's resistance to any tax rise before 1995, but equally in weakening the government's insistence on firm spending cuts to be agreed before they went home. The key to the deal was the tax trade-off, reached by Mr Waigel and the main body of state premiers in a working group on Friday night. That is where the deal between a higher VAT take for the Lander, against a higher solidarity surcharge for the central government, was done. The other key was the question of social spending cuts. Everyone agreed they would try to find savings of up to DM3bn from clamping down on social-security swindles. Mr Kohl wanted the savings to be identified by May  -and, if not, the original cuts to be reinstated. Mr Engholm flatly refused. Mr Kohl got the tax deal, Mr Engholm the social spending. In spite of the overwhelmingly sceptical view of the German media that the pact would never come to pass, most of those involved always said they were 'condemned to agree'. Mr Engholm, in particular, was clear that he wanted an agreement and would get one. He, like Mr Kohl, is instinctively a man of consensus and compromise. That is why both are accused of failing to give clear leadership. When they left Saturday night's closing press conference, Mr Kohl took Mr Eng-holm's arm and squeezed it, a gesture which said more about their temporary alliance than any words. There is no doubt that the local election results from the state of Hesse, just six days before, concentrated minds powerfully. Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats did badly - losing 2.3 per cent on a previous bad score. Mr Engholm's SPD did even worse, losing 8.4 per cent of its share of the vote. Both men were reinforced in their determination to show they could do business in Bonn - not simply shout slogans at each other. The question now is how the pact, in all its inevitable pain, will be sold to the nation, and whether the lower ranks in the leading parties will still try to pull it apart. That is precisely where the leadership powers of both Mr Kohl and Mr Eng-holm will be challenged.</p>

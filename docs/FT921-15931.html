			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / US group may enter UK telecoms market SPRINT, the big US telecommunications carrier, has applied for a licence to compete with BT and Mercury Communications in the UK. It is the first significant challenge to the duopoly held by the two companies since the government last year abolished their exclusive rights to provide basic telecommunication services. Sprint, the third-largest long-distance telecommunications carrier in the US, wants to provide domestic and international telecommunications services in the UK. It plans to lay a fibre optic network around the UK, largely alongside the canal system, at a cost of Pounds 150m-Pounds 200m. The application to provide domestic services is expected to be approved by the Department of Trade and Industry. But Sprint's application to provide international services will test the openness of the UK telecommunications market. In its white paper last year, the government said that the duopoly on international services should be ended but that it was unlikely to grant new international licences in the short term. It argued that this was because UK companies found it difficult to operate in foreign markets. Sprint said yesterday a relaxation of US regulatory policy last month meant this should no longer be a consideration as far as US companies were concerned. If Sprint is granted an international licence, other US and UK groups are likely to follow suit because international services are the most profitable part of the telecommunications market. About 20 telecommunications licence applications, most to run niche services, have so far been filed with the DTI. Officials are understood to be particularly interested in an application by Millicom, a US-based group, to provide voice and videophone services using radio links. British Rail and the regional electricity companies, which expressed enthusiasm about entering telecommunications last year, have yet to make formal applications.</p>

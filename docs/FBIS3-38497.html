The Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] informed  Turkish journalists who traveled to northern Iraq to visit the  Zhalah camp after it was bombed in a cross-border air operation  on Friday [28 January] that the "embargo on the press is being  maintained" and that they will not be allowed into the camp.    Several Kurdish sources in the region have claimed that the  PKK militants left the Zhalah camp at 0500 and returned at 1900  on 26 January.    Meanwhile, 'Abdallah Rasul Kusret, prime minister of the  federal Kurdish state in northern Iraq, said that his government  was not informed about Turkey's air operation. He asserted:  "Consequently, we were not able to take precautionary measures  in our villages. We lost 18 people in Sheni, Goreser, and Sune,  which are close to the border. Many of our people were wounded.  Nine people were killed and 19 others were wounded in Iran.  The PKK lost only seven men."    Stressing that they have informed Ankara on their reaction  to  the air operation, Kosret said: "The Zhalah camp is 120 km from  Turkey's border. PKK maintained its activities in areas close  to Turkey. We signed a protocol with that organization and  allowed its members to settle in the Zhalah camp. Our objective  was to keep the PKK away from the border. Turkey is aware of  that. The protocol we have signed is still valid. The PKK  members are in the Zhalah camp. That is where they maintain  their activities."    Local sources have said that 1,200 militants were based in  that camp until recently. However, they also said that  considering the possibility of an air attack, the PKK recently  reduced the number of its militants in that camp to 500 and  began to use it as a facility for support services instead of a  base for military and political training.</p>

Attending the meeting were CPV Advisers Pham Van Dong and Vo  Chi Cong, Le Duc Anh, Vo Van Kiet, Nong Duc Manh, Nguyen Duc  Binh, General Vo Nguyen Giap, many high-level party and  government cadres, and representatives of all central and Hanoi  sectors and departments. Comrade Pham The Duyet, member of the  CPV Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the  Hanoi party committee, delivered a speech recalling the glorious  tradition of our party in the past 64 years. He said:    "Right from its birth, our party firmly held the  revolutionary banner and outlined a correct platform to widely  gather and unite people from all walks of life and lead them to  the victory of the August Revolution, establishing the first  worker-peasant government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam  in Southeast Asia.    "Then the party successfully led a nine-year resistance war  against the French colonialists, opening an era of the  disintegration of the Old Colonialist System in the world.  After the Geneva Agreement in 1954, the party led our people to  hold high the banner of national independence and socialism to  simultaneously carry out the two revolutions: the socialist  revolution in North Vietnam and the national democratic  revolution in South Vietnam for the national unification.    "That correct line became the revolutionary action of our  people. It led our people to the great victory in 1975,  liberating South Vietnam and unifying our nation for the whole  country to move forward to socialism.    "In the socialist revolution, our party has exerted many  efforts to study, search, and invent for the outlining of  correct socialist lines, goals, and directions. Sometimes it  committed mistakes. Our party seriously criticized itself and  initiated and led a national renovation undertaking in all  social aspects at the Sixth National CPV Congress. The Seventh  National CPV Congress developed the Sixth National CPV  Congress's renovation line to continue taking the renovation  undertaking into new depths.    "The result of the implementation of the Seventh National  CPV  Congress resolution was evaluated at the recent MNPC. The  conference confirmed that we have scored very important  achievements. The great achievement with a paramount meaning is  the overcoming in an important step our socioeconomic crisis.  Three years on the road, our economy scored a fairly good  developing rates. The average annual development rate was 7.2  percent. Inflation, from two digits in earlier years, reduced  to 5.2 percent in 1993. The life of major part of the people has  been stabilized and partly improved. Those achievements have  positively contributed to the firm maintenance and consolidation  of political stabilization, a necessary condition for national  construction and development.    "In recent years, due to the successful renovation and the  broadening of our external relations, our reputation and  position of our country in the world has been improved, creating  favorable conditions for the national construction and  protection."    The Hanoi party committee secretary confirmed that the  aforementioned great achievements have created a premise for our  country to move to a new developing era, an era for the first  step of the national industrialization and modernization. After  confirming the achievements recorded by the Hanoi party  committee and people in the past year, Comrade Pham The Duyet  stressed:    "With its role and position outlined at the Six National  Party Congress, the Hanoi party committee has actively led the  people in the implementation of the renovation undertaking. The  recent 11th Hanoi party committee meeting unanimously evaluated  and found that in 1993, under the party and government  leadership, the Hanoi people have recorded great achievements.  That is the maintenance of political security and social order.  The economy continued to score new achievements with fairly  good development rates. Its gross domestic product increased  11.2 percent over 1992. Nearly 30,000 new jobs were created.  The Hanoi average production per head increased from $517 in  1992 to $565 in 1993. Hanoi industrial production reached its  highest level so far. Education and training service; cultural,  arts, physical education, and sports activities; public health  care; and other social welfare service achieved prominent  progress compared to the previous years. Hanoi party and  government and mass organizations widely expanded many public  movements for the implementation of political, economic, and  social duties in the past year."    Comrade Pham The Duyet pointed out the strengths and  weaknesses in socioeconomic development scored by the Hanoi  party and people in the past and stressed party building work.  He said:    "The Hanoi and local party committee accelerated their  leadership, considering the party renovation and rectification  an important task for 1993. They implemented suitable steps and  measures and reviewed their work regularly to learn from  experiences in wards, villages, state enterprises, colleges, and  so forth.    "Party building, renovation, and rectification work,  however,  still bears many shortcomings. Many problems have not been  solved adequately. Various party organizations especially still  are confused in their leadership content and method. Cadre  planning and training was carried out, but did not receive  appropriate attention and investment.    "Our party tirelessly has struggled, explored, and  innovated,  thus achieving great and glorious victories throughout the 64  years of its history."    The Hanoi party committee secretary then outlined the  socioeconomic targets that set forth by the Hanoi party  committee for 1994. He also reasserted the determination of the  Hanoi party organization and people to bring the MNPC resolution  to reality and to fulfill all socioeconomic targets. In his  conclusion, Comrade Pham The Duyet said:    "In developing our party's glorious revolution traditions,  the Hanoi party organization and people pledge to closely unite  around the party Central Committee led by our beloved Comrade  General Secretary Do Muoi, to continue our renovation  undertaking, to advance further in the industrialization and  modernization process, to fulfill the socioeconomic targets set  forth by the Seventh Party Congress, and to make Hanoi become  evermore prosperous and civilized on the socialist path,  deserving the trust of the people in Hanoi and in the entire  country. We will greet the 40th anniversary of the liberation  of Hanoi and other national holidays in 1994-95 with practical  action."</p>

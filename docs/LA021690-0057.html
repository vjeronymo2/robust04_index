			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> STUDY REVEALS FLIERS FACE RADIATION RISK  </P> <P> A study of airline-cabin environment found that, even with the smoking ban that  takes effect Feb. 25, passengers and crew still face a health risk from  increased radiation from the sun and stars. The study released by the  Department of Transportation recommends airlines schedule cabin crews in ways  that will reduce their risk to cosmic radiation, especially those crews who  regularly fly near the North Pole and South Pole or at higher altitudes.  </P> <P> The study found the risk of cancer death from cosmic radiation comparable to  the risk of death from exposure to smoke-filled cabins. In addition to risks  facing crew members, the study noted a risk to frequent fliers and to the  fetuses of pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy.  </P></p>

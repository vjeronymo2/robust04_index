			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada halts Russian grain shipments THE CANADIAN Wheat Board has halted shipments of grain to Russia until it receives satisfactory proposals from Moscow for payment of overdue principal and interest on a CDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 650m) line of credit. Russia is the second biggest market for Canadian grain, with shipments so far this season totalling 4.24m tonnes, including 2.9m tonnes of wheat. A wheat board official expressed optimism yesterday that the suspension of exports will be 'very temporary', but said that shipments were being halted with immediate effect. Nine vessels are either waiting at various Canadian ports to load grain for Russia, or are expected later this week. The official said that payments on the line of credit, which was signed during a visit by president Boris Yeltsin to Ottawa last February, had fallen off 'significantly' in recent months. According to local reports, the arrears are now well over CDollars 100m. Canada and Russia signed the latest in a series of long-term grain agreements at the end of January. It provides for the purchase of 25m tonnes of wheat and barley between February 1992 and January 1997. Grain shipments were disrupted earlier this summer because of the Russians inability to pay shipping costs. Since June, the wheat board has been arranging shipments to Russia on a partial cif (cost, insurance and freight) basis, instead of the traditional fob (free on board). Poland plans to buy 500,000 tonnes of wheat on world markets to restore strategic reserves, a government official said yesterday, reports Reuter from Warsaw. Last week Mr Janusz Bylinski, the deputy agriculture minister, said Poland would have to buy up to 2m tonnes of grain before the next harvest to make up for a forecast 25 per cent fall in the domestic crop due to drought.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Two Guinness trial charges are dropped THE PROSECUTION of Mr Thomas Ward in the final Guinness trial was scaled down yesterday when two of the three charges against him were dropped for lack of evidence. The charges dropped on the order of the judge alleged that Mr Ward, a US lawyer and former Guinness director, was guilty of false accounting and dishonestly procuring the execution of a valuable security in relation to the Pounds 5.2m he received after the company's 1986 takeover of Distillers. Mr Ward still faces a third charge, which he denies, alleging that he stole the Pounds 5.2m from Guinness. At the start of his defence, Mr Ward told an Old Bailey jury that Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chief executive, had agreed he should be paid a fee that was 'in the millions' for his contribution to the takeover. The two men agreed this after the Guinness bid had been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, apparently ending all prospect of the bid succeeding. Mr Saunders had been unhappy and depressed at the news. His advisers had told him there was nothing he could do about it and had moved on to work for other clients, Mr Ward said. Mr Ward agreed to search for a solution but insisted he be guaranteed payments of a size similar to those being paid to Guinness's other advisers such as Bains, the management consultants, and Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank. 'I could not continue doing this thing without some understanding that I would be paid and paid well,' he told the jury. Mr Saunders had agreed that a fee that was 'in the millions' was fair, he said. Mr Ward then explained how he played a major role in negotiating with the Office of Fair Trading to have the bid de-referred by agreeing to sell off brands to limit the market share of the combined company. Earlier, Mr Andrew Trollope QC, for Mr Ward, said his client had made no attempt to conceal the nature of the Pounds 5.2m payment from the company or its auditors. Mr Ward came from a different financial culture where the awarding of enormous 'success fees' was common practice, Mr Trollope said. Mr Ward had earned the money through his contribution to saving the bid. The trial continues today.</p>

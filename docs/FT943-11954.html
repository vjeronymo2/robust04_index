			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Second London blast after Israel embassy hit: Rabin gives warning of new wave of Islamic terrorism - Eighteen injured in explosions An explosion damaged buildings near the headquarters of a large Jewish charity in north London early this morning, just hours after a powerful car bomb blasted Israel's embassy in west London. Four people were slightly injured in the second blast at about 12.45am, which ripped out shopfront windows in the High Road, North Finchley. Witnesses reported a car burning immediately after the explosion. After the first bomb injured 14 at the west London embassy, Israel's prime minister Mr Yitzhak Rabin warned the world was facing a new wave of radical Islamic terrorism, a day after Israel signed a historic co-operation agreement with Jordan. The two London explosions followed a car bomb attack on a Jewish centre in Buenos Aires on July 18 which killed at least 96 people, and prompted Mr Rabin to suggest that European and American countries were at risk from 'a wave' of attacks by extremists. 'They continue a struggle of terror to kill Israelis, to fight against moderate Arab regimes and to do everything to undermine any possibility . . . to bring about a comprehensive peace between Israel and its neighbouring Arab countries and the Palestinians,' he said. President Clinton said at a news conference with Mr Rabin and King Hussein of Jordan that the enemies of peace had not been silent. 'We will not - we must not - allow them to disrupt this peace process,' he said. The early morning explosion, in the heart of Jewish north London, was near the offices of the Joint Israel Appeal, a prominent Jewish charity which raises about Pounds 30m a year for humanitarian needs. Mr Abdul Carim, a local resident, said: 'I was sitting reading when I heard a tremendous explosion. I looked out and saw a car burning in the road. The house next to me had all of its windows shattered and there is glass all along the street.' Police immediately taped off surrounding streets and began checking parked cars in the North Finchley shopping distrct, although residents were not evacuated. Mr Chris Webb, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, said three of the injured had been in a passing car. The fourth was a resident. All were understood not to have been seriously injured. The earlier attack extensively damaged the Israeli embassy in west London and rocked nearby buildings in the capital's 'embassy row', including Kensington Palace, where four members of the British royal family were unharmed. The blast at around 12.10pm occurred without warning, although one embassy official said a vehicle driven by a woman had been diverted by security staff from the main entrance minutes before the explosion outside the embassy. Commander David Tucker, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad in London, said last night police were seeking a woman of 55 to 60 years, believed to have been driving the car, which was thought to contain about 20-30lb of commercial explosives. Ms Rachel Gordan, a member of the embassy press office, said: 'It was a huge, huge explosion. Parts of the building just collapsed.' Builder Mr Michael Hassit, who was working nearby, said he saw a 'big plume of smoke and debris going up to 200 feet up in the air'. The London embassy, together with other Jewish buildings around the world, has been on heightened security alert since the Buenos Aires attack. However, the attackers clearly managed to exploit vulnerable security points around the embassy building in an operation which some security experts believe would have taken several weeks to plan. Mr Douglas Hogg, Foreign Office minister, described the attack as a 'shocking offence' and said security in the UK would be stepped up. He added, however, that there could not be full security guarantees in an 'open city like London'.

The conference was attended by people from 40 countries,  including Ukraine. The Ukrainian delegation was headed by  Militia Colonel General Valentyn Nedryhaylo, first deputy  interior minister. There is good reason for the attention paid  by the EC to the problem of narcotics. Today, drug lords are  acting on a large scale, expanding their spheres of influence  and trapping thousands of new victims in their nets.    According to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, the number of  drug addicts in Ukraine has reached 400,000. They consume five  tonnes of deadly substances every day, spending almost 80  billion karbovantsi. In light of the fact that the "traditional"  routes of shipping drugs stretch close to our territory, members  of the Italian and Colombian drug Mafia have already held  consultations about using these channels for selling their  products. The documents adopted, and concrete measures outlined  by the conference will facilitate the launching of an attack  against the drug Mafia in the very near future. However, the  efforts of law enforcement bodies alone are not sufficient.  That is why the participants in the forum passed a decision to  support all public organizations in the fight against the use  and trafficking of drugs.</p>

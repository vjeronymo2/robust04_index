			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In Rwanda, the intermittent bombing of Kigali  continues. [passage omitted]. However, the government formed  after the death of President Habyarimana is pursuing its  diplomatic offensive in Africa and in Europe. The Rwandan  foreign minister has been in Paris since last Monday [25 April].  Jerome Bicamumpaka was received at the Elysee, at the Matignon  [prime minister's office], and at the Foreign Ministry. The  next leg of Jerome Bicamumpaka's visit was to be Belgium, but it  will probably not take place, Monique Mas says:    [Mas] No, Brussels does not wish to receive Jerome  Bicamumpaka. The Belgian Foreign Ministry has even stressed that  the visa he demanded was refused. Belgium has not severed its  diplomatic relations with Rwanda and it is thus continuing to  deal with the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels. It is difficult,  however, for Belgium to receive the representative of a  government which it has accused of involvement in the attack on  the presidential plane and a government which put all the  responsibility for the bloodbath on the Rwandan civilian  opposition and the FPR [Rwandan Patriotic Front], and above all  on the United Nations and, especially, the Belgian blue helmets.

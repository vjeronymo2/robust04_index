			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: MP cleared An all-party committee of MPs found Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, the Labour MP for Workington, technically in breach of a Commons rule about declaring interests, but recommended no action about his failure consistently to declare his sponsorship by Cohse, a health service union. Mr Campbell-Savours said his non-declaration had been on the principle that the rules requiring him to declare the benefit to his constituency party from the sponsorship were inconsistent, because they did not require declaration of similar benefits from other organisations.</p>

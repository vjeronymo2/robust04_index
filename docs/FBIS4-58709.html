			<p>BFN     [Text] London: Quds Press--The Islamic Jihad Movement in  Palestine has stated that it will carry on with its fight  against Israeli occupation, despite the signing of the agreement  launching self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.    A statement sent by the movement to Quds Press says the  signing of the agreement "shows how lightly our people's appeals  have been taken."    The movement, which takes a negative view of the peace  negotiations with Israel, said "the agreement amounts to  capitulation and will not bring peace." "The causes that  triggered the intifadah are still there," it emphasized.    The agreement 'Arafat and Rabin signed in Cairo yesterday  skirts the substance of occupation, the Islamic Jihad said.  This shoddy agreement, the movement's statement warned, lays  the groundwork for other wars in the region in that it  represents complete acquiescence in Zionist dictates and terms.</p>

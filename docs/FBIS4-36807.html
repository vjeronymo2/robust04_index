			<p>BFN     [Text] The gang of apostasy and secession in the [Yemeni]  Socialist Party [YSP] leadership has prevented a food convoy  from entering Aden. Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme  commander of the Armed Forces, instructed the Government to  prepare this convoy within 24 hours, send it to Aden, and  distribute it free of charge among the residents of Aden, the  economic and commercial capital.    Deputy Prime Minister brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Qadir Ba Jammal  explained that in implementation of the instructions of the  brother chairman leader, the Government prepared a convoy of 100  trailers, 40 carrying wheat, 30 carrying rice, 21 carrying  various products including peas, broad beans, vegetable oil,  ghee, and tomato paste, and nine trailers carrying various kinds  of vegetables.    Ba Jammal said that the Government informed the  International  Red Cross that it is preparing this food convoy as part of a  plan for the free distribution of these products among the Aden  residents in accordance with the UN plans and programs.    At a news conference he held in Sanaa yesterday afternoon,  Ba  Jammal said that the Government yesterday received a message  from the Red Crescent and the Red Cross through their regional  representatives in the Arabian Peninsula stating they had met  with other officials and that the matter needs the approval of  the other party, which, unfortunately, views this humanitarian  gesture as a political action. He said that this is the story  behind the obstruction of our humanitarian initiative by those  who remained outside the homeland for 25 years and now returned  to speak on behalf of its sons and prevent this assistance from  reaching the sons of heroic Aden.    At the news conference attended by correspondents from the  local, Arab, and international media in Sanaa, the brother  deputy prime minister denied the allegations and falsehoods  circulated by the trumpets of the gang of apostasy and secession  to the effect that the aircraft of the forces of unity and  constitutional legitimacy are launching raids on the Aden  refinery. He said the forces of unity and constitutional  legitimacy are careful not to harm this refinery or other vital  economic installations.    Brother Ba Jammal said that contacts continue with the  unionist leaders in the YSP, both in and outside Yemen. He  explained that these contacts take place through national  figures from other groupings.    The deputy prime minister, replying to questions posed by  the  media correspondents, tackled the national issues pertaining to  the current developments in the Yemeni arena.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- China's largest  garbage disposal site has been completed in Changping, a  northeastern outskirt county of Beijing.    Covering an area of 70 hectares, the landfill site was  prepared with World Bank loans of 2.53 million U.S. dollars. It  has the capacity to bury 2,000 tons of garbage every day,  one-fifth the city's total daily refuse needing disposal.    After the site is filled up 11 years later, the area will be  afforested to prevent it from polluting the environment.</p>

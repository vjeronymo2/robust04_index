			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WHERE ARE THE FACTS?  </P> <P> We have yet to note groups opposing the Southern California Edison-San Diego  Gas &amp; Electric merger speaking in a way that would encourage factual  dialogue about the issues involved. The most recent example was the story  headlined "SDG&amp;E Merger Opponents File Ad Complaints" (June 22).  </P> <P> In this story, opponents resort to what has become their favorite tactic:  catchy rhetoric that impugns the character and integrity of the utilities.  While that approach is a tried-and-true method used by groups that have little  factual basis for their criticism, it is harder to understand why the media  would repeat such language without challenging its sponsors for hard facts to  back up their rhetoric. The Coalition for Local Control and the Utility  Consumer Action Network are using the media and getting away with it.  </P> <P> Continuing coverage of this type raises a couple of questions:  </P> <P> * Is the media demanding at least some proof of inflammatory grandstanding  against the utilities? If not, why not?  </P> <P> * If so, should such proof not be indicated in the coverage?  </P> <P> A spokesman for the state attorney general's office termed the opposing groups'  filing "an unusual complaint." That's an understatement given the fact that the  two utilities have filed a stack of supporting information and sworn testimony  nearly 20 inches high with the state Public Utilities Commission and the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  </P> <P> Have the reporters covering the story read the full filings? If they have,  little has made its way into print. There is a lot of important information  that should be digested and presented to the public to inform the debate on an  important public policy issue.  </P> <P> It certainly would seem fair to hold merger opponents to at least some minimal  standards of proof, even if not as detailed or rigorous as what the regulatory  agencies required of SDG&amp;E and SCE. The lack of any insistence by the media  on factual information to back up anti-merger spokespeople's frequent charges  is a tolerance of a form of latter-day, anti-merger McCarthyism.  </P> <P> San Diegans for the Merger was formed specifically to encourage a balanced  discussion. Unfortunately, to the extent that the rhetoric of the opposition is  picked up without challenge, a balanced discussion becomes much more difficult  to achieve.  </P> <P> L.F. O'DONNELL  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

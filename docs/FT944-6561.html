			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Leading Article: All change in Whitehall Although often disparaged at home for its unashamed elitism, Britain's civil service used to be the envy of the democratic world. It now faces an uncertain future, and could be seriously weakened if the government fails to tackle problems created by a decade of rapid structural and cultural change in Whitehall. In a report published last week, the all-party Treasury and Civil Service committee of the House of Commons questioned the adequacy of existing mechanisms for upholding the ethical standards of the civil service. The committee recommended a statutory code of ethics setting out the duties of civil servants and the responsibilities of ministers. It also called for a reformed Civil Service Commission with members drawn largely from outside Whitehall; and for reforms in the relationship between parliament and the semi-autonomous 'next steps' agencies which over the past five years have taken over most of Whitehall's service-delivery responsibilities. These proposals are timely and should be implemented. The committee cited Gladstone's dictum that the British constitution 'presumes more boldly than any other the good faith of those who work it'. Recent events, notably the admission by civil servants to the 'arms for Iraq' inquiry that they drafted inaccurate replies for ministers, have brought that good faith into question, and support the case for a code of ethics. The case is made well-nigh imperative by the impact of 15 years of one-party rule. When parties alternate regularly in power, permanent officials have a strong incentive not to mistake party convenience for the national interest. They are under far less pressure to separate the two when serving one set of political masters for a protracted period. Ministerial accountability The doctrine of ministerial accountability also needs be modernised to reflect new realities. It is a nonsense to pretend that ministers can be properly accountable to parliament for the work of executive agencies for which they have no operational responsibility. As the committee notes, the government's attempt to draw a distinction between accountability, which cannot be delegated by ministers, and responsibility, which can, is 'unconvincing'. Chief executives of agencies should be directly and personally accountable to select committees of the Commons for the implementation of their annual performance agreements. It might be advisable to go further still and give select committees a role in the appointment of agency chief executives and other senior members of quangos. Such a step could underpin the political impartiality of senior officials in agencies and quangos, and do something to redress the unhealthy domination of government over parliament which is a prime cause of much existing unease. Contradictory signals However, current Whitehall reforms beg two larger issues. Is the government committed to the continuation of the career civil service? If not, how does it intend to ensure that the senior civil service is schooled in the standards and ethics which today's officials mostly accept from long training? Ministers are sending out contradictory signals in response to the first question. On the one hand, they pay lip service to open competition for top jobs, and are pressing forward with 'market testing' and cuts in the number of senior officials; on the other hand, they appear reluctant to advertise many top jobs outside Whitehall, let alone to adopt the New Zealand practice of short-term contracts for senior officials inside mainstream departments. Ministers must make their intentions clear. The official-for-life mentality of most civil servants has hitherto provided a critical underpinning for the ethics and political neutrality of Whitehall. It has also limited - although not banished - the 'revolving door' problem of officials anxiously seeking outside jobs. If Whitehall is, by contrast, to provide short career stops for an elite of high-flyers who commute between the public and private sectors, then far more attention will have to paid to questions of recruitment, pay and conflicts of interest. A statutory code of ethics would only be a first step towards reform.</p>

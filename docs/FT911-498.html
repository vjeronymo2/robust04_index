			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Sport: At play with a double-edged blade - Cricket money, one of the game's permanent needs. But what do businesses stand to gain from sponsoring cricket? That is a much trickier question and produced some tricky answers when I tried it out on companies which sponsor first class cricket today or have sponsored it in the past. Cricket and money have always been bed-fellows, but in the good old days uncertainty about profit and loss was part of the fun. In the 18th and 19th centuries a game was only a good game if it was played for a spectacular sum of money, which was raised by wealthy patrons with an interest in the game. The interest was primarily financial and these patrons were big time gamblers. In his classic The Young Cricketer's Tutor John Nyren recalls the Hambledon Club in the 1770s and 80s playing matches against All England teams for massive sums of money: Pounds 500, even Pounds 1,000 a time, of which the players got only Pounds 5 each if they won a fortune for their patrons, Pounds 3 if they lost. Such was the 'heart-stirrring' excitement on these occasions that Hambledon's most generous patron, Sir Horace Mann, spent his time 'walking about . . . cutting down the daisies with his stick - a habit with him when he was agitated.' By the 20th century patrons like Mann were a thing of the past. As The Times reported tersely in September 1908, 'cricket has ceased to attract the betting-man, although there are few signs that he did the early game much harm.' Indeed, without betting patrons to support and enliven it, first class cricket soon found it hard to pay its way. Those who are old enough to remember the Gillette Safety Razor Company launching English one-day cricket and commercial sponsorship in 1963, in the form of the Gillette Cup, will remember the desperation of county cricket in the preceding years. Fewer people were going to county matches; clubs were losing money and appeal, after a post-war revival. Gillette's Pounds 6,500 was a life-saver, though the limited overs competitions it inspired have been sucking the life-blood out of the county game ever since. The Gillette Cup was a success - for one-day cricket; for players such as Ted Dexter with one-day, cavalier appeal; for commercial sponsorship, only adopted as a last resort by cricket's nervous and straight-laced establishment, and, one would have thought, for Gillette, whose name quickly became synonymous with one-day cricket. Gillette is a big, American, multi-national company and one of its publicity squad told me that it went into cricket sponsorship to acquire an English identity that would outdo the crossed swords and traditional English image of its razor blade rival, Wilkinson. He added with a weary chuckle,'That's the official line, but you're never really sure what you want out of advertising or sponsorship.' Why did Gillette stop its sponsorship in 1980? 'We left because the Test and County Cricket Board got too greedy for funds and asked for too much money.' Modern sponsors, then, are not sure when their sponsorship is making them a profit, only when it is making them a loss. I think Sir Horace Mann would be cutting down more than daisies if his money had been put into a wager where it did not matter which team won and he would not have known when he had won something because he would not have known what he was hoping to win in the first place. But that seems to be how modern cricket sponsors like it. They talk about identity and public profile, not profit. Cornhill Insurance sponsored its first Test Match in 1978 when, according to a company survey, less than 2 per cent of people had heard of Cornhill. Apparently the figure has risen enormously with the company's Test Match sponsorship, but Cornhill's marketing manager said he could not say how many more customers and how much more money the 'improved name awareness' had brought in; that would be 'too crude an evaluation.' Sponsors' aims are long term. Most companies continue their sponsorship for long spells, at least ten years, usually longer. I was assured by Alan Smith, Chief Executive of the TCCB, which is in charge of national sponsorship, that if any of cricket's eight current large sponsors were to withdraw, there are companies queueing up to replace them. It is the TCCB which lays down the terms and conditions of sponsorship. Take it or leave it. When Gillette left National Westminster Bank took its place and has just extended its sponsorship into its eleventh year. No-one at NatWest had any doubt that the money and effort required for sponsorship on this scale were worth while and that its sponsorship was a success, in spite of hard times in the counting house. Success may be hard to measure but it is easier if the head of the company concerned is 'a cricket nut', which is how Lord Alexander, Chairman of NatWest Bank, happily describes himself. The more nuts the better. Unlike most things in English first class cricket at the moment, sponsorship looks good. I dislike myself for saying this, but I can not help feeling that it all sounds just a bit too good to be true. Does not the 'happy, friendly, working relationship' which the TCCB enjoys with cricket's sponsors have an element of danger for the spectator who only goes to cricket matches to watch, without powerful money to back his or her views? What is to stop a company offering money for the privilege of laying down some of the conditions in its sponsorship contract? Alan Smith did not waste words: 'If we were offered Pounds 20m in return for letting a sponsor put his name in the middle of the wicket we would refuse, not for aesthetic but for practical reasons; it would distract the players.' Cricket without an aesthetic dimension - does that mean logos on the outfield; stripes, numbers and colours and, before long, sponsors' names on cricketers' clothes; the thin end of a wedge where only money is valuable? A crisp official reply. 'We may try out one or two names painted on the field of play this summer. We don't know yet.' I sighed sadly. 'Oh, come on. We can't afford to be impractical. If outfield advertising brings in money to help school cricket, we have to take it.' I suppose so, and soon we will have logos on cricket shirts too. But with many a wistful glance to the handsome cricket we inherited from Hambledon in its prime, when it was the excellence of play that spoke for its sponsor, as celebrated by Rev Cotton in his noble song 'Cricket': 'The parties are met, and array'd all in white Famed Elis ne'er boasted so pleasing a sight.'</p>

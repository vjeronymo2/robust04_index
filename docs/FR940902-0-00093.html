			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter thought the process for notifying the Secretary regarding significant developments concerning the grant or subgrant was too complicated and could delay the implementation of the project and workers' access to services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 631.63(b) simply requires the grantees to provide information to the Department on any significant developments that impact the project. This reporting requirement should not affect or delay the project's execution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Special Provisions for CAETA and DDP Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 631.60 has been clarified to state that Subpart G relates to programs and funds reserved to the Secretary for use under part B of title III of the Act: Including section 323 (20% discretionary funds); section 324 (Demonstration Programs); section 325 (Defense Conversion Adjustment Program); section 325A (Defense Diversification Program); and section 326 (Clean Air Employment Transition Assistance).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Defense Authorization Act for 1993 authorized the Defense Diversification Program (DDP) as an amendment to JTPA, at section 325A. Its purpose is to provide retraining and readjustment assistance to workers and military personnel dislocated by defense cutbacks and closures of military facilities; and to provide planning support and conversion assistance for diversification of affected facilities within an area impacted by reductions in military expenditures or closure of military facilities. Section 631.65(c) of this final rule prescribes the needs-related payments procedure in accordance with the requirements in section 326(f) of the Act, as required by section 325A(i) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Clean Air Act is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency; however, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, at section 110(a), amended the Job Training Partnership Act by adding a new section 326, establishing the Clean Air Employment Transition Assistance (CAETA) program. Section 326 is designed to assure the establishment of programs to provide assistance to workers dislocated as a result of a firm's compliance with the Clean Air Act. The purpose of these programs is to provide readjustment and retraining assistance to eligible workers to enable such workers to return to work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department published proposed CAETA regulations for comment on March 24, 1992 (57 FR 10232). Thirteen State, substate entities and other organizations submitted comments. Upon review, the Department has determined that there is no programmatic justification to have separate regulations for Clean Air. It is necessary, however, to make specific provision in the JTPA regulations for specific statutory requirements applicable to the CAETA program. The specific statutory requirements for that program are implemented herein at &sect;631.65.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the comments received pursuant to the proposed regulations requested clarification of general JTPA title III areas that were subsequently addressed in the Interim Final Regulations on December 29, 1992 (57 FR 62004). The following discussion relates to comments on issues specific to the Clean Air Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Administration of Clean Air Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested including a statement that the Clean Air Act is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency. DOL agrees with this comment and has added this statement in the preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Needs-Related Payments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments were received on the provisions of needs-related payments. One commenter indicated that the language in the proposed regulations might discourage grant applicants from serving those eligible for payments so they can conserve funds for training, and that applicants could perceive ETA as biased toward proposed grants with limited needs-related payments (NRP's). It was also believed that grant applicants should be encouraged to seek eligible dislocated workers most-in-need, particularly those requiring income support during training. The language at &sect;631.65(c) of the final rule is intended to reflect the statutory requirement that CAETA programs provide for adequate needs-related payments. The language is not intended to permit a programmatic restriction against those dislocated workers who are eligible to receive NRP's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter raised a question about when grantees should start using family income to determine eligibility for needs-related payments. The Department agrees that there should be a time frame; it is only upon actual enrollment in a training and/or education program that one becomes eligible for consideration to receive needs-related payments. Individual or family income for the six-month period immediately prior to a participant's enrollment in training and education programs is to be annualized to determine eligibility for needs-related payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that the determination of family income at the time of eligibility determination, and that the three-month re-determination requirement in the proposed rule would create administrative burdens. The determination of family income only applies to those dislocated workers who (1) have been determined eligible pursuant to section 326(a) of the Act, (2) have exhausted or are not eligible for unemployment compensation benefits, and (3) have been enrolled in training and education programs pursuant to section 326(f) of the Act. Section 326(f)(4) of the Act requires adjustments reflecting changes in family income. The final rule is revised to require that eligibility determinations ``shall be reviewed periodically;'' however, it is expected that an equitable system would be outlined in a grant application. It is expected that a grantee's system would be sensitive to participants' probable decreasing family income (depending upon the date of layoff) under the six-month income determination rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter suggested clarifying restrictions on needs-related payments to participants when relocation, out-of-area job search, or TAA allowances have ceased, or when OJT has been completed. The statute requires that needs-related payments be available to enable participants to complete training or education programs. Relocation and out-of-area job search allowances would normally be provided to participants who possess marketable skills, and, therefore, are not enrolled in training or education. If TAA allowances were being provided for training or education, needs-related payments may be used when TAA allowances are exhausted (if a participant is otherwise eligible for and enrolled in an education or training program under CAETA). After OJT, a participant ordinarily is employed and receives wages from the employer. If the participant is not employed, NRP's could only be made if the participant is enrolled in other training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

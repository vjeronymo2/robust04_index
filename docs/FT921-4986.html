			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Earnings at Heineken rise 12% as sales slip HEINEKEN, the Dutch brewer, posted a 12 per cent rise in net profit in 1991 in spite of a drop in the volume of beer sales caused in part by the Gulf war. A stronger second half helped lift Heineken's net profit before extraordinary items to Fl 409.7m (Dollars 221.5m) from Fl 365.7m in 1990. In the first half, which bore the brunt of the Gulf war impact, net profit had risen by less than 1.8 per cent. Heineken said that the higher-priced premium segment of the European beer market and the low-alcohol segment had suffered less from last year's difficult conditions than the overall beer market. This accounts for the fact that sales proceeds showed a rise even though volume sales fell. Turnover was up 5.9 per cent at Fl 8.2bn. Heineken declined to give a figure for volume sales, saying that this would be published in its annual report on April 2. 'The lower level of sales compared to 1990, resulting from bad weather and the consequences of the Gulf crisis in the first half of 1991, could not be fully compensated for in the remaining part of the year,' Heineken noted. Operating profit rose by 19.2 per cent to Fl 729.9m, outstripping the rise in net profit, which was held back by an undisclosed 'considerable rise' in taxes. Heineken also booked a net Fl 33.2m in extraordinary profits in 1991 stemming from the sale of land in Singapore. A roughly similar amount in extraordinary gains from the same land disposal is forecast for 1992. As expected, Heineken left its dividend unchanged at Fl 3.50 per share but announced a one-for-four distribution of bonus shares to shareholders. Heineken distributes bonus shares out of its revaluation reserve every three to four years. Its last bonus issue was in 1989.</p>

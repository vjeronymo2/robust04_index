			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Enough to tempt a saint - A man of many parts inspires Kieran Cooke's choice of food I HAVE always had a soft spot for St Francis Xavier. He had a tough enough life, wandering around the Far East long before the days of decent hotels. And death did not bring peace; far from it. His fellow Portuguese decided that Francis, being the great man he was, should be shared around. There must be more parts of Francis spread around the world than any other saint. A hand in Macau, a leg or foot in Goa. A substantial slice of him in Lisbon. Various parts rumoured to be in Africa. And so we move from saints to stomachs. The connection is simple. I was climbing a hill above the town of Malacca, on Malaysia's west coast, getting the juices flowing in preparation for a slap-up meal. St Francis was buried in Malacca for a few months before being carted off and cut up. There is a statue to him on the hill (one hand is missing). Having paid my respects, the main business of the evening began. Malacca is the home of nyonya food, one of the world's great, but least-known, cuisines. Nyonya, basically, is a delicate blending of Chinese, Malay and Indian. Lest anyone think this might be yet another example of composite cuisine, along the lines of spaghetti and chips or souvlaki and peas, it should be stressed that nyonya has been around for a considerable time and has developed an identity very much its own. At about the time in the mid-16th century that St Francis, still in one piece, was doing his eastern rounds, Chinese immigrants were drifting south into Malay waters. They settled in what later became the Straits settlements: Penang, Malacca and Singapore. Many inter-married with locals and, over the generations, local customs were adopted. The women - the nyonyas - wore the Malay sarong. The men - called babas - built houses mixing both Chinese and local architecture. Known collectively in Malay as Peranakan, many became wealthy members of an emerging merchant class. They developed their own Malay-based patois. There are still plenty of Peranakan in Malacca today. Some of the architecture still survives. But the food is the most enduring feature. To call the recipes complicated is an understatement. A traditional nyonya would take hours to prepare a meal. Like all great cooking, instinct and approximation are far more important than rules on ingredients and detailed measurements. In Malay, this loose cooking style is called agar agar - equivalent to 'a pinch of this and a splash of that.' There are leaves and nuts from Indonesia. Spices - plenty of them - from Malaysia, India and Thailand. Dried fungus, called Cloud's Ears, from China. Yellow rice with hard-boiled eggs dyed red. Coconut and tamarind. Shrimp paste and blimbing (a small, sour fruit). All these, together with fish, chicken, beef or other dishes, are mixed to make a lip-smacking meal. A nyonya feast might start with otak-otak. In Malay this means brains but it is, in fact, fish cake mixed with coconut and spices, cooked and served in special herbal leaves. Then you could move on to such dishes as nyonya laksa, (noodles with prawn paste featuring liberal helpings of chillies and other spices, dried fruits, lime and pineapple); beef rendang (dried beef with a sauce capable of ringing alarm bells down at the fire depot); and perhaps a nyonya-style fish-head curry. On no account should one sidestep the pudding. The Peranakan are hearty believers in their kueh - small cakes and jellies, usually either stuffed or covered in coconut, sometimes both. For something truly local, gulam Malacca should not be missed: sago pudding cooked in brown sugar and coconut milk. The meal is best washed down with liberal amounts of tea. A cooling beer is excellent to have afterwards, relaxing in a cane armchair under a fan. Wine, up against all those far stronger tastes, is a waste of money. There are those who might want to rush out and try a bit of nyonya agar agar for themselves. My advice would be to save up and go to Malacca instead. Two excellent restaurants are ready and waiting. One, the Peranakan House in Cheng Lock street, is in a traditional Peranakan house. Such is the noise level in many restaurants in the East, conversation can be very limited. But here there is peace and quiet - and great food. The other restaurant, a sister to the one in town, is in an old Chinese mansion at Klebang Besar, about five miles out on the coast. I assume that Francis is up there, tasting the succulent fruits of heaven. But it is a pity he could not have stayed together longer - in body and soul. Even a saint might be tempted by nyonya food.</p>

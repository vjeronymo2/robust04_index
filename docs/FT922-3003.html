			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Travel: Homage to a cleaner in Catalonia - Teresa McLean enjoys the friendliness and unfailing good humour of the people in one of Europe's untamed corners YOU have not lived until you have tried explaining to a Catalan cleaning lady that a dog has defecated at the door of your hotel room. The woman spoke neither English nor Spanish, only Catalan, which I do not speak. It had to be body language. Encouraged by other members of the hotel staff, I struggled to explain what was wrong. Eventually the cleaner dipped her mop in her bucket and let it drip suggestively. I started barking. My husband had long since taken refuge in a cafe and I soon joined him. It was a great relief to find, on returning to our room later, that the floor near the door had been scrubbed spotlessly clean. This dog muck episode reflects the chief characteristics of the Catalans we met: their cheerful kindness and helpfulness, alongside the enormous difficulty we had in communicating with them. A few people speak a few words of French or German; hardly anyone speaks English; many people speak, or at least understand, both Catalan and Spanish (known as Castillian), but most people we met took pride in sticking to Catalan. It is unlike any other language I have heard, but apparently has Latin-based roots in common with southern French, some Italian dialects and Romanian. If you are rash enough to try pronouncing it, salvation lies in peoples' unfailing good humour, which stops short of guffaws of laughter. In our 17 days there, the nearest I can remember to a bad-tempered remark was a lady in a bread shop asking us not to touch the loaves on the shelves. Usually shops and markets were only too quick to hand out free samples of anything they had. Bakers took particular pleasure in giving us free slices of coca, a Catalan pastry-bread, the sweet variety often covered with crystallised fruit, pine nuts and sugar. Most coca is nice, but most Catalan food is not. I suspect Catalonia is one of those places, like England, where you find better food in people's homes than in restaurants. Apparently, you can enjoy superb fish cookery on the coast, but we were inland. Fine foods grow: olives, nuts, huge tomatoes, homicidal onions, honeydew melons, plums, grapes, peaches (the staple Catalan fruit) and the great provincial pride and joy - wild fungi, sold fresh in the short autumn season, dried the rest of the year. But these delights die in the cooking, ending up in dull, heavy meals. Lunch is any time between 2.30-5pm, dinner any time between 9.30pm-midnight. Children take a two-to-four-hour siesta and are still up and flourishing after midnight, helping their parents chew their way through dry pork chops and chips, chicken and chips or botifarra (a Catalan version of Cumberland sausage) and chips. The lucky ones might get a squid fritter. Breakfast is a movable feast and better than the others. Usually we got coffee and croissants, while the sturdy natives drank lager and ate salami sandwiches. Fatty food and smoking are two of the province's favourite indulgences, with gallons of lager and iced rose to wash everything down. We first got a taste of this after driving about 80 kms through a symphony of stinks, from abattoirs, farmyards, sewers and God knows what else, on our way from Barcelona airport to Vic, an old-fashioned town famous for its 35 churches and its old-fashioned, well-behaved girls. Vic, like many Catalan towns, is ringed by a fiendish one-way system and we only reached our hotel, late at night, by driving along the pavement, guided by amiable citizens. The receptionist couldn't understand a word we said, so he offered us a beer. Above all else, Vic stands out for its Episcopal Museum, which is crammed full of art treasures, ranging from stone-age carvings to medieval church decorations and a mass of sculptures, paintings and manuscripts. This year the museum is celebrating its centenary and though you cannot hope to fit all its glories into one visit, it would be a crime not to try. Catalonia's religious art is far more beautiful and varied than I had expected, though the damage done by the civil war, even in the tiniest places, was often catastrophic. Some religious buildings, however, escaped unhurt. We walked round several sets of cloisters that had originally belonged to medieval monasteries, the abbey churches now used as parish churches and the cloisters still shady and quiet, with only the occasional fountain and click of a visiting German camera to break the silence. My favourite example of a medieval church still in religious use is the Romanesque, secular cathedral in La Seu D'Urgell, an old town high in the Pyrenees, near the French hardly altered over the centuries. It is tall, slender, dark and hauntingly atmospheric, with a large present-day congregation. The cathedral is in the old, pedestrian quarter of town, which is a warren of covered alleyways and buildings dating back seven centuries, even boasting some ancient grain measures, used today as leaning posts. We were lucky enough to be in one of Seu's old squares when it was showing off the sardana, the Catalan national dance, one Sunday evening. Every weekend the square fills with circles of people dancing the sardana, arms on high, hands joined, stepping in rhythmic patterns. A town band provides the music, playing woodwind, brass and an undercurrent of percussion with robust enthusiasm, until the heat and thirst become too much for them. These are brave men. With the temperature well above 30'F, most men seem to spend a fair bit of time sheltering in bars and playing cards, while women work, cook or talk about men, and weather forecasters stick sun symbols all over maps. It is money for old rope, Spanish weather forecasting. Small wonder most men have short hair, to stay cool. Alas, the same is not true of their shorts, which hang in loud, loose folds round their knees, topped with bum-bags. Most women have long hair before marriage, when a few of them take revenge on the more comfortable sex by getting one of Catalonia's wealth of hairdressers to cut their hair drastically short. Both sexes, of all ages, spend leisurely hours sitting on benches, sizing up the haircuts and all other visible features of people walking past while their children charge around and trade in skate-boards. Being stared at is one of the things you have to get used to if you go to Catalonia, or anywhere else in Spain. It is part of Spanish life. So is sitting in cafes. In a hot, humid month like August, one of the most welcome things this lovely, languid pastime has to offer is iced mineral water, available without 'gas' but generally assumed to be more desirable the more gaseous it is. Bubbles fight the heat, which is formidable. Spring must be the best time to visit Catalonia, when the weather is cooler and the glorious countryside drenched in flowers. Even at the end of a scorching summer, we saw flowers and herbs everywhere. There were spectacular birds, including eagles, red and black kites, hawks, honey buzzards and bee-eaters; spectacular dragonflies and butterflies - too many and various to take in, flying off in thick clouds when disturbed. But most of the rivers had dried up. The majestic River Segre was one of the few still tumbling past us as we drove through the mountains and hills. The trick with spectacular, dramatic, indeed occasionally unsurfaced and hair-raising journeys such as these, far up in the wilds, is to head for towns which the guidebook describes as quaint or left over from a former glory. It was not just sadly but with a sense of foreboding that we turned towards Barcelona for the flight home. Somehow it felt frightening to leave such a wild place, where little has changed since the mountains and forests were formed, and go back to the tamed parts of Europe.</p>

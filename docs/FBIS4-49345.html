			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing and agencies] </F>   [Excerpt] The Chinese Government marked yesterday's 75th  anniversary of the May 4 Movement by placing one of the  country's most prominent scientists and democracy activists  under house arrest. Professor Xu Liangying, who for many people  personifies the ideals of science and democracy first evoked  during the 1919 May 4 Movement, said two police officers had  been placed at the entrance to his apartment building yesterday  morning, preventing him from leaving.    In Tiananmen Square, authorities hosted official functions  to  stop dissidents from holding pro-democracy activities at the  scene of the June 4, 1989, massacre. In an early morning  ceremony on the square's windy expanse, 10,000 youths, including  middle school pupils, police cadets and workers, pledged  allegiance to the party's Communist Youth League. They stood in  formation behind leaders holding large red flags, and thrust  their right fists into the air as they vowed to struggle for  communism. Van-loads of plainclothes and uniformed police were  posted on and around the square all day.    In a telephone interview yesterday, Professor Xu said: "It  is very important that there be free and open discussion of  science and democracy on this anniversary, but it is obvious  they don't want me to talk about it." After being allowed a  certain amount of freedom over the past few weeks, Professor Xu  said it was ironic that the authorities should choose the 75th  anniversary of a patriotic movement to restrict his movements  once again. "They clearly still think it is a very sensitive  date," he said.    The Government used the anniversary to urge the country's  youth to uphold "the fine tradition of the May 4 Movement" and  shoulder the "historic mission" to bring China into the 21st  century. The official party newspaper, the People's Daily  [RENMIN RIBAO], said the fundamental goal of that mission was to  stress the study of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's theories on  developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and adherence  to the party's basic line.    Professor Xu, however, found the connection between Deng  Xiaoping's theories and the spirit of May 4 a little hard to  swallow. "That's ridiculous," he said. "What has Deng got to  do with May 4?" Students at Beijing University, one of the most  active colleges during the May 4 Movement, were equally  doubtful. "Everyone is entitled to their own opinion," an  economics research student at the university said of the  editorial. Reading Mr Deng's works was useful in understanding  modern society and the economy, he said, but there was no need  to study the patriarch's theories religiously.    This year's anniversary celebrations have been kept  relatively low key by the authorities in order to prevent  China's youth from getting too carried away with the spirit of  the May 4 Movement. But most students at Beijing University  were not in a particularly festive mood anyway. There was no  way for students to enjoy anniversary activities not sanctioned  by the school authorities even if they wanted to, another  student said. Likewise, he said, it would be virtually  impossible for students in Beijing to be able to mark the fifth  anniversary of the June 4 massacre.    Despite being downplayed by the authorities, most students  interviewed at Beijing University yesterday said the May 4  Movement was still of significance for today's younger  generation. The spirit, idealism and patriotism of May 4 was  still evident, it was just expressed in different ways, they  said.    The ideals of "science and democracy" were still held by  many  students although the development of the legal system was  equally important, the economics research student said. Most  students, however, were more concerned with developing their own  potential. [passage omitted]</p>

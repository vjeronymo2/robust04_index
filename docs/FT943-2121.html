Demand in some areas of the UK market for plugs, sockets, circuit breakers and other equipment fell by 40 per cent during the recession but the patchy recovery of 12 months ago had strengthened, albeit slowly and unevenly, he said at the association's annual lunch. The upturn in the construction industry had boosted sales of electrical equipment, although construction activity was still down on pre-recession levels.</p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Your mind is but a pandemonium I am regularly transported by works of philosophy. This Christmas, the good deed was performed by Consciousness Explained,* the effervescent latest offering from Daniel Dennett, the American philosopher of mind. Within a few pages I was once again questioning the world's priorities. Why do we spend such an inordinate time analysing trivia such as elections, recessions and bank frauds while virtually ignoring the fantastic philosophical mysteries of human life? Consciousness may seem as untroubling a concept as rain or money: it is what happens when you wake up each morning. The difficulty lies in finding a place for it in a scientific description of the world. Most of us are unthinking materialists. Without fully comprehending the intricacies of modern physics, we believe the world is composed of particles of some kind - particles that if split will unleash huge amounts of energy. We believe in science because it works: it conquers diseases, builds bridges and puts men on the moon. But now consider your own inner mental life. Imagine a beautiful sunset. How is this image consistent with the objective world of science? How could a collection of particles - or anything physical - constitute a mental image of a sunset? And where, indeed, does that image reside? It is not literally in our heads: it could not be found by a brain surgeon. Yet neither is it in the external physical world. Descartes proposed a famous solution: dualism. The world consists of two types of substance: physical objects (including our brains), and minds. He even speculated that the pineal gland in the brain provides a direct link to the non-physical mind. But dualism seems a hopelessly flawed theory. How can non-physical thoughts gain any purchase on the physical world? They are not streams of sub-atomic particles or anything else physical, so how can they influence brain cells? It is like expecting a shadow to lift a weight. Believing they could not doubt their inner mental lives, Schopenhauer and other German idealists took one logical route: they denied the reality of the physical world. Most of us are not prepared to make that bold leap: hence the vexed search for a physical explanation of consciousness. In Consciousness Explained, Mr Dennett argues that Cartesian dualism, although discredited, has left an unfortunate legacy: we no longer believe the pineal gland is a 'fax machine to the soul' but we have unconsciously absorbed Descartes's assumption that perceptual information is ordered and processed by a mysterious central entity - 'I'. Mr Dennett claims there is no inner sanctum, no 'Oval Office', nothing that corresponds to our ordinary notion of personal identity. Instead he puts forward a 'pandemonium' theory of consciousness. Information of different kinds is bombarding different parts of the brain all the time. It is processed in parallel by millions of separate specialist circuits - none of which is intelligent or conscious - and subject to continual revision. The circuits dealing with words he calls 'language demons'. But evolution has thrown up hosts of others, such as our automatic tendency to duck when objects loom before our eyes. What we think of as consciousness is the product of 'competition among the many concurrent contentful events in the brain'. He contrasts this view of consciousness as a democratic society of competing perceptual agents with Descartes's 'bureaucratic model' of a central processor - the mysterious soul - controlling everything. Mr Dennett admits his theory is little more than a suggestive sketch. But it has the virtue of actually trying to explain something. Positing a soul or central agency merely avoids the difficult questions: how is IT able to function as a conscious agent? Mr Dennett's pandemonium model rings true to personal experience. When I write - or think - I find ideas and images bubbling up in an uncontrollable fashion exactly as he suggests. It helps explain how we can answer questions without planning what we are going to say. Writing in 1739, David Hume, the Scottish philosopher, put it thus: 'For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other . . . I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and I can never observe anything but the perception . . .' You may think something is missing. How can a heap of circuitry be conscious of itself? Mr Dennett's answer is that the individual bits of the brain, built to perceive the external world, cannot help 'perceiving' each other: hence our confused image of our own identity. It follows that a sufficiently complex computer could be as conscious as you or I. Mr Dennett is unruffled by this thought: if you are already a materialist and thus accept that flesh and blood can be conscious, why should you baulk at a conscious heap of silicon? I find Mr Dennett's theories about personal identity stimulating, if not entirely comprehensible. But I am less certain the book justifies its title. Go back to the mental image of a sunset. How can this really have a physical explanation? Mr Dennett's answer is that an explanation is valid only if it goes beyond the thing to be explained. Thus a proper theory of consciousness should not allude to mental images. I remain mystified and intend to make matters worse by listening to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony - surely not a collection of sub-atomic particles. * Published by Little, Brown in New York</p>

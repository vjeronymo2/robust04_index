			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / CBS wins winter Olympics rights CBS may have lost its broadcasting rights for American football, but it has has reasserted its claims as a top sports television network by winning the US television rights for the 1998 winter Olympics. The network was due to announce yesterday it had secured the rights for the winter games, to be held in Nagano, Japan, with a record bid of Dollars 375m (Pounds 253.3m). CBS televised the Albertville games in 1992 and will also broadcast next month's winter Olympics in Lillehammer, for which it paid around Dollars 295m. The Lillehammer games could draw enormous attention, as the women's figure skating contest, already one of the most popular television events, is now rapidly turning into a made-for-TV melodrama after the attack on Ms Nancy Kerrigan, one of the top US skaters. CBS was stunned last month when it lost the rights to broadcast games from the National Football Conference, the top American football league, to Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox Network.</p>

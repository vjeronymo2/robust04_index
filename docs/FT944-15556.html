			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Pains of glass - Why a Derbyshire-based company altered work and pay structures Around Derbyshire's coalfields in the north of England there is widespread mistrust of anyone who says that improving productivity will make jobs more secure. The closure of pits shortly after British Coal exhorted employees to higher productivity left many understandably cynical. Local feelings were therefore running high three years ago when new management at Plyglass, a glass processor in Somercotes, Derbyshire, attempted to rebuild the basis on which its 460-strong workforce was paid. The company, which makes tempered and laminated glass, sealed double glazing units and PVCU windows for the construction industry, was typical of many long-established companies. Industrial relations were characterised by management and labour simply co-existing with little sense of common purpose in an atmosphere of mistrust and hostility. Plyglass's efforts to break with the 'them and us' attitude and improve productivity will be familiar with many other companies trying to alter working practices. Its experience underlines the difficulty of changing deeply entrenched attitudes. When Alan Twaite arrived at Plyglass as managing director three years ago, he says, it was clear that company interests were not uppermost in the minds of many in the workforce. He says less than 10 per cent of the workforce at its four sites could be described as 'caring' and willing to learn how to improve the business. A smaller minority were firmly rooted in the 'stuff it' camp. But the vast majority of employees were sitting on the fence, undecided which side of the traditional divide they were on. 'There was this feeling that if everyone was standing to attention the management was in control,' says Twaite. 'In fact, Plyglass was paying the highest wages in the area but it was bad value for money,' he adds. The business was also in financial difficulty. Like many larger companies, the parent of Plyglass, family-owned Greenbrook Industries, had gone on an acquisition spree in the 1980s that proved unsuccessful. Plyglass was on the way to making pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.4m on sales of Pounds 17m in the year to June 1993 and was threatening the health of the whole group. Twaite quickly sold or closed the Scottish, Welsh and Hampshire companies. But he believed the big obstacle to further progress was working practices. 'The productivity issue was important, to solve an attitude problem,' says Twaite. But the company also needed the workforce on its side to reduce waste of materials. Sixty per cent of manufacturing costs is accounted for by materials compared with less than 10 per cent for labour costs. 'One does not address this issue with enforced disciplines,' Twaite says. 'You have to get the guys to treat the product with care.' With the one remaining site at Somercotes, the management started looking at the annual pay settlement. Under long-established practice, the Glass and Glazing Federation and the General, Municipal and Boilermakers Union would negotiate a basic rate that accounted for about half average pay. The balance was negotiated in bonuses at the factory. Twaite says this system led to all sorts of anomalies. The bonus was partly decided by time and motion studies of throughput on a particular machine. Any breakages or work that required more work led to higher bonuses. Furthermore, the system was geared to maximising output, not to meeting demand from customers. At the beginning of 1993 Twaite and production director Bob Taylor decided to raise the basic pay to about 80 per cent of the average pay under the old system. This would be enhanced under a new pooled bonus scheme. The new scheme includes a productivity element; if departmental targets are exceeded, the bonus pool is credited. Employees also work to quality targets. This is based on a formula that looks at the amount of materials waste, whether orders are delivered on time and the level of customer returns. The bonus pool is then shared equally throughout the company. Management's announcement of the plan, after months of trying to negotiate its introduction, was greeted with a vote for strike action. But the strike never happened - Taylor says because district union oficials realised the company's customers would take their orders elsewhere, effectivly closing the factory. Eighteen months later, there has been progress but not unqualified success. Output has increased by 16 per cent, while the wage bill is unchanged year on year. But there has been less consistent progress in reducing waste. 'I cannot point to continuous improvement,' says Taylor though he claims Plyglass is better placed to manage its reduction. The response from the workforce has been mixed. Twaite says some old attitudes die slowly. Some employees are only just beginning to understand what the company is trying to do for its customers. The management admits it also has much to learn, particularly about communication. Employees complain they get little notice of the size of their bonus payments or explanation why they vary. 'The main problem is that the workforce does not feel it can see the bad months coming whereas in the old system they could tell what their pay would be,' says Taylor. The company has returned to profit with Pounds 620,000 from sales reduced to Pounds 16m. But it believes it has only scratched the surface of possible improvements. It is working with consultants on a programme of continuous improvement funded partly by the Derbyshire Training and Enterprise Council. And it is stepping up efforts to communicate better - a move Taylor says will pay off as more employees try to isolate problems that have affected the bonus pool. Whether this is enough to give Plyglass a future as a successful, independent glass processor is uncertain, given the consolidation taking place within the industry, says Twaite. But its efforts so far have at least given it the opportunity to fight for that future.</p>

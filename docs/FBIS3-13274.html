He described it as a source of pride and honor for  Islamic Iran. He referred to the impact of international  Jerusalem Day in keeping alive the issue of Palestine which is  the most fundamental issue that faces the Islamic world. He  said: The holding of ceremonies marking international Jerusalem  Day has an important effect on the continuation of the struggle  of the people of Palestine. He stressed: Israel definitely will  not last and the acceptance of any kind of peace plan with the  regime occupying Jerusalem is suicidal.    The president referred to the colonial history of the  creation of Israel and said: During World War II, world  arrogance realized that Zionists were a threat to the European  community and decided to create a base in the Middle East to  achieve its inauspicious goals, and that is exactly what it did.  Since then the Israeli policy has been to drive out Muslim  Palestinians step by step and to usurp their lands. Apart from  such actions, Israel has also established security zones that  can be used as a weapon at all times.    The president added: The mass murder of the oppressed Muslim  Palestinians in cases such as Dayr Yasin and the recent tragic  event in the Abraham mosque in Hebron are among the usual  practices of the Zionist regime.    The interim Friday prayer leader of Tehran referred to the  colonial nature of Israel and said: The Zionist regime cannot  resist a second against the struggle of the Muslim nation of  Palestine if it decides to set aside its colonial nature. It is  for that reason that it has always enjoyed the support of  America and Britain so as to maintain their interests in the  region.    He added: The establishment of an Arab-Israeli peace does  not  seem logical as long as the relationship between the usurper  Zionist regime and the Palestinian nation is one of the  oppressor against the oppressed. The president said:    [Begin Rafsanjani recording] The logic of the western world  for creating Israel is extremely faulty and vulnerable. You see  how deceptively they are trying to make themselves look good,  but they have come unstuck there. But Israel is so important to  them that they are prepared to take this shame on their name to  their grave. They are prepared to see all their claims wiped out  for the sake of preserving that malevolent, arrogant entity,  which is behaving this way.    But, will Israel last? In my opinion, no. It will  definitely not last. That foreign body that has entered a  living being cannot last long.    In my opinion, ultimately, the way to salvation is Islam.  What can do something, keep the people on the scene, preserve  this lengthy and hazardous crusade for a long time, is Islam.  What one is willing to live for, die for, put up with torture,  hunger and homelessness for, is the religious and Islamic spirit  which we have experienced in Iran. [end recording]    In the first sermon Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Hashemi-  Rafsanjani referred to the role of programs about worship,  particularly during the holy month of Ramadan. He said the  meaningful presence, the revolutionary and Islamic concept and  spirit, and the revolutionary fervor of religious centers, the  resistance against conspiracies and the continuation of  construction was the reason for the success and strength of the  society.    The interim Friday imam of Tehran added: Iran's all-round  reconstruction, especially after eight years of holy defense, is  the result of the self-improvement of the Muslim nation of Iran  during this auspicious and holy period. Because people make up  the pillars of society. If those pillars are strong and robust,  and believe in religious principles and beliefs, undoubtedly the  society will last.    In another part of his sermons the president said: Without  the presence of earnest people on the scene to defend the  Islamic revolution, the issues of the country, which is under  foreign pressure from all sides, could not be advanced. We are  in the construction period and with their ploys the enemies  intend to dishearten us in that endeavor and bring us to our  knees. But our nation, with the alertness which stems from that  worship has stood against all those plots and will continue to  do so.    He expressed the hope that, like the people of Iran, other  Muslim nations of the world will find their way and fight off  the conspiracies of world arrogance.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Hanoi finds Friends in international places - Kevin Bubel on attempts to preserve the city's culture The visitor's first reaction to Hanoi is often surprise that after decades of war, isolation and neglect it is still intact and in many places unchanged. Few cities in the region have managed to preserve their colonial and Asian heritage under the pressures of rapid economic expansion. But while rapid change looms for Vietnam, the drive towards prosperity may not sound Hanoi's cultural death knell. An organisation recently launched in the Vietnamese capital aims to encourage new investment and growth with the help of corporate funds, while preserving the city's culture and its architectural environment. The Friends of Hanoi Heritage is an international foundation supported by the Vietnam government, UNESCO and other international government bodies. Its board of trustees is chaired by Gough Whitlam, the former Australian prime minister. Accompanying him are Vietnam's Vice-Minister for Construction, Pham Sy Liem, and the Vice-Chairman of the Hanoi People's Committee, Dinh Hanh. Registered as a charitable trust in Australia, it is starting to attract investment from corporate backers interested in doing business in Vietnam. Cash will fund projects to set up the legal, economic, social and political frameworks with which to get planning and conservation programmes in motion. In return, supporters of the foundation are promised useful business contacts with Vietnamese officials and fringe benefits - such as use of the Friends logo (a pagoda), government briefings on investment and local television exposure. The biggest donors will also receive invitations to briefings by Vietnam's prime minister and senior ministers. One of the project organisers, John Goodyear says it provides an 'ethical entry' into government and commercial markets. Goodyear, an Australian lawyer who has worked in Asia for some years, is a director of the Sydney-based Indochina Financial Services (IFS), the company appointed by the trust to direct fund raising. 'It's about preserving the city while recognising there is going to be economic growth. If it's not done correctly you don't have a city, you have another Bangkok,' says Goodyear, referring to the development sprawl of the Thai city. Price Waterhouse, the accountancy group, joined the organisation at the outset. It acts as the foundation's auditor and advises on setting up investment structures. The idea was first taken to selected companies in Hong Kong at the end of February. Interest has also picked up in Japan, one of the largest foreign investors in Vietnam and in Singapore. The fund-raising target for the first three years of the trust's 10-year duration is Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m). The foundation does not undertake its own conservation projects, but brings in money and advice so that the Vietnamese government can devise and implement its urban planning strategy. For companies already involved with Vietnam, Peter Wallman, the IFS managing director and a former Australian investment banker, says donations to an organisation such as Friends could act as 'insurance' for keeping up good relations. 'When you have a very powerful government which can make unilateral decisions, it's really important for a company to be linked to the cultural side of the country.' Hanoi's western architectural influence, provided by the French before they were forced to give up colonial rule in 1954, is much in evidence as the city was spared US bombs during the Vietnam war. Although run down, the streets of Hanoi, also the cultural capital of the country, have a refined air. Divided into distinct quarters, the city was devised on a small, human scale. There is little four-wheeled traffic, with goods carried on the back of bicycles. But more cars would bring many areas to a standstill. There, says Goodyear, lies the other incentive for outside companies to consider the Friends initiative. 'If you're building a hotel you'll want to be sure that in 20 years' time, traffic can still get to it. You'll have an interest in maintaining development, so that the city grows in a proper way.' Putting together a city-wide cultural conservation plan is complex. It involves road and housing development, resettlement of certain parts of the community and disruption to local business, as well as shaking up national and local government departments. Friends has begun work on an archive of pictures and written material to establish which buildings are worth saving, using sources in Vietnam and France. The second stage will look at the drafting of a legal framework to protect individual sites, define land rights and set planning and construction standards. A long-term objective is to pass on professional and technical expertise , so that the conservation and planning process can continue in Hanoi and across Vietnam. 'The Friends can't unilaterally change the (development) law. But they can say 'this is the recommended law' and if that is developed in conjunction with the Vietnam government, then it's going to get legal passage,' says Wallman. Decisions and projects will rest with Hanoi. But Goodyear says that western experience could be 'layered in' to advise on which errors to avoid.</p>

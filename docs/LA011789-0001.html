			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLIDAY MADNESS  </P> <P> Every year we go crazy from Thanksgiving through Christmas and New Year's Day.  What a sham! What a shame!  </P> <P> The holiday season does us more harm than good. Though promising peace and joy,  this time of year brings depression, debt, dyspepsia and drunkenness. Bah  humbug.  </P> <P> Let's end the traditional madness of forced togetherness, hypocritical  sentimentality, fattening food, debilitating drink, rampant commercialism and  meaningless ritual. It's not worth the pain.  </P> <P> These winter holidays were designed by primitive societies to relieve their  fear of the dark. But we today don't need exorcism. We are free to celebrate  life year-round without all the hype, hoopla and high expectations  traditionally programmed into one crazy month of the year.  </P> <P> JOHN MAYBURY  </P> <P> San Francisco  </P></p>

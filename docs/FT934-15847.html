			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Mixed views in Bridgwater as Lib Dems wait to pounce - Roland Adburgham revisits the FT's panel of voters in Somerset THE OVATION given to Mr John Major yesterday found an echo in at least one corner of Somerset's Bridgwater constituency, where a small panel of voters selected by the FT has sat in judgment on all three of the party conferences. 'It was an excellent speech,' said Mrs Beatrice Forber, a Tory supporter who admits she has been unhappy about the party in the past year. 'He is suddenly coming into his own. I feel that the shadow of Thatcher has faded and she will now go where she belongs - into the history books.' The panel, however, was sharply polarised by the conference. Mrs Forber considered it would 'steady the boat' and be 'tremendously helpful' in dissuading Tory supporters from deserting to the Liberal Democrats. Bridgwater is one of four Tory-held seats in Somerset which could be vulnerable to the Liberal Democrats at the next general election. Others thought rightwing sentiments expressed by some speakers might alienate the uncommitted. Mr Allan Challenger, a former member of the Labour party, was dismayed by the tone of the conference. 'I found the discussions on law and order and single parents putrid in terms of their prejudice,' he said. 'I fear that the right is gaining dominance in the Tory party at the moment.' He thought the conference might backfire on Tory attempts to spike Liberal Democrat guns. 'Some of the language used has been so extreme that people with misgivings about what the Tories have done to the social fabric would be rather alarmed.' Mr Hugh Barran, a solicitor and Liberal Democrat supporter, agreed. The conference made the Tories appear 'less attractive, more doctrinaire and less sympathetic'. They needed a sense of balance on issues such as single parents. 'Any system of benefits has some room for abuse. But the right appear to be taking it out on some people who are not capable of looking after themselves properly.' Mr Ian Weston, a Bridgwater businessman, also felt the Tories appeared insensitive, but did not blame Mr Major. 'At the moment, he is the only person whom I want to lead the Tory party . . . Kenneth Clarke would be disastrous.' The panel agreed that extending value added tax to domestic fuel would continue to damage the Tories. Mr Challenger said: 'It is as bad a measure as the poll tax in many ways and as ill-judged. I think they will live to regret it.'

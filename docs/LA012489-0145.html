			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> PRINCE CHARLES TOURS DISASTER SITE  </P> <P> Prince Charles received a warm welcome today when he toured the small Scottish  town where a Pan American World Airlines jet crashed last month, killing 270  people.  </P> <P> Charles' visit followed widespread criticism that no member of the Royal Family  had attended a memorial service for victims of the bombing that blew the plane  out of the night sky Dec. 21. His brother Prince Andrew didn't help matters  when he visited the town after the crash and expressed sympathy for the  victims, "especially the Americans."  </P> <P> Charles appeared to win the hearts of the townspeople as he walked through the  streets of Lockerbie, visited their homes and even stopped in a pub for a shot  of whiskey.  </P></p>

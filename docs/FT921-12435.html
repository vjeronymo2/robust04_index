			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Crest Nicholson's Pounds 3.8m sale helps reduce gearing CREST Nicholson, the troubled Surrey-based housebuilding and commercial property development group has made further progress in reducing its gearing by the sale of two commercial properties for Pounds 3.8m. The two properties, retail developments at Angel Place in Neath and Baxtergate in Doncaster were sold for Pounds 1.28m and Pounds 2.5m respectively. The latest disposals continue the strategy put in place last year after the group recorded a near-Pounds 34m loss for the half-year, made provisions totalling Pounds 21m against falling property values and saw the departure of Mr Roger Lewis, its chief executive. Crest's plan to turn assets into cash has been implemented by Mr John Callcutt, who replaced Mr Lewis as chief executive. After disposals totalling almost Pounds 50m, Crest's net borrowing has fallen to around Pounds 50m, down from a peak level last year of Pounds 115m. Gearing is now down to around 45 per cent from a peak of over 80 per cent. Building analysts expect Crest to report losses of over Pounds 50m when the group unveils its preliminary results next month. These are expected to include more provisions against falling property values.</p>

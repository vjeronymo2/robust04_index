Television is an institution that has been totally  subsidized  by the Cuban state in both its national currency and its  convertible currency costs. It is now advisable to seek new ways  of pursuing its educational, cultural, and informational mission.    For some years television, through the INTER TV  organization,  has been working on a self-financing system, but it is still  quite far from meeting television's very expensive financial  needs.    The income that has to date been generated from the sale of  technical services and of some Cuban programs to foreign  agencies is still not sufficient to cover its short-term  requirements.    Starting in 1993 they began to look at other ways of  increasing services at competitive prices to major productions  of foreign organizations, including cinema, and they will begin  coproductions in which television will receive dividends based  on its participation.    One example of this is the production of a series set in  Cuba  and the Caribbean with a Spanish television company, in which  Cuban television will provide the talent and equipment without  payment having to be made in convertible currency.    Other possibilities are dubbing and subtitling. This is  available to date in up to seven languages. The potential of  film archives is also being explored. There is a great wealth of  images, and this product carries a high price per minute. The  marketing of sound archives of productions that are the property  of Cuban radio and television has also not been ruled out. These  activities also include the start of the production of  advertising, intended especially for foreign organizations.    This is taking place at a time when there are foreign  capital  investments in Cuba, and mixed public-private enterprises are  being formed with Cuban groups. The inevitable products, firms,  and commercial brands of a number of internationally known  companies are beginning to appear. Most of these companies have  good budgets for promotional costs, publicity, and public  relations.    One part of the media that could most benefit from this is  radio and television. How it should be done requires intelligent  handling.    Juan Hernandez, vice president of ICRT [Cuban Institute of  Radio and Television], told me some time ago that one of the  strong points of Cuban television is precisely that it is not  commercial or subject to the will of advertisers who in other  television stations decide on its fate. So including ads in ours  may seem contradictory. However, within the array of publicity  available, we will select ads that seek to enhance a company's  image, emphasizing its social orientation. In that way the  viewer receives a pleasant, nonconsumerist image that may often  become a message promoting behavior that will benefit families  and society.    This is done through sponsorship, in which an advertiser  helps to finance a broadcast in exchange for his participation  being mentioned.    Using this concept, and based on experience with sports  broadcasting (where internationally the presence of active  publicity has become inevitable), and given the high costs of  satellite transmission of sports events, Cuban television  decided to experiment with the Central American and Caribbean  Games and seek sponsors.    Foreign firms and associated Cuban groups responded to this  invitation and--apparently--everyone benefitted. This commercial  opportunity was especially advantageous for Cuban groups, most  of which have very limited budgets for presenting their image.    According to the president of Cubanacan S.A., Abraham  Maciques, it is necessary to boost the image of merchandise that  is not advertised and, therefore, not sold. For the corporation  he heads, investing about $8,000 in the television promotion in  Ponce may mean a great deal in the future, since all over the  world major tourist attractions invest 10 percent of their  profits in activities of this nature, while Cubanacan has only  spent 2 percent. Canada now spends about $400,000 on promotional  advertising to attract 110,000 tourists, and a much higher  amount needs to be spent to induce a German to choose Cuba as  his destination.    The experiment with the Central American Games in Ponce  proved successful economically, and the impact on the population  was examined in social surveys.    There were varied responses, ranging from "I was not  surprised," or "this is normal in sports arenas," to "it makes  the broadcast seem more dynamic," or "I do not like it, but I  will accept it if it is best for Cuba."    Certain that the practice is feasible with the philosophy we  have outlined, it would not be difficult to finance sports  broadcasts in the coming years, as long as good management is  exercised for the acquisition of rights and sponsors.    The daring move of attempting this experiment, apart from  the  financial return it produced for Cuban television, gave viewers  at home access to a spectacle in which the Cuban team won the  gold medal in games at which dignity and patriotism were on  display.</p>

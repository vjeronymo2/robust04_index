			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Bush presses Middle East leaders for more progress on peace PRESIDENT George Bush and Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, his acting secretary of state, will today complete a round of contacts with Middle East leaders aimed at accelerating the peace process when negotiations resume in Washington on September 14. The four Arab delegations yesterday agreed to an Israeli proposal for a 10-day recess so that the teams could return home for consultations. When the sixth round of talks opened on August 24 it had been intended they would continue without interruption for a month. Mr Bush has been in contact with King Hussein of Jordan, who is in the US recovering from surgery, while Mr Eagleburger is seeing the heads of delegations. All sides have been pleased by the improvement in the atmosphere at the talks following the election of a new government in Israel, but there has been little if any progress on issues of substance. There is concern among the Arab delegates at what they see as the lack of involvement by the US administration. Earlier this week the Palestinian delegation said its talks with Israel were at an impasse. Jordan complained that the Israelis had reneged on items that should appear on a joint agenda, while the Syrians said they had not yet seen an Israeli willingness to discuss 'land for peace'. Israeli spokesmen have generally been more enthusiastic, especially about the talks with Syria. Mr Yassir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, meanwhile has again shown his disregard for American public opinion, following his support for Iraq during the Gulf war. He has appeared at the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Jakarta hand-in-hand with Mr Taha Yassin Ramadan, one of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's closest colleagues. Jordan yesterday hailed a message from King Fahd, the Saudi Arabian ruler, to King Hussein as signalling a breakthrough in the countries' frosty post-Gulf war relations. Mr Mahmoud al-Sharif, Jordan's acting foreign minister, said the message had 'created an opening in the otherwise frigid relations in the two countries'.</p>

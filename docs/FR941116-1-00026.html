			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State has indicated, in the current State-EPA Agreement (SEA), that it will begin developing an ozone redesignation request and maintenance plan for the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area. The maintenance plan must demonstrate that the ozone NAAQS will be maintained for an initial period of 10 years after the redesignation request is approved by EPA. The maintenance plan must be updated, after 8 years into the initial 10-year period, to demonstrate that the NAAQS will be maintained for an additional 10 years. During the development of the maintenance plan, the State may consider additional revisions to the ozone control strategy in order to demonstrate maintenance of the ozone standard; such revisions could include further modification of the VOC control requirements of Reg 7. For a maintenance plan to be approved and the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area to be redesignated as attainment pursuant to Section 107(d)(3)(E), the State may have to develop specific RACT regulations for major non-CTG sources. Information available to EPA suggests that there has been growth in emissions from some non-CTG sources in the area; RACT regulations for these sources may be necessary to ensure maintenance of the NAAQS for the initial 10-year redesignation attainment period, as is required by Section 175A of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. 1990 SIP Revision Submittal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, the revised Reg 7 ( as submitted by the Governor on September 27, 1989) met the CAA requirements, which were interpreted in the CTGs, the Blue Book, and the Post-87 Policy. However, in its review, EPA identified two remaining issues where the regulation did not explicitly follow EPA guidance: A. The compliance schedule, and B. Clarification of the Graphic Arts definition for potential to emit. These remaining two issues were addressed by the State in its August 30, 1990 submittal and are described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a letter dated August 30, 1990, the Governor of Colorado submitted revisions to Reg 7 to address EPA's remaining concerns with the September 27, 1989 Ozone SIP revision. A detailed description of the additional specific revisions to Reg 7 is contained in the Docket for this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document. Revisions were made to the following sections of Reg 7: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 7.I&blank;Applicability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.XI&blank;Use of Cutback Asphalt <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.XIII&blank;Graphic Arts <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A. Compliance Schedule: Reg 7 did not contain an explicit deadline for compliance with the revised regulation. In response to EPA comments, the State adopted additional revisions (Section 7.I.B. and 7.I.C.) to Section 7.I. (Applicability) of Reg 7, requiring all sources to come into compliance with the revised Reg 7 by October 31, 1991. EPA considered a 2-year timeframe for compliance with the Reg 7 revisions to be acceptable because no ozone SIP Call was made in 1988 (no violations of the ozone NAAQS have been monitored in the Denver-Boulder area since 1984) and thus, the revisions were not immediately necessary for the area to attain the NAAQS. The 2-year compliance timeframe applies only to the regulation revisions, and not to requirements which existed prior to October 30, 1989. Sources which were in existence prior to the regulation revisions and which were covered by the regulations at that time were required to maintain compliance with those provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Graphic Arts definition: The Graphic Arts definition of potential to emit, contained in Section 7.XIII.A.2. of Reg 7, was somewhat unclear. The definition referenced the EPA requirement that potential to emit be determined at maximum capacity before control (per the Appendix D Clarification document), but also included a requirement that potential emissions be based on historical records of solvent and ink consumption (per the previous regulatory guidance document, Guidance to State and Local Agencies in Preparing Regulations to Control Volatile Organic Compounds from Ten Stationary Source Categories, September, 1979). As a result, the definition could have been interpreted to require potential to emit to be calculated at both maximum and historical operating rates, which in most cases will be different. EPA's interpretation of this definition was that potential to emit should be calculated at maximum capacity before control; historical records of solvent and ink consumption should be used to determine VOC emissions at a given operating rate, not to determine the historical maximum operating rate. The Reg 7 revisions, submitted by the Governor on August 30, 1990, addressed this concern by not including a reference to the historical records. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Capture Efficiency: As a final issue, on January 13, 1992, EPA notified the State that, prior to proposing this action, it was necessary to document the State's position with regard to capture efficiency (CE) determination. During earlier reviews of the State's VOC regulations, EPA Region VIII indicated that, because EPA had not issued final, generally-applicable CE test methods, an acceptable State approach to CE was a commitment to develop test methods consistent with the most recent EPA guidance on CE testing on a case-by-case basis as needed, and a commitment to adopt test methods after EPA issued final CE test methods. The CE provision adopted by the State in Section IX.A.5.e of Reg 7 does address the requirement that testing for CE be performed on a case-by-case basis, and that this testing be consistent with EPA guidance. In a letter dated February 5, 1992, from John Leary, Acting Director, Colorado Air Pollution Control Division, to Douglas Skie, Chief, Air Programs Branch, EPA Region VIII, the State committed to adopt and use all new CE methods as they are developed and promulgated by EPA's rule-making process. In that same letter, the State indicated that until changes are promulgated, the Air Pollution Control Division will use the CE protocols that were published by EPA on June 29, 1990 (55 FR 26814, codified at 40 CFR 52.741(a)(4)(iii) and Appendix B). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

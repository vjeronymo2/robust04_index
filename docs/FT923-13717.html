			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Books: Powers of the press - Thrillers THE PELICAN BRIEF by John Grisham Century Pounds 14.99, 371 pages SAYONARA by Elliot Marshall Chapmans Pounds 8.99, 376 pages THE CHINAMAN by Stephen Leather Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 14.99, 312 pages TWO US Supreme Court judges are killed on the same evening. No one can link the murders, but the President quickly begins choosing successors who will ensure that the court has a conservative majority for a generation. In New Orleans, Derby Shaw, a young law student is intrigued. She investigates and writes a brief which names an unlikely suspect. Her professor and lover passes the brief to a friend in the FBI. Within days, her lover is dead and she is running for her life. From that beginning, John Grisham weaves a heady tale of deceit, treachery and multiple killing which successfully describes the manipulative rivalries and enmities inside the US political and legal systems. If that sounds grim, Grisham has no doubts as to the whereabouts of democracy's principal safety mechanism. The closing chapters of the book make skilful use of newspaper deadlines to maintain a comfortable degree of suspense. Once Derby Shaw's story is printed, readers can be sure that the cover-ups and conspiracies are doomed. God Bless America and the Washington Post. The Pelican Brief is not as original as Grisham's first novel, The Firm, but that may be because in ranging beyond the legal profession it calls on a cliche too far. But it is better than the average thriller. And it is much better than Sayonara, Elliot Marshall's depressing vision of a United States threatened with economic thralldom by a Japan bent on revenge and humiliation. Whereas Grisham seeks out and finds redemption within the US system, Marshall wants only villains to blame for the post-war loss of economic and social leadership. Who better than inscrutable outsiders? Marshall's description of the Japanese is stereotyped and thoroughly nasty, just as the women in the book, even the supposedly modern and independent types, are narrow simulacra. He paints a relentlessly unappealing picture in which the materialist decadence of the US is not obviously better than the backward-looking morality of Japan. Unfortunately, as Michael Crichton's Rising Sun has already shown, this sort of dangerous xenophobia sells. It is a relief to turn to The Chinaman, who is actually a monosyllabic Vietnamese refugee. This inscrutable outsider wages a dignified one-man war on the IRA to avenge his daughter's death in a bomb blast. When he starts practising his old skills as a jungle terrorist on a Sinn Fein leader, the tables are neatly turned. Enjoyable tosh.</p>

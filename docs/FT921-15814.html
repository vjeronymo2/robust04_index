			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: LSI Logic pulls out of US semiconductor consortium SEMATECH, the US semiconductor consortium set up some five years ago to develop world-beating chip manufacturing technology and stem Japanese competition, has lost one of its founding member-companies. LSI Logic has withdrawn from the consortium, marking the first defection from the industry group since Sematech was formed. LSI's executives said they disagreed with the direction that Sematech had taken and disapproved of Sematech's increased emphasis on supporting US semiconductor production equipment manufacturers. Two more of Sematech's original 14 member-companies are believed to be considering pulling out. However, Sematech's future is not in doubt. The consortium has strong support from its leading members, including International Business Machines, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Motorola and Texas Instruments. LSI Logic's departure 'leaves a dent, but not a serious one,' said Mr William Spencer, Sematech chief executive. Its departure comes as the industry group is asking for extended government funding for the next five years. Sematech receives half of its annual Dollars 200m budget from the US Department of Defence and the remainder from member-companies. Sematech officials remain confident of continued government support, noting that the group has strong congressional backing for its efforts to increase the international competitiveness of the US semiconductor industry. However, LSI Logic's withdrawal from Sematech demonstrates the difficulties of collaboration among competing US chip-makers. 'Sematech has significantly shifted its direction since the consortium was formed,' said Mr George Wells, LSI Logic president and chief operating officer. The group's current programme is 'not what we signed up for', he complained. 'Shoring up the US semiconductor production equipment industry may well be a good idea but it is not where we wanted to see Sematech put its funds.' LSI, the leading manufacturer of application-specific integrated circuits chips that are tailored to meet the needs of individual customers, said the technology requirements of its specialised products have diverged significantly from those of mass production commodity chips over the past few years.</p>

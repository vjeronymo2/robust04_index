			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL EDUCATION'S CHIEF TOP O.C. EARNER  </P> <P> Jerome Cwiertnia earned a nifty $1.8 million in 1988 as president of National  Education Corp., the nation's largest operator of vocational training schools.  </P> <P> But Cwiertnia is living proof that money -- even lots of it -- doesn't always  buy happiness in the executive suite. He quit his job with the Irvine firm last  March to look for a position that would give him "more managerial  responsibility."  </P> <P> Cwiertnia's pay of $1.8 million made him the highest-paid manager among Orange  County-based, publicly held corporations, according to The Times annual survey  of executive compensation. Counting salary and stock options, Cwiertnia earned  $360,000 more than his boss, H. David Bright, National Education's chairman.  Bright was the county's second highest-paid executive, making nearly $1.5  million last year.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the pair of National Education executives earned far less than  1987's top-earning corporate chiefs. James Conte, president of Community  Psychiatric Centers in Laguna Hills, earned a whopping $8.5 million in 1987 --  with $7.6 million of that total coming from stock options. His boss, Community  Psychiatric Chairman Robert L. Green, earned $6.8 million in 1987, including  $6.3 million in stock options.  </P> <P> Conte and Green do not appear on the 1988 list. The company declined to supply  information on executive pay for the latest survey because it had not yet been  disclosed in the company's proxy.  </P> <P> The survey of about 2 dozen of Orange County's largest publicly traded  companies, conducted by Mercer Meidinger Hansen for The Times, showed that pay  for the county's top 10 executives averaged $998,000 in 1988, down from $2.4  million in 1987. The large difference primarily reflects a big decline in  profits taken by executives exercising stock options.  </P> <P> The Top 25 list was dominated by the county's largest companies: National  Education and home builder J.M. Peters each claimed four of the top-paid  executives; Bergen Brunswig, a pharmaceutical distributor, placed three  executives on the list, and five companies claimed two each.  </P> <P> No female executives made the Top 25 list.  </P> <P> Despite Orange County's reputation as a high-technology center, Western Digital  Chairman Roger W. Johnson was the only high-tech executive to place in the top  25.  </P> <P> Johnson earned $565,578 in 1988, placing 12th on the list. But Western  Digital's proxy also listed nearly $1.8 million in stock options. In Johnson's  case, the stock-option earnings are not included in the compensation totals  because it was believed that the options were paid out over a 3-year period  ending in September, 1988. Western Digital would not say when the payments were  made.  </P> <P> Many top managers enjoyed big gains in 1987 by selling those options before the  October, 1987, stock market crash. Stock prices were depressed throughout much  of 1988, reducing the incentive for executives to trade their options for cash.  </P> <P> While 1988 was not a big year for stock profits, National Education's Cwiertnia  gained the top spot by exercising stock options worth $1.1 million.  </P> <P> Stock options are a commonly used method of motivating and rewarding corporate  executives. Typically, a stock-option program gives an employee the right to  periodically purchase the company's shares at a fixed price -- at or below the  market price -- for a certain number of years.  </P> <P> If the stock's market price rises above the option price, the option may be  exercised. The executive's profit is the difference between the option price  and the market price.  </P> <P> Compensation specialists say that stock options, while used widely at  corporations nationwide, are becoming less attractive as a form of executive  compensation for the smaller, fast-growing companies that are common in Orange  County.  </P> <P> "If an emerging company goes public and has widely dispersed stock options,  then the higher the stock goes the more the company pays out in compensation,"  said David Thomsen, managing director of the Economic Research Institute in  Newport Beach. "In some extreme cases, the stock price has gone so high that it  has wiped out a firm's earnings per share."  </P> <P> Thomsen said some Orange County companies are turning to  alternative-compensation programs such as deferred or supplemental-compensation  plans, which involve tax-free, interest-bearing accounts that the company  typically contributes to. These programs are less risky than stock options,  which often depend entirely on a company's stock performance.  </P> <P> At companies where executives' pay was tied to the firm's performance,  individuals reaped handsome rewards as profits soared.  </P> <P> J.M. Peters Co., a Newport Beach home builder, enjoyed a strong 1988 thanks to  the soaring county housing market.  </P> <P> Company Chairman James M. Peters likes to reward people "not only by salary,  but also with an incentive to perform," said Brian Teriot, a company spokesman.  He said executives' salaries are often tied to the company's earnings or the  number of house closings.  </P> <P> Several J.M. Peters executives made out handsomely in 1988.  </P> <P> Those executives included: J. Karl Kruetzer, president of the company's San  Diego division, $531,804; Frank E. Fullerton, vice president, $512,550; Robert  J. Trapp, vice president, $509,089, and Richard D. Bradshaw, vice president,  $479,897.  </P> <P> The two co-founders of Newport Beach-based Downey Savings &amp; Loan Assn. were  generously rewarded. Company President Maurice L. McAlister made more than $1.1  million in 1988, while Chief Executive Officer Gerald H. McQuarrie earned  $820,947.  </P> <P> Downey, one of the county's most profitable thrifts, had earnings of $29  million on revenue of $330.8 million in 1988.  </P> <P> McAlister and McQuarrie, neither of whom made 1987's list of highest-paid  executives, made the 1988 list because of large bonuses. McAlister received a  $750,000 bonus, McQuarrie a $500,000 bonus.  </P> <P> "The board voted to give us the bonuses because we had excellent earnings for  several years," McQuarrie said. "The two of us started the company (in 1957)  and took no salaries for the first 3 or 4 years, and then took only $800 a  month for about 10 years.  </P> <P> "This was our first bonus in 30 years," he added. "And I'm not going to give it  back to them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY'S HIGHEST-PAID EXECUTIVES  </P> <P> Executives at publicly held Orange County companies ranked by total  compensation reported for the most recent fiscal year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> O.C.

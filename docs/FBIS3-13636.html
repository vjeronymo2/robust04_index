			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with "Mr. Jalil," the secretary of the Democratic </F> Party of Kordestan in Iran, by Mustafa 'Abdallah in Vienna; date  not given]    [Text] ['Abdallah] I met him during a tour he was making  of a number of European countries that took him to Britain,  France, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and finally  Austria, to explain the cause of the Iranian Kurdish people and  inform the public about the aspects of their revolution. At the  start of his interview he stated that their main goal is to  overthrow the regime in Iran and establish a democratic regime  in which human rights and the rights of national minorities will  be respected. He added that the Democratic Party of Kordestan  [DPK] represents 90 percent of the Kurdish people living in Iran.    What is the DPK's relationship with the Mujahedin-e Khalq in  Iran?    [Jalil] By virtue of our common struggle against the present  Iranian regime, we have strong ties with the forces that oppose  this regime, including the Mujahedin-e Khalq movement, of  course. Political cooperation is continuing. But regrettably  there is no coordination in the field due to geographical  conditions. But we are in the process of initiating such  coordination.    ['Abdallah] You said that you are working to overthrow the  regime in Iran. Is there a specific plan for this?    [Jalil] After having failed in the past 15 years to convince  the Iranian regime to grant our people their national rights, we  were forced to undertake military operations. We have dealt  painful blows to the regime in many places, weakening their  forces in these areas. By virtue of our indomitable struggle,  we have turned Kordestan into an impregnable fortress for the  Kurds.    Although there have been many victims, amounting to 60,000  civilians and about 6,000 military men, our morale and the  morale of our Kurdish people is high. Our struggle has  strengthened the struggle fronts in many areas in Iran.    ['Abdallah] When do you expect your plan to overthrow the  regime in Iran to succeed?    [Jalil] The Iranian regime is now closer to falling and is  very weak. According to our study of the situation, the main  problem lies in the absence of an organization that unites all  the opposition forces to speed up the overthrow of the regime.  But we are currently trying hard to establish a joint Kurdish  organization and an Iranian organization of all the opposition  forces to achieve our goal of weakening and overthrowing the  present regime.    ['Abdallah] Mr. Jalil, do you have any information about  Iran's support for terrorism?    [Jalil] It is known that the present Iranian regime is a  terrorist regime in all respects. It resorts to terrorist means  to achieve its objectives. Among these means are physical  liquidation of the opposition forces and leaders. This is in  addition to exporting terrorism. We have so far noted more than  100 terrorist operations by the regime at home over a short  period of time. In the past month alone, the regime carried out  three terrorist operations against members of the Kurdish  leadership, killing two of them in Kordestan and Iraq and the  third in Turkey.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Max Hastings Max Hastings, editor-in-chief of The Telegraph Group, would be happy to swap his Isle of Dogs office for a desert island. A country lover at heart, working in London is the bane of his life. Who would you take with you? Jeremy Deedes, Bill Deedes' son who is editorial director. Jeremy is my nanny and I rely on him not to do anything foolish. I can't think of anything he would like less than to be stuck on a desert island with me, but about three times a day I run into Jeremy's office saying 'crisis, Baldrick, crisis'. An additional office item, along with a phone and fax? I'd be lost without a word processor. When I was a teenager and bored in the summer holidays my father would often talk of the challenge of a blank piece of paper. I didn't understand what he meant then, but I do now. But like most modern journalists I can't do it with a pen and paper any more. Would management from an island work? I would use the fax a lot. The editor I worked for longest and I most respected was Charles Wintour on the Evening Standard. Charles was a great one for rule by abrupt memo and in some ways I mimic his memo style - both the nice ones and the nasty ones. Confined to an island, what would you miss? The stimulus of seeing an enormous number of people. At weekends when I don't see people one complains of the phone always ringing, but then one thinks what would it be like if the phone didn't ring. What wouldn't you miss? London. One of the highest prices one pays for doing a job like this is having to work in an office in London. Canary Wharf certainly has nothing to do with civilisation as far as I understand it. What would you take to read? At the very least I'd ask to take the complete Trollope. Something to drink? A few cases of wine. For the first six months that I was editor of The Daily Telegraph I never drank at lunchtime. These days I'd rather suffer the consequences of having a drink then. When I go to lunch and see everyone having Perrier I don't feel jealous. I think it has become a reverse virility symbol. And to eat? I'm an unashamed carnivore. I'd like the fishing that I could do on the island but I'd be sorry if I couldn't have meat anymore. Would you survive on an island? Living rough never bothered me. I spent 15 years roaming around the world's wildernesses as foreign correspondent and was fine. I would also do some preparation. My father was cast away on a desert island by a Sunday newspaper and became ill with scurvy and nearly died. He hadn't done proper research. You can take just one newspaper The Daily Mail. It is very entertaining and professionally run. I'd also want the Spectator and Country Life to see what is happening to house prices.</p>

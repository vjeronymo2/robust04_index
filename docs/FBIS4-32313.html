			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Adnana Hadziahmetovic on address by </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic to the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly in Sarajevo on 22 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Hadziahmetovic] In the first part of today's  session, the deputies of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly adopted  the report on the work of the state delegation at the Geneva  negotiations, [words indistinct] with the contact group, and the  [words indistinct] on the military agreement.    The state delegation at the Geneva negotiations [words  indistinct], Prime Minister Silajdzic said, submitting the  report on the talks with the international contact group. The  delegation approached the talks with the demand that the  principle of the preservation of the sovereignty of  Bosnia-Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders  be respected, and that the occupied territories with the  majority Bosniak and Croatian population be returned [words  indistinct], the necessity of respecting the principles of the  London conference, and the UN Security Council resolutions,  Prime Minister Silajdzic said, adding:    [Silajdzic] When it comes to concrete, territorial  solutions, the state delegation presented the contact group with  a map of the federation as determined by the Vienna agreement,  at which the territories with the majority Bosniak and Croatian  population are defined, amounting to 58 percent of the territory  of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The contact group was  presented with information and other convincing documentation on  the justifiability of the solutions that we are committed to.    Four, as for the issue of the so-called corridor, the state  delegation presented a unified view that corridors are  unnecessary as a lasting solution, since the territory with the  Bosniak and Croatian majority and the territory with the Serb  majority are a constituent part of the state of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in which freedom of movement of people and  goods must be provided and guaranteed in all the regions.  Therefore, (corridors) are redundant. We presented the view  that, if the issue of the corridors is to be discussed, then it  must include a link between the central part of the federation  and the Bihac canton. All the corridors must have an equal  status regardless of for whom they are established and through  whose territories they pass.    Five, I particularly want to stress that the state  delegation  was very persistent and resolute in its view that the contact  group could not attempt to open seriously the process of  negotiations if, at the same time, the issue of measures to be  undertaken in case of obstructions to the peace process is not  solved. We asked openly and on several occasions: If the  negotiations are obstructed, will the international community  carry out air attacks and other military measures? Will it lift  the arms embargo? Will it establish an effective control over  the [Bosnia-Herzegovina] state border with Serbia and  Montenegro? Will it tighten the economic embargo against the  so-called Yugoslavia, and will it impose other sanctions against  the side that is responsible for the failure of the peace  conference, the peace initiative? We were told that our demands  and proposals would be considered, and that we would soon hear  the views of the contact group concerning these matters.    [Hadziahmetovic] We have made it clear, Prime Minister  Silajdzic continued, that we cannot consider as serious any  proposal by the contact group unless it contains clearly defined  intentions and guarantees concerning the implementation of the  peace agreement. The state delegation reiterated the proposal  for the Bosnian Serbs to join the federation under equal  conditions, Prime Minister Silajdzic said, adding:    [Silajdzic] In case such a proposal is again rejected, we  presented the basic principles on which the internal  organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina would be based. The proposal  is based on the inviolability of the international subjectivity  and the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We would  accept the internal transformation into a complex state, in  which one part would be the federation and the other would be  with the Serb majority that would have a high degree of autonomy  and a permanently open possibility to join the federation. The  central bodies of that state would be organized in a way that  would express the constituent position of each [word indistinct].</p>

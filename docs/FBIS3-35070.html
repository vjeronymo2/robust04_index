			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Fatah Central Committee member Zakariyya </F> al-Agha by Rashid Khashanah in Tunis; date not given]    [Text] [Khashanah] How can we describe Fatah's position  in the Gaza Strip, and what is the status of its relations with  the other forces rejecting the Declaration of Principles  agreement?    [Al-Agha] The position is good, although there are some  minor problems. And our relations as a movement with the other  forces are good. And we are doing our utmost to secure a  minimum of coordination. And dialogues are continuing among us  with a view to easing any tension that may emerge, especially in  field positions.    I can say that relations with the national forces inside the  Strip are satisfactory so far. But the main problem is the hot  security situation. The reason is the spread of weapons inside  the strip with the encouragement of the Israeli authorities and  under their eyes. This situation in turn creates numerous  security problems and excesses against citizens.    [Khashanah] How can this situation be brought under control?    [Al-Agha] We are trying together with the other national  forces to bring the security problem under control and to  confront all the excesses taking place. However, the  comprehensive solution to this situation will take place after  the establishment of a Palestinian national authority that can  bring an end to these regrettable aspects and guarantee the  Palestinian citizens' security and safety.    [Khashanah] Social and economic conditions in the Gaza Strip  are worse than in the West Bank. What is the effect of that on  the political situation?    [Al-Agha] There are problems resulting from the bad economic  situation, especially the spread of unemployment in the strip.  Many Palestinian establishments are suffering severe financial  straits, and their workers have not received their wages for  several months. In addition, families of the martyrs and  detainees have not received the allowances decided for them.  This situation is attributable to the scarcity of the PLO's  financial resources and the systematic Israeli economic policy  against Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories.    Furthermore, the delay in implementing the Declaration of  Principles agreement between the PLO and Israel in addition to  the obstacles created by the Israeli side during the  negotiations to obstruct progress are all factors which have  created a state of frustration and impatience among citizens --  which has led to psychological worry and tension and maybe some  regrettable actions from time to time.    [Khashanah] What are the potential effects of the  agreement's implementation on the situation in the strip in the  light of the meeting with President 'Arafat?    [Al-Agha] We discussed political and organizational matters  whose positive results I hope will emerge in the stage ahead.  And I hope that the national authority will begin to play its  role inside the occupied territories so that a new era in the  Palestinian people's history will begin -- an era when the  occupation will disappear.</p>

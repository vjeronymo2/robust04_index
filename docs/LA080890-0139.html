			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRAZIER, LLOYD, KRONEMANN EARN TENNIS HONORS  </P> <P> Former UC Irvine All-American Trevor Kronemann has been named Team Tennis' male  most valuable player and male rookie of the year, the league announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Newport Beach Dukes' Amy Frazier, who finished as the third-ranked women's  singles player, was named female rookie of the year.  </P> <P> John Lloyd, the Los Angeles Strings' player-coach, was named the coach of the  year after leading the Strings to a 12-2 regular-season record, the best in the  league. Robin White of the Strings was named the female most valuable player.  </P> <P> Kronemann, who plays for the Charlotte Heat, edged another rookie, San  Antonio's Sammy Giammalva, for the awards, which are based on winning  percentage during the league's one-month regular season.  </P> <P> Kronemann was an All-American in each of the four years he played tennis for UC  Irvine and Coach Greg Patton, who is also the Dukes' coach. Kronemann was a  late replacement for the Heat. Because he was still playing collegiate tennis  when Team Tennis held its draft, Kronemann wasn't eligible to be selected. But  when Mark Dickson was injured, Charlotte picked up Kronemann, who helped the  Heat qualify for the Team Tennis playoffs.  </P> <P> Newport Beach finished fourth in the four-team West Division and missed the  playoffs in its inaugural season. The Dukes finished the season 7-7, losing  their final three matches.  </P></p>

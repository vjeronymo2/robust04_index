			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 29 Jun (MENA) -- Nine Yemeni leaders called  today for an immediate cease-fire in Yemen and a quick return to  negotiations in order to allow all efforts to bear fruit, stop  the shedding of the Yemeni people's blood, protect Yemen's unity  and territorial integrity, and halt the bleeding of human  resources.    In a faxed statement received by MENA's main office, the  nine  leaders called on the two sides to resort to reason so as to end  the suffering of the Yemenis, to stop the destruction of the  homeland's resources and capabilities, and to allow peace to  prevail all over Yemen's territories and thus thwart all the  attempts to deepen the tragedy.    The nine leaders are: Ahmad Muhammad Nu'man, Jarallah 'Umar,  'Ali Nasir Muhammad, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Ruba'i, Sinan  Abu- Lahm, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus [word indistinct], Mujahid  [word indistinct], Muhammad 'Abd-al-Malik al-Mutawakkil, and  Ahmad 'Ali al-Salami.</p>

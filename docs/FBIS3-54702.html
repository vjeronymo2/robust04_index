			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean Foglizzo, head of the IMF permanent </F> mission in Russia, by unidentified ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  correspondent; place and date not given: "The IMF Does Not Have  any `Magic Figures'"]    [Excerpts] The IMF is not setting our country any  conditions, it is merely demanding firm guarantees that the  credits granted will be repaid. [passage omitted]    [Foglizzo] We help those countries which are experiencing  difficulties in the sphere of foreign payments. On condition,  of course, that their policy does not harm other states. Our  job is to use money to the maximum advantage and enable a  country to implement economic reforms on the one hand while, on  the other hand, ensuring the repayment of the debt so that our  depositors do not suffer a loss and have an opportunity to  promptly invest their repaid resources in the economies of  countries that need investment. This is the IMF's philosophy,  these are the functions assigned to it by the world community.    We are adopting the same approach toward Russia. We need  firm guarantees that the reforms here will continue to develop.  The government's program designed to run through the end of  1994 is now being implemented. It has been approved by the  Council of Ministers Presidium and the prime minister. But how  can we rely on that program when a detailed budget for next year  has still not been prepared even now, at the end of December?  In this case it is not a question of a tough stance by the IMF  toward Russia but a desire to build our partnership on firmer  foundations.    [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] What credits has Russia already received  from the IMF?    [Foglizzo] An accord was signed 5 August 1992, granting  Russia a so-called reserve credit of $1 billion. This is the  main form of credit which the IMF issues to its members for the  support of economic programs. It was received in full by your  country by December 1992. During this year Russia has received  a further $1.5 billion from the IMF. This is aid within the  framework of the recently created program of finance for  systemic transformations. It envisages the granting of credits  to those countries which are switching to a market economy. The  maximum credit of this type is $3 billion. When the IMF granted  Russia the first 1.5 billion, we expected that it would receive  the remaining 1.5 billion by October or November -- but that  did not happen. In August the government was unable to adhere  to the course of reforms agreed with and supported by us. There  were many reasons for that. The main reason was the conflict  between the president and the parliament which led to a  destabilization of the situation.    [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Now this main reason has been removed.  Does this mean that our country will soon receive the second  part of the systemic credit?    [Foglizzo] That depends on the subsequent development of  events. A program of urgent measures was elaborated this fall,  designed to achieve financial stabilization. We approve it  although perhaps not all of its details. Now the problem is to  convince the other branches of power and the Russian people that  there can be no solution to the crisis without such measures.    As I have already said, this year the government was unable  to fully maintain the course of financial stabilization. Now  the time has come to think about an action program for next  year. I do not know what kind of program it will be. The IMF  has no "magic figures" -- no universal budget deficit or  inflation rate ceilings. The main point is that there must be a  firm and unwavering desire for reforms, stabilization of the  economy, and radical reduction of the rate of inflation.  [passage omitted]    [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Is the IMF currently holding talks  with the Russian Government on further cooperation?    [Foglizzo] An IMF mission visited Moscow in the first half  of December. Our specialists would like to come here again as  soon as possible. But I do not think that there will be any  serious negotiations until the question of the new parliament is  finally resolved and the composition of the Russian Government  is confirmed. We can hardly construct real plans for next year  before 15 January.    U.S. President Clinton is due to arrive in Moscow soon. He  will have talks with President Yeltsin. IMF Executive Director  M. Camdessus has also been invited to Moscow. The IMF's  subsequent activity in your country will depend on the results  of this top-level meeting.    [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Clearly, work in Russia has brought the  IMF more problems than it anticipated?    [Foglizzo] No, we are cooperating quite well with Russia.  Of course this does not mean that all our efforts have been  successful. But during this year we have come to understand the  country better and have learned how various traditional  mechanisms influence the economy. In your government we have  found people who really understand the situation, who know what  must be done, and who know how to explain the decisions that are  made in a way that is accessible to the population. First and  foremost this applies to Vice Premier and Finance Minister Boris  Fedorov.    I think that Russia has changed enormously in the past year.  Even the actual standard of the debates on economic questions is  far higher now than it used to be. The privatization process is  making quite successful and rapid progress. We are glad that  the currency market has operated without interruption and that  the rate of the ruble there has stabilized in the past six  months. Markets in vouchers and other securities have been  formed. This is an important factor for stabilization.    The structural reorganization of industry has begun. This,  after all, is the key to a successful economic reform.  Production is beginning to respond more flexibly to changes in  the situation in the market.    New relations are developing between the government and the  Central Bank. In May-June the IMF supported the agreement  between them. Without that accord we could not have allocated  the first $1.5 billion systemic credit to Russia. Our experts  working at the Central Bank believe that in recent months  relations between it and the government have improved somewhat.  The Central Bank nevertheless does want to adapt, albeit  cautiously at the moment, to the new market conditions. For  example, the interest rate is currently 210 percent a year or  17.5 percent a month whereas inflation in September-November was  15 to 17 percent. This means that a positive interest rate has  appeared in Russia for the first time.    There are also some alarming tendencies. For example, the  raising of customs import duties. It is our hope that this is  the exception rather than the beginning of a lengthy process.  On the whole I believe that this year's balance has been  positive -- inflation has fallen and the slump in production is  slowing down even if it has not actually stopped. Thus there  are grounds for optimism. [passage omitted]</p>

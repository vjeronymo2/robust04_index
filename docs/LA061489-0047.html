			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIGNS OF FERVOR NEARLY ERASED FROM BEIJING  </P> <P> Most signs that there once was boiling political fervor on the streets of  Beijing have been all but erased. The city is like an air-brushed photograph in  which key images have been eliminated. One begins to wonder if they ever  existed.  </P> <P> No one appears to dare to put up posters denouncing the June 4 military assault  on Tian An Men Square and its peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators. Once,  hastily posted messages and photocopied photos competed for attention with the  government's martial-law orders. Now the denunciations have disappeared. So  have any pro-democracy posters.  </P> <P> All the burnt-out armored cars and buses have been removed from streets and  intersections where they were left by outraged Beijing citizens retaliating  against the army's crackdown. Thoroughfares have been swept by legions of  soldiers and municipal workers.  </P> <P> The government boasts that this city of 10 million is back to normal and in a  way it is: normal for the early 1980s, or perhaps before 1979, when the last  prolonged drive for democracy blossomed and then withered in Beijing and other  cities.  </P> <P> In a 10-day period, once-vibrant, open discussion has receded from the lips of  many Beijing residents, replaced by evasion and suspicion. The atmosphere has  reverted to those earlier, gloomier times.  </P> <P> Before June 4, political questions stimulated uncommonly passionate speeches  about government corruption, ineffectiveness and the need for democracy. Now,  the favored response is, "It's not clear."  </P> <P> One longtime Western resident of the city driving past the Beijing Hotel spied  a long, red banner with the words, "Long Live the Great, Glorious and Correct  Communist Party."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slogans Like Museum Pieces  </P> <P> "These are like pieces out of a museum. I don't think anyone thought these  kinds of things would come back," he said of the banners.  </P> <P> A veil is being pulled across the events that rocked the city. To seek accounts  of the civilian dead or missing is to run into virtual silence.  </P> <P> On Tuesday at Babaoshan, the city's main cemetery and crematory, reporters  sought information on the numbers of victims whose bodies might have been  brought there after the massacre.  </P> <P> A civilian standing guard at the gate of the cemetery's crematory grounds said  there was no registry of arrivals. Told that a caretaker at the front entrance  had assured visitors that such a registry was available, the guard said that  foreigners could have access to only the registry of foreign deaths and that in  any case, one would need government approval to get a look at that or anything  else.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shrine to Dead Soldier  </P> <P> While virtually no trace of the civilian dead from the army invasion of the  city can be found, the site of a place where a soldier was killed became an  official shrine Tuesday.  </P> <P> At a pedestrian overpass at Chongwenmen, near the train station,  government-affiliated groups, including the Beijing Women's Federation, marched  to hang wreaths from the bridge where the soldier was burned and hanged by a  mob.  </P> <P> Schoolchildren waved paper flowers while adults bowed three times before the  spot where the soldier had died. State television recorded the scene for  broadcast throughout the day.  </P> <P> Before the crackdown on pro-democracy students and their supporters, and for a  day or two after, political talk on the street was angry, defiant and  unrestrained. Now, there is fear of talking out of doors or in groups.  </P> <P> Still, Beijing residents occasionally find ways to overcome their fears. Mobile  conversations sometimes take place in a crowd of cyclists when one rider pulls  up alongside another and begins to talk, without ever looking to the side.  </P> <P> The conversation sometimes turns to desperate concerns.  </P> <P> "Is it hard to get a visa to the United States?" asked one such mobile talker.  "There is no hope for China."  </P> <P> At a snack shop, a request to light a cigarette might be a pretext to exchange  a few words, at least until someone else enters the room.  </P> <P> No one has to tell the Chinese directly not to talk. There are plenty of  indirect ways to break up talk about the events of Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plainclothesmen Interrupt  </P> <P> Increasingly, conversations on the street are interrupted out of the blue by  someone in plainclothes who butts in and makes an insulting remark.  </P> <P> "This is an internal matter. This is not a foreigner's business," interjected  one such stranger during a conversation near the Beijing Hotel on Changan  Avenue.  </P> <P> The small crowd that had gathered to listen to a discussion of a shooting that  occurred last week slowly broke up, with everyone going in different  directions.  </P> <P> Reporters visiting Beijing University the other day found that their parked car  had, in their absence, been surrounded by a group of plainclothesmen of  ambiguous intent.  </P> <P> As the driver and passenger entered the car, they were jostled briefly by the  men, who then kicked the side of one door as the foreigners left.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protesters Now Phantoms  </P> <P> On the campuses of universities, it is almost as if the students who protested  -- and the ones who died -- were phantoms.  </P> <P> Last Friday, the mother of one dead student, Xiao Zhi, went to the People's  University campus to collect her son's books and belongings, his dormitory  mates said.  </P> <P> The students told a reporter that Xiao, 20, who had been a hunger-striker at  Tian An Men Square, had escaped the crackdown of June 4. But he returned to the  vicinity of the square the next day after buying a train ticket for his home in  Sichuan province.  </P> <P> During an army thrust down Nanchizi street near the Forbidden City, Xiao "froze  for a moment, turned to look at the solders and was shot in the chest," one of  the students said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cremated at Cemetery  </P> <P> Xiao was a communications student at the university who had hoped to become a  television news announcer. He was cremated earlier this week at Babaoshan  Cemetery, the students said.  </P> <P> The cramped room that he shared with seven other students contained the usual  clutter of Chinese university students: books, electric fans, laundry strung  from bed to bed.  </P> <P> With Xiao's things now removed, one of his roommates had placed some cartons on  his now bare bed; amid the mess hardly anyone could tell that someone else had  once occupied that space.  </P></p>

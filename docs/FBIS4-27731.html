			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from 3 June PASASON: "Wholeheartedly Welcome the </F> Premier of the DPRK Administrative Council"]    [Text] At the invitation of Comrade Khamtai Siphandon,  prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Comrade  Kang Song-san, premier of the DPRK Administrative Council, will  lead a delegation to pay an official friendship visit to the Lao  People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] on 3 June.    Reacting to this event of great significance in the  relations  of profound friendship and close cooperation between Laos and  Korea, the entire Lao people and Vientiane residents are  extremely pleased to have the great honor and an opportunity to  welcome Comrade Kang Song-san and his entourage right on Lao  soil. They will bring the goodwill, friendship, and intimate  brotherly affection from the fraternal Korean people to our Lao  people.    The official friendship visit to our country by the premier  of the DPRK Administrative Council and his delegation takes  place after several delegations of Laos and Korea have exchanged  visits with one another, especially the official friendship  visit to the DPRK in December 1993 by our high-level party-state  delegation headed by Comrade Khamtai Siphandon, which ended in  glorious success. The visit by the DPRK premier clearly  testifies to the development in the fine relations of friendship  and close comradely solidarity between the two comrades who  share common ideals and between the two parties, states, and  peoples of Laos and Korea. These relations and solidarity have  been nurtured by President Kim Il-song and President Kaysone  Phomvihan and further strengthened to continuously bear fruit,  thereby contributing to the strengthening of solidarity among  the nations sharing similar ideals and to the building of peace,  stability, and cooperation among the countries in the  Asia-Pacific region and the world over.    The LPDR and the DPRK consistently have shared common  objectives and ideals. The Lao and Korean peoples have  maintained fine relations for a long time. They have  consistently rendered support and assistance to one another.  The relations and cooperation between the parties, states, and  peoples of Laos and Korea have continuously been further  strengthened. The relations and cooperation between the two  countries, particularly in the economic field, have advanced,  especially following the visit to the DPRK by Comrade Khamtai  Siphandon last December.    The Lao people would like to take this opportunity to  express  our sincere thanks toward the fraternal Korean party, state, and  people for having rendered assistance to us in the past. We  pledge to give consistent support and solidarity to the  fraternal Korean people in carrying out the just cause of  defending and building their socialist fatherland in the north,  in trying to reunify the country through peaceful means, and in  struggling to turn the Korean peninsula into a zone of peace and  stability and free from nuclear weapons.    We, the Lao people, wish the official friendship visit to  the  LPDR by Comrade Kang Song-san, premier of the DPRK  Administrative Council, and his party success, thereby  contributing to further strengthening the relations of  friendship and cooperation between the LPDR and the DPRK.</p>

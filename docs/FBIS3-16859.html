"Russia said that certain positive changes have recently  occurred in Baghdad actions which testify to its intention to  fulfill disarmament aspects of Resolution 687 and long-term  control measures of Resolution 715," Russian permanent  representative to the United Nations Yuliy Vorontsov told  ITAR-TASS today.    In the words of Vorontsov, "the Russian delegation thinks  that positive changes in the Iraqi stand should be encouraged".  Bearing this in mind, Russia suggested to include in a  statement of the Security Council president a provision on  positive changes in Iraqi actions.    The Russian delegation also voiced the need for the "soonest  agreement on the date to begin the fulfilment of long-term  monitoring plans and duration of the 'control period' for  estimation of its efficiency.    "If upon the completion of this period, say six months,  Iraqi  honest comprehensive fulfilment of obligations is confirmed,  Russia will be ready to discuss the lift of oil embargo in  accordance with paragraph 22 of Resolution 687".    The Russian delegation thinks Iraq should immediately  recognize sovereignty and borders of Kuwait.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Equity Issues: Mexico to sell another 25m shares in Telmex THE Mexican government is to sell a further 25m shares in Telmex, the Mexican telephone monopoly, next month, further reducing its shareholding in the company from 9.3 per cent to 4.6 per cent. The international offering of American depository shares, totalling Dollars 1.5bn, was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in New York on Thursday. Roadshows will be held over the next few weeks in the US, Europe and the Far East, and the deal is expected to be priced in mid-May. Just under 40 per cent of the deal will be aimed at investors outside the US, under the lead management of Goldman Sachs. Foreign investment in the Mexican stock market rose 348 per cent last year to a record Dollars 9.05bn. Since Telmex's Dollars 2.2bn international share offering last June, which accounted for a substantial portion of that growth in foreign investment, its share price has more than doubled from Dollars 27 1/2 to Dollars 57 5/8 . Meanwhile, the trend for deleveraging among US companies which piled up debt through takeover sprees and management buyouts during the 1980s is becoming particularly obvious among cyclical stocks. Among the latest offerings under preparation, Black &amp; Decker is planning to sell 18m shares, totalling around Dollars 425m, which will bring the company's gearing down from around 60 per cent to 40 or 45 per cent. A total of 3.6m shares will be offered through an international tranche, arranged by Lehman Brothers. The company is also to spin off a computer subsidiary. Federated Department Stores, which re-emerged from bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 earlier this year, is preparing an offering of 32m shares, of which 8m will be offered internationally.</p>

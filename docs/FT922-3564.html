			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Rally quenched after US selling bout THE LONDON equity market was showing signs of finding its feet yesterday until a weak opening on Wall Street triggered a sudden sell-off in stocks in the UK by a leading US securities house. The fragility of the UK market was tested by renewed concern in the utility sectors after first BT, and then water stocks, attracted the interest of their respective regulatory authorities. Share prices stood up well in early trading, brushing off an easier trend in some European markets as they returned from the one-day holiday. The FT-SE Index crawled above the 2,650 resistance mark again, helped by a recovery in banking stocks and speculative demand for life assurance issues. Also helping sentiment was a steadier performance from the futures sector. But progress was checked by a fall in BT shares after Oftel, the industry watchdog, said it planned to restrict future price increases. Trading in both ordinary and partly-paid shares of BT was heavy. The market's rally melted away as the US house began to sell stock and London quickly turned down after Wall Street gave ground in early trading to show a loss of 20 Dow points in UK trading hours. The FT-SE Index closed at 2,635.4, a net loss of 10.4 leaving it just above the day's low. Seaq trading volume, spurred by the sell programme, increased noticeably to 488.3m shares from Monday's abysmal 305.7m. Customer, or retail business in equities in London, fell to only Pounds 772.6m on Monday, breaking a run of four consecutive sessions returning daily customer business levels of over Pounds 1bn, the benchmark for a healthy, profitable market. Traders commented that the mood of the market was generally nervous and that confidence was not helped by reports that some leading London-based houses were beginning to lower their year-end forecasts for the UK market. The absence of clear evidence of an economic recovery, together with the uncertainty prompted by the growth of anti-Maastricht sentiment, have cast a cloud over the near term outlook for equity investment. While the London market is still considered to be fairly valued at current levels, there is the underlying fear that its rating would be quickly affected if the UK government's heavy funding programme is upset in any way. London reacted sharply yesterday to suggestions from New York that Wall Street is losing hope in any further easing of policy by the Federal Reserve just at present. Adding to the cautious mood of the stock market, last week's Pounds 242m rights call from Blue Circle, the UK construction industry group, has revived fears that the stock market could be hit by a new wave of funding demands. However, the mood was lightened by signs that UK equities may have been oversold last week. The banking sector, the cause of much of the upset, was in better shape as bid speculation died down and the arbitrageur holders of shares in Midland Bank looked hopefully for a better lead from the share price of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking.</p>

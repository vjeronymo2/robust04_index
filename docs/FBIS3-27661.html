			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, February 24 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese  representative to the UN Human Rights Commission said today that  the organization should strictly follow the UN charter if it  truly wants to help realize human rights and basic human freedom.    Zhang Yishan, vice-representative of China to the  commission,  said that the reason why so many countries have called for  rationalizing the commission's work is that it has deviated from  the UN charter's purpose and principles in many cases.    Such deviations are not good for the promotion of  international cooperation in human rights and the general  realization of human rights and basic human freedom, he said.  China supports such calls for rationalization, he added.    He said it is imperative to eliminate such malpratices and  abnormalities such as politicizing human rights issues,  employing double standards toward other countries, and using  human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in other  nations' internal affairs.    He said that some countries are extremely self-important and  relentless in attacking others for human rights violations while  still claiming that they are following the international  standards of human rights.    He noted that the practice of exerting pressure on some  nations by adopting resolutions is absurd and will not truly  help improve their human rights records.    He pointed out that for some countries, it seems to be their  god- given right to accuse others of human rights violations  except themselves.    He said that this is both anachronistic and unhelpful for  the  efforts to truly promote human rights.    He also asked the commission to fully discuss the issues  that  concern the developing countries most.    He said one of the few achievements of the commission last  year is that it recognized the indivisibility of all kinds of  human rights, including the right to development and the right  to have different economic, culture and social systems.</p>

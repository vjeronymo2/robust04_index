			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jose Antich report: "Pujol Supports a Socialist Government </F> of `Regeneration'"]    [Text] Barcelona -- The climate of widespread political  crisis requires a government of "regeneration" comprising  heavyweights from the "PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party]  and independents," not the current government of "under  secretaries" that has been ruling Spain since last 6 June. The  president of the Generalitat [autonomous community of  Catalonia], Jordi Pujol, maintains in his many contacts with the  government leadership that this is the key in undertaking the  drastic remedy which the current situation requires. "Anything  that is not like this, or similar to it, will make general  elections inevitable," Pujol commented.    Jordi Pujol does not ask for anyone to resign, at least not  publicly. His position reaches to the very top of the  government and claims to protect Felipe Gonzalez from opposition  attacks, primarily from the People's Party and the United Left  [IU], but also, according to some of his collaborators, from the  government ranks.    Yesterday, Pujol came out against the People's Party and IU  proposal calling for Felipe Gonzalez's resignation if the  Socialists are to form a new government. "Such a government  would be more fragile than one led by Gonzalez," Pujol argued.  Pujol feels that bringing the elections forward in order to get  out of the current situation of "confusion and commotion," would  be a "fiasco." "At this time, elections are neither a logical  solution nor the best one," Pujol said yesterday morning at the  Barcelona stock exchange, speaking to several hundred  businessmen.    In the afternoon, Pujol stressed that the CiU [Convergence  and Union] was continuing to support the government because the  only alternative would be to call new elections. "There is no  other alternative, either arithmetically or politically, to our  policy but to call elections," at which point he said, "the time  has not yet come." Pujol reiterated that, given that there are  to be elections in Andalusia and European elections, the general  elections could not be held within the next six months.    Pujol, who said everything in the conditional tense,  repeated  his thesis that if there is not a quick reaction from the  government regarding the corruption problem, the political  situation could make it advisable to call elections.    Although he said that we cannot know what will happen in the  coming months, he emphasized that preventing the elections from  being moved forward is up to "the ruling party, which has the  parliamentary seats and the power." He added that the country's  ability to be governed "does not depend on the CiU, which, in  any case, plays a complementary role."    Pujol, who affirmed that the "responsibility of a politician  is put to the test during the tough times, like the current  period," appealed to the government to "calmly" tackle the  current political crisis.</p>

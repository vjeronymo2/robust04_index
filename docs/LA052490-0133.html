			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER 22-POINT RALLY, IT'S 2-0 IN PORTER-LAND;  </P> <P> NBA PLAYOFFS: TRAIL BLAZERS CHARGE TO 108-107 VICTORY AS GUARD SCORES 23 OF HIS  28 IN SECOND HALF.  </P> <P> Always the optimist, Portland Trail Blazer guard Terry Porter said he knew his  game-winning shot was going in, just as he was certain his team would come back  from an 18-point halftime deficit to beat the Phoenix Suns in Game 2 of the  Western Conference finals. Easy for him to say now, after the Trail Blazers  pulled off one of the NBA's most astonishing feats with a 108-107 victory  before 12,884 at the Coliseum to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.  </P> <P> "Of course, I always know it's going in," Porter said of his 14-foot jump shot  with 12 seconds left. "I just wanted to get a clean shot."  </P> <P> 2 After a miserable first half, in which the Trail Blazers trailed by as many  as 22 points, it looked as if they had no shot of maintaining home-court  advantage. They quickly fell behind the Suns and even got so out of it that  they were assessed a technical foul for having only four players on the court.  What's more, a team photographer was was ejected from the game for arguing with  referee Jess Kersey.  </P> <P> "Not only that," guard Clyde Drexler cracked, "but our locker room was locked  when we got back there."  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers might have been disorganized at that point but not, as it  turned out, distraught.  </P> <P> "All we wanted to do was play better in the second half," Porter said. "I  figured if we could steadily get that lead down, we'd have a chance. When we  cut it to nine points going into the (fourth quarter), I knew we had a good  chance."  </P> <P> Porter made it possible. He scored 23 of his 28 points in the second half. He  made four of the Trail Blazers' five three-point shots, including two in the  last 5:38. Porter's three-pointer with 28 seconds left tied it, 106-106, and he  swished a jumper off a fractured pick-and-roll play with 12 seconds left for  the game winner.  </P> <P> "We could have folded our tent, but we didn't," Portland Coach Rick Adelman  said. "That's the way it's been all season for us. Terry Porter has been our  game winner all along, and he did it again tonight. I just can't think of  another win as satisfying as this."  </P> <P> It was not the biggest second-half comeback in NBA playoff history, but it was  close. In 1948, Baltimore recovered from a 21-point halftime deficit to beat  Philadelphia by three points. Four other times in playoff history teams have  rebounded from 18-point halftime deficits.  </P> <P> Depending on one's perspective, this was either one of the greatest comebacks  in Trail Blazer history or one of the most ignominious fold jobs the Suns have  ever experience. Maybe it was both.  </P> <P> But don't mention tortillas and folding around the Suns. They gave credit to  Portland for taking the lead. They say they did not give it away.  </P> <P> "I've had everything happen to me in the NBA," Sun Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons  said. "It's not going to break my heart and it's not the end of the world. I'm  sure we'll come back and play extremely hard.  </P> <P> "We couldn't stop them. That's the story. It was a great comeback, and they  earned it. But this is a long series."  </P> <P> The Suns, after taking a 59-41 halftime lead, looked as though they didn't know  what hit them.  </P> <P> With 35 seconds left in the half, Portland was assessed a technical foul by  Kersey. It seemed center Kevin Duckworth left the court during a stoppage of  play. No Trail Blazer replaced him. So the Trail Blazers were called for having  only four players on the court. To that point, even five Portland players could  not stop the Suns.  </P> <P> Then, in the second half, the newly resolute Trail Blazers scored 41 points in  the third quarter to cut the Suns' lead to 91-82. From that point, the Trail  Blazers clearly were in control, while the Suns were simply trying to keep from  losing.  </P> <P> It took nearly all game, but the Trail Blazers finally caught the Suns when  Porter sank his three-point shot with 28 seconds to play. The Suns called two  timeouts to set up their next possession, and it appeared the Trail Blazers  made a mistake by fouling Kevin Johnson on the inbounds play.  </P> <P> But Johnson, shooting 82% from the free throw line in the playoffs, made only  one of two shots, giving the Suns a 107-106 lead. More important, it gave the  Trail Blazers the ball with 27 seconds left.  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers, wisely, put the ball in Porter's hands. He feigned a drive  on the right wing, then headed toward the free-throw line. Freeing himself from  Kevin Johnson's shadow, Porter pulled up for a jump shot from about 14 feet. He  swished the shot for a 108-107 lead with 12 seconds left.  </P> <P> Phoenix called its last timeout, then put the ball in Kevin Johnson's hands.  Johnson brought it up, then passed to Eddie Johnson in the corner. Johnson,  heavily guarded, attempted a high-arching jumper with two seconds left.  </P> <P> He missed, and the Trial Blazers had completed the stunning comeback.  </P> <P> "This is the greatest thing that's happened in my career," said Trail Blazer  forward Jerome Kersey, who had 16 of his 29 points in the second half.  </P> <P> Porter did not say it, but it undoubtedly was his best effort in such an  important game.  </P> <P> Drexler scored 16 of his 20 points in the second half and added nine rebounds,  six assists and six steals.  </P> <P> "At halftime, we felt we were still in it," said Duckworth, who had 11 points  and seven rebounds. "We just needed to make some shots and play good defense.  That's the story."  </P></p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Argentina to probe Italian bribes link ARGENTINA'S President Carlos Menem has announced an investigation into allegations that his brother-in-law extorted bribes from companies three years ago when he was a foreign ministry official in charge of relations with Italy, Spain and Middle Eastern countries. He and other former and serving officials are suspected of involvement in Italy's widening corruption scandal. Mr Menem said he was 'going to be absolutely inflexible with those who have not acted correctly.' On Tuesday, ex-president Raul Alfonsin said he sent a letter in 1990 to then-foreign minister Domingo Cavallo alerting him to complaints from businessmen that Mr Karim Yoma, brother of Mr Menem's estranged wife Zulema, had demanded bribes to process applications for Italian government soft loans. Italy has credit lines to Argentina worth over Dollars 1.0bn. The allegations against Mr Yoma, who left the government in 1990, are the latest in a series of claims, from the opposition and the press, that other senior government officials in Argentina and Italy demanded 'commissions' from companies applying for loans to import Italian machinery or finance investments in Argentina. Officials are also suspected of approving projects to Italian companies on suspiciously generous terms. In 1987, Argentina signed investment and loan agreements with both Spain and Italy breaking its economic and political isolation following the 1982 debt crisis and defeat in the Falklands conflict. Although it was Mr Alfonsin who signed the agreements, most of the loans began flowing after Mr Menem took office. Mr Menem has denounced Mr Alfonsin's allegations as a smear campaign in the run up to Congressional elections. However, Mr Alfonsin has touched a raw nerve. Mr Menem's government has been rocked by over a dozen corruption scandals in the last two years, three of which involve members of his wife's family. In December 1991, Mr Miguel Angel Vicco was forced to resign as Mr Menem's private secretary, when the press accused him of corruption. It was Mr Vicco who introduced the president to several Italian businessmen suspected of attempting to misappopriate Italian loans.</p>

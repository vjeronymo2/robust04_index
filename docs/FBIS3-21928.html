The drug plants, interspersed with corn on a farm known  as Mumucuera, in the Sonora municipality of Navojoa, would have  produced slightly over 40 tons of the drug.    This announcement was made by the office's representative in  the state, Fausto Destenave Kuri, who reported that more than 2  million drug plants, of the types known as "lamb's tail" and  "lemon-lime," were destroyed manually. Backing was provided by  Mexican Army, and both State Judicial and Municipal Police  personnel.    He added that, based on a series of investigations, Federal  Judicial Police agents assigned to the state, under orders from  the deputy representative, Julio Cesar Moraila Amador, detected  several marijuana plantations three km from the Km Six by-pass  of the Navojoa-Huatabampo highway. They were located on an earth  fill road, "protruding" from a corn crop.    When the forces invaded the farm, they observed that the  marijuana was interspersed with corn, and that the crop's  dimensions were of considerable size. Therefore, an inspection  by topographical experts and reconnaissance flights over the  zone by military personnel were required. It was determined that  the farm had been divided into six plots, on an approximate area  of 58 hectares.    Destenave Kuri noted that, a few days earlier, the local  office headed by him had received reports concerning the  presence of armed persons on that site, as well as an unusual  movement of vehicles through the region.    During an operation conducted on the farm known as  Mumucuera,  it was discovered that the plants had reached a height of  one-two meters, with a density of four per square meter. This  land was supplied with water through a complex irrigation  system, consisting of pumps to extract the vital liquid and  hoses.    The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, for its part,  stressed that, on the borders of the plantations, six camps were  found, supplied with food, bedding, and cots. There were two  dryers for the drugs, as well as bags of fertilizer and  insecticides, fumigation pumps, shovels, hoes, plastic drums,  and other household equipment.    The participation of Federal Judicial Police personnel was  required to destroy the marijuana crops. They began uprooting  all the plants for subsequent incineration.    Finally, the representative of the Attorney General's Office  in the state remarked that preliminary investigation  029/94-Obregon-III, initiated after these incidents, now  contains data on the likely owners of that land and of the  drugs. Criminal action will be taken against them for crimes  against health in the form of planting and cultivation, and any  other forms proven to exist.</p>

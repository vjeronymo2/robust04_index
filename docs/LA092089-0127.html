			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWYER EMBEZZLED, STATE BAR ALLEGES  </P> <P> A San Fernando Valley personal-injury lawyer embezzled at least $125,000 from  dozens of clients by settling insurance claims without their knowledge or  consent and keeping the money, the State Bar of California alleges.  </P> <P> Bar officials are seeking the disbarment of Richard F. Murkey, who they say  swindled 29 clients and their doctors and committed a host of violations of his  "oath and duties as an attorney.  </P> <P> Based on three of these cases, the district attorney's office has filed five  felony counts of theft and forgery against Murkey, who is scheduled for a  preliminary hearing today in Van Nuys Superior Court.  </P> <P> Murkey, 42, once accused by his grandmother of trying to cheat her out of her  life savings, is temporarily prohibited from practicing law pending the outcome  of formal disciplinary proceedings by the State Bar. A Bar Assn. referee ruled  that he has "demonstrated a reckless disregard" for his clients and that his  continued practice could cause "substantial harm to the public."  </P> <P> Susan Leventhal, a Bar Assn. attorney, said when Murkey settled cases without  consulting clients, he frequently accepted sums much lower than the clients  would have agreed to. When clients discovered their cases had been resolved --  usually by contacting insurance companies directly -- Murkey wrote them checks  that frequently bounced, the State Bar alleges.  </P></p>

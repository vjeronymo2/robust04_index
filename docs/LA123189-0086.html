			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> FREELOADING DUCKS PUT STORE OWNER IN FOWL MOOD  </P> <P> Denis Maillet is knee-deep in ducks, and he doesn't know what to do about them.  </P> <P> Between 300 and 400 wild ducks have found the living so easy at Sabattus Lake  behind Foster's General Store that they have stopped migrating south this  winter.  </P> <P> People from surrounding communities bring their children to the lake to feed  the ducks, and a small waterfall behind the store keeps part of the lake open  all winter, giving the ducks a place to swim.  </P> <P> That makes everyone happy except Maillet, who owns a small warehouse next door.  </P> <P> "I come in sometimes and find my yard full of ducks, in the driveway,  everywhere," Maillet said. "The ground is covered with duck (droppings)."  </P> <P> Maillet said he is in a no-win situation when it comes to dealing with the  ducks. The birds damage his property and make it hard to get in and out of his  building, and some local people get angry at him because they feel he is an  animal-hater.  </P> <P> "When I see people on my property feeding the ducks, I approach them and try to  explain some of the problems that result from what they are doing," he said.  "Some receive it gracefully, but others snub me off. You get the feeling they  think you are a bad guy."  </P> <P> Maillet said federal law prevents him from hurting the birds. "I'd be breaking  the law if I ever even touched one of those ducks," he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the size of the flock gets bigger and bigger. Linda Foster, who owns  the general store next door, said the flock of ducks started out with just a  few several years ago.  </P> <P> "I would say they have been here a good three years," she said. "There are a  lot more of them now. I'm not sure when the people started feeding them, but  they stay right here now through the winter."  </P> <P> Maillet said the ducks are wild and should be left alone. He said some of the  birds have lost parts of their feet and legs when they have become stuck in the  ice on the lake.  </P> <P> "Heck, I even recognize some of them now, especially some of them that have  only one leg," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ODDS AGAINST GARRISON AGAIN AS SHE TRIES TO DENY NAVRATILOVA  </P> <P> So, Martina Navratilova, your path to the women's final and a record ninth  Wimbledon title has been cleared of Steffi Graf, now how do you feel?  </P> <P> "I'm just trying not to hyperventilate," Navratilova said.  </P> <P> All that separates the 33-year-old Navratilova from a ninth Wimbledon crown --  Helen Wills Moody had eight, the last in 1938 -- is Zina Garrison.  </P> <P> The odds are against Garrison, who is 1-27 against Navratilova.  </P> <P> "I've beaten her once and I've played her close in a lot of situations,"  Garrison said. "And you get to a final, a final like this on grass, anything  can happen."  </P> <P> A 26-year-old Texan, Garrison is the second black woman to appear in a  Wimbledon final. The first was Althea Gibson, who won consecutive titles in  1957 and '58.  </P> <P> Navratilova's 98 Wimbledon singles victories are a record. In six matches so  far this year, Navratilova has lost only 24 games, without dropping a set, as  she chases her dream of a record ninth title.  </P> <P> "I've had a bit of an obsession, too," Garrison said.  </P> <P> "I worked on a lot of sprints, a lot of running, weights -- I was running  eight, nine miles a day almost -- and just trying to get into top shape and be  ready, (so) if I have the opportunity to do it, I knew I could do my best."  </P> <P> To get to the final, Garrison saved 28 of 38 break points, won 84% of her  service games and beat No. 3-seeded Monica Seles and No. 1 Graf.  </P> <P> Garrison has even served more aces than Navratilova, 13-11.  </P> <P> "She has beaten Steffi, so she can certainly beat me," Navratilova said. "I'm  confident, too, but I'm not certainly counting my chickens before they're  hatched." THOMAS BONK  </P></p>

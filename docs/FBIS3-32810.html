			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Eduardo Alves] </F>   [Text] Luiz Inacio Lula Silva did not like the draft  government program that he asked the PT [Workers Party] to  design. He decided to react against some of the topics defined  by the party, and will designate Sao Paulo federal Deputy  Aloizio Mercadante to introduce the changes he considers  essential in the text. The orthodox majority ruling the party  has been hostile to Mercadante.    For example, Lula does not agree with a moratorium being  included in the party program, not even as a possibility. He  believes a moratorium is a unilateral measure. He advocates  "political renegotiation" with the governments of creditor  countries. If the principle of "default" is admitted in an  official document of his candidacy, Lula says, it will be  ridiculous to advocate renegotiation.    Lula also disagrees with the emphasis the preliminary  document attached to privatization. First, because he fears that  it will be almost impossible to reverse some of the  privatizations, something that almost all PT groups have  demanded. Second, because he believes the so-called "strategic  areas" in which the party will not agree to private control will  be questioned by the revisionist Congress, which will be an  appropriate forum for maintaining, for example, the petroleum  and telecommunications monopolies.    Lula also disliked the chapter dealing with land reform. He  wants a section on a farm policy especially favoring the owners  of small farms. Lula also disagreed with the emphasis the party  attached to the debates on the military. While he does not want  to overemphasize the importance of the military in the document,  the party is turning the subject into a central issue of the  debates.    Another restriction that Lula marked on the draft program is  the inclusion, even if "shameful," of socialist prospects. Lula  does not want references to socialism in the text because he  believes the program cannot be a strictly partisan document,  because this will make it impossible for the party to make  alliances.    Lula and Mercadante held a long phone talk on 9 February,  and  they had a meeting scheduled for the evening. In the morning,  Lula told the deputy that the public considered him his main  economic adviser, and that it was time for Mercadante to  participate in the internal debate.    Mercadante said he will participate in the debates on the  program. He will outline a critical view of what has been done  so far. "The program lacks targets, objectives, and  quantification," he said.    The deputy's opinion on the functioning of Lula's campaign  is  shared by a great majority of those close to Lula. "Wherever  Lula goes, things work. The part that depends on the party is  not operating properly," he said. Mercadante will attend a PT  executive board meeting on 17 February, at which attempts will  be made to introduce changes into the program.    PT Vice President Rui Falcao, who leads the faction that  opposes Mercadante within the PT, has labelled his rival's  joining the debates as "positive."</p>

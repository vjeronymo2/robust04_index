			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Disney records profits up 22% in first quarter EARNINGS from the recently-released film Beauty and the Beast and other animated film and television products helped The Walt Disney Company to a 22 per cent rise in net income of Dollars 208.1m in the first quarter to end-December. The profits, on revenues 30 per cent up at Dollars 1.94bn, mark a recovery for Disney, which ended its financial year to September 30 with a 23 per cent slump in net income to Dollars 636.6m. One of the problems facing Disney - flat attendance at its US theme parks - continued in the first three months of the new financial year. Operating income in the theme parks and resorts division dropped 18 per cent to Dollars 113m, on revenues that were 6 per cent higher at Dollars 662.4m. Increased costs associated with the 20th anniversary celebration of Walt Disney World also contributed to lower operating results. The filmed entertainment division managed a 49 per cent rise in revenues to Dollars 965.8m in the quarter, with an 81 per cent jump in operating income to Dollars 166.8m. These results reflected the success of Beauty and the Beast in the US as well as the worldwide home video release of Fantasia. The company's consumer merchandise division recorded 15 per cent higher operating income of Dollars 88.7m on revenues that up 39 per cent at Dollars 308.4m. Disney declared a 20 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend to 21 cents per share. But Wall Street marked the company's shares Dollars 5/8 lower at Dollars 132 1/2 .</p>

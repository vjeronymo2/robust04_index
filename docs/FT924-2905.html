			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Congress rejects Gaidar as premier RUSSIAN PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin suffered his most serious political setback since coming to power 18 months ago with the rejection by the Congress of People's Deputies of Mr Yegor Gaidar as his prime minister. Mr Gaidar narrowly missed confirmation in his post by the Congress - 467 votes to 486 against - but he is likely to remain as acting prime minister for the immediate future. Mr Gaidar said after the vote that the government should 'carry on working calmly'. He, and other senior colleagues, feel it is essential to continue reforms, especially the privatisation programme, as long as possible. If Mr Gaidar is reappointed, even in a temporary capacity, the reforms would continue. They would be moderated, not so much by yesterday's vote as by the concessions already given to the opposition Civic Union and pledges made on extra spending. The vote came on what is expected to be the penultimate day of a Congress which has showed both its enmity to the consequences of economic reform and its desire to claw back powers from the presidency to itself. However, the closeness of the vote and the lack of an alternative prime ministerial figure from the ranks of the opposition, make it likely that Mr Yeltsin will today propose Mr Gaidar as acting prime minister once more, pending the adoption of a law on government which would define the powers enjoyed by the presidency and the parliament. Mr Mikhail Mityukov, chairman of the parliament's legislation committee, said last night that Mr Yeltsin could appoint Mr Gaidar for a period of three months after a new law on government had come into force. The president's alternatives are: to propose Mr Gaidar once again, possibly offering further compromises to attract more votes; to propose another figure; or to take the step of dissolving a parliament which has shown itself willing to wound him. Political opinion last night was firmly on the side of the three-month appointment option. Mr Gaidar's closest aide, Mr Vladimir Mau, said: 'The vote confirms Gaidar as a major political figure. We didn't expect anything like half. No one else could have got as much.' Mr Yeltsin suffered some humiliation as a result of having put forward a compromise deal which was accepted without recompense. The Congress voted to accept his offer that it be allowed veto rights over four ministers other than the prime minister (defence, foreign affairs, interior and security) before it voted against Mr Gaidar - precisely the result the deal was supposed to prevent. He and Mr Gaidar have also offered changes in the cabinet and in economic policy. West regrets rejection, Page 4 Editorial Comment, Page 18</p>

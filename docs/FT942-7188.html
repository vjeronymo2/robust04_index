			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Paper industry sets up price increases A spate of proposed price increases has firmly tilted the balance of power in North American and European pulp and paper markets towards producers. International Paper, the world's biggest paper company, based in Purchase, New York, last week announced plans to cut discounts on coated groundwood paper by about 7 per cent on July 1. The rise coincides with the peak ordering period for mail-order and Christmas catalogues. It would be the first increase for this grade of paper in four years. In the newsprint market, US and Canadian producers plan to cut discounts by between 6 per cent and 7 per cent on August 15, the second price increase this year. Sizeable increases are also scheduled for linerboard and corrugating medium, used to make cardboard boxes. In Europe, producers of coated grades made from chemical pulp are pushing for a 10 per cent price rise on top of hikes of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent over the past six months. The shift in bargaining power is illustrated by Fletcher Challenge Canada's decision not to renew a long-term newsprint contract with Times Mirror, publisher of the Los Angeles Times. According to one paper consultant, Times Mirror, which gained a reputation during the past recession as one of the toughest bargainers among newsprint buyers, has yet to find another supplier willing to provide long-term protection against further price increases.</p>

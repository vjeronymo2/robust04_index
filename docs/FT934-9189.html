			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: BAA secures rail finance BAA, formerly known as the British Airports Authority, has secured the first round of bank financing for its proposed rail link between Heathrow airport, which it operates, and Paddington station in central London. Japan's Export Import Bank (Exim) has agreed a loan facility of up to Pounds 135m towards the Pounds 300m cost of the project. BAA said it would use Pounds 30m of the facility early next year, with the balance to be drawn 'if required'. The terms of the loan were undisclosed. BAA is in talks with about another 30 banks over short- and long-term loans, and is likely to announce a deal soon with the European Investment Bank. About two-thirds of the financing will be fixed-term over at least 15 years. The rail link project, called Heathrow Express, is a joint venture between BAA and state-owned British Rail.</p>

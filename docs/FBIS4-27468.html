			<p>BFN     [Text] The Supreme Court has allowed the holding of the  controversial East Timor conference at the University of the  Philippines [UP] in Diliman, Quezon City. The high tribunal  ordered the Quezon City Regional Trial Court to desist from  implementing the temporary restraining order on the meeting,  which will discuss alleged human rights violations in East Timor.    President Ramos directed all government agencies to  immediately comply with the Supreme Court ruling. However, the  government will still enforce the ban on foreign participation  in the conference. The Immigration Bureau canceled the visas of  foreign nationals attending the conference, but President Ramos  removed the name of Japanese Bishop Aloisius Nobuo Soma from the  list of 34 foreigners banned from attending the East Timor  conference. The president's decision was announced following a  closed-door meeting of the Cluster E which advises the president  on political and security matters.    Malacanang [presidential office] was forced to say that the  government will prevent the conference from turning into a  political platform that would undermine the political integrity  of Indonesia. The speeches and other public statements of the  foreign delegates will be closely monitored, particularly those  that would affect the national interest.    Twenty-five foreign delegates who were able to slip through  a  dragnet thrown by immigration authorities at the airport  attended the meeting which opened yesterday. No arrests have  been made in the UP campus as of press time. Surrounded by  human chain of students, nuns, and priests, the foreign  participants march inside the Diliman campus going to the  conference site.</p>

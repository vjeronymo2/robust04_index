			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani </F> with local and international reporters and an unidentified  moderator at the Polideportivo Center in San Salvador on 10  January--live]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Moderator] Mario Jovel, from  the "Up-to-Date" television newscast.    [Jovel] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Some small business  owners and certain politicians have said that one of the  repercussions of NAFTA could be Mexico's strong capabilities,  which are very different than what Salvadorans have. Could this  be a repercussion or what could be the main repercussions of  NAFTA?    [Cristiani] I think that the repercussions, or the main  repercussion, will generate competition. To that effect, our  entrepreneurs will have to face the challenge of competing with  products coming from other countries. Competition leads to  better quality at a better price, and consumers, who are the  majority of the population, receive the benefits; in other  words, consumers will have greater options when choosing the  product that provides better quality at the most reasonable  price.    I think our entrepreneurs should not fear open competition.  They have proven to be good businessmen on numerous occasions,  and they have highly qualified workers. I think that if we make  this decision--and I think entrepreneurs are about to make that  decision--they will accept the challenge, and I think they will  be successful. Personally, I do not think there is any reason  why we should fear competition. We must obviously try harder to  provide the people with those two elements.    There is always an advantage, even in free trade, and that  is  transportation. Transportation is what makes the difference  between the imported and locally manufactured product;  nevertheless, I still do not think there is anything to fear.  Furthermore, the treaty with Mexico is asymmetrical; that is,  our products will enter Mexico even before Mexican products  enter El Salvador, according to what was agreed in Tuxtla  Gutierrez; in other words, this is an additional advantage.    Naturally, if we want to see examples, let's see examples  such as Mexico versus the United States, or let's see Spain  versus Germany. Actually, there has been an increase in trade  between the two countries, both in the cases of Spain and  Germany. That is where each country has to seek in which areas  it can be more competitive and then compete.    [Moderator] Carlos Marquez, from AFP.    [Marquez] Mr. President, the elections will be held in 68  days, and I would like to know if any governments have been  invited to observe the electoral process.    [Cristiani] That is something that corresponds to the  Supreme  Electoral Tribunal [TSE], and, as everyone knows, the United  Nations will send observers. The United Nations is a world  organization; therefore, all countries indirectly have the  possibility of being included in a mission that we understand  will arrive at the time of the elections. The mission will  include 900 [as heard] observers.    For the time being, the TSE has only notified us that it has  decided to invite all of the electoral bodies of Latin America  inasmuch as they have an organization among themselves. They  also have an agreement whereby all members of these bodies are  observers in each other's elections. Apart from them, we have  not had any other request by the TSE.    [Moderator] Amadeo Cabrera, LA NOTICIA.    [Cabrera] I would like to know if you will attend the new  Honduran president's inaugural ceremonies, and how do you  describe bilateral relations between the outgoing president and  your government?    [Cristiani] Yes. We have plans to attend the inaugural  ceremonies of the new Honduran Government on 27 January. I  would say that relations between the government of President  Callejas and ours have been excellent. [passage omitted]</p>

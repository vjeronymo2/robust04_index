Mix in chicken and  broth mixtures. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  Cool, then refrigerate 8 hours.  </P> <P> When ready to serve, remove fat from surface and discard. Heat gumbo over  medium heat, stirring occasionally. Serve over hot cooked rice.

You may sweeten the  jam as necessary when eaten. Or add less sweetener than you think you will need  to the water in which the fruit is to be processed. More can be added later.  </P> <P> SUGAR-FREE PEACH JAM  </P> <P> 1 envelope unflavored gelatin  </P> <P> 1/4 cup cold water  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups peeled, sliced peaches  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon lemon juice  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon granulated or few drops liquid non-caloric sweetener  </P> <P> Soften gelatin in cold water. Place peaches in saucepan, sprinkle with lemon  juice and bring to boil. Add softened gelatin and blend well. Add sweetener to  taste and remove from heat.  </P> <P> Pour into 2 sterilized half-pint jars and seal immediately. Do not use  paraffin. Let cool. Store in refrigerator until used. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: My children and I would be very grateful if you could provide a  recipe for those delicious, but very expensive, frozen fruit bars, especially  the pineapple ones, on the market.  </P> <P>  -- MRS.

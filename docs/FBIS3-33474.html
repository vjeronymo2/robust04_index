Reconsidering a ruling  made last December, Judge Novely Vilanova of the Seventh Federal  Court granted an injunction on the suit filed by the Attorney  General's Office against former President Fernando Collor, Paulo  Cesar Farias, Claudio Vieira, and 24 companies for illegal  amassment of wealth.    Judge Vilanova's decision means that any contract signed  between those companies and the government since the injunction  was granted are suspended. Among the companies affected are the  Andrade Gutierrez, Norberto Odebrecht, and Tratex construction  companies, as well as Mercedes Benz do Brasil, Votorantim, and  the Cooperativa Regional dos Produtores de Acucar e Alcool de  Alagoas.    Late yesterday afternoon Attorney General Aristides  Junqueira  sent notes to Ministers Elcio Alvares (Industry and Commerce)  and Romildo Canhim (Federal Administration Secretariat)  notifying them on the court's decision. Beside suspending  contracts and reallocating budget resources, the government must  now prevent those companies from winding up, changing their  business status, or merging with others.    Reconsidering the first ruling on a request from the  Attorney  General's Office, Judge Vilanova emphasized the existence of  evidence in the law suit against the companies. Pointing out  the urgency of "mechanisms of morality," Vilanova observed that  the injunction does not assume guilt. He criticized the  government, saying: "In face of the illegal actions attributed  to the companies, the government could have temporarily  suspended the participation of those companies in new bids. A  court decision was unnecessary."    The companies may still resort to the Federal Regional  Court.  The companies may not engage in contracts with the government  for 10 years. While Collor, Farias, and Vieira have not been  punished, yet they may have their political rights suspended for  up to 10 years in addition of losing their assets and being  fined.    The 24 companies affected by the injunction are:    1. Construtora Tratex Inc.;    2. Construtora Andrade Gutierrez Inc.;    3. Construtora Norberto Odebrecht Inc.;    4. Cetenco Engenharia Inc.;    5. Mercedes Benz do Brasil Inc.;    6. Industria Votorantim Inc.;    7. Companhia Catarinense de Cimento Portland;    8. Companhia Cimento Portland Gaucho;    9. Companhia Cimento Portland Rio Branco;    10. Empresa de Transportes C.P.T.;    11. Transportes Especiais Olimpia Inc.;    12. Cimento Itau do Parana Inc.;    13. Companhia Cimento Portland Itau Inc.;    14. Transportadora e Comercial Alem Fronteiras;    15. Cimento Santa Rita Inc.;    16. Leao Irmaos Acucar e Alcool Inc.;    17. Abaete Automoveis;    18.

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ANHEUSER-BUSCH MAY HAVE TO SHARE MARKETING RIGHTS FOR SHAMU  </P> <P> Anheuser-Busch has agreed to spend $1.1 billion to buy the Sea World parks from  Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, but it may have to share the marketing rights to  their symbol, Shamu the killer whale.  </P> <P> The Orlando-based HBJ already has a licensing agreement with Watson General  Pictures of La Jolla, which created the cartoon "Shamu -- The Beginning" that  has not yet appeared on television.  </P> <P> Any proceeds from the animated special or merchandising spinoffs will be shared  among Anheuser-Busch of St. Louis, Watson General Pictures and Watson's partner  in the making of the movie, Lion's Den Venture.  </P> <P> Anheuser-Busch will also have to share profits, which analysts say could reach  into the millions of dollars, from the marketing of other Sea World characters  and animals, according to the licensing agreement.  </P> <P> Anheuser-Busch spokeswoman Vicki Pearlman said the company knew about Watson  General Pictures when it agreed to purchase the parks from HBJ in September.  The sale of the Sea World parks is set to close later this month.  </P> <P> "The company was aware of the licensing agreement relating to the Shamu  character," she said.  </P> <P> One expert said Anheuser-Busch may try to buy the rights back from Watson  General Pictures.  </P> <P> "I would think Anheuser-Busch would want control of the characters," said Bert  Boksen, who follows theme parks for the Raymond, James &amp; Associates  regional brokerage in St. Petersburg. "Somebody else . . . could portray Shamu  in a commercial drinking Miller beer."  </P> <P> HBJ and Sea World officials were not available for comment.  </P> <P> Watson General Pictures' 1988 annual report indicates that the agreement gives  Sea World royalties of 6% to 50% of proceeds from merchandising as well as a  share in proceeds from the cartoon.  </P> <P> Watson General Pictures says in its 1988 annual report that its plans include  "initiating of a worldwide marketing and merchandising program" to promote the  photogenic killer whale as well as television specials, a feature film valued  at $6 million to $8 million, and a children's TV series.  </P> <P> The report also says that Watson has been approached by "a major merchandising  company" that is interested in marketing the Shamu projects with the company.  The company was not identified.  </P> <P> Ms. Pearlman would not say whether Anheuser-Busch has been in touch with Watson  or has an interest in buying rights back from Watson.  </P></p>

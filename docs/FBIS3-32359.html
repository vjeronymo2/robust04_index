The leaders stated that they will continue to support the  coffee-producing countries' efforts to permanently upgrade the  bean's international prices.    Regarding their bilateral relations, the heads of state  agreed to continue working to establish the Colombian-Salvadoran  Commission on 24 and 25 February in San Salvador. This  commission will allow them to formulate an effective cooperation  program. Gaviria and Cristiani will request that the commission  gear its work toward reaching an agreement on judicial  cooperation and mutual legal assistance issues "so as to  establish a common front to counter all kinds of criminal  organizations," in reference to drug-trafficking activities.    The leaders agreed that factors, such as extreme poverty,  persist and negatively hinder their countries' possibilities to  achieve the desired socioeconomic development. In this respect,  they expressed their support for preparation of the Social  Development World Summit to be held in Denmark in March 1995.  The presidents stated their conviction that full respect for  human rights and basic liberties are an essential part of all  democratic systems and praised the efforts made by their  administrations in this respect.    The presidents underscored the importance of the Uruguayan  Round negotiations and of the free trade agreement  implementation between Mexico, the United States, and Canada on  international trade. They also reaffirmed their decision to  continue strengthening the solidarity and cooperation between  their countries, which are fundamental to confronting the  world's challenges and requirements.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bafokeng chief to join Impala Platinum board THE GRADUAL return to health of Impala Platinum, South Africa and the world's second largest producer, continues with the announcement yesterday that acting chief Mokgwaro George Molotlegi had accepted an invitation to join Impala's board as a representative of the Bafokeng tribe. The Bafokeng tribe is an important player as it owns the land that Impala mines. Doubt has in the past been cast over the security of Impala's lease owing to disputes about who represents the Bafokeng tribe. Mr Michael McMahon, executive chairman of Impala commented yesterday: 'This is a significant step in furthering our relationship with the Bafokeng tribe, who are a vital part of our operations.' The Bafokeng do not own equity in Impala, but in terms of a royalty agreement are entitled to 13 per cent of taxable income.</p>

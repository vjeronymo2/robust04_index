			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISSED STATIONS ON DOUGHNUT QUEST  </P> <P> * I've just finished reading your article on doughnuts and really must  recommend another place that is far superior to any of the ones listed. This is  the Star Deli &amp; Donut Show, 1456 S. Robertson Blvd., Los Angeles,  ironically only a short distance from one you listed. Talk about apple  fritters! Out of this world!  </P> <P> ADELINE SCHWAY, Los Angeles  </P></p>

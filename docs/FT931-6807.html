			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / BBC1 post for BBC2 chief MR ALAN YENTOB, the controller of BBC2, was yesterday appointed controller of BBC1. It is the first time since 1965 that the person in charge of the corporation's minority channel has gone on to run the BBC's more mainstream television station. One of his early tasks will be to decide what to do about Eldorado, the soap opera set in Spain which was commissioned by his predecessor at BBC1, Mr Jonathan Powell. Yesterday Mr Yentob said it had failed in ratings terms. 'It doesn't seem to have done the business,' he said, although he would not be drawn on the soap's fate. According to Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of network television, only Mr Yentob, 45, went before a sub-committee of the BBC governors on Thursday evening. All the signs are that Mr Yentob, controller of BBC2 since 1988 and regarded as a considerable success, did not initially apply for the job. 'I decided that I wanted to do it and I do want to do it,' he said yesterday. He said his main task would be to offer the audience a genuine choice, although he supported the emphasis Mr John Birt, the director-general, was placing on the BBC pro-ducing 'distinctive' programmes.</p>

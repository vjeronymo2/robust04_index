			<p>BFN     [Text] Taiyuan, April 4 (XINHUA) -- People in northern  China's dry inland Shanxi Province are eating more fish and  farmers have even become prosperous by raising it.    "When Shanxi people eat fish, they never take their hands  off  it" -- this used to an oft-used expression to described people  in Shanxi who did not know how to cook and eat fish. There was  virtually no fish farming in the province before 1980.    However, that has changed. Figures show that during the past  few years, fish production grew at 7 percent to 15 percent  annually. All over the province, reservoirs, lakes and rivers,  plus newly-dug ponds, have been used for fish farming.    Ponds were dug along major river banks of the province,  including the Yellow River, the Fenhe River and the Huotuo  River, and at all possible areas around major cities and mines  to raise fish. Large reservoirs became fish ponds as well.    New techniques like small "net-cage culture", which was  imported from the United States, were spread from only 70 cubic  meters of water to over 800 cubic meters. New species of pond  fish and fresh water butterfish were developed.    So far, among all the province's 111 counties, 108 have  established their own fishery industry. Annual total fish catch  has grown from only 650 tons before 1980 to 14,000 tons last  year.</p>

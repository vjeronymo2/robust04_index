			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH TO ATTEND ALL-MALE EVENTS  </P> <P> President Bush "opposes segregation in any form" but plans to attend social  functions hosted by two all-male clubs in Washington on Saturday, his spokesman  said today.  </P> <P> As he did last year, the President will attend a luncheon sponsored by the  Alibi Club, which meets on regular occasions, and the annual dinner of the  Alfalfa Club, which meets once a year to roast political personalities.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush is attending the two  functions "for the same reason he did last year -- because he belongs to both  clubs and enjoys them."  </P> <P> When asked whether the President should attend a segregated gathering,  Fitzwater said, "I don't think it's relevant" and added, "The President is  opposed to segregation in any form."  </P></p>

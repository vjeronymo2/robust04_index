			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THATCHER'S RESIGNATION  </P> <P> Alexander Cockburn's Column Left is aptly named! His article, "Tory Instinct  for Survival Gores Thatcher" (Commentary, Nov. 22), says little of substance!  He blasts the capitalist prime minister of England, praises the socialist  president of the Irish Republic and the socialist prime minister of Norway!  Cockburn has convinced me -- he prefers socialism 2 to 1.  </P> <P> ELLEN ERICSEN  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At a Glance): Honesty pays for TSB The TSB has set a shining example to the rest of the savings industry by telling its customers in full when a new account is superseded by an old one. It has launched a 60 Day Notice Account which will pay 10 per cent gross on balances of Pounds 5,000 and upward. There must be an initial deposit of at least Pounds 500. Interest can be paid yearly or monthly according to choice, and account holders will be offered either a passbook or cash machine card and statement service. The 60 Day Notice Account replaces TSB's Special Notice account and all customers are being automatically upgraded. Letters informing them of the change went out this week, a move which contrasts with claims by some building societies that it is not practical to notify all customers individually about account changes. TSB says the new account is a better deal for savers, with a reduced notice period and a minimum opening deposit of Pounds 500 instead of Pounds 2,000.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Lamont confident of British growth BRITAIN will show faster growth this year than the European economy as a whole, according to Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor. In confident mood after chairing the Group of Seven talks in London, Mr Lamont told a press conference he was encouraged by signs of an upturn in Britain, even though UK unemployment would 'continue to rise for some time'. Mr Lamont noted a 'disquieting' deterioration in economic conditions among other European nations, much of it linked to the slowdown in Germany. This was leading to a 'serious situation' for growth prospects across mainland Europe. In a robust rebuttal of speculation that he might lose his job in a cabinet reshuffle after this month's UK budget, Mr Lamont said he was looking forward to being in the British delegation at the annual world economic summit in Tokyo in July. 'See you there,' he told reporters. Asked about the high level of German interest rates, the chancellor said: 'When the Germans feel able to reduce their interest rates this will bring considerable benefits (to the rest of Europe).' But he said the G7 meeting had not discussed the timing of any such move. Hinting that he might decide in the March 16 budget to put up taxes to reduce the growing public-sector deficit, Mr Lamont said that, at the end of the day, governments had to decide on economic policies with regard to their long-term fiscal positions. That was even though the gap between state spending and revenues tended naturally to rise during recessions, such as the one Britain has suffered since about mid-1990. Mr Lamont indicated he was cautiously optimistic about the possibility of a UK recovery, noting rising retail sales volumes and the latest modestly bullish survey of output expectations among manufacturers published last week by the Confederation of British Industry. He said that, on current economic evidence, UK bank base rates at 6 per cent were 'at the appropriate level' after cuts of 4 percentage points since September. Although he was concerned at the high level of UK unemployment, which in January pushed through 3m for the first time in six years, loss of jobs in Britain 'could not be isolated' from similar trends in other developed countries. The 'only answer' to high unemployment was to 'get back on track' for steady non-inflationary growth. 'There are no easy solutions; if there were we would be implementing them already.'</p>

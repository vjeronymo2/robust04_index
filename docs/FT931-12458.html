			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Arts: Rheingold in Chicago - Opera Planned as the start of a new Ring, this Das Rheingold at the Lyric Theatre, Chicago has its definitive moment in the second scene, at the point where the assembled gods are wondering quite what to do. As in the opera at this juncture, a lot of diverse forces have been brought together - in the cast, in the orchestra, in the design elements - but the spirit of fire has yet to arrive. Zubin Mehta conducts an extraordinarily thin-textured performance, one which, in its disconcerting starts and stops, suggests old-fashioned accompanied recitative and which never lifts to embody or empower the music. August Everding, the producer, opts for an easy literalism and easy sterotypes (the interpretation of Fricka as a wheedling mumsy is grotesque). John Conklin's design ideas are borrowed from hither and yon, and just dumped on to the stage. The collage quality of the production is revealed at once, in the imagery displayed during the orchestral prelude: first a huge projection of a faintly pre-Columbian mask with a broken nose (only at the other end of the opera does the apparition of Erda finally suggests this is her signature), then the three norns spinning a rope of blue light, then the Rhine (a water photograph at the back of the black, grille-sided box in which everything takes place) and her maidens. These last are doubled - and this is the production's one thrill - by three flying acrobats in elasticated harnesses, using the great height of the Chicago stage opening to dart and bounce and flutter with marvellous agility. Even this display, though, is not as magical as it might have been without the ineffective efforts to disguise the machinery, and there is a similar not-quite-achieved feel to other aspects of the staging. For no very good reason, the scenes in the gods' world incorporate a Japanese-style low rectangular enclosure painted in cinnabar red. The giants are shadowed by immense framework puppets, which soon lose their surprise and begin to look merely redundant. And the costumes are all over the place: long black robes and purple sashes to make the giants look like a couple of monsignors, a Fricka done up in decadent splendour as cousin to Herodias, and Froh and Donner in bikers' leathers. The production's virtues have to be sought among the cast, where strengths abound. The presence of so many international names - James Morris as Wotan, Ekkehard Wlaschiha as Alberich, Matthias Holle as Fasolt - looks like cheque-book casting, but it has impressive results. Mr Morris comes to Chicago having sung his role everywhere from San Francisco to Covent Garden, and on two recordings, but he still sounds fastened to and driven by the urgency of Wotan's dilemma: with no hint of any discomfort through a hefty stretch of impressively hefty singing, he can afford to colour the occasional attack with a grating strength, and, if anything, he sounds more purposeful than he has before. Mr Wlaschiha's severe, black voice and presence cannot reach to the lubricity of the opening scene, but thereafter this is a stark portrayal. And Mr Holle produces sound and phrasing of a ravishing quality to suggest in Fasolt the pride and perfection of the humble. Equally admirable are some of the younger singers. Dennis Petersen brings a sudden burst of life to the stage in his appearance as Mime: his singing is quick and sure, and neatly characterised without being turned into a croak, while in his acting he leaps out from the slough of the production. Nancy Maultsby is splendidly sure and strong all the way down to Erda's depths; Mark Baker is a lustrous Froh; and Bryn Terfel, no less, brings his musicality, burly eagerness and confident vocal force to the part of Donner, which seems far too small a space for a singer of his distinction to be crammed into. The opera is always waiting to be stolen by Loge, and this muddled production puts nothing, dramatically, in his way. Barry McCauley sings the part with a Heldentenorish resolution and, though his acting tends to be careful, easily has the last laugh as the gods climb into Valhalla through the production's heavy-handed image - red poles emerging through the gold stairway - of blood to come.</p>

He added that the group included several suspects who had  been on the run and others who had been convicted in connection  with numerous terrorist cases in Upper Egypt. He said that in  yesterday's incident no escapes occurred.    The interior minister explained that information was  received  that a group of fugitive terrorists were staying in a hideout in  al- Zawiyah al-Hamra' and that after obtaining permission from  the Prosecutor's Office, the hideout was stormed. He added that  the terrorists opened fire on the security forces, who returned  the fire. He said that a detailed statement will be issued  later today naming the suspects and the details of the incident.    Al-Alfi continued that a quantity of bombs, ammunition,  explosives, and weapons that the terrorists had been using in  their operations were discovered in the hideout. He pointed out  that the security forces found large sums of money with the  seven terrorists who were killed, proving that they were hired  agents paid for their acts, which he termed cowardly and vile.    The interior minister said that the police will not rest as  long as one terrorist remains at large in Egypt but will pursue  and arrest him.    The interior minister reaffirmed that the police have the  initiative now and are conducting campaigns of arrests and  surveillance against terrorists and all those linked to violent  and terrorist crimes. He explained that the police are using  scientific methods and careful planning that are based on full  information.

Hasan al-Alfi, who was speaking after inspecting an  exhibition of stolen goods organized by the Cairo Security  Directorate, concluded his remarks by saying that public  security is one integral whole and that it operates concurrently  on security, economic, criminal, and social levels. He  explained that the police are making great efforts in all these  fields based on the concept that their work is a vocation and  not a mere job.

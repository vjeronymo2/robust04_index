			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC investigation and subsequent inspections revealed several violations. Enforcement action was taken by the NRC against Atom Mechanical for violation of part 21 requirements, and against St. Mary's Hospital and Picker International for violations of part 35 and part 30 requirements, respectively. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Moreover, the State of Maryland determined from its own investigation that the incident at Anderson Memorial Hospital resulted from a failure of the part, i.e., breakage of the return spring. No enforcement action was taken by the State of Maryland.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, Atom Mechanical Company was found to be in violation of 10 CFR 21.21 (October 16, 1989), St. Mary Medical Center was found to be in violation of 10 CFR 35.59(g), 10 CFR 35.605, 10 CFR 35.630(a), 10 CFR 35.615(d)(4), 10 CFR 35.632(a), and 10 CFR 35.634(a) (October 17 and 26, 1989), and Picker International, Inc. was found to be in violation of 10 CFR 30.3 (subsequent to inspections that occurred on October 26 and November 9, 1989). Inspection reports are available for review in the NRC Public document room.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under current NRC regulations, persons authorized under a specific license to use devices containing byproduct material (e.g., use of teletherapy equipment under a part 35 specific license) ultimately are responsible for the safe use of these devices, and for assuring that such devices are properly maintained. Suppliers of sources or devices containing byproduct material, whether they are an original manufacturer or a manufacturer of replacement sources or devices, must be licensed under parts 30 or 32 or an appropriate Agreement State license, and also have responsibility for the safety of the sources or devices that they supply or replace. Service or repair, which would include the replacement of parts or components of medical or industrial sources or devices that present a risk of radiation exposure from the failure of certain parts, such as the teletherapy devices discussed as examples in this petition, may be performed only by qualified persons authorized under an NRC or Agreement State license (cf. &sect;&sect;35.605, and 39.43(e)). Some generally licensed devices may be serviced by general licensees who are authorized to perform limited service work if sufficient information about the service work (e.g., procedures, training, expected dose, etc.) is submitted by manufacturer or initial distributor and accepted by the NRC. However, these devices typically are not mechanically complex and do not present the same risk of significant radiation exposure. Moreover, the NRC has no record of failure of these devices leading to a radiation exposure attributable to defective replacement parts or improper servicing. Finally, under the provisions of part 21, the supplier of any basic component, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  whether or not a licensee of NRC or an Agreement State, is also responsible for the quality of the component, whether it is original or replacement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A ``basic component'' is defined in part 21 as one, ``*&blank;*&blank;* in which a defect could create a substantial safety hazard.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Reasons for Denial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has examined the petition (1) in light of its regulations and policies for both general and specific licensees, and (2) in view of the cases cited by the petitioner in support of the petition. The NRC is denying the petition because current regulations apply equally to manufacturers and suppliers of both original and replacement parts, ensuring the integrity of these parts; therefore, no additional requirements addressing the regulation of manufacturers and suppliers of replacement parts are necessary. Further, current regulations address service and maintenance of sources and devices possessed and used under an NRC license, including replacement parts, whether manufactured or supplied by the original manufacturer or supplier or some other manufacturer or supplier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the petition for rulemaking is denied. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 28th day of March, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James M.

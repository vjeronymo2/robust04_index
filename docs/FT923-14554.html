			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / BT bars many redundancy applicants: Voluntary package oversubscribed Unions say workforce is further demoralised THOUSANDS of British Telecom-munications employees who want to leave their jobs as part of a voluntary redundancy programme are being told they will have to stay. Unions say the move has provoked fury among BT's employees and has further demoralised an already insecure workforce. BT is spending more than Pounds 1bn on Release 92, its scheme to shed 24,000 employees this year from a workforce of 200,000. However, terms are so attractive and, the unions claim, morale so low that the redundancy scheme is heavily oversubscribed. BT intended to cut 8,000 engineering jobs but 17,000 engineering staff want to take voluntary redundancy. A total of 7,000 clerical workers want to leave compared with a target figure of 2,000. Half the total workforce initially expressed an interest in receiving more information. The deadline for final acceptance under the scheme is the end of next week. The National Communications Union, the main BT union, says some members have already bought small businesses, put their homes on the market or made plans to emigrate on the strength of indications from management that attractive redundancy terms would be available. Under Release 92 payments could be as high as Pounds 100,000 plus pension entitlement, although the average sum is likely to be about Pounds 30,000. Training vouchers worth Pounds 1,000 and at least three months' guaranteed work through an employment agency are also on offer. Because of the demand BT is introducing criteria for redundancy selection. Those who have gained high marks in performance appraisals will not normally be eligible for the scheme, and those with long service will also go to the bottom of the list because of the high costs of paying them off. Mr Bill McClory, NCU assistant secretary, said it was clearly prejudicial to his members' interests to be good at their jobs. The Union of Communication Workers, whose members in the operator service at telephone exchanges are threatened by future job cuts, added that there had been a high level of interest from operators. BT said yesterday it had made clear from the outset that management 'would ultimately have to decide whether or not it could allow an applicant to go. People should not have made any firm plans for their future until they had received confirmation that they could go, been given a confirmation of their entitlements and made a formal decision to accept the offer.' It added that further job reductions were likely, although no specific posts had been identified. The terms of Release 92 were unlikely to be repeated under any future redundancy scheme, said BT.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The seven individuals captured by Interpol in Guayas  with a half-ton shipment of cocaine are incarcerated, and are  being subjected to intense questioning at the offices of the  Second Guayas Regiment. They may possibly be introduced to the  public today.    This disclosure was made by Lieutenant Colonel Abraham  Correa  L., chief of that police office, who stated categorically that  none of those under arrest had been tortured or mistreated, as  persons interested in procuring the captives' release are  apparently attempting to claim.  <H5>  Legal Arrests </H5>   Correa declared that "Operation Nortenito" was the result of  many investigations conducted by agents from this office for  nearly four months. They began bringing results last Sunday,  when several members of this drug trafficking organization were  caught "red-handed." They had concealed the drugs inside a truck  parked in a garage at the La Atarazana housing complex.    The Interpol chief remarked: "With the police intelligence  data, the police superintendent in charge, Manuel Velez, was  asked to issue the pertinent search and arrest warrants for the  suspects, to prevent their possible release later on grounds  that the proper legal procedures were not followed."    Abraham Correa also confirmed the fact that those in custody  had not been mistreated. He said that, on the contrary, they are  being visited regularly by members of the Guayas Red Cross, who  are responsible for examining them and determining that they are  in good condition.    He added that this type of procedure had been carried out in  previous operations, in which members of the Human Rights  Commission also verified that torture was not used to obtain  information from the accused.  <H5>  Operation Continuing </H5>   He also remarked that "Operation Nortenito" is continuing,  noting that they are now on the trail of the Colombians,  Alejandro Castano Garcia and Agustin Rodriguez Garcia, as well  as other persons of different nationalities involved in the drug  traffic and who are currently fugitives at large.    The seven subjects under arrest are seriously implicated in  the possession of 540 kg of cocaine hydrochloride, the  international market value of which exceeds $10 million.    According to the Interpol investigations, the drugs were to  be shipped through this city's seaport to Miami, camouflaged  among Colombian products such as cookies, candy, and instant  coffee.</p>

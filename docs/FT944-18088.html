			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / United in wishful thinking: The Northern Irish seem fairly optimistic - but disappointments may lie ahead As you leave the Bogside (or 'Free Derry') and drive towards the centre of the city, which road signs elsewhere in Northern Ireland still call Londonderry, a striking mural confronts you. It shows a back view of British soldiers walking into the distance, past a signpost clearly marked 'London'. Seventy odd miles away is another mural, painted on the side of a house facing into the Shankill Road, a long finger of militant Protestantism thrust defiantly into Catholic west Belfast. It is literary rather than pictorial: '1969 IRA ran away. 1994 IRA surrendered.' So both sides have won. Or think they have. Or want you to think they have. Or are trying to convince themselves that they have. Or perhaps a mixture of all of the above. If there is one common feature which just now seems to unite almost all factions in both parts of Ireland, it is wishful thinking. Almost but not quite all factions - at least not if Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien, the former UN envoy and Irish cabinet minister, can be considered a faction. He greeted the IRA ceasefire on August 31 with a series of dire predictions in British newspapers, culminating in a chronology of disasters that included half a million refugees and 10,000 fatal casualties in a civil war ending 'in stalemate with a smaller but entirely Protestant Northern Ireland'; a military coup in Dublin; and explosions in several British cities - all by the end of 1995. I could not find anyone in Belfast or Dublin last week who would admit to believing in the whole of this scenario, but several people asked me what I thought of it, as though anxious to be reassured. In my turn I asked Mr John Bruton, leader of the main opposition party in Dublin, Fine Gael, what he thought. The nightmare was possible, he replied; but 'on average you don't have a nightmare every night. The likelihood is that it won't occur. The role of people like Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien is to prove themselves wrong by warning in time of the danger.' Many of the Northern Irish Protestants I met admitted to being more optimistic now than when the ceasefire was announced. The suspicion of a secret deal between the IRA and the British government has largely faded. Indeed, many express a degree of confidence in the British prime minister seldom heard on the mainland. His pledge of a referendum on any new arrangement for Northern Ireland is welcomed by unionists and generally believed. Even his rough treatment of the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, seems to have paid off: several Protestants expressed embarrassment about Mr Paisley's behaviour, while the only person who criticised Mr John Major's reaction was a southern Irish diplomat. There could, however, be a psychological explanation for this unexpected surge of unionist confidence in the British government. As Professor Paul Bew, a political scientist at Queen's University, pointed out: 'It's very uncomfortable for unionists to believe in a sell-out, because if you really did believe that you'd have to prepare for a very unpleasant conflict.' The fact is that IRA violence against British and Protestant targets has completely ceased since August 31, and that that is a great relief to the people. Mentally they remain on their guard, but emotionally they cannot help relaxing a bit. Obviously it is nicer to think this relaxation has a good chance of becoming permanent than to prepare for a reversion to violence and insecurity in weeks or months. The only thing unionists have ever had to hope for, all through the long years of violence, is that one day the IRA would realise the futility of the 'armed struggle'. Once they begin to think that that day might have arrived, the attraction of the thought becomes irresistible. But of course the thought has to be rationalised. Evidence of some sort has to be found. It is found, paradoxically, in the very success and publicity which the IRA's switch to a 'peace strategy' has enjoyed. Particularly for the Sinn Fein leaders, this conversion is seen as having produced such dividends in the shape of applause and respectability on both sides of the Atlantic that it seems hardly conceivable they would sacrifice it all by switching back to violence. I found many people disposed to take Mr Gerry Adams's statement to the Boston Herald last week at face value, when he said no one could guarantee 'two or three years up the road that if the causes of conflict aren't resolved another IRA leadership won't come along'. In other words, people accept that Mr Adams and his colleague, Mr Martin McGuinness, are now personally identified with the new strategy to the point where, for them at least, there is no going back. It was to see Mr McGuinness that I went to 'Free Derry'. Needless to say, he does not think the IRA has surrendered. Republicans, he said, were now 'totally and absolutely committed to the peace process', but their decision, which had 'totally transformed the situation on this island', was 'taken from a position of considerable strength'. Was there a danger that the 'peace process' could fail, I asked. Yes, he said. 'In Ireland there is danger all the time. But I am not in any way at all looking at this from a pessimistic point of view. We have a very real opportunity to resolve this conflict.' Permanent? 'Nothing in life is permanent,' said Mr McGuinness. It was all up to the British government. 'Since August 31 they have removed the broadcasting ban and reopened a handful of cross-border roads, while keeping the vast majority closed. Most people regard that as a measly response. There is a very real danger of the momentum being lost.' I asked what kind of solution to the conflict he envisaged. 'No party will go on record on its bottom line before a negotiation,' he replied. 'Of course our preferred solution is a unitary state, a united Ireland. Other parties to the negotiations will have a different view. But the key thing is acceptance by the British government that at some time in the future Britain will end its jurisdiction, even if that is some way down the road. When the British government accepts that inevitability, it will be a matter for all the Irish parties to work out the structures.' Slightly twisting the words of the Downing Street Declaration, Mr McGuinness claimed that document already contained 'a clear acceptance by the British government that the solution has to be an island-of-Ireland solution'. Britain, he said, had undertaken to 'facilitate' such a solution, but the onus was on it to go one step further and 'persuade' the unionists. 'Once the unionists accept that the British government is involved in a process of disengagement, it becomes a matter for the people of Ireland. Psychologically, once the British government makes it clear to the unionists, you're talking about a very fertile field.' The 'worst scenario', he conceded, 'would be that elements of unionism would try to rebel. In that case the British government should have the will to confront people who disrupt the process.' He brushed aside my suggestion that, having once agreed to withdraw, Britain would be more likely to get on and do so, leaving the Irish of all persuasions to fight it out. When I said that in the same declaration, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, had agreed to give the majority in Northern Ireland the final say on sovereignty, Mr McGuinness replied: 'We would totally disagree with that.' Why, he asked, should 900,000 unionists have the right to overrule 600,000 nationalists in Northern Ireland, when 'on the island there are 3 1/2 m other people with a keen interest', not to mention 'many millions' in Britain itself who, he claimed, 'believe the British government should disengage'. 'It's not fair,' he concluded, 'to give the destiny of Ireland solely over to those 900,000 people, as opposed to the feelings and wishes of all the others.' Nor would he accept that in a united Ireland the northern Protestants would form a minority at least as disgruntled as the northern Catholics now are in the UK. 'Nothing could be further from the truth. Many political parties in the 26 counties (ie the south) are not too far distant from them: the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael, the Democratic left.' Together with these allies, he suggested, the unionists might well form a government 'in a totally new Ireland'. He did not seem to realise that, if some unionists do regard the southern parties he named as allies, it is because those parties accept, more clearly and less equivocally than the Irish government, that Northern Irish Protestants have a distinct culture and history, and have the right to remain in the UK. But what, I asked, if Britain and the unionists are not so obliging? How long would the IRA tolerate a deadlock? 'I can't speak for them,' said Mr McGuinness coyly. 'But Sinn Fein is committed to the peace process. We shall be very disappointed if the British government doesn't speak with Sinn Fein very soon. The talks need to begin now.' On its side, the government's position is that 'exploratory' talks will be held within three months, after it has sufficient indications that the IRA intends the ceasefire to be permanent, and there has been 'a period of verification'. My impression is that the period of verification has already begun, and that the government is waiting less for a specific form of words from the IRA than for a feeling that unionist opinion is ready. Britain is certainly bothered, as is Mr Bruton in Dublin, by the fact that the IRA does not regard the 'cessation of violence' as affecting the methods it uses to enforce order within its own constituency. The only change is that the presumed delinquents' legs and arms are now broken with iron bars instead of their knee caps being shattered by a gunshot. These 'punishment beatings' are apparently popular in areas where the Royal Ulster Constabulary makes few attempts to deal with common law crime. But, as Mr Bruton said, 'an organisation that has to maintain that sort of intimidation in its own area cannot be said to be fully committed to democratic politics'. He professed to hope that his own government 'will put sufficient pressure on Sinn Fein to remedy those situations' - which sounds like more wishful thinking. Another area of uncertainty is the future of loyalist violence. Everyone tells you, including their quasi-official spokesman, Mr David Ervine, that the loyalists are 'close' to deciding on a ceasefire. But Mr Ervine added that they were held back by a 'lingering fear' that the Framework Document for new inter-party talks, on which London and Dublin are working, would contain 'something fearful for unionists' - meaning something that opens the way to Northern Ireland's detachment from the UK and its creeping annexation by Dublin. Mainstream unionists seem more confident that this will not be the case, pointing to the delay in producing the document (now expected in November) as evidence that London is resisting pressure from Dublin. The one thing that is certain is that no one in Northern Ireland will welcome the Framework Document when (or if) it does appear. It is bound to attract unionist suspicion, while falling short of even moderate nationalist hopes, let alone those expressed by Mr McGuinness. Moreover, as a spokesman for Mr John Hume's nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party candidly said, 'anybody welcoming it would be mad', since they would thereby give the other side a reason to reject it. Such is the nature of Northern Irish politics, which the non-violent parties and the British well understand. But the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries have their own way of registering disappointment when something falls short of their expectations. The Framework Document will surely disappoint one of them, and probably both. At that point, some of Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien's nightmares may start coming true.</p>

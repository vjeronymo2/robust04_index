The large decline in our country's oil revenues will make it  very difficult to balance the 1994 budget.    Mr. Redha Malek's government is experiencing huge  difficulties in balancing the 1993 budget, as his predecessor's  optimistic forecasts ($20 per barrel) prove quite unrealistic.    In the past few days, prices fell further on the London and  New York markets. All the efforts of OPEC member countries were  of no avail. The announcements by the Sultanate of Oman and by  Egypt that they would decrease their production by 5-10 percent  had no effect on the market.

In London, the Brent dropped somewhat more, closing at  $13.56.    This price drop does not seem to worry too much the OPEC  chairman, Qatari 'Abdallah Bin-Hamad al-'Attiyah, who believes  that it was not urgent to hold an extraordinary meeting before  25 March 1994, when the next OPEC meeting will take place.    Decidedly, Mr. Redha Malek's fears are not about to be  dissipated. His revenue forecasts, amounting to $8 million to  $8.5 million, may well fail to materialize if the price drop is  not stopped within the shortest possible time.    Another bad year in prospect for Algeria, unless....</p>

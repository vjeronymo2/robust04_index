			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Commercial property funding falls sharply The amount of new money flowing into the commercial property industry has fallen significantly since last year, Savills, a leading firm of surveyors, has calculated. In the first four months of 1994 a total of Pounds 1.4bn was raised through loans, bonds and rights issues, Savills says. That is in line with the amount of new finance raised in 1990 and 1991, but well down on 1993 when a total of Pounds 5.7bn was raised in the year. The decline in property share values this year has reduced the attraction of raising money through rights issues. In the first four months of the year a total of Pounds 414m was generated by rights issues compared with Pounds 2.4bn last year. Bank lending to the property sector has continued to fall from its peak of Pounds 40.6bn in May 1991. In the first three months of this year, it fell from Pounds 34.2bn to Pounds 33.6bn. The office market in most of the south-east's main office centres is likely to undergo a pronounced recovery this year, according to research by chartered surveyors Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. Property development, which has been almost non-existent for the past two to three years, will increase sharply on the back of increased demand, a shortage of good-quality property and selective support from investors,it says. It estimates that the take-up of new space in the offices centres surrounding the M25 motorway will return to pre-recession levels of about 3m sq ft this year.</p>

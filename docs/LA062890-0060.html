			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> EVERYONE WINS AT THE JIM HALL INVITATIONAL  </P> <P> This is the time for that annual nine-day wonder known as the JVC Jazz  Festival. It is a time when critics moan about the use of non-jazz acts while  producer George Wein groans about the shortage of young musicians and the  difficulty of attracting audiences. It is also a time when the public proves  them all wrong, by crowding into concert halls to salute artists of all ages.  Nowhere was this more evident than at the Jim Hall Invitational Tuesday at Town  Hall.  </P> <P> Hall, 59, has long been respected for his guitar mastery and lack of  exhibitionism. The host, Pat Metheny, observed that Hall's influence has  extended even to those who have gone on to develop radically different styles.  </P> <P> The evening presented him in a dozen settings, from impeccably executed duos  (with bassist Ron Carter, saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and valve trombonist Bob  Brookmeyer) to a semi-classical ensemble that included a string quartet. His  assurance that he had a "non-proliferation" treaty with the other guitarist, to  avoid excessive volume, was faithfully remembered by all hands.  </P> <P> Hall ventured from shallow waters (a cheerful ukulele-like strumming on "St.  Thomas" with Ron Carter) to deep experimentation, in an acerbic and atonal  work, untitled, written 35 years ago when he was a student. The latter was one  of three numbers with the Classical Heritage string ensemble, which also  performed a rather turgid piece, "Abstract and Dreams," with composer Don  Thompson at the piano, as well as a fascinating item called "Laura's Dream"  that teamed Hall with the four mallets of vibist Gary Burton.  </P> <P> Written by Argentina's Astor Piazzola, this was the climactic closer of the  first half.  </P> <P> Later, Hall worked mainly in tandem with other guitarists, two of whom spurred  him on to some of his most creative moments. John Scofield, in a 180-degree  switch from funk back to jazz, drew spirited and aggressive mainstream sounds  from a solid-body guitar and had Hall responding in time. On a more restrained  level, Pat Metheny proved to be a soulmate for Hall as he brought a keening,  mournful air to the Brazilian standard "How Insensitive" before the pair burst  into a hard-driving series of exchanges.  </P> <P> Hall's regular quartet was weakened by the unswinging piano of Gil Goldstein  and the mood-shattering drum interlude by Terry Clarke. He seemed more at home  trading choruses with his promising 20-year-old guitar student, Peter  Bernstein.  </P> <P> For his finale, Hall fielded a 10-man band that included guitarists Bernstein,  John Abercrombie, Mick Goodrick (playing a headless and almost bodyless guitar)  and Scofield. To his credit, instead of jamming on a conventional blues they  played a Hall composition, "Careful." The title seemed especially fitting for  an evening that had clearly been planned with loving care.  </P></p>

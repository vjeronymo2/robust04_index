			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Superstate 'nightmare'troubles Hurd Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, yesterday criticised what he called the 'nightmare' scenario of a European superstate, and declared he was confident that the 'centralising tendency' in Europe was at an end, writes Gillian Tett. Speaking in Bologna, Italy, in his first big speech on Europe since the German constitutional court ratified the Maastricht treaty last month, Mr Hurd insisted that the principle of subsidiarity should now be the touchstone for the European Union. 'Subsidiarity is not only about rolling back the frontiers of the Community, where these have advanced beyond common sense; it also means moving forward with a lightness of touch,' Mr Hurd said.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW YEAR'S BIRTH  </P> <P> Regarding Jim Carlton's article, "Pastor Lashes Out at Media" (Jan. 5), I was  very disappointed in Pastor Ralph Wilkerson's and Dr. Charles Wesley Turner  Jr.'s failure to recognize the legitimate grievances expressed by the media  concerning their actions.  </P> <P> It's bad enough to make a public media and congregational spectacle out of one  of God's greatest miracles -- the birth of a baby.  </P> <P> But to threaten the health of the child, and then deny the planning or the  threat, is inexcusable.  </P> <P> To blatantly deny that it was so planned many months ago, as the quotations The  Times' articles clearly indicate, shows a very serious failing. Wilkerson is  quoted as saying, "There was absolutely no danger to the baby, and I don't care  what anybody says." Does Wilkerson really believe that his position as a pastor  also makes him a medical expert?  </P> <P> IRVING E. FRIEDMAN  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

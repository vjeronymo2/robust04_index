			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Sport: Britain's men shine in the sun - A better showing by the hosts at Wimbeldon / Tennis or the mysterious lack of it - and Steffi Graf's security problems seemed to dominate the headlines during a busy and wonderfully sunny first week at Wimbledon where the British men at last distinguished themselves. Inspired perhaps by Jeremy Bates' progress to the fourth round last year, Andrew Foster has reached the same stage this time. This afternoon Chris Wilkinson opens the Centre Court programme in a third round match against the two-time former champion and No 2 seed, Stefan Edberg. In mid-week, Mark Petchey and Chris Bailey also covered themselves in glory while failing heroically against two of the higher ranked men. Foster, a lanky 21-year-old who has benefitted from the new Lawn Tennis Association coaching structure, first beat Thomas Enqvist of Sweden, the 1991 Wimbledon junior champion, in five sets. That was an impressive performance for a man ranked 329 in the world who had recently changed his double-handed backhand for a single-handed stroke. Then Foster scored a straight sets win over Mexico's Luis Herrera who last year had ended the distinguished career of Jimmy Connors on his way to the third round. 'That's probably as well as I've ever played. It's certainly the best I've ever concentrated' said Foster afterwards. Yesterday Foster was lucky when Andrei Olhovskiy, the Russian, who had surprised top seeded Jim Courier last year, retired complaining of dizziness and sickness with Foster leading 6-3 6-5. Next on Foster's menu is top seed and world No 1, Pete Sampras. That should be a tasty dish for one with nothing to lose  - but do not expect miracles. Southampton-born Wilkinson made the most of a fortunate draw and an affinity with grass to beat first Argentina's Daniel Orsanic, who was bred on clay, and then the qualifier from Canada, Sebastien Lareau. Ranked 187 in the world, 42 places below Wilkinson. Lareau lists Robert Ludlum as one of his favourite authors. So uncomfortable did he look while losing in straight sets on an alien surface that he would doubtless have preferred to be on the Road to Gandolfo for an Osterman Weekend] Wilkinson continued his winning ways in doubles. With Paul Hand he beat the American Jensen brothers, Luke and Murphy, who two weeks ago had become the French Open doubles champions. Then, with Clare Wood, he beat Byron Talbot and Andrea Tamesvari in the first round of the mixed. Wilkinson is undaunted by the prospect of facing Edberg this afternoon. 'I'm playing well enough to beat anyone' he said confidently. Eyebrows were raised when he added 'I'm only thinking about winning the tournament.' Petchey and Bailey can count themselves unlucky not to have joined Foster and Wilkinson in the third round. Both competed with courage to create winning chances that slipped through their fingers. Petchey, who lives in Loughton, was cheered by an army of supporters from Essex on Court 13 on Thursday as he raised hopes of a first big upset. With some aggressive serve-and-volley play, Petchey built a two sets to one lead against Jakob Hlasek, who not so long ago had been ranked No 7 in the world. In spite of holding a match point at 6-5 in the final set the 223 ranked Petchey eventually went down 7-6 4-6 6-7 6-2 10-8. The real drama came late in the day on the Centre Court. Bailey, a 6 ft 5 in giant, faced the No 5 seed Ivanisevic who had come within two points of winning last year's Wimbledon final against Agassi. On the face of it the 25-year-old Briton had little chance against the fastest server in tennis who last year delivered 206 aces during his seven matches on the Wimbledon lawns. Only four years ago Bailey's career had been threatened when he had snapped the anterior cruciate ligament in one of his knees. It cost him two years. Yet after two operations and months of physical rehabilitation here he was playing on the Centre Court for the first time. Such was Bailey's athletic commitment and skill in the forecourt - particularly on the first volley  - that the Norfolk man had Ivanisevic in despair. To the delight of the shamelessly supportive Centre Court crowd Bailey took a two sets to one lead and was ahead 2-0 and 30-0 in the fourth. In allowing Ivanisevic to escape with that set Bailey showed his relative lack of experience. The final set boiled to a thrilling climax as Bailey, refusing to be intimidated by some fierce left-handed serves and flashing passes down the lines, forced his way to match point on the Ivanisevic serve at 6-5. Ivanisevic unleashed a huge second serve that struck the net and bounced in. A let. On the replay Ivanisevic hit an even faster one down the middle line  - his 32nd ace. It was the act of a desperate man and, for Bailey, a cruel blow. Ivanisevic went on to break Bailey and then served out the match with supreme confidence, ending it with his 34th ace. The 5-7 7-6 6-7 6-4 9-7 victory had taken 3 hours and 35 minutes and the Centre Court clock stood at 8.40pm. As the two men left in the gathering darkness they were given a standing ovation. British tennis should thank Billy Knight. Three years ago, this former British No 1, always a gritty fighter, was persuaded by LTA training chief, Richard Lewis, to work with the younger men alongside his old doubles partner, Tony Pickard, who had become the Davis Cup captain. Knight's unquenchable spirit is beginning to filter through. Britain's present players are starting to believe they can be as good as the rest of the world. For Bailey, Foster, Wilkinson and Petchey that is a welcome discovery. Now the hard work begins in translating this advance into results on the ATP Tour. I hope these four, and the younger men behind them like James Baily, Tim Henman and Jamie Delgardo, are ready to accept the challenge.</p>

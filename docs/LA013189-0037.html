			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> James S. Brady, who remained on the government payroll as Ronald Reagan's press  secretary for nearly eight years after being severely wounded in an  assassination attempt, is retiring. White House Press Secretary Marlin  Fitzwater said this week that President Bush talked with Brady's wife, Sarah,  about the former press secretary's retirement plans before his inauguration.  Brady, 48, who has held a variety of government jobs since coming to Washington  in 1968 as a communications consultant to the House, is entitled to a  government pension. He was shot in the head March 30, 1981, during an attempt  on Reagan's life, and uses a wheelchair.  </P></p>

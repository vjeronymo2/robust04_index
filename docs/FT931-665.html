			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Top trading nations suffer current account imbalances THE CURRENT account imbalances of four of the world's five leading trading powers widened in 1992, Gatt said. When trade in both goods and services is taken into account, France was alone among the top five traders in moving into virtual balance on its current account. Japan's current account surplus widened from Dollars 73bn to a record Dollars 118bn (Pounds 79.1bn) as recession cut imports. In contrast, the US current account deficit leaped from a negligible Dollars 4bn in 1991 to Dollars 62bn as economic recovery sucked in imports. Germany's current account deficit rose from Dollars 20bn to Dollars 25bn in spite of slowing import growth, as recession began to bite in the second half of 1992. This was because of a higher deficit in trade in commercial services, and a falling surplus on investment income. In the UK, beginnings of economic recovery saw a strong import surge boosting the current account deficit from Dollars 11.4bn in 1991 to Dollars 21bn last year. Criticising the 'popular press', and implicitly the US administration, for focusing political attention on widening merchandise trade gaps, Gatt said 'this is clearly inappropriate because trade in services is an important and growing part of countries' trade.' Despite the numerical widening of imbalances, Gatt noted that growth in these economies through the 1980s had meant that the current account deficits were smaller relative to GDP 'than in most other years since the early 1980s'. Even in Japan, the surplus was lower last year in relation to the size of its economy than between 1985 and 1987. Germany and the UK show the most worrisome trends, the UK slipping from a position in 1982 where it had the highest current account surplus of all five traders in terms of GDP to a position last year where it had the highest deficit, at 2 per cent of GDP.</p>

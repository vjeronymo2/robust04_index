			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Airbus clinches Dollars 1.8bn US order Airbus Industrie, the European aerospace consortium, has won orders and options for 40 aircraft worth an estimated Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.15bn) from International Lease Finance Corporation, the California-based aircraft leasing group. The order, announced yesterday, is the biggest received by Airbus this year, and reflects the improvement in the international aircraft market after the sharp recession of the past few years. An official at the four-nation Airbus consortium said: 'It confirms that things are looking up, although there is still some way to go.' The deal caps a much better year for Airbus in its fiercely competitive  - and often acrimonious - battle with Boeing of the US for airline orders. Before yesterday's announcement, Airbus had received more than 80 orders for its airliners this year, compared with 38 in 1993. The two aircraft manufacturers have always disputed market share figures. But industry observers said they were running neck and neck in the number of firm orders this year, demonstrating the inroads that Airbus has made on Boeing's traditional dominance in the sector. Boeing has won 111 orders this year, including seven for Air Berlin, the German charter operator, and one for Lufthansa, announced just before Christmas. ILFC is ordering 30 aircraft and taking an option for a further 10. The firm orders include eight A319s, 13 A320s and nine A321s. The options comprise three A319s, three A321s and four A320s. All the aircraft have single aisles and are generally used for short and medium-haul flights. Deliveries will run from February 1996 until the year 2000. Mr Jean Pierson, managing director of Airbus, said the deal reflected the confidence of ILFC in the single-aisle aircraft produced by the European consortium. ILFC, part of American International Group, the US insurance and financial services group, is the world's largest aircraft leasing company after GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing company rescued from collapse last year. ILFC is the single largest customer of Airbus, which groups Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain. It has 115 Airbus aircraft on order, while 40 others have already been delivered. But in recent years ILFC has also ordered about 300 Boeing aircraft, of which about 180 are still to be delivered. No ILFC officials were available for comment yesterday, but it is believed within the industry that ILFC may be placing another big order with Boeing soon. ATR, a joint venture between Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, is to sell five turboprop aircraft, worth an estimated total of Dollars 60m.</p>

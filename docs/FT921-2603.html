			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bancomer offering raises Dollars 837m GRUPO Financiero Bancomer (GFB), the holding company comprising Mexico's second largest bank, has placed Dollars 836.7m of stock in the international markets, in an offering that enables the group to meet the final payment due on the recently-privatised bank. The private placement, arranged in the US, priced each Mexican 'C' and 'B' share at 4,200 pesos (Dollars 1.38), and each American Depositary Share, worth 20 Mexican 'C' shares, at Dollars 27.50. In early trading, the ADS price rose to Dollars 32, reflecting the enthusiasm with which the offering was taken up. GFB had aimed to raise Dollars 500m from the placement, but increased the number of shares available last week due to heavy demand. In the months preceding the placement, GFB sold Dollars 298m of 'C' shares, bringing the proceeds from recent share sales to Dollars 1.13bn. The Mexican government sold 56 per cent of the equity in Bancomer late last year for a sum, including subsequent accrued interest, that has risen to Dollars 2.88bn. Mr Ricardo Guajardo, head of Bancomer, said that Dollars 300m from the placement would be used to meet the final payment of Dollars 1.73bn due on April 6, and the rest to buy up shares in GFB and its subsidiaries. Grupo Financiero Banamex, which contains Mexico's largest bank, is expected to announce soon its international share offering, although for a much smaller sum.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Council tax to rise by only 2.1% on average Council tax will increase by an average of only 2.1 per cent, rather than the government prediction of 7 per cent, when its second year starts at the beginning of next month. The figures, published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, show that Liverpool, where no party has overall control, will have the highest tax. This year's average for properties in band D  - priced between Pounds 68,000 and Pounds 88,000 - will rise 19.5 per cent to Pounds 866.72. This is followed by the Labour-controlled cities of Manchester and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, with Pounds 777.62 and Pounds 725.20. Conservative-controlled Westminster, where councillors were accused this year of gerrymandering, has the lowest tax - Pounds 245 for band D. Councils said the government's new formula for allocating grants to councils had caused most of the differences. Mr Jeremy Beecham, leader of Newcastle, said the figures showed that 'these days, council finances are firmly in the grip of the government'. He said authorities could only pass on the effects of changes in government grants and of the 'capping' criteria, which the environment department can use to force councils to cut budgets. Three Labour councils have set taxes above the limits set for them by the government, and might now be 'capped'. Langbaurgh on Tees in Cleveland is preparing to spend Pounds 17.3m, rather than its 'cap' of Pounds 16.6m next year. Slough in Berkshire left its budget unchanged at Pounds 15.16m, but suffered the biggest cut in standard spending of any council according to Local Government Chronicle - from Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 14.25m. Sheffield set a budget of Pounds 384m, Pounds 6m above its capping limit.</p>

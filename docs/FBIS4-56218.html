			<p>BFN     [Text] At the First International Conference on the  Sustainable Development of Small Insular States, which is being  held in Barbados, a nongovernmental organization proposed that a  declaration against the U.S. blockade on Cuba be included in the  conference's final document. The proposal was made by (Peggy  Antrobus), general coordinator of the Alternative for Women's  Development, who recognized Cuba's strong emphasis on social  development and the prioritization of investments in health  care, education, and social security.    As part of that conference, on 4 June, a minisummit will be  held to create the Association of Caribbean States, which will  encompass not just English-speaking states but the entire  Caribbean community, including Cuba. At that meeting, the heads  of Caribbean states and governments will sign the constitution  that will govern the association, whose goal is the  establishment of a solid development program for the whole  region.    Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas  underscored the current and historical importance of Caribbean  union:    [Begin Burelli recording] Once again the entire Caribbean  community is united in a single body and in a single assembly.  In the last 30 years, despite Cuba's historical and political  weight, those abroad, specifically European countries, have  viewed the Caribbean as exclusively English-speaking countries.  Of course, those countries are very important; but the Caribbean  includes much more than only those countries. The Caribbean has  great importance historically, politically, and strategically.  [end recording]    Foreign Minister Burelli added that the Association of  Caribbean States will have goals identical to those of other  international organizations, such as the Organization of  American States.    [Begin Burelli recording] Except, in this case, the [words  indistinct] is official. It will echo all aspects, languages,  and interests of the Caribbean, which until now have always been  divided.

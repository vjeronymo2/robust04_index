			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- First Deputy Foreign  Minister Alexandr Vondra pointed today to the crucial importance  of Syria, Pakistan and Iran which exceeds the scope of the  region from the power, political and economic points of view.  Vondra, who returned from a twelve-day trip to the three  countries, also pointed to their large markets which make them  attractive for European partners.    Czech politicians and entrepreneurs should pay more  attention  to these countries because privatization has been advancing  there and local economies are adapting themselves to the new  budgetary and taxation policy, Vondra said.    Despite changes in the political climate in the past on both  sides, the long-term traditions of good commercial relations  with these countries have remained. It would be erroneous not  to take this into account and not to strive to maintain and  develop all the good moments in the tradition of mutual  relations, he added.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1989, ONE LINE (OR SO) AT A TIME;  </P> <P> PULITZER: MURRAY'S PRIZE-WINNING WORK OFFERED INSIGHT, HUMOR FROM MIAMI TO  ROCHESTER, N.Y., AND POINTS IN BETWEEN.  </P> <P> Jim Murray, who won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary Thursday, has often said  that his job is to make Los Angeles laugh, and for doing that, he has more than  earned his pay.  </P> <P> But it has not been all yuks and chuckles and shouts of glee. Murray has also  dispensed insight and compassion along the way, while putting the pompous in  their place and the seemingly profound in perspective.  </P> <P> In 1989, the datelines on his columns included the Super Bowl in Miami, the  Kentucky Derby in Louisville, the Indianapolis 500, the U.S. Open golf  tournament in Rochester, N.Y., and the World Series in the earthquake-stricken  San Francisco Bay Area.  </P> <P> In between, he enlightened and delighted readers with, among other offerings,  an open letter to Pete Rose, baseball's 20 greatest moments -- as seen from the  other dugout -- and a comparison of Ram Coach John Robinson's fake field-goal  attempt against the San Francisco 49ers with other notable, ill-fated calls,  such as those by the captain of the Titanic, General Custer, the Charge of the  Light Brigade and Tom Lasorda when he told Tom Niedenfuer to pitch to Jack  Clark.  </P> <P> But the best way to trace Jim Murray's year is in his own words, some of which  are contained in this random sampler extracted from his 1989 columns:  </P> <P> On a recently acquired Kings' hockey player: "I always thought Wayne Gretzky  came with the Stanley Cup attached. He took a bath in it in the off-season.  Used it as a flower pot on the back porch. . . . You look at Gretzky's numbers  and you figure there must be two of him."  </P> <P> On baseball's designated hitter: "I think it's time to come to a uniform  decision on this indelicate matter. I mean, either a team is the home nine or  it's the home 10."  </P> <P> On Sunday Silence: "A horse they thought so little of they did everything but  leave him on a park bench with a note on him won the Kentucky Derby Saturday."  </P> <P> On Magic Johnson: "Giving Magic the basketball is like giving Hitler an army,  Jesse James a gang, or Genghis Khan a horse. Devastation. Havoc. He's one of  the more demoralizing forces in sports. Dempsey with a hook, an Unser with a  car, Henry Aaron on a slow curve. . . . Magic Johnson without a basketball is  an offense against nature."  </P> <P> On a certain blubbery former heavyweight champion making a comeback: "George  Foreman made his fight like a guy waiting for a bus. If it was outdoors,  pigeons would have lit on him. Guys have moved faster in checkout lines at the  market. George may be the Great Fat Hope."  </P> <P> On the state of U.S. tennis: "You know tennis in this country is in scandalous  condition when a couple of guys named Boris and Ivan are playing for our  national open title."  </P> <P> On the Rams: "Ram fans are schooled to fear the worst. They are conditioned to  believe if there are two ways to do a thing, the Rams will pick the one with  the least chance of succeeding."  </P> <P> On former Washington Redskin Dexter Manley: "Spending 16 years in or around  classrooms and coming out unable to read or write is like spending your life in  a cornfield -- and starving to death."  </P> <P> On Orel Hershiser: "His manager likes to call him Bulldog, but if Orel were a  canine, he'd probably be wearing a jeweled collar and a shaved torso. If he was  any paler, he could haunt a house."  </P> <P> On the America's Cup being decided in the courts, an imaginary maritime legal  parallel from the past: "SAN FRANCISCO, 1898 -- The Spanish-American War was  awarded to the King of Spain, and Cuba was ordered returned to him, as the  Appellate Court of California today upheld a lower-court ruling that Admiral  Dewey illegally trapped the Spanish Fleet twice."  </P> <P> On Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: "He dominated his sport in the way few have in the long  history of games men play. God made him more than 7 feet tall. He took care of  the rest."  </P> <P> On the U.S. Open golf tournament: "Welcome to Wuthering Heights West. How do  you par a swamp? What club do you use for Ooze? . . . The leader board looks as  if it's bleeding to death."  </P> <P> On Oklahoma's ex-football coach: "They said Barry Switzer had one of the most  successful football programs of his day. Depends on what you're counting. Bowl  games, yeah. In the important contests of life, he had one of the worst  football programs I've ever seen."  </P> <P> On the supposed wonder horse, Houston: "Now, if I paid $2.9 million for a  horse, I'd at least want him to talk."  </P> <P> On Nolan Ryan's arm: "It is an American heirloom, a work of art. Ryan should go  to the Hall of Fame. The arm should go to the Louvre."  </P> <P> On Pete Rozelle: "As a PR man, he's without an equal. He could make Castro  President of the U.S."  </P> <P> On Oregon's legalized football betting: "America the Beautiful is turning into  the world's biggest bookie parlor. The numbers racket used to be run by Murder,  Inc. Now it's run by the state."  </P> <P> On racing's greatest jockey: "Nobody ever rode a horse with the skill and grace  of Bill Shoemaker. The worst rogues on the track turned into swans when he got  on them. It wasn't a race, it was a romance. A love affair. Shoe didn't ride a  horse, he joined him. Most riders treat horses as if they were guards in  slave-labor camps. Shoe treated them as if he were asking them to dance."  </P> <P> On the ex-coach of the San Diego Chargers: "You remember Don Coryell. He was  the guy who used to stand on the sidelines with his hands on his knees and  stare out at the line of scrimmage like a guy who just got a peek at his own  coffin."  </P> <P> On Pete Rose: "The count is 0-2, Pete, but you always were a good two-strike  hitter. Besides, how tough can that be for a guy who beat out Ty Cobb?"  </P> <P> On the Indy 500 champion: "Every time you see Emerson Fittipaldi in a garage in  Gasoline Alley or on a pit wall in Kokomo or Sheboygan, you want to ask him,  'What's the matter -- butler got the day off?' Or, 'Get lost on your way to the  palace at Monaco, did you?' "  </P> <P> On the owner of the Clippers: "You're Donald Sterling, financier, and your  basketball team is the equivalent of junk bonds. It looks good on paper but not  on court."  </P> <P> On athletic supremacy: "You always get great athletes from the bottom of the  economic order. That goes back to the days of ancient Rome, when the gladiators  were all slaves (later Christians, and we all know the early Christians were  the poor)."  </P> <P> On the Triple Crown: "If you're going to win just one race, make it the Derby.  If you're going to win two, you better win the third, too, or you get to be  forgotten."  </P> <P> On USC's 42-3 rout of Ohio State: "Now we know what a Buckeye is. A land animal  most often found on its own 20-yard line."  </P> <P> On trainer Charlie Whittingham: "Charlie has been around horses so much he  sleeps standing up."  </P> <P> On Sugar Ray Leonard: "He looks like he just walked off a can of baby food. If  you saw him in the park, you'd want to take him down to the precinct and buy  him a lollipop till his parents showed up."  </P> <P> On the race at Indy: "It was the greatest Indianapolis 500 -- at least that I  have seen. . . . A crash on Lap 199 between the two leaders is not something  you're apt to see outside the pages of pulp fiction. It makes for great theater  and puts the 1989 Indy 500 alongside the Babe Ruth called-shot World Series,  the Dempsey-Tunney fight or the 1960 Arnold Palmer Open. . . . A vintage event.  A great year. A collector's item."  </P> <P> On the earthquake at the World Series: "You might have lost your heart in San  Francisco, but it hasn't lost its. The city that the late Doc Kearns would call  'a good game town' is getting off the floor one more time. It is reaching for  the bottom rope to pull itself up for one more go. The city by the bay is like  a grizzled old club fighter who keeps getting to his feet and carrying the  fight to his opponent."  </P> <P> On taking time off: "Every vacation you go on, you hope for three things: To  take 10 strokes off your handicap. To get a tan. To get a rest. Well, one out  of three ain't bad. The tan, I got."  </P></p>

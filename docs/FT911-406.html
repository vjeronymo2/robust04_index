			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Fractional rise at James Smith Estates James Smith Estates, the USM-quoted property group, reported a fractional rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.14m to Pounds 1.16m in the year to March 24, and this, said Mr Stephen Mulliner, chairman, was achieved 'despite the difficult conditions experienced by the property sector, including the high level of interest rates'. He ascribed the 'satisfactory year' to the company's low gearing and the high quality of the commercial property portfolio. With more shares in issue this time earnings were slightly down at 5p (5.07p) per share and the final dividend is lifted 0.2p to a proposed 2.2p for a total of 3.3p (3p). Gross rental income rose to Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 1.45m).</p>

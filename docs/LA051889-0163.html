			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CENTINELA TO EXTEND EMERGENCY SERVICE  </P> <P> Centinela Hospital Medical Center has agreed to continue treating emergency  obstetric patients after May 26, although it will refuse to accept other  patients brought in by paramedics after that date, officials announced  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The agreement between the Inglewood hospital and the county supersedes  Centinela's earlier decision to withdraw completely from the emergency care  system and apparently ends fears that it would create a domino effect,  prompting other hospitals to follow suit.  </P> <P> After Centinela announced in March it would soon stop taking paramedic  patients, Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne announced it had filed  for state permission to close its doors to paramedic patients.  </P> <P> The hospital said it feared an increase in obstetric patients that it could not  properly treat. Centinela is the only hospital in its immediate area with an  obstetrics unit.  </P> <P> "It was a potential disaster just waiting to happen," Carl Williams, of the  county's Department of Health Services, said Wednesday. "I am pleased we have  been able to come to an agreement on this."  </P></p>

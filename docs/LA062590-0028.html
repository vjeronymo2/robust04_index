			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Mattel Sues Cult Leader: The Hawthorne-based toy maker sued religious cult  leader Tony Alamo and two of his companies, claiming that they have damaged the  images of Mattel and Barbie. The breach-of-contract case, filed in Los Angeles  Superior Court, said Alamo Designs in early 1989 obtained two licenses to make  and sell denim jackets, T-shirts and jeans decorated with rhinestones and the  name and likeness of Barbie and Nostalgic Barbie.  </P> <P> The suit said the agreements were violated because Alamo, among other things,  marketed an unapproved T-shirt with a "religious symbol," called Pope John Paul  II a "Nazi war criminal" and has been evading arrest for felony child abuse.  The suit seeks more than $75,000 and an order barring Alamo from using Barbie  images or trademarks. (Filed June 21, 1990. Case No. BC004015)  </P></p>

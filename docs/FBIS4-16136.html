			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 12, BNS - Only two potential  candidates submitted their applications to the Chief Election  Commission [CEC] for participation in a by-election to the  Lithuanian parliament.    Liudvikas Sabutis, member of the previous parliament,  nominated by the Conservative Party, and Albinas Visockas,  leader of the recently founded extreme-leftist Socialist Party,  intend to compete for a vacant seat left by President Algirdas  Brazauskas.    Although the Socialist Party is not yet officially  registered, this is unlikely to prevent Visockas from being  registered as a candidate because he collected the necessary  1,000 signatures in his support. The CEC is scheduled to  discuss registration of candidates Thursday.    The by-election in the Kaisiadorys district, where  Brazauskas  was elected to the parliament, is scheduled for May 15. This  will be the third attempt to elect an MP in this district.    During earlier by-elections in the same district last summer  and fall, none of the candidates received the necessary amount  of votes. Sabutis held the lead in fall, but nevertheless failed  to enter the parliament.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Management: Guidelines for safety - A look at ways to combat violence in the workplace British employers are neglecting their duty to prevent violence at work, a national charity which specialises in personal safety issues claimed this week. Under the 1974 Health and Safety Act and the 1992 Health &amp; Safety at Work Regulations, companies are legally required to carry out assessments and establish agreed procedures for all types of risk. According to the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, however, 'what actually happens is that risk assessment tends to be carried out only for industrial accidents involving machinery or toxic substances; employers do not recognise that personal attacks on staff should be included in this process'. In a bid to raise employer awareness the trust has just published guidance notes aimed at reducing the risks of violence and aggression at work. They have been formally endorsed by the government's Health &amp; Safety Executive, the Confederation of British Industry and the TUC. Until the HSE incorporates violent incidents at work into the revised Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurences Regulations the extent of the problem will be unclear. But the trust believes that workplace violence is increasing faster than violent crime in general and estimates that there are an average of 35,000 incidents per year, three quarters of them assaults on staff by the public. The guide argues that both employers and employees have a common interest in reducing violence, citing the impact on morale, image and recruitment. 'It can also mean extra costs, with absenteeism, higher insurance premiums and compensation payments.' Risk assessment is summarised in five steps: look for the hazards; classify all incidents; search for preventative measures, deciding whether existing precautions are adequate; create a company policy and procedures and put it into practice; check that the measures work - review and, if necessary, revise the assessment from time to time. The trust warns that self-defence courses 'need to be viewed with great caution'. They need to be well taught though 'however much training a person is given there will always be times when that person is not on top form'. Avoidance is the best option: 'In any violent physical contact everyone will be hurt and if an employee responds with active aggression he or she may risk a counter claim of assault.' *Suzy Lamplugh Trust, 14 East Sheen Avenue, London SW14 8AS.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Guy Rogers] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- The elections must be  extended if necessary to allow thousands of East Rand hostel  residents, isolated by violence, to acquire identity documents  and to cast their votes, says Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  Thokoza chairman Abraham Mzizi. Speaking at Thokoza hostel on  Tuesday [26 April] afternoon, Mr Mzizi said thousands of East  Rand hostel residents still had no identity documents.    He would send a fax to Ulundi to notify IFP leader  Mangosutho  Buthelezi about the situation, he said.    East Rand SA Defence Force Commander Col Chris du Toit had  already agreed he would take the matter "to the highest levels  of government".    Hostel inmates, most of whom are IFP supporters, had been  unable to get to Home Affairs Offices in surrounding white towns  to get ID, said Mr Mzizi. "They will be abducted or killed (if  they leave their hostels)."    Inkatha's late entry into the election had exacerbated the  problem. There were more than 1,000 eligible voters without ID  in Thokoza hostel and more than 2,000 in the Katlehong hostels  and the outlying Zonkezizwe hostel. "There are also problems in  Tembisa I have not spoken about."    Mr Mzizi called on the Independent Electoral Commission to  visit the hostels to issue temporary voters cards and if they  could not come on Tuesday they should do so on Wednesday.    "And if necessary the election must be extended. If people  cannot vote because they have no ID it will not be free and  fair. It will be grossly unfair," Mr Mzizi said.</p>

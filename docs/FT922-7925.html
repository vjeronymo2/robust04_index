			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Low-paid balk at cost of pulling down the Wall: German public sector workers feel they are shouldering an unfair share of the burden of unification IN THE end, the money simply wasn't good enough. The tram-drivers and refuse-disposal workers led the revolt, when a clear majority of Germany's public sector workers yesterday rejected their 5.4 per cent pay rise, and opted in effect to go back on strike. Few believe they will do so. They have been abandoned by the other lesser trade unions of the public sector - the railway and postal workers, policemen and white-collar clerical workers. But their gesture has nevertheless thrown Germany's industrial relations into further turmoil, and provided a dramatic demonstration of the disgruntled mood at the grass-roots of the country's workforce. It was a revolt of the lowest-paid, even when they had done best out of the deal, wrung out of the government last week after 11 days of unpleasant and unprecedented strike action. According to the oTV, the largest public sector union to which they all belong, the lowest paid were getting well over 6 per cent pay rises from the deal, where the top ranks were being held down to barely 5 per cent. But it still was not enough. The union leadership was obviously taken aback by the backlash. Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, hitherto seen as a tough and technocratic leader of a ramshackle trade union, leading from the front, was clearly shattered by the outcome yesterday. 'The result depresses us all, and it depresses me in particular,' she said. 'We simply had not reckoned with such a mood (in the union).' Equally it was a shock to the public sector employers - the central government, states and local authorities - who were dragged over the threshold of a 5 per cent offer only after seeing that their workers actually enjoyed a broad measure of public sympathy. It is also a shock for the rest of the trade union movement, where the mighty private sector unions, such as IG Metall, the engineering workers, IG Bau in the construction industry, and IG Medien in the print industry, are set on strike action for more cash. They urgently need a deal in the public sector to use as their baseline for the coming battle. 'There is no doubt in my mind that IG Metall and the rest will be totally frustrated by the outcome,' according to one Social Democrat politician, who asked not to be named. 'They need to use the public sector pay rise as a springboard, but that means they need to have it settled. 'On the other hand, the militancy of the public sector workers may convince the other union leaders that they must hold out for more. 'IG Metall has already made a serious mistake by suggesting it would settle for around 6 per cent.' In fact the public sector vote seems to have been a two-edged revolt: on the one hand by a radicalised grassroots membership against their own union leadership; and on the other by a disgruntled workforce convinced that it is shouldering an unfair share of the costs of German unification. The perception of the German trade unions that the unification burden is completely one-sided, was spelt out in detail yesterday by Mrs Ursula Engelen-Kefer, deputy chairman of the DGB, the German trade union federation. 'It all began to go wrong with the great 'tax lie',' she said, referring to the repeated assurance of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his colleagues, before unification, that there would be 'no tax rises to finance unity'. First to go up were unemployment contributions, raised by 2.5 per cent on April 1, 1991. Then on July 1 last year came the big tax package: the 7.5 per cent 'solidarity surcharge' on income tax; petrol tax up; tobacco tax up; and, from next January, value added tax will go up 1 per cent. 'All these measures put far more burden on the workers and those on social security, for the financial costs of unity,' Mrs Engelen-Kefer insisted. The extra contributions for pensions and unemployment alone will bring in about DM50bn (Pounds 17bn) this year. 'The real incomes of workers sank in 1991 by 0.5 per cent, and in 1992 will hardly show any real growth at all . . . . Between 1989 and 1992, the purchasing power of pensions sank by some 0.5 per cent. 'Professionals, the self-employed and civil servants, as well as the higher paid, have been very largely spared the costs, with the exception of the solidarity surcharge,' she said. As for the business sector, 'which has earned a massive amount from unification', it had seen its tax burden reduced this year by DM5bn-DM6bn, she said. No doubt the government would quarrel with the figures. But Mrs Engelen-Kefer does reflect (and inform) the thinking on the shop-floor. The feeling is ever more widespread that 'it would have been better if the Wall had been left where it was'. In the German public sector, that general resentment has been aggravated by growing strains inside the 900,000-strong oTV itself. It is a diffuse union, representing wage scales ranging from DM2,000 to DM20,000 a month, everyone from council administrators to refuse collectors, and it has always had problems maintaining a united facade. Yesterday's ballot result showed a gulf between the yes votes of white-collar workers, and the no votes from the street. Throughout the 1980s, the oTV concentrated on cutting working hours, rather than pushing up wages. The result was that its members slipped down the earnings league. Since 1989 they have been trying to claw it back, just when the real boom years were over. Last year Mrs Wulf-Mathies managed all right - she got an overall 7 per cent. But this year her determination met the counter desperation of the government with its back to the budget wall, and there was a limit to the cash in the kitty. She thought it was enough, but her members disagreed.</p>

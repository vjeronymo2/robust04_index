On the decisions and recommendations which  are expected to result from tonight's meeting, Dr. Nabil Sha'th,  political adviser to Yasir 'Arafat and the head of the  Palestinian delegation in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations  on the implementation of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, gave the  following exclusive statement to this program:    [Begin recording] [Sha'th] This is the first major meeting  to  be held since the terrible massacre perpetrated by the murderous  Israeli settlers in the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron. The first  responsibility of the PLO is to protect the Palestinian people.  So we must discuss this subject in order to arrive at specific  recommendations for providing protection for our people --  international protection and protection on the ground by the  disarming of the settlers, the disarming of all the settlers,  because without this protection cannot be provided for the  Palestinian people.    In addition to this, we must also study the U.S. call for  the  negotiations to be held in Washington. We want to know what  this call will add to the negotiations, how the change of venue  will help to solve the problems facing the peace process, what  role the United States will play in the coming negotiations, and  at what level the negotiations will be. What are the main  subjects -- will they include the protection of the Palestinian  people or not? [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Dr. Sha'th,  you have announced in statements to the press that future  negotiations will focus basically on providing international  protection for the Palestinian people so that what happened in  Hebron will not recur. In your opinion what form should this  international protection take?    [Sha'th] Many forms are known to the world. A few weeks ago  a massacre occurred in Sarajevo in which the number of victims  was similar to the number of Palestinian martyrs in the Ibrahimi  mosque in Hebron. The result was a change in the international  view of the Bosnian issue and of the protection required for the  Bosnian people from the Serbs who were threatening the lives of  the Bosnian Muslims daily. A minimum level of protection was  provided which was not sufficient at all, but it was a minimum  threat to the killers so that they would move their guns far  from Sarajevo and protection would be provided for the Bosnian  Muslims in Sarajevo.    There are international forces in Bosnia and in many other  places -- Sinai, the Syrian-Israeli borders, the Lebanese  borders, and others. The agreement we signed in Washington  comprises suitable and agreed international protection. Until  this moment Israel has been dragging its feet in discussing this  item which provides for observers and international troops who  will give the minimum protection, in addition to the Palestinian  police who must replace the army of occupation when the latter  withdraws.

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / FBI may support gun control law THE Federal Bureau of Investigation is reported to be on the point of coming out in favour of tougher gun control legislation, George Graham writes from Washington. Mr William Sessions, the FBI's director, is understood to have written to Ms Janet Reno, the US attorney general, asking her to approve a six-point FBI policy statement calling for stricter licensing of gun dealers and handgun owners, more restrictions on assault weapons and a ban on the sale of ammunition capable of piercing bulletproof vests. Mr Sessions, who is battling to hold onto his job after accusations of ethical violations, is understood also to propose backing the Brady bill, named after Mr James Brady, the White House press secretary shot during an assassination attempt on former President Ronald Reagan. President Bill Clinton has promised that he will sign this bill, which would impose a five-day waiting period before any handgun purchase to allow the police time to conduct background checks, if Congress passes it. The statement would be an unusual entry into the political arena for the FBI, but the bureau would only be following a wide array of senior law enforcement officers across the country, who have become increasingly disenchanted with the gun lobby led by the National Rifle Association. The National Association of Chiefs of Police reports that 77.7 per cent of its members now favour the Brady bill.</p>

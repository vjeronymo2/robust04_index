Furthermore, during operations conducted in Baja California,  Sonora, Baja California Sur, Jalisco, and Nuevo Leon, the police  authorities arrested six presumed public poisoners, seizing more  than 2.5 tons of cannabis indica intended to be taken to the  United States for sale and consumption.    The Attorney General's Office representative in Coahuila,  Maria del Refugio Martinez Cruz, informed the assistant attorney  for branch offices and inspections, Alfonso Cabrera Morales,  that four tons and 182 kg of pure cocaine, and slightly over  3,000 kg of packed marijuana, were burned. The incineration took  place in the town of Saltillo, in the presence of  representatives from the National Defense Secretariat, the  Mexican Navy, and the health sector, as well as from state and  municipal governments.    The official noted that, in the other aforementioned  municipalities, various amounts of cannabis totaling seven tons  and 825 kg were destroyed. They had been seized in operations  conducted by Federal Judicial Police [PJF] personnel under  orders from the force's deputy representative in the state, Juan  Carlos Alvarado Aranda.    It was emphasized at the drug burning ceremonies that the  authorities had confirmed their steadfast intention of pooling  efforts so as, together, to combat society's common enemy: the  drug traffic.    Moreover, the PGR representative in Sonora, Miguel Angel  Cortes Ibarra, reported that federal agents under orders from  the assistant representative, Julio Cesar Moraila Amador, had  intercepted a trailer truck at the highway inspection point  located at Km 120 of the Hermosillo-Nogales route. It was  carrying 1,709 kg of pressed marijuana, presumably intended to  be taken to the town of Nogales, Arizona, for marketing.    According to the report submitted to the PJF's General  Directorate, headed by Commander Adrian Carrera Fuentes, Macario  Ramirez Arcega was placed at the disposal of the Federal Public  Prosecutor's Office. He was driving a vehicle with Federal  Public Service registration 325-UBB. In the body of this vehicle  203 packages and 64 bags containing the aforementioned amount of  drugs were discovered.

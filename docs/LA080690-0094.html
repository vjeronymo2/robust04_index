			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RENOVATED EQUESTRIAN CENTER SADDLED WITH SKEPTICISM;  </P> <P> HORSES: TWO BURBANK RESIDENTS BOUGHT THE GRIFFITH PARK FACILITY FROM THE  INSOLVENT GIBRALTAR SAVINGS IN FEBRUARY.  </P> <P> In the three months since a Burbank development firm took over the financially  troubled Los Angeles Equestrian Center, work crews have painted and repaired  peeling fences, pulled acres of weeds, planted dozens of rows of flowers and  towed away abandoned cars rusting behind stables.  </P> <P> And while regular patrons of the center say Del Rey Properties has rescued the  72-acre facility from disrepair, many remain wary of the future. "Eight years  we've been here and everyone has promised everything and none of it has ever  come through," said one horse trainer.  </P> <P> It is that type of skepticism that owners Gregory Daggett and Timothy Behunin  are finding difficult to overcome as they attempt to make profitable an  operation that has lost money since it opened in 1982. The two Burbank  residents bought the center in February from the insolvent Gibraltar Savings  for $3.6 million. In May, they took control of the facility, which is on  city-owned land in the northeastern corner of Griffith Park.  </P> <P> Since then, the new management has worked to revitalize the deteriorating  center, which fell into disrepair during the caretaker ownership of Gibraltar.  A 10-man crew has worked seven days a week just pulling weeds. Dozens of  dumpsters have been filled with trash and hauled away. Slippery concrete wash  racks have been improved so horses do not fall as they are washed. Transients  sleeping in stalls have been evicted.  </P> <P> "We feel good about the change," said Shirley Andrews, a city administrator who  oversees the center. "For someone to take over an operation that has been  deteriorating is very hard."  </P> <P> General Manager Kenneth Mowry declined to discuss when Del Rey expects to turn  a profit on the center.  </P> <P> Many patrons acknowledged that Daggett and Behunin face an uphill fight in  turning the center around. Some protective horse owners said they were  unsatisfied with Del Rey's operation of the center, but most reserved judgment.  Many said they feel as though they have been in limbo since Gibraltar took over  in 1988, when it foreclosed on the facility's previous owner.  </P> <P> "I think everyone is a little nervous," said Beverly Engleberg, who boards a  horse at the center. "Everybody is kind of watching and waiting."  </P> <P> They are watching for changes in programs that might make the center cheaper to  run, but would damage its reputation as one of the finest equestrian facilities  in the United States. Even in its dilapidated condition, the center was  acknowledged to be among the best riding centers and is home to several  world-class horse trainers. Some expressed concern that Del Rey would expand  the services of the center and neglect the basic care of the 645 horses that  board there.  </P> <P> "We don't want restaurants and condos and swimming pools and tennis courts,"  said one trainer. "We just want a place that works."  </P> <P> Daggett said that's what he wants too. He said programs at the center will  remain intact and expansions will be made only if they can be shown to be  cost-effective. "Everything has got to be a stand-alone deal," he said.  </P> <P> The purchase of the center was primarily a business decision, but Daggett said  there was a certain amount of sentimentality involved in the decision. Horse  riders since they were children, Daggett and Behunin spent many weekends of  their youth riding their horses on the hills overlooking the open fields where  the center now stands.  </P> <P> "Everybody is a little bit cowboy at heart," said Daggett, who has run smaller  stables nearby for several years. "But this was a business move. We hope to  make money in it."  </P> <P> Mowry said the owners believe they can succeed where others have failed largely  because their debt service is considerably smaller than that of previous  owners. According to Andrews, the $3.6 million Del Rey paid for the center is  little more than a quarter of the approximately $12 million Gibraltar owed on  the facility.  </P> <P> In addition, Mowry said, careful management has helped stem the flow of money.  A 100-yard chain-link fence, for instance, has been rented since 1982 for $74 a  month. Mowry said the fence could have been bought several times over with the  rent money. It will be taken down and replaced with a new fence -- this one  owned by the center. Andrews said electrical boxes around the facility have  been padlocked to prevent the surreptitious use of electricity.  </P> <P> "The big story is the little things," Mowry said. "It's the small details."  </P> <P> But some boarders and trainers said such cost-consciousness on the part of Del  Rey has been reflected in the care of their horses. One woman complained that  she could not get extra shavings used for padding for her horse's stall.  Another said her horse's stall was not cleaned regularly. Others were anxious  about the center's decision to feed horses alfalfa cubes, instead of loose hay.  Several horses died a few years ago as a result of eating cubes contaminated  with animal parts.  </P> <P> "They ride horses, but they are not horsemen," said one boarder who asked not  to be named.  </P> <P> Mowry said stalls are cleaned twice a day and that horses whose owners do not  want them eating cubes are fed loose hay instead.  </P> <P> Daggett said it is understandable that many people are apprehensive about new  management at the center and added that it might take time for longtime  boarders to become accustomed to new ways.  </P> <P> "All I can ask people is to judge us by what we do, not by what's been done in  the past," he said.  </P></p>

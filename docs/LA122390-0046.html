			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMODELER'S DIARY: GETTING HOUSE IN SHAPE EARLY FOR RETIREMENT SALE  </P> <P> My husband and I were impelled into the wilderness of remodeling in the spring  last year. The impetus was our 40-inch kitchen stove, which was about 30 years  old. The stove was still doing its job, but it was beginning to show its age  and couldn't bake a level cake.  </P> <P> "Let's get a new one," said my husband, Wil.  </P> <P> The stove was built into custom cabinets, so we tried to buy another just like  it but couldn't find a 40-inch stove of any kind. We knew that some major  cabinet remodeling would be necessary.  </P> <P> Refitting the cabinets to accommodate a new stove would also mean rebuilding  the ceramic countertops, and we knew we couldn't match the existing tile.  </P> <P> With only one of our five children still at home, with college costs almost out  of the way and retirement plans to be considered, we agreed that any  improvements to the house should add to its resale value.  </P> <P> Another important consideration was that we wanted to enjoy the fruits of our  labor for awhile instead of making improvements and redecorating when we were  ready to sell.  </P> <P> So we made a list of things we wanted to do. In fact, we made several lists,  juggling needed repairs against desired improvements until we settled on a  combination we could afford: refinishing floors upstairs and down, getting new  carpeting, windows, doors and entry tile, plus the final decorator items --  paint, wallpaper, draperies, bed covers, area rugs and accessories.  </P> <P> We wanted to lighten and brighten our home in every way possible. And we wanted  to build an all-new kitchen.  </P> <P> We estimated costs, arranged the financing and then had to decide where to  begin. We made mistake No. 1 when we started with the flooring.  </P> <P> We knew the other projects -- remodeling the kitchen, replacing entry tile,  redecorating -- should be done first, but we expected house guests through the  summer and didn't want to offer them rooms. We made mistake No. 2 when we  contracted for the floor refinishing and carpeting with a man sent out to  measure our rooms by a vendor preparing an estimate. This man said he could  save us quite a bit of money, and we accepted his offer.  </P> <P> He said it would take two weeks to re-glue and refinish wood parquet floors in  the master bedroom and hallway, install new wood parquet in the den, refinish  the hardwood floor in the dining room and install carpeting in three upstairs  bedrooms and a hallway.  </P> <P> The day he was to start he called to say his truck had broken down. He began  working two days later with a crew of young men who were neither careful nor  experienced.  </P> <P> They used the wrong stain on the wood parquet, which then had to be sanded and  stained again, and installed a different shade of carpet than we ordered  (though, ultimately, it proved to be better for our color scheme).  </P> <P> The two-week schedule became a two-month nightmare, and we learned all over  again that you get what you pay for.  </P> <P> Before the flooring was finished, we had the putty replaced on all windows  (instead of installing new ones). While that was going on, our first house  guests arrived and, in the midst of a severe heat wave, we were awakened each  morning at 7 to the sound of the glazers chipping out the old putty.  </P> <P> Folding closet doors were replaced with sliding, mirrored doors in all bedrooms  and a closet organizing system was installed in the master bedroom -- all  without mishap or delay.  </P> <P> We shopped for other items, including a garden window for the kitchen. While  ordering the window, we struck gold. The salesperson we worked with asked if  we'd thought about consulting a kitchen designer. She highly recommended a  woman with whom she had studied. Sandra restored our faith in people and our  own good judgment. She met with us, asked many questions, followed up with  letters and phone calls, and when we decided to contract with her for  professional plans, she went into high gear.  </P> <P> She advised us on how to verify the licenses of all contractors and  subcontractors; how to prepare for interim cooking and dining facilities; which  contractors and subcontractors to schedule, in which order.  </P> <P> She counseled us on the latest lighting options and provided information on  where to shop for good buys in fixtures, lighting and flooring.  </P> <P> She also gave us great advice on the new kitchen sink: "Find a model you like  with drains at the back, not in the middle. That way, your garbage disposal and  plumbing connections will be at the back and you'll have a lot more usable  space under the sink."  </P> <P> When we ordered the cabinets at the end of October, we had to decide whether to  begin construction as soon as the cabinets were delivered or wait until after  the holidays.  </P> <P> The subcontractors said they could do the job in two or three weeks -- four at  the most. Our designer said we'd be lucky to be back in the kitchen in less  than six to eight weeks. We listened to her. It's a good thing we did, because  demolition began on Jan. 9 this year, and we couldn't cook (let alone eat) in  the kitchen again until Feb. 20 -- six weeks to the day.  </P> <P> One subcontractor caused the delay. In dealing with him, we made Mistake No. 3  -- which was to pay him for work not yet done. We learned that we must never do  that for any reason. A reputable, responsible contractor or subcontractor has  established credit with suppliers and enough capital reserve to expect payment  only when the work has been done in an acceptable manner.  </P> <P> While the final work was being done on the kitchen, we began scheduling the  last of the remodeling and decorating, including some additional electrical  work, exterior and interior doors, entry tile, ceiling fans in the bedrooms,  wallpapering, and painting.  </P> <P> Each time one of these projects was delayed (and most of them were), it meant  rescheduling the workmen who were to follow.  </P> <P> But the work was finally finished nine months after it began, and the results  have made every minute of frustration and difficulty worthwhile.  </P> <P> Our home has the bright, cheerful appearance we envisioned. The new kitchen is  much more efficient and comfortable, with all-adjustable shelving, all base  cabinets equipped with pull-out shelves or drawers, and a cabinet finish that  is easily cleaned with cool water and a dry cloth.  </P> <P> The entry is brighter and more welcoming, bedrooms appear larger and are easily  cooled after a hot day, and the slightly imperfect flooring is easily  maintained.  </P> <P> We can enjoy the results of this odyssey until we're ready to retire and sell.  Then, whether we build our retirement home or buy one that needs remodeling,  the first person we'll contact is Sandra.  </P> <P> READERS WELCOME TO SHARE THEIR REMODELING TALES  </P> <P> Readers wishing to share their remodeling experiences should send queries or  manuscripts to Real Estate Editor, Los Angeles Times, Times Mirror Square, Los  Angeles, Calif. 90053.  </P></p>

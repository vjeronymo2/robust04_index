			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman, has called on the separatist  elements in the leadership of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP],  who are rebelling against legitimacy, to immediately surrender  to legitimacy to preserve the remainder of the Armed Forces  personnel, who were misled by those separatist elements into a  losing battle. The brother chairman regretted the victims of  the ongoing fighting against the rebels in the YSP leadership.  He said that the blood that was shed is Yemeni blood and dear  to all of us.    Addressing the people's deputies at the House of  Representatives this morning, the brother chairman said: Our  Yemeni people, who offered thousands of martyrs to defend the  republican system, will offer more sacrifices to maintain unity.  He said: Separation is impossible. We will not move an inch  from unity, regardless of the price.    The brother chairman announced the rejection of any  mediation  effort or call aimed at bringing into our country any Arab or  international forces. He said: What is taking place in Yemen  is an internal affair and an issue that concerns the Yemenis.  We are not two states or two regimes, but one state, one  people, and one republican system. The ongoing fighting is  taking place against Yemeni elements who fomented sedition in  the society and rebelled against the constitutional legitimacy.  They bear responsibility for their acts and mistakes. But, as  for the unionists in the YSP, they are the object of our  respect, pride, and love.    He added: Our unionist enterprise is to build a new Yemen on  the basis of a democratic and multi-party political system,  where the constitution and law are enforced. We want to build  the state of law and order, social progress, and of genuine,  comprehensive progress, away from flowery speeches, slogans,  lies, and deception.    He indicated that our valiant Armed Forces are now scoring  major successes and chasing the forces of rebellion and  secession to force them to surrender to the people's will,  legitimacy, and national consensus.    The brother chairman urged the House of Representatives, and  through it the masses of our Yemeni people, to maintain public  order, abide by the law, and prevent chaos. He said: We highly  appreciate our great Yemeni people's endurance and patience,  which has lasted for a period of approximately nine months since  the beginning of the political crisis fabricated by the  secessionists in the YSP leadership when al-Bid returned to  Aden. Relaxation is imminent. The outcome will be favorable,  God willing.    In his address to the House of Representatives, the brother  president reviewed all the developments that have taken place in  our country since the fabrication of the crisis on 19 August  1993. He also reviewed the role that the separatist elements in  the YSP leadership under al-Bid had in leading the country to  the current regrettable situation. He described the concessions  that have been made to end the crisis, maintain unity, and spare  the people and the homeland problems, troubles, and affliction.    The president said: However, the secessionist elements in  the YSP continued to work to escalate the crisis and promote its  repercussions in the military and information spheres. These  elements brought the military situation to a head beginning with  the Abyan events on the eve of the signing of the Pledge and  Accord Agreement in Amman; through the Shabwah, (Harth Sufyan),  and 'Imran events; and finally igniting the fire in Dhamar with  the Ba Suhayb Brigade and against the Central Security men in  Aden and the 2d Armored Brigade at al-Rahah.    The president said: We did not want matters to go this far,  but the rebellious secessionist elements continued to be  arrogant and intransigent, working to provoke sedition and bring  conditions all over the homeland to the point of explosion.    The president alluded to the YSP secessionist elements'  crimes of plundering public funds and of financial and  administrative corruption, noting actions by Salih Abu-Bakr  Bin-Husaynun and a number of other secessionist elements from  the YSP leadership who took $375 million from the al-Masilah oil  revenues illegally and deposited them in private accounts of  their own after having doubled the price of the construction of  the al-Masilah oil pipeline in an illegal way and without  consulting constitutional establishments.    The brother president reviewed the development of the  crisis,  alluding to the dialogues following the parliamentary election  on constitutional amendments and the YSP demands to improve the  drafting of some articles in the draft amendments concerning the  form of the state presidency, the local government, and the  third article of the constitution. However, [word indistinct]  imposed new conditions represented by [word indistinct] draft  that was agreed on. We accepted the political dialogue and the  Pledge and Accord Document was completed. We accepted this in  order to prevent the implementation of the plot to dismember the  homeland, despite the fact that it contained 75 percent of the  YSP demands. However, the YSP was not convinced. The  secessionist elements continued to implement their scheme of  returning the homeland to what it was before 22 May 1990. They  continued to present impossible conditions and refused to accept  any mediation efforts. We said: Let us begin with the two  basic points in the Pledge and Accord Document; namely,  arresting elements accused of sabotage and disturbing security,  and withdrawing military units from the previous borders.    The president said: But they rejected this. Then we  discovered that their demands were only a cover to circumvent  the results of the parliamentary elections and implement the  plot of secession. This was proven by the fact that elements  accused of sabotage and explosions, whose names were placed on  the list of of persons to be arrested, were in alliance with the  YSP and were fighting among its ranks, paying them money and  giving them arms to practice deception.    The explosions, the kidnapping of foreigners, and the  banditry have been revealed to be the work of the intelligence  forces of the YSP in order to terrify unionist elements in the  party and force them to leave Sanaa in order to implement the  secessionist plot for which al-Bid had been working. He  continued to escalate the crisis after reaping the fruits of the  crisis.    The brother chairman of the Presidential Council added that  after the elections, the YSP was offered many concessions to  participate in assuming power, despite the fact that it came in  third. He pointed out that the YSP continued to practice media  deception and kept harping on a state of law and order, at a  time when large amounts of weapons were found at the  headquarters of the Central Committee in Sanaa. The weapons  included more than 400 pieces of equipment, 350 RPG's, and [word  indistinct] missiles, and other weapons. This is the cultural  scheme of the YSP.    The brother chairman added that what happened in 'Imran was  part of a series of incidents meant to ignite the military  situation in order to destroy the 1st Armored Brigade and then  destroy the city of 'Imran and march on Sanaa to topple the  regime of the state of unity and constitutional legitimacy. He  pointed out that the martyrs and victims who fell in that  regrettable fighting are the victims of the policy of the  elements that have not learned their lesson since the inception  of the YSP.    Brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the  House of Representatives, earlier welcomed brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council,  commending his attendance of the House's session to brief the  House on the facts since the inception of the crisis.    The House discussed the latest developments in the country.  The discussions of the deputies of the people, including the  deputies attending for the parliamentary bloc of the YSP,  asserted that the members of the House represent the entire  Yemeni people in accordance with the Constitution and the  constitutional oath taken by the deputies at the first session  of the elected House of Representatives.    The people's deputies, of various political and party  persuasions, stressed adherence to constitutional legitimacy and  Yemeni unity and national unity, at whatever cost. The deputies  were also unanimous that they are against those who undermine  the democratic approach and against those who seek separation.    The House of Representatives also stressed that the current  war is not a civil war but a war between constitutional  legitimacy and those who have abrogated it. The deputies'  remarks also stressed that it is important for the security  agencies to maintain public security and safeguard public and  private funds and the safety of the citizens, regardless of  their political persuasion.    Afterward, the House formed a committee from its members,  including the bloc of the General People's Congress, the YSP  bloc, the Yemeni Reform Grouping bloc and the bloc of the  independents. The committee will present views to the House on  the current developments in the country.    At the outset of the session, the House of Representatives  reviewed the minutes of its previous session, to which the House  statement issued on 5 May 1994 is attached. The two were  approved unanimously. The House of Representatives will resume  its sessions tomorrow morning, God willing.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Non-executives' role was the focus of quotation Sir, Sir David Plastow's letter ('Non-executive directors' input is invaluable', March 5) appears to be a delayed knee-jerk reaction to my Pall Mall lecture. A reader may prefer my generally accepted, though quite sparing, use of hyperbole - 'blunting the edge' - in making a point, to his somewhat crude rebuttal - 'ill-informed nonsense'. After all, one does not need to have been an automotive engineer in order to recognise the difference between the essentials of a vehicle and its trim. As a matter of record, the quotation related not to non-executive directors as such but to those requirements of a code which over-emphasise their monitoring role; their independence from the business of the company; and to their control over decision-making activities. Sir David has been fortunate, or otherwise, in that his many experiences appear to have arisen through company needs rather than from regulatory requirements.

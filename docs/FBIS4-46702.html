There is a lot of distortion and  sometimes open politicking in it. Therefore, we asked for a  commentary on this topic by a suitable and competent  person--Volodymyr Shcherbyna, chief of Object Shelter's  radiation security department.    [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Volodymyr Grigorovych, passions around  Chernobyl do not subside. It is important, however, to discuss  without emotion the greatest technological catastrophe in the  history of humanity. Therefore, a question arises: Which  criteria for appraising Chernobyl's grave problems do you  consider most objective?    [Shcherbyna] In my opinion, it is protection from  radiation--the science that provides the ability to optimally  calculate the scientific-technical, techno-economical,  medical-biological, and sociopsychological aspects of current  and future Chernobyl problems.    Note this: In the decree "On Some Measures for Providing the  Economy With Electric Power" the previous parliament apparently  is not revoking its decision, just agreeing with the Cabinet of  Ministers proposal to continue ChAES exploitation, but only  under the supervision of the Derzhatomnaglyad [State Oversight  Committee for Nuclear and Radiation Safety], Minpriroda  [Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources],  and the Academy of Sciences. In my opinion, this is a way to  shirk personal responsibility, as old as the world--when there  are so many oversight organizations, you never find who is  directly responsible.    The decision to continue the station's exploitation does not  remove in any way from the agenda the grave questions that were  pertinent at the time it was taken off line. I will enumerate  only some of them.    First, the level of ChAES safety is substantially lower than  what is required by international and national standards, or the  radiation environment requirements that have developed in  Ukraine as a result of the Chernobyl catastrophe, and because of  both the design and the technological capabilities of the power  generators, and because an almost complete absence of nuclear  power generation infrastructure in Ukraine cannot be improved in  any substantial way.    Second, the radiation-ecological and psychological blows  Ukraine sustained from both the Chernobyl catastrophe and its  consequences have caused a strong nonacceptance of continuation  of ChAES exploitation among a great majority of the Ukrainian  population.    Third, the international public opinion of many countries,  especially those that have been seriously affected by the  Chernobyl catastrophe, cannot understand why they have to put up  with continuing exploitation of ChAES, which already has  inflicted such damage on the humanity and ecology of Earth.    And fourth, the state of Ukrainian economy at the time of  adopting this decision include sources of energy that make it  possible, essentially without significant expenditures, to take  out of exploitation ChAES power generators.    The decision to activate ChAES has not changed an iota any  of  these points.    [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] As far as we remember, the writer, who was  the head of the parliamentary commission on the questions of  Chernobyl catastrophe at the time of the hearings asked  directly: What about competent guarantees of AES' safe  exploitation?    [Shcherbyna] I remember--and think about what he was told:  Since, according to Derzhatomnaglyad, all Ukrainian nuclear  power stations meet neither international nor national safety  standards, discussing this issue with respect to ChAES is  meaningless. And we should mention that from the standpoint of  departmental sense the answer is irreproachable. Except that the  person who brought up this question was interested not in the  problem of how logical this information looked to  Derzhatomnaglyad, but the problem of the future of the Ukrainian  people and environment.    [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] So what is actually the real level of  ChAES  safety?    [Shcherbyna] First, remember for starters that it is  different from other stations equipped with RBMK's [high-power  pressurized tube reactors]. The ChAES is an indissoluble "No. 3  generator" complex--the nuclear-unsafe and radiation-unsafe  Object Shelter, which technically is in a condemned condition.  That is, what is called the Chernobyl Nuclear-Unsafe Complex  (ChYaNK). Next: the equipment and engineering structures, which  as a consequence of the 1986 tragedy have suffered to a greater  or lesser extent from the overload not foreseen by the design.  The station represents "harder" conditions for the work of all  enterprise services, as well as the staff as a whole. And one  more special feature: arranging the main location of service  personnel at a considerable distance (50 km) from the station,  beyond the boundary of ChAES radiation effect.    According to the main normative document currently in  effect--OPB-88, the nuclear station's safety is ensured by  implementing the principle of depth-distributed protection. This  principle consists of 13 components. With respect to ChAES, of  these 13 components only one-quarter have been carried out,  while three-quarters have not been put in place either at all or  in part.    This normative document also establishes an integrated  indicator of nuclear station safety. It is expressed by the  value of the maximum emergency discharges of radioactive  material surrounding the core. This value is set at the level of  one event per year per 10 million operating power generating  units of AES. For the ChAES this indicator is 10,000 times  higher.    [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] However, the top officials of Derzhkomatom  [State Committee on Atomic Energy] and the ChAES maintain that  the target level of safety has been achieved.    [Shcherbyna] This is not quite correct. Let us look at the  significance and substantiation of these arguments. The main  technical measures that are being taken in order to avoid the  repetition of the 1986 accident were predicated on precluding  the introduction of positive reactivity. At the same time, the  chief designer organization of the RBMK-1000 in its "Generalized  Analysis of the Accident at the ChAES No. 4 Generator. Report  13.168" produced this conclusion: "Having considered the  formulated requirements for modeling all known information  received in the NDKIET [expansion not identified], IAE [Atomic  Energy Institute], VNDIAES [All-Ukraine Institute for Nuclear  Power Stations Research], and the IYaD AN URSR [Nuclear Research  Institute of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences] from the results  of various three-dimensional programs, one may ascertain that  for the simulated re-creation of the accidental reactor runaway  the surge of positive reactivity alone in the A3-5 combination  is not sufficient and requires development of different  hypotheses."    Most foreign specialists support this viewpoint. Although  since the initial facts of the 1986 accident have not been  determined, we cannot maintain with certainty that the 1986  accident will not be repeated. And even less so can we maintain  this about accidents of a different kind that have similar or  greater radiation consequences.    This conclusion is convincingly supported by many  specialists  both in our country and abroad, including in numerous papers  presented at the symposium on the problems of ChAES held in Kiev  in May 1993.    One of the most interesting presentations at that symposium  (delivered by a representative of the Austrian green movement)  showed, in more technical depth and with more argumentation than  in the presentations of the top officials of Derzhkomatom and  ChAES, that the level of safety of the ChAES does not correspond  to any measurements of the international community.    I want to repeat: From the standpoint of ensuring  safety, the parliament decision to continue exploitation of  ChAES legitimized the transformation of ChAES into the Chernobyl  Nuclear-Unsafe Station (ChYaNS), the central link of which is  the Chernobyl nuclear-unsafe complex Object Shelter--No. 3  generator.    Behind this move of ChAES into a ChYaNS category is not just  the change of initials; behind it is the demonstration of the  Derzhkomatom's will and its stubborn conviction that there are  things that are more important than a repetition of an accident  of Chernobyl proportions in Ukraine.    [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Thus, are you against development of  nuclear power generation?    [Shcherbyna] Not at all. I believe that humanity can go  ahead  with the development of nuclear power generation but only to the  extent to which it is possible to ensure that its benefits  outweigh the harm. And that the relationship "benefit--harm" in  the nuclear power generation should be seen not only from the  viewpoint of... interests, but after evaluation of short-term  and long-terms prospects.    These problems face both humanity as a whole and each  country  separately.    Unfortunately, methodological tools developed by world  science for calculation of "benefit--harm" ratio in nuclear  power generation cannot yet provide answers to all questions  arising in this sphere. Much in this we still have to work out  by the method of trial and error, including the road of "public  choice" with respect to the level of risk in nuclear power  generation.    It so happens that in Ukraine many nuclear professionals are  convinced that because of the complexity and, most importantly,  uncertainty of the methods of evaluation of "benefit--harm"  ratio in nuclear power generation, it is not advisable to bring  into this issue the general public and even less so to provide  it with that part of information with respect to which they  themselves have great doubts. And if circumstances force us to  speak on this topic, we should do it in such a way that society  would "understand us correctly."    The Chernobyl catastrophe has graphically demonstrated all  the harm of "measured truth" on ChAES safety. It is good that  some of us are opening our eyes. And there are more people like  this day by day...    [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Your eyes have opened; however, you are a  specialist... What do we do about many of our public movements,  which reject from the outset nuclear power generation, equating  all of it with Chernobyl?    [Shcherbyna] We need to tell the truth. And the most acute  issues are these:    1. What is the total damage the Chernobyl catastrophe has  produced and continues to produce?    2. With the help of what measures and at what cost can the  damage caused by the Chernobyl catastrophe for Ukraine be  liquidated or at least neutralized to an "acceptable level?"    3. What is the probability of an accident on the scale of  Chernobyl-1986 repeating itself at the ChAES and where will it  put Ukraine this time?    And nobody should have any doubt that until the public gets  the answer to these questions, it will "by all means available  to it" resist continuation of exploitation of the ChAES. Until  then, the ChAES is practically the only nuclear station in the  world that has realized in practice even those negative sides of  nuclear power generations that remain a "possibility" for the  rest of AES.    Let us look for example in what minimum acceptable form an  answer may be provided to the first question. We need to first  of all evaluate these factors: What is the degree of harm the  Chernobyl catastrophe has produced for the health of the future  generations of Ukrainian citizens; what part of the  radio-ecological tolerance of the Ukrainian environment has been  used up by the Chernobyl catastrophe; and what damage has the  Chernobyl catastrophe of 1986 done to the health of the current  generation?    And the more we delay obtaining scientifically substantiated  answers to these questions, the more conservative our society  becomes in the appraisal of the consequences of Chernobyl  catastrophe and nuclear power generation as a whole.    In these conditions any consideration of the problem of  continuing exploitation of ChAES without at the same time  discussing these questions produces an outcry about "disrespect  for public opinion."    Whether we discuss the problem openly or sweep it under the  rug, people see with their own eyes the increase in the number  of children who got sick as a result of the Chernobyl  catastrophe, the increase in the number of sick and disabled as  a result of the work on the liquidation of the consequences of  the Chernobyl accident and the work on continuing exploitation  of ChAES.    They see the devastation and destruction of a part of their  land, the international isolation of Ukraine as a result of its  insistent refusal to hold back exploitation of ChAES, and many  other things.    Moreover, the "service record of ChAES accident-proneness"  is  such that it forces one to re-doubt suspicions regarding  everything that is connected one way or the other with the  Chernobyl nuclear power station. Really, let us read and think  about it:    1983--radiation accident.    1986--radiation catastrophe.    1988--"disintegration" of the power generation system.    1990--critical accident at the Object Shelter.    1991--fire at No. 3 generator.    1993--fire at the Object Shelter.    1993--disappearance of nuclear fuel...    [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] But we were told all the time that we  would  freeze without ChAES.    [Shcherbyna] All right, let us talk about power generation  with figures in hand. Compare at least two of them. ChAES  accounts for 4 to 6 percent of total electric power output in  Ukraine. According to the Ministry of Energy's own data, there  is no demand for 33 percent of all power generation capability  in Ukraine today.    Add to this the 30-percent reserve of power generation  capability. If we put on line only half of them, buying organic  fuel for this purpose for an amount equivalent to $600 million  worth a year, we will produce $1.5 billion worth of electric  power by "Derzhkomatom estimates." By that we not only  compensate for the cost associated with taking ChAES off line,  but even make a substantial profit in the dollar equivalent.    [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Still, let us say that the Cabinet of  Ministers had serious reasons for believing that without ChAES  it will not fulfill its obligation to the country. And for this  reason it asked parliament to permit continuing exploitation of  the station. But what does it mean: "to continue exploitation of  ChAES for the period warranted by its technical condition"?    [Shcherbyna] Formally it means that we cannot "adhere to the  rated capacity" of nuclear power stations whose technical  conditions do not meet normative requirements. However, as the  Derzhatomnaglyad reported, ChAES did not meet established norms  before, or ever for that matter.    This inconsistency may be resolved in only one way--by  assuming that parliament's decision applies not to the entire  technical condition of the station but only such, one would  assume, "most critical parameters." In this case the decision  should have said who is to set these "most critical parameters"  for ChAES. The station itself, as a self-operating organization,  or a higher body, and as Derzhkomatom, Derzhatomnaglyad, or some  other? It would be most logical to admit that this can be done  by the Cabinet of Minister, since it was this body that asked  parliament to continue work on capacity of ChAES.    Next. What does this mean: "ChAES exploitation is conducted  under the oversight of Derzhatomnaglyad, Minpriroda, and the  Academy of Sciences." A new institute is being set up--the  institute for watching over ChAES exploitation. But what does it  mean? What is its status? What are its responsibilities?    But the main point is still something else. The main point  is: Why do we need to make this an observer institute? Both  Derzhatomnaglyad and Minpriroda have extensive oversight  functions with respect to ChAES, as well as any other AES in  Ukraine. Moving these organizations from the category of  oversight bodies into the category of observers at first glance  does not make any sense for the Cabinet of Ministers, because it  considerably cuts their rights regarding ChAES, as well as their  responsibility for ChAES safety.    Really, what does this decree make Derzhatomnaglyad with  respect to ChAES? Essentially, into a "State Committee for  Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety of ChAES." The same  applies to Minpriroda.    Perhaps, it stems from our long-standing habit that  collective responsibility (the synonym for the lack of  individual responsibility) begins where there are no less than  three participants, which explains adding the Ukrainian Academy  of Sciences.    The Ukrainian Academy of Sciences is not set either by its  substance or its structure to carry out the tasks of  departmental science. Hence, its inclusion in the ChAES problem  in the role of "observer" over the safe exploitation of the  stations means only one thing: The Academy of Sciences' task is  to warn in good time all other organizations interested in this  problem that from such and such point in time the technical base  of ChAES precludes the ability to be safely exploited and  therefore the station needs to be closed.    Perhaps for the first time in the history of all science  organizations and institutions in the world the Ukrainian  Academy of Sciences is tasked with overseeing the safety of an  individual enterprise with about 7,000 employees. This is an  unprecedented instance in the history of world science.    [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Perhaps the authority of the Ukrainian  Academy of Sciences simply will deflect harsh criticism  currently aimed at Derzhkomatom?    [Shcherbyna] Well, the Derzhkomatom needs not only help, but  complete and unconditional help in this issue, which is,  generally speaking, secondary for the Ukrainian nuclear power  generation as a whole. This is something to think about for  everyone: parliament members, voters, and officials in the  executive power structures.    Our country's nuclear power generation sector is at the  earliest stage of its independent development. And therefore all  serious decisions set a precedent. Also, as we know from  history, it is easier to make a precedent a practice than to  root it out of practice. Hence, essentially this decision is  equivalent to an admission that in Ukraine there are matters  more important than the ensuring nonrepetition of the Chernobyl  catastrophe...    [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Will not, perhaps, our descendants find  such "conclusions" criminal?    [Shcherbyna] I hope we ourselves will not come to the point  seeing it that way.</p>

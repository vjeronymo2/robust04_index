			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: WPP in Dollars 14.6m disposal WPP, the heavily-indebted marketing services group, has sold its 64 per cent interest in Fallon McElligott, the US advertising agency, for Dollars 14.6m (Pounds 9.6m), writes Diane Summers. The group owns 80 per cent of Scali, McCabe, Slaves, the US advertising network, which, in turn, owns 80 per cent of Fallon McElligott. WPP said Dollars 10m of the Dollars 14.6m was paid in cash and the balance in an interest-bearing note repayable over five years. The group said the effect of Fallon's results on WPP's consolidated revenue and trading profits had been 'immaterial'. The sale, which was to Fallon's management, 'does not give rise to any material exceptional charge or gain,' said WPP. In the half year to June 30 WPP's average net debt was Pounds 372m. Last month it sold Seiniger Advertising, the Los Angeles-based producer of marketing campaigns for films, for Dollars 6.9m.</p>

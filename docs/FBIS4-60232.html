			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, May 21 (AFP) -- Aden authorities  proclaimed early Saturday an independent state in South Yemen,  16 days after becoming embroiled in a civil war with northern  government forces.    Announcing the secession from the north after one of the  bloodiest days of fighting since the conflict began, the south's  leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid said in a televised address: "I  proclaim the creation of the Yemeni Democratic Republic as an  independent state with its capital in Aden."    The declaration came just a day before the fourth  anniversary  of the unification of North and South Yemen and hours after the  north called a three-day ceasefire.    The two sides, locked in a political crisis since August  1993, have been at war since May 4.    Al-Bid said the decision to break away resulted from  attempts  by his bitter northern rival, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, to  "destroy the south" by means of war, and his refusal to  countenance dialogue on the basis of a bilateral reconciliation  document signed February 20 in Amman.    He said the new state, which he called on "friendly"  countries to recognize in line with international norms, would  be governed by the same constitution as that in force in the  north.    It would base its legislative system on Islamic Shari'ah  law,  he added.    He also announced the formation of a Council of National  Salvation comprising elected southern deputies, representatives  of political parties and religious figures, which will choose a  Presidential Council and an interim government, adding that  multi-party elections would be held within a year.    Al-Bid, Salih's sacked vice president and the leader of  South  Yemen prior to unification, said the new state was committed to  respecting "political and public freedoms, human rights and  freedom of expression and of the press," and would maintain a  liberal economic system.    The announcement prompted spontaneous celebratory gunfire  throughout the southern port city, correspondents said.    It was also backed early Saturday by 'Abd-al-Rahman  Al-Jifri,  leader of the opposition Sons of Yemen movement, who told AFP  the union "could not continue under (the Sanaa) regime," which  had sought to control it "by use of force".    Salih's General People's Congress and Al-Bid's Yemen  Socialist Party had formed a fragile governing coalition after  April 1993 elections.    The declaration came after a day of bitter fighting amid  increasing pressure from Arab leaders for an end to hostilities.    Hours earlier the government in Sanaa called a three-day  ceasefire as of Saturday 00:00 a.m. (Friday 2100 GMT), the SABA'  news agency said.    Northern leaders presented the truce as offering "a last  chance to the (southern) separatists ... to end their  rebellion, adhere to the constitution and place their troops  under the command of the head of state" in Sanaa.    Earlier in the day Salih seemingly ignored appeals from  Egyptian President Husni Mubarak and Palestine Liberation  Organisation leader Yasir 'Arafat to lay down arms for the 'Id  Al-Adha feast, which starts Saturday.    But in Mukallah, 700 kilometers (450 miles) east of Aden,  Al-Bid ruled out any form of surrender and vowed "not to give up  a single inch of our territory in the south."    In a radio speech he said Salih was "trying to get his hands  on Aden and the oil-rich eastern provinces and we are not going  to let him have either Aden or the oil."    A spokesman for the southern forces here said 1,500 northern  troops had been killed Friday in the Kharaz region west of Aden  while trying to advance on the city.    The death toll, which was not confirmed by the north, was  the  largest daily loss announced since the fighting broke out.    Earlier Friday northern forces claimed to have made further  progress in advancing on Aden.    The southern army had also retaken control of the key  Al-'Anad airbase 60 kilometres (35 miles) north of Aden, the  spokesman said, although earlier in the day Sanaa said its  forces controlled the airbase.    Despite unification in 1990, the north and south have  persisted in retaining separate security forces, civil services  and bureaucracies.</p>

The intergovernment agreement "on the  procedure for the unification of the Belarus system with the  Russian Federation monetary system and the mechanism for the  functioning of a common monetary system" was signed.    Its successful implementation could serve as the start of  the  ruble zone and raise integration processes in the CIS to a  qualitatively new level. Unfortunately, the reverse is also  true: Failure could seriously delay these processes. That fear  is by no means unfounded. The experience of many of the CIS'  good initiatives which have disappeared into the sand requires  heightened circumspection and responsibility here.    In assessing the objective chances of success we must  highlight the main point -- the optimum selection of partners on  the basis "of love and calculation," as the saying goes: The  mutual sympathy of the two countries' peoples, the contiguity of  their territories, their close economic ties. Suffice it to say  that Belarus sells nearly one third of its GNP in Russia,  acquiring in exchange rolled metal, cement, petroleum products,  gas, and other things. But the successful combination of  partners and their desire to unite their monetary systems still  do not guarantee success. After all, it is a case of a unique  step unprecedented in world practice. Consequently, the most  serious preparatory work is needed.    The foundation of this work was laid by the agreement of a  program nature between Russia and Belarus concluded in September  last year. Something has already been done, particularly in the  field of coordinating foreign economic, trade, and customs  policy. But radical questions of the interaction of the two  countries' budgets and in particular questions of the normal  functioning of two emission banks with a single currency have  not been sufficiently worked out in such a short time.    In addition to unresolved problems new problems have arisen  in recent months, complicating the unification of the monetary  systems. The first act here is the replacement of Belarusian  rubles with Russian ones. In September 1993 the exchange rate  was 1.5 Belarusian rubles for 1 ruble. The one for one  principle stipulated by the program agreement for the exchange  of money did not give rise to any special objections at the  time. But since then the market exchange rate of the Belarusian  ruble -- the "hare" -- has declined to 5 for 1 Russian ruble.  But in the January agreement the "hare's" exchange rate against  the ruble remains the same. Of course the currency exchange  rate is determined not only by their purchasing power but also  by supply and demand, the saturation of the market, and other  factors. Nonetheless the correlation of one to one for the  exchange of Belarusian rubles for Russian rubles now seems  absolutely unacceptable. The September agreement on the  unification of the monetary systems has been approved by a  parliamentary majority in Belarus. It must be supposed that the  January agreements will also be ratified there. But the Russian  Duma will hardly agree to such a disadvantageous exchange of  money.    We know the relatively recent experience of the exchange of  GDR marks for FRG marks after Germany's reunification. The  nonequivalence of the exchange produced many additional  difficulties even for that country's prosperous economy. To  avoid inflation additional taxes had to be introduced in its  western lands. Russia, where tax rates are already excessive,  is barred from such a route. Consequently, nonequivalent  exchange could intensify inflation.    To determine a rational rate for the exchange of "hares"  for Russian rubles regular exchange sales of Belarusian currency  are needed -- to refine its quotation price; we must also  calculate the cost of similar selections of consumer items in  Belarusian and Russian rubles -- to compare their purchasing  power.    The drastic decline of the Belarusian ruble exchange rate in  recent months makes concern for the stability of the future  joint monetary system -- not only statically, at the moment of  unification, but also dynamically -- particularly topical. And  the main thing for this stability is to ensure that market  reforms are conducted in synchrony. Hence Belarus' task of  accelerating the liberalization of prices and privatization,  bringing them up to Russia's level.    In conclusion, it must be admitted that less than four  months  have not been enough for such a complex and crucial matter.  Time out essential for the more thorough working through of the  problem is in my view preferable to hasty decisions. But there  are grounds for fearing that political motives will yet again  prevail over economic expediency and the fundamentally necessary  agreement will in practice become a heavy burden to the Russian  economy.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Plea to defend Europe's cultural identity SOME 4,400 actors, producers and authors from France and elsewhere in Europe yesterday signed a plea for Europe's 'cultural identity' to be kept from being submerged in the Gatt trade negotiations. The appeal, which appeared in Le Monde and other newspapers, coincided with the release this week of Germinal - Emile Zola's classic novel of 19th century miners' misery which Mr Claude Berri, the film director, has turned into France's most expensive film. The French film industry is hoping the FFr160m (Pounds 18.22m) film, subsidised by national and local authorities, will help counter inroads from such Hollywood blockbusters as Jurassic Park, which is shortly to hit French cinemas, and highlight the importance of keeping the country's elaborate system of support for French and European films outside Gatt's trade liberalisation rules. Germinal goes on release today after a premiere in Lille on Monday night attended by President Francois Mitterrand, Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, and many of the cast that ranged from big stars like Gerard Depardieu to former miners employed as extras. The move by the Nord/Pas de Calais regional council to invest FFr10m in the film has been sharply criticised by Mr Bruno Bonduelle, president of APIM, the region's development agency, as 'a catastrophe' for an area that is seeking to shed its rust-belt image and to attract modern investment, including the planned European central bank. But Ms Marie-Christine Blandin, the Green politician who heads the regional council, defended the film as reminding audiences of the 'dignity and solidarity' of the miners. 'If culture cannot be treated as an exception in the Gatt negotiations, Europe's cultural identity will die,' Mr Berri said this week. The French government is pressing the European Commission to insist that audiovisual broadcasting be kept out of the world trade talks. Paris fears that eventually Gatt rules could be used by the US, first to dismantle the quota system requiring French TV stations to fill no less than 60 per cent of their prime air time with EC-made programmes, and then to attack film subsidies.</p>

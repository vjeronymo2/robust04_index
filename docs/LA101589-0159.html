			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> ST. FRANCIS LOSES IN BATTLE FOR THIRD  </P> <P> St. Francis High and St. John Bosco entered Saturday night's Del Rey League  opener with losing records and high hopes of resurrecting their seasons. After  all, somebody has to finish third behind Loyola and Crespi.  </P> <P> And visiting St. John Bosco retained those hopes after soundly beating the  Golden Knights, 38-6.  </P> <P> The Braves (3-3 overall) ran at will, gaining 313 yards on the ground and 441  total yards.  </P> <P> "They played an excellent game and they prepared for us very well," St. Francis  Coach Bill Garrison said.  </P> <P> St. John Bosco tailback Anthony Bull gained 134 yards in 17 carries and scored  on runs of three, 10 and 76 yards.  </P> <P> Sergio Diaz added 98 yards in nine carries, including a four-yard scoring run.  </P> <P> The Braves had built a 30-0 lead before St. Francis (1-5) scored.  </P> <P> On the first play of the fourth quarter, Golden Knights quarterback John Willis  hit Marty Konrad with a 46-yard touchdown pass. Willis completed nine of 22 for  142 yards.  </P> <P> Tailback Pete Morales gained 63 yards in 13 carries for St. Francis.  Considering the numbers, St. Francis was fortunate to trail at the half by only  17 points.  </P> <P> The Braves, who outgained the Knights, 213 yards to 66, scored on three of  their four first-half possessions. On their fourth, the drive stalled on the  Golden Knights' 22.  </P> <P> Bull scored on first-half runs of three and 10 yards, and kicker Nomar  Garciaparra added a 24-yard field goal to give St. John Bosco its lead going  into the half.  </P> <P> The Braves' defense did its share as well, limiting St. Francis to six rushing  yards and sacking Willis twice.

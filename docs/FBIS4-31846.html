			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Serbian Troops Breach"] </F>   [Text] NOVA MAKEDONIJA cites anonymous Macedonian [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and police  sources on confirmation of reports on an army camp put up by 15  Serbian soldiers near Kriva Palanka, who occupied surrounding  peak elevation and strategic points for observation of the  Macedonian territory. The same sources also report that the  Macedonian troops are enforced on this side of the border and  that this "breach" of Serbian soldiers, made into Macedonian  territory, is surrounded by Macedonian Army troops, who have an  order only to observe for the time being.</p>

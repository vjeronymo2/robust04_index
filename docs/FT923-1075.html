			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Major puts ERM membership on indefinite hold: Smith calls Tory leader the 'devalued prime minister of a devalued government' MR JOHN MAJOR put British membership of the European exchange rate mechanism on indefinite hold yesterday in the face of a bruising onslaught at Westminster on the disin-tegration of his economic strategy. Speaking just hours before Mr David Mellor's departure from the cabinet delivered a further blow to his embattled government, Mr Major said: 'I do not believe that we shall be able to go back into the mechanism soon, or into the same mechanism we left.' A commanding parliamentary debut as Labour leader by Mr John Smith in the emergency debate served notice on Mr Major that he faces a challenging time in the Commons chamber over the next few years. In a wounding attack Mr Smith declared Mr Major was now 'the devalued prime minister of a devalued government'. Mr Major's comments, confirming that domestic economic recovery is now the government's first priority, brought an immediate surge in equity prices on London's financial markets. The FT-SE 100 index closed up 40.7 at 2621.2. The prime minister's speech followed a long debate at a full meeting of the cabinet about the direction of economic and European policy. An increasingly hawkish Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, insisted that the cabinet drop its previous formula that the pound would be put back into the system 'as soon as conditions allow', in favour of the demands for reform of the ERM set out later by Mr Major. Pro-European ministers such as Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, wanted a firmer commitment to re-entry. But they acknowledged that the recent turmoil in the ERM had strengthened the chancellor's position. Senior ministers said that Mr Major's phrasing meant Britain would probably remain out of the system for at least six months and quite possibly for a year or more. Mr Lamont confirmed that view in a combative speech in which he launched a sharp attack on Professor Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank. Using phrases that will exacerbate the rift between the British and German authorities, but which won him loud applause from his own backbenches, Mr Lamont blamed the Bundesbank for the final speculative attack on sterling. The subsequent judgment offered by MPs on the most difficult speech of Mr Major's career was that it was a brave performance in which he had held the line. Mr Lamont meanwhile had defused speculation about his immediate future. But to the fury of Mr Major's Euro-sceptics, the prime minister reaffirmed his commitment to ratification of the Maastricht treaty. In what the pro-European cabinet ministers claimed as an important victory, the prime minister declared there was no future for Britain as a 'sour, isolated country off the mainland of Europe'. The prime minister sought to negotiate the treacherous fault-lines in his party over Europe by emphasising the setting of a new condition for implementation of the agreement on European union. Referring to next month's emergency summit of EC leaders, Mr Major said that the Community would have to give substance to the notion enshrined in Maastricht of subsidiarity - the devolution of decision-making to national governments. Under constant sniping from Tory Euro-sceptics, he emphasised his continuing support for Maastricht, arguing that a British prime minister could not sign an international treaty and then disown it. Last night prominent Euro-sceptics claimed the signatures of more than 50 Tory MPs for a Commons motion declaring that the government should re-assert national control of economic policy by keeping the pound permanently outside the ERM. Half-a-dozen of them abstained in last night's vote to reinforce the protest. Mr Major did not spell out in detail the reforms of the exchange rate system that the government would be seeking. But Mr Lamont emphasised the need for a sustained fall in German interest rates. Other proposed changes focus both on technical matters of intervention and on the fundamental issue of sharing responsibility for changes in monetary policy between strong and weak currency governments. In an effort to reassure financial markets, Mr Major emphasised the government's determination to stick to its public spending targets. Mr Lamont will tell cabinet colleagues later today that meeting the Pounds 244.5bn target for next year will involve cuts in sensitive budgets across Whitehall. The cabinet committee charged with sharing out the resources will consider plans for cash reductions in the health service budget, a squeeze on discretionary benefits and large cuts in Whitehall's capital spending programmes.

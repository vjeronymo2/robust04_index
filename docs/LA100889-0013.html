			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MR. CLEAN LIGHTS OUT FOR THE TERRITORY;  </P> <P> EXIT THE RAINMAKER BY JONATHAN COLEMAN; (ATHENEUM: $18.95; 402 PP.)  </P> <P> In late May, 1982, Jay Carsey, good-looking, upwardly mobile WASP, charismatic  president of Charles County Community College, highly paid government  consultant and pillar of Southern Maryland society, took off for  God-knows-where, leaving behind a series of enigmatic messages to his gorgeous  wife, admiring colleagues and loyal friends. Though the messages told where the  keys and the bank accounts were and bore witness that Carsey, ever Mr. Clean,  was not dropping out of sight on account of any financial monkey business,  there were no clear indications of why Carsey was leaving everyone in the lurch  like this.  </P> <P> Graduation was only days away. The college, after the heady expansions of the  Kennedy-Johnson years, was beginning to experience the contractions of the  Reagan era. And though Carsey took with him less than $30,000 and left behind a  fairly substantial estate, he provided his abandoned unemployed wife with no  clear title and the dreary prospect of pursuing her property through the  courts. Once the police had eliminated the possibilities of suicide and foul  play, people were left with no coherent explanation. After all, Jay Carsey --  "Uncle Jay" to (it seemed) all of Southern Maryland -- was the one person you  could always count on. But Carsey's farewell messages were pellucid on a couple  of points: He had planned this stunt carefully and he had no intention of  returning or of being found -- ever.  </P> <P> To John Sine, dean of the college and his obvious successor, Carsey left a  color postcard of Ronald and Nancy Reagan with an inscription that referred to  the title role Crasey had played in a production that Sine had directed when  the two first met years earlier: "Exit the Rainmaker. Good luck."  </P> <P> Jonathan Coleman, who first reported this story for CBS News, is no ordinary  investigator. With the tenacity of a scientist, the patience of a novelist, and  the instincts of a hunter, he pursues Jay Carsey's motivation -- through the  events of his life and the remembrances of his family, friends, and  acquaintances. (The man had virtually no enemies.) The gradual accretion of  detail gives you the feeling of watching the restoration of a ruined mosaic.  Seemingly random tesserae assume their place in the pattern; a detailed  portrait begins to emerge from the pieces.  </P> <P> About halfway through the book, Coleman actually catches up with Carsey in  person, only to find that the man himself is no less enigmatic than the  messages he left behind. Nonetheless, as this antic narrative draws to its  conclusion, you feel satisfied that Coleman has "got" Carsey -- at least as  well as one man can ever get another -- that the mystery of Carsey's flight has  been dispelled, and that you are left only to puzzle about whether Carsey did  the right or the wrong thing in throwing over his life and loves the way he  did. Coleman himself refuses to help the reader with this judgement, retaining  to the last the stance of the clinical observer and never permitting himself  the dubious joys of the moralist.  </P> <P> How many Jay Carseys are there in America? Very few -- at least among the  middle class -- would act on their fantasies as he did. But how many are there  who have such fantasies? Almost everyone, Coleman discovers in his interviews.  Some fantasists confess their admiration of Carsey openly; others, fearing that  the thinnest line separates their grueling treadmills of responsibility from  Carsey's footloose dereliction, rail against him. But in their railing, Coleman  rightly hears the telltale noises of excessive protestation.  </P> <P> Coleman gets something wrong, I think, and that is his assumption of the  universality of Carsey's story: "If the life (Carsey) had been living was  irrevocably American, his decision to light out was far more universal." But  "lighting out" is a typically American phenomenon -- is, in truth, part and  parcel of the national literary myth that Leslie Fiedler limned so arrestingly  in "Love and Death in the American Novel" many moons ago. Even the phrase  Coleman uses is a (it would seem, unconscious) borrowing from Huck Finn, who  articulated his intention to "light out for the territory" before Aunt Sally  could "sivilize" him.  </P> <P> Fiedler also pointed out that the white male's fantasy of flight (preferably in  the company of a darker-skinned, more elemental male) usually is prompted by a  castrating female who represents civilization at its most repressive. Who was  Jay Carsey's Aunt Sally? The answer is not far to find. He had two: his mother  and his wife. It was his mother who programmed him to be the best, to shine at  everything. (His father, incidentally, served as the pattern of male inwardness  and control.) It was his wife who saw to it that all Jay's screws were screwed  as tight as could be -- in service to her needs and whims and an  acquisitiveness as cosmic as Imelda Marcos'. Both these women were the objects  of Carsey's hidden rage, a rage so buried it could only be expressed in flight.  For Carsey's flight resulted in his mother's heart attack and death and years  of anguish for his (at last, ex-) wife, Nancy.  </P> <P> But though this story may not have quite the universal ring that Coleman  ascribes to it (I think it would be incomprehensible in most of the Southern  Hemisphere and off-putting even in parts of Europe), it is a fascinating  symbolic statement of the American psyche. In a time when the psychological  models of Freud, Jung, Lacan et al have been criticized as too culturally  specific to have universal relevance, "Exit the Rainmaker" points to the need  for diverse, culturally specific models of the psyche that are not Viennese or  Swiss or Parisian. It points to a crying need for Americans to reexamine the  WASP model of psychological health: tough, dry humor, thank you; win at tennis;  win at business; win at squash; leave the bar clear-eyed, though mind is  totally drowned by very dry martinis; and no emotion, please.  </P> <P> Most important, "Exit the Rainmaker" points to what may be America's most  pressing need of all: to reunite its emotional life and its spiritual life in a  new, integrated whole. The phenomenal sales, during the last decade, of one  attempt to create such an integration, Scott Peck's "The Road Less Traveled,"  give some indication of how pressing the need is. If the Puritan model, from  which the WASP caricature has sprung, won't do any longer, what will? (In this  endeavor of integration the majority culture might at last appropriate from the  ethnic minorities gifts of more lasting value than the pizza, bagels, and feta  cheese it already has received so avidly.)  </P> <P> Given the book's importance in explaining us to ourselves, it is a shame it has  not been better edited. Some judicious pruning would have eliminated needless  padding and fuzzy circumlocutions. Coleman, who usually sounds like a  minor-league E.B. White, can occasionally write like a meandering freshman.  This book, like Coleman's first one, the equally fascinating "At Mother's  Request," was accepted at Atheneum by Tom Stewart, one of the publishing  industry's last gentlemen and a great editor. By the time the "Rainmaker"  manuscript was delivered, Stewart was gone, another casualty in the sad war of  quality vs. greed that has made Publisher's Row an annex of Movieland. Too bad  Atheneum didn't care about the book enough to get down to the job of editing  it.  </P></p>

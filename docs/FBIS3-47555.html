			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview With LDP's Seiichi Ota by Shinzo Oshima, editor </F> in chief; in Tokyo on 12 August: "Does the Liberal Democratic  Party Have a Future?"]    [Text] Seiichi Ota, Member of the House of  Representatives and Representative Sponsor for Creating a New  LDP [Liberal Democratic Party]    [Oshima] I see you are tall. What are your height and  weight?    [Ota] Height is 186 centimeters and weight is 84 kilograms.    [Oshima] Come to think of it, Former House of  Representatives  Yoshio Sakurauchi was also tall.    [Ota] Yes. For his generation, he was on the tall side.    [Oshima] I would assume you inherited your tallness from  your  mother's side.    [Ota] My mother (who was named Toshiko and was the younger  sister of former Speaker Sakurauchi of the House of  Representatives) was 168 centimeters. And, that was on the tall  side for someone born in the Taisho era.    [Oshima] By the way, how many years did you spend as a  college instructor?    [Ota] Six years, since I worked in universities from the age  of 28 to 34.    [Oshima] Had you hoped to become a college professor from  your younger days?    [Ota] I did not feel that way when I entered college. When I  finished college, I felt I did not want to restrict my lifetime  outlook and went on to graduate school. Once you proceed to  graduate school, you become restricted to a teaching career. The  more time you spend in graduate school, the harder it becomes to  find employment.    [Oshima] Did you have your eye on potential future career  paths when you decided to teach at Fukuoka University in your  hometown?    [Ota] I accepted a job there because the chairman of the  Economics Department strongly urged me to take the job at the  school. It was a case where I did not have the luxury of  selecting the university I would teach at.    [Oshima] For someone who later became the action group  leader  of the LDP, I admire you for having tolerated research work for  as many as six years.    [Ota] Oh, but I never disliked working in a college  environment. Even now, I feel that I would like to return to the  college environment if my political career were to come to an  end. Given a preference, I feel that my real place in life is to  engage in economic research.  <H5>  Strict Assistant Professor </H5>   [Oshima] What was your specialty in the area of economics?    [Ota] Economic theory. I taught economic theory. Another  name  for economic theory is mathematical economics, but I did not  treat the study of this discipline as something trivial but as  the starting point for my career.    [Oshima] Did you feel you were popular among your students?    [Ota] No. I was not popular among my students. I was strict  with my students. Roughly 40 percent of the students failed my  courses. Of special note is that 60 percent of the students  failed the test that immediately preceded my candidacy as a  member of the House of Representatives. Thus, the students that  I graded in my final year at the college held ill feelings  towards me. The situation was such that the students formed a  "group to demand the firing of seiichi Ota" (laugh).    [Oshima] Why is it that an assistant college professor  changed careers to the political world which is a maelstrom of  Machiavellianism?    [Ota] Economics involves the construction of models of the  real world and attendant analysis of results emanating from  their prescribed manipulation. The discipline is a world in  which one performs a constant check on the accuracy and  realistic traits of the model. I would imagine that anyone  specializing in economics will at one time or another hope that  he could participate in the real economic world. He should  aspire to join the political world, if the opportunity were to  present itself.    [Oshima] Would I be correct in saying that politics was one  of your career options from your younger days?    [Ota] During my college days, I used to journey to Shimane  Prefecture for each House of Representative election to make  roadside speeches on behalf of my uncle (former Speaker  Sakurauchi of the House of Representatives). I always held in  the back of my mind the idea that life does provide that  particular career option.    Once he became a Diet member, Mr. Ota began to  demonstrate himself to be a combative type far removed from  scholarly characteristics. He consistently attacked the Tanaka  and Takeshita forces. His attacks were such that they were not  typical of a member belonging to the "noble members" of the  Miyazawa faction. When former Prime Minister Tanaka was found  guilty in his initial trial, an LDP consensus was formed to  "remove Tanaka" which was led by Mr. Ota.    When suspicions were directed at Prime Minister Noboru  Takeshita in connection with the Recruit scandal, Ota joined  Shizuka Kamei, Takeo Hiranuma, and Katsuhiko Shirakawa to form  the "Jiyukakushindoshikai" and initiated a movement to overthrow  the Takeshita cabinet. In this connection, when Prime Minister  Takeshita designated Mr. Sosuke Uno as his successor, this group  reacted by attempting to promote the candidacy of Mr. Ganri  Yamashita. Further, this interview was hurriedly conducted,  after 1600 hours, 12 August immediately following the plenary  session, in Room 432 of the House of Representatives Members  Building No. 2.    [Oshima] I was following the activities of the  "Jiyukakushindoshikai" which was formed by Mr. Ota and others  with interest because of its lively activities, but it seems the  organization is no longer active.    [Ota] Of the four leaders, Mr. Katsuhiko Shirakawa later  lost  an election, although he has since been reelected. And, Mr.  Shizuka Kamei and Mr. Takeo Hiranuma have been appointed  responsible positions in the Mitsuzuka faction and no longer  participate in antiestablishment movements (laugh). That leaves  me all by myself.    In the past, there were very few LDP Diet members who  assumed  a clear-cut critical stand against Mr. Kanemaru. During the  broadcasting of my political views during the last House of  Representatives election, I gave a speech on the theme that we  must eliminate the two-tier power structure. At least until the  first half of last year, I was the only one that assumed an  unequivocal stand against the Keiseikai (Takeshita faction).    [Oshima] What sort of position did your next-door associate  take?    [Ota] Mr. Shokei Arai (Room 433 of the House of  Representatives Diet Members' Building No.2) assumed a clear-cut  anti-Keiseikai position from the summer of 1992.    [Oshima] Were any threats posed by the Keiseikai?    [Ota] Various things happened, but they were not of a nature  that would prompt me to become discouraged about my ideas. Even  now, some politicians do harbor Keiseikai-type concepts.    Waging struggles against such concepts is one of my life  philosophies. Even Mr. Kanemaru and Mr. Ichiro Ozawa know that I  am that type of individual.  <H5>  We Are the True Reformists of the Founder </H5>   [Oshima] As I recall, it was the fall of 1992 that you  initiated a move to impeach Kanemaru.    [Ota] We formed the "Group To Recover Confidence in the LDP"  for the purpose of impeaching Mr. Kanemaru. We started out with  a group of seven, but by the time Mr. Kanemaru resigned, it had  grown to about 20 members.    [Oshima] I understand that group evolved into the "Group To  Create a New LDP." How many members do you have now?    [Ota] Forty-six.    [Oshima] I see that does not equal the 47 warriors of the  feudal days, but was there not a time when the various political  incidents prompted the group of 45 to secede from the party?    [Ota] What point in time are you speaking of?    [Oshima] I was thinking of the middle of June of this year,  just before and after the vote of no confidence was cast against  the Miyazawa cabinet.    [Ota] At that time, both myself and Shokei Arai had no  perception that a problem existed. It was a time when the  situation was in great turmoil. At that time, the issue did not  concern an overall political reform, but simply the issue of  election system reform. Both myself and Mr. Arai are of the  opinion that election system reform should be implemented, but  we cannot agree with the position that that alone will cover the  entire issue. I also cannot logically understand the creation of  a new party on the premise of election system reform.    The term reformist is used too lightly. They say that  reformists are involved in the revision of the election system,  but the question arises as to how things stood if we turn the  clock back to the fall of last year. At that time we were the  reformists. At that time our foremost political reform issues  concerned the proposed resignation of Mr. Kanemaru who was the  unquestioned symbol of money corruption, breakup of the  Keiseikai, and an end to control of Diet members by factional  alliances.    [Oshima] So I see. The members of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] were sustaining Mr. Kanemaru.    [Ota] It was not a case of sustaining Mr. Kanemaru, but  acting as if they were Mr. Kanemaru himself.    Further, young politicians such as Shigeru Ishiba of the  "Group Calling for the Establishment of Political Reform" did  not utter one word during the Kanemaru incident. That particular  reformist group failed to play any role in connection with the  Kanemaru incident or the breakup of the Keiseikai.  <H5>  Era of Political Parties Is Gone </H5>   [Oshima] Many things have happened, but I get the impression  that party politics stands at a crossroad.    [Ota] I believe the era of political parties has ended. I  believe it would be detrimental to allow the political party  known as the LDP to remain in control of the situation. The  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is detrimental and so  is the Japan New Party (JNP). In essence, the struggle between  socialism and liberalism has ended. The significance of having  established political parties no longer exists.    [Oshima] Oh.    [Ota] Why was the LDP formed in 1955? The right and left  factions of the Socialist Party combined and the Liberal Party  and Democratic Party combined as if to follow suit. It was a  case of the SOPJ creating the LDP. Now that the reason for  existence of the SDPJ no longer exists, the same is true with  the LDP. A middle-of-the-road political party was created  because the confrontation between the two parties was not a  desirable situation. Once the significance of LDP-SDPJ existence  is gone, the significance of a middle-of-the-road party is also  lost.    [Oshima] Then, what happens to the political world?    [Ota] We should organize the Diet into an organization that  respects the independence of individual Diet members, because  differences in opinions among individual Diet members do exist  in the final analysis. Political parties can be left in ruin,  but political actions should be taken on the merits of the  visions and convictions of individual Diet members.    I believe the parliamentary democracy found in the United  States would be a good format. Members of the U.S. Democratic  and Republican Parties are not restricted by party decisions.  Individual congressmen cast their votes based on their own  responsibility and then seek a showing of confidence from  individual constituents. Although they belong to a party, the  system provides for a very high degree of independence on the  part of the congressmen.    [Oshima] In Japan, it appears little consideration is given  to the independence of Diet members.    [Ota] Differences in views between Diet members are greater  than differences in views between political parties. As an  example, differences in opinion between Mr. Koko Sato, formerly  of the LDP Executive Department, and me were greater than those  between me and SDPJ Diet members of the same age group. This  fact becomes readily obvious when individual comparisons are  made.    When a majority vote is sought in the Diet, the individual  parties begin to pressure their members and the situation is  wrought with complications. Individual executive departments  establish ties with any one to protect their predominant  positions. The result is Diet decisions which are biased. I  believe an entirely different outcome would result from a true  majority decision.    [Oshima] I will pose a vulgar question, but relative to  orders from LDP President Yohei Kono, orders from Kochikai  leader Kiichi Miyazawa, and the will of the Group To Create a  New LDP, where do you place your priorities?    [Ota] The LDP president is not allowed to issue orders. The  LDP acts only on the basis of consensus. The question becomes  one of how much of a role I play in the creation of a consensus  for the LDP. Even Mr. Miyazawa does not issue orders. When the  Kochikai is in the process of forming a consensus, I make a  variety of statements in an attempt to reflect my opinions.    [Oshima] If Mr. Masayoshi Ohira were still alive, you would  have complied with his orders. I believe you're saying that no  such person exists at the present time.    [Ota] No, you're in slight error. Each individual Diet  member  enjoys the confidence of the general public. If I were required  to comply with orders from Mr. Miyazawa, you would think that  constituents of the Third District in Hiroshima ranked higher  than the constituents of the First District in Fukuoka. I  believe we should not be placed in the position of being issued  orders.    Needless to say, I do compromise and make concessions in  order to form a consensus, but if I were placed in the position  of receiving unilateral orders from someone, I would be guilty  of a breach of trust in relation to my constituents.    [Oshima] I understand there are a number of political  parties  where rank-and-file Diet members are unilaterally issued orders  (laugh).    [Ota] The LDP has some value because it does not act in  compliance with someone's orders as they do in Shinseito,  Komeito, and the Japan Communist Party (JCP). They speak of  strict control by the faction or strict control by the Executive  Department, but in comparison to other parties, the LDP is  relatively free of strict control.    [Oshima] Yes, that seems to be the case. Now that you say  so,  I understand the situation.    [Ota] I believe the highest estimate of those LDP Diet  members who can say the party did something for them in the  process of becoming politicians is 10 or 20 percent. That gives  you an idea of how small a role the party plays in the creation  of a single LDP Diet member. I was fortunate in being officially  recognized from the very beginning, but there are very few  junior Diet members who waged their first election campaigns  with the blessing of the party.  <H5>  Diathesis of Shinseito and Komeito </H5>   [Oshima] Have you ever met a senior politician who was  willing to sacrifice himself for a cause?    [Ota] Never. I have done a number of things in the  establishment of the Miyazawa government, thinking that it would  be a good cause, but without his orders. Even in connection with  the Kanemaru scandal, his downfall should have provided for  conditions conducive to placing Miyazawa in a position to more  easily exercise leadership. We took action for the downfall of  Kanemaru, but Miyazawa failed to assume leadership in forming a  second cabinet. I was very disappointed because of his failure  to act.    I will not say that I was the only one to continuously  advise  Mr. Miyazawa within the Miyazawa faction to run in elections for  party president, but there were only a few who did so. In fact,  there were more individuals who according to the circumstances  then prevailing advised him that it was not the right time and  that he should side with someone with more potential.    [Oshima] What do you fear most about the Hosokawa  government?    [Ota] I believe the Hosokawa government is in reality the  Shinseito government. Very strong leadership is being exercised  by Shinseito and Komeito. I am very concerned about this  situation.    Although this may sound just like the criticism addressed  relative to the Keiseikai at one time, the reason is that  Keiseikai was not a place for healthy debate within the faction.  It was of the same diathesis as the Communist Party and Komeito.  In previous times, when Mr. Kanemaru or Mr. Ozawa said, "Face  right," everyone faced right without any discussion whatsoever.    If one were to speak of the strong unity, the flip side of  the coin would have revealed that particular situation. It was a  unified group in which individualism was suppressed, giving  birth to such a situation. The faction was plagued by those  circumstances from the days of Mr. Tanaka. I for one rebelled at  the situation. Both Komeito and the Shinseito are plagued by  such a diathesis.    [Oshima] True. They have much in common.    [Ota] Yes. They are similar. I believe that organizations  that do not allow for open debate by individual Diet members are  a very detrimental existence to the principles of democracy in  this nation.    Even Mr. Morihiro Hosokawa first said, "I will follow a  third  path," next spoke of "cooperation from outside the cabinet" and  then became prime minister. He went through three stages.    In effect, he took advantage of Shinseito and Komeito.  Leadership is being exercised from and everything is influenced  by pronouncements from these two parties. I believe that  situation makes for a very frightening future.    [Oshima] Both Shinseito and Komeito are formidable  opponents.    [Ota] And, they are able to wage strong election campaigns.  Setting aside the question of whether one should join Shinseito  or Komeito, there is an atmosphere that indicates individuals  who are not sympathizers will not be able to survive. If the  situation remains unchanged, they'll be able to win 70 percent  of the Diet seats. If one were to think of the future, he might  visualize fascism. If an election were to be held under the  single-seat constituency system under current conditions, I  believe we will see the creation of Japanese politics controlled  by fascism. The general public will probably awaken to reality  when that happens, but then it will be too late.    [Oshima] You are speaking of a loud victorious laugh coming  from Ichiro Ozawa and Taisaku Ikeda.    [Ota] Yes.    [Oshima] How do you view the relationship between these two  prominent individuals?    [Ota] I believe an agreement had been reached before [Ozawa]  left the LDP. He was able to leave the LDP with confidence  because an agreement had been reached beforehand.    [Oshima] Is this a case of a two-phased material and  psychological alliance?    [Ota] I cannot address the material facet because I have not  seen the evidence, but reality shows evidence of a monolith.  Agreement on this point had been reached way back, because  before the Shinseito was established, there was constant  agreement in utterances by Hata, Ozawa, and the Komeito from the  time the duo became public information.    [Oshima] How would you respond if one questioned you about a  future for the LDP?    [Ota] At the present time, we have seven parties and one  faction or eight parties, depending on how you count, but if the  various non-LDP parties and factions were to unite, the LDP  probably has no future. If the small electoral district system  is approved, there is a strong possibility that our party will  go from 40 percent to 30 percent of the Diet seats. If that  happens, I feel we're not going to be able to make a recovery.  Even if a recovery were possible, it'll probably take 10 years.    [Oshima] The statement that there is no tomorrow for the LDP  reflects some degree of reality.    [Ota] You are right. Regaining control of the government  will  require fundamental change. I believe doing so is the mission of  our particular generation.    [Boxed item: Representative Seiichi Ota was born 30  October 1945 in Fukuoka city. He is currently 47 years old. His  father Seinosuke was chairman of the Hakata Daimaru Department  Stores. He was graduated from Keio High School and Keio  University Economics Department and earned a doctorate in  economics from the Keio University's Graduate School. He served  as assistant professor in the Economics Department of Fukuoka  University and visiting assistant professor at Brown University  in the United States before being elected to the House of  Representatives in June 1980. He has since been reelected five  times from the First District of Fukuoka and is a member of the  Miyazawa faction.    He has served as parliamentary vice minister of finance  and chairman of the House of Representatives Finance Committee  and is currently chairman of the LDP Finance Committee. As this  background suggests, his next career objective would be to  become minister of Finance (under the condition that the LDP  resumes control of the government). Between himself and his wife  Yasuko, eldest daughter of Former Fukuoka Prefecture Governor  Kamei, he has two daughters. Among books published are  coauthored "Summary Theory Concerning Macroeconomics" and  jointly translated "Samuelson's Economic System." On 25 June  1993, he formed a group to create a new LDP and became its  representative sponsor.]    [Interview Postscript] The name and face of  Dietman Seiichi Ota became known throughout the nation on 26  July [1993], when he quickly announced himself as candidate for  LDP president. As I watched the tall Mr. Ota announce himself  for the candidacy with the words, "I am resolved to sacrifice  myself for the position," I could not understand why such a  young leader would want to take such a step. Frankly speaking, I  asked for this interview because I wanted to seek an answer to  that question.    I was able to dispel myself of the question in my own  peculiar way as a result of that interview. I can cite as one  factor the sympathy that he inspired among young politicians  because of his consistent actions against Kakuei Tanaka and Shin  Kanemaru. In essence, there is an aura about Mr. Ota.    Just as absurdly amicable relationships formed among  politicians because of being in the same initial election year  group or next door neighbors in the Dietmen's office building  lead to unusually important factors, this aura about Mr. Ota can  play a decisive role in determining whether he becomes a leader.  However, future prime ministers will probably be determined on  the basis of intellectual capacity. Sooner or later, Mr. Ota may  just be called upon to fill that position.</p>

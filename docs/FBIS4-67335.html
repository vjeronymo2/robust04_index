The weapons, which were to be sold to  Calabrian and Sicilian mafia families, had been purchased in  Switzerland and illegally brought into Italy through the Grison  Mountains. A total of 33 persons were arrested following the  investigations that started two years ago.    The police action, called "Giano," started in the area of  Rimini. A group of policemen infiltrated the criminal  organization that allowed them to trace the network of  traffickers to the top. In addition to the weapons, that also  came from former Yugoslavia through Serbo-Croat intermediaries,  the policemen discovered 16 kg of pure heroin and two kg of  cocaine. They impounded 15 machine guns, eight high-caliber  guns, seven pistols, two riot-guns, explosive materials, and  detonators.</p>

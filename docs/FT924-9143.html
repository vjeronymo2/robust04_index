			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Motoring: Ford gets it right second time IF only Ford could have got it right first time . . . The launch of the Escort two years ago was a damp squib. There had been so much hype about a Pounds 1bn investment in a new version of Ford's perennial best-seller that, having driven it, one had to ask: where did all the money go? The body was all new but the styling was bland. The engines were the old ones carried over. Handling was soggy, performance nothing to write home about. The experts were distinctly underwhelmed. Two years on, the Escorts and their booted counterparts, the Orions, have had a modest facelift. A number of engineering improvements, minor in themselves but cumulatively important, have been made. The twin-cam, multi-valve Zeta engine, previously used only in up-market 1.8 litre Escorts and Orions, now powers 1.6 litre models. They have been transformed. This week, I test drove an Pounds 8,995 1.4 Escort LX - still with the single camshaft CVH engine - and it was the improved build quality that first impressed. The whole car was rock-solid. No creaks or squeaks. Excellent seats, light controls, a resilient ride and so quiet there was more noise from the tyres than from the engine. With a modest output of 71 horsepower and fairly high gearing, it paid to use the 5-speed box freely and keep the fuel-injected engine spinning fast. On the motorway, driven as though by a commission-hungry young rep in pursuit of more orders, the 1.4 Escort was unfussed. When I switched to a Pounds 11,550 1.6 litre multi-valve engined Orion, the performance boost was obvious yet it delivered its 90 horsepower just as quietly and smoothly. Though happy to run at high revolutions, the 1.6 Zeta engine pulled so silkily at low speeds that I could trickle through villages at less than 30 mph (48kmh) in top gear. Power assistance (optional on the 1.4, standard on all 16-valve engined Escorts and Orions) took the effort out of parking. Steering response was satisfactory but I thought the Escorts and Orions lacked the sharp agility of the new 3-door Citroen ZX hatchbacks I had driven a few days before. There are seven Citroen ZX 3-doors, five petrol-engined and two diesels, at prices from Pounds 8,500 for the 1.4i Reflex to Pounds 14,500 for a very fast and sporting 16v. My pick of the bunch was the Pounds 10,750 Furio, powered by a new 1.8 litre, 103 horsepower engine. You could call the Furio a warm, not hot, hatchback. The insurance companies have smiled upon it. The Furio's group 11 insurance rating compares with a Ford XR3i's group 15, a Rover 216 GTi 16v or VW Golf GTi's group 14, even though they all have much the same performance. So, apart from having a list price Pounds 2,000 lower than any of its rivals, a ZX Furio will also save a typical owner several hundred pounds a year in insurance premiums. Citroen has increased its sales by 20 per cent this year to become the fastest-growing motor manufacturer in Britain. In the 3-door ZXs, especially the Furio, it clearly has another winner on its hands. This sporty stablemate of the 5-door ZX does not have to be driven hard to show its virtues. The engine develops its maximum torque (in plain language, pulls hardest) at only 3,000 rpm. Its vigorous acceleration in fourth and fifth gears is just what is needed in everyday motoring. I also tried the range-topping ZX 16V which really is a hot hatchback. A top speed of 137 mph/220 kmh and 0-60 mph/0-98kmh acceleration in eight seconds are claimed. It handled with an almost nervous responsiveness and still rode well, though the suspension has been stiffened and the high-speed rated tyres are wider. Like the less potent Furio, it pulled well at modest revolutions. With a Pounds 14,500 list price and group 15 insurance rating, it will be beyond the financial reach of many young drivers. But they should try the Furio. I can see this warm hatch becoming a cult car; a mid-1990s' counterpart of the original Golf GTi and Peugeot 205 GTi 1.9.</p>

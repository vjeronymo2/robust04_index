			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Deep appetite for deposits: Why does RTZ, the world's largest mining company, keep a low profile and resist the urge to speculate Digging very large holes in other people's countries is an occupation that requires sensitive political antennae as well good mining skills. Few companies know this better than RTZ, the largest mining company in the world. Its decision earlier this week to cut its stake in the Lihir Island gold project in Papua New Guinea from 80 per cent to only 20 per cent is seen as an act of political as well as commercial caution. Lihir Island is one of the largest gold deposits in the world. But it lies in a country where an RTZ affiliate has already had to close a copper mine - Bougainville - because of local uprisings. The deposit is also situated at the bottom of a volcanic crater full of hot water and is potentially expensive to extract. So while Lihir Island fitted RTZ's appetite for large deposits, it lacked the company's other requirements of political stability and low cost. RTZ's business philosophy has been honed by decades of experience, much of it uncomfortable, even bitter. This has taught it to take a low profile and be rigorous with its sums. It runs its Pounds 7bn empire from inconspicuous offices in the corner of St James's Square in London's West End. It does not plaster its name over its operations: you will search in vain for any sign of RTZ's proprietorship at most of its mines. Its chairman, Sir Derek Birkin, an undemonstrative but tough-minded Yorkshireman, shuns the limelight. In a recent interview, he said: 'It's an emotive business . . . We don't like to go in with our heavy boots on.' But behind the low-key exterior, the company's strategy has a clear objective: to secure for RTZ the strongest possible position in whichever market it decides to enter. The company's global structure is held together by tight budget controls and short communication lines. However, in order to cater for the strong local sensibilities of its operations, regional managers are given a high degree of autonomy: they are supposed to know how to handle decisions on the ground, deal with local politicians, smooth the way for RTZ's plans, set the priorities. This allows Sir Derek to run a business that has some 67,500 employees with a headquarters staff of only 250 people. 'It's hard work, this management style,' he says. 'We all have to travel a lot.' But if RTZ is now arguably the most successful leading British company in its field, it only got there after painful upheavals. It began as a Victorian mining finance house which invested in new mining ventures, and gradually came to own and operate mines itself. A strong period of growth came after the merger of Rio Tinto and Consolidated Zinc Corp in 1962. But in the 1980s controls weakened, and ambitious local barons threatened to pull the group apart. The centre had to reassert itself: a period of retrenchment followed during the mid-1980s, with sell-offs and staff cuts. The change was also cultural: the company traditionally had strong links with the establishment and its pillars, like Barclays Bank. The change brought greater toughness and independence, and a clearer sense of its objectives. RTZ got back into shape just in time to pull off the coup that finally propelled it to the top of the mining league: the 1989 acquisition of most of the mining and minerals operations of British Petroleum. This Dollars 3.7bn deal almost doubled RTZ's size and brought it several additional businesses, including Kennecott, the owner of Bingham Canyon in Utah, one of the world's largest copper mines. Today, RTZ mines virtually all the leading industrial and precious metals, including 7 per cent of the world's copper, and a wide range of minerals. It is the world's largest producer of several commodities including boron, a versatile mineral used in a variety of industries from glassmaking and power transformers to fertilisers and detergents. RTZ's Borax mine in the Mojave desert outside Los Angeles shares the entire world market for boron with only one other producer, in Turkey. Geographically, RTZ operates in most corners of the globe. Half its business is in North America. It owns 30 per cent of Escondida, Chile's newest copper mine, and 49 per cent of CRA, the large Australian mining concern. Other countries with an important RTZ presence include South Africa, Namibia, Portugal and France. RTZ's corporate philosophy is driven by its belief that success in a commodity business such as metals depends almost entirely on an ability to produce the goods more cheaply than anyone else. Provided the quality is right, other attributes such as marketing are secondary, because buyers will automatically go for the lowest price. RTZ has therefore concentrated on building up a portfolio of high-quality, low-cost mines containing world-class deposits that can withstand the bucking of the commodity markets. Although it prefers to have overall control, RTZ is willing to take part shares in exceptional mines, such as Escondida. This serves a special purpose in the tightly circumscribed mining business: every deposit you control is one fewer for your competitors. Like most mining concerns, RTZ has a corporate culture shaped by the earthiness of the business, and the long-time horizons needed to open up and exploit mines. There is a strong resistance, for example, to the urge to speculate. Mr Bob Adams, head of planning and strategy, says: 'If people say to us 'what are you hot on?', we say we don't know. No one's clever enough to pick winners. What we do know is that if we're in the best mines in any commodity, we have a good profit base.' There is also a reluctance to go downstream and get involved in smelting and refining more than necessary. 'We are in mining. It's all we're interested in,' says Sir Derek. In fact, Sir Derek's comment is more a wish than a reality. If RTZ has a flaw, it is Pillar, an aluminium fabricating company acquired as part of an earlier diversification. Pillar has been badly hit by the recession and is believed to be up for sale, though RTZ will not confirm this officially. The wariness of speculation extends to the futures and currency markets, and even interest rates. When RTZ bought the BP business, it financed the deal with fixed-rate money, contrary to its usual policy of going for floating rates. This proved expensive, because rates subsequently fell and RTZ ended up with a much larger interest bill than necessary. Mr Bob Wilson, the chief executive, says the company acted the way it did, not because it took a view on the market 'but because we felt we could not afford to expose the company to a rise in interest rates'. RTZ could take one simple step to reduce its currency exposure: relocate to the US. But there is an ingrained resistance even to discussing this idea, since that might imply it was an option. Sir Derek says: 'Eighty eight per cent of our shareholder base is in the UK, and we want to stay close. We do think that being British is helpful. There's an image of fair play, of cultural skills. That's not meant to sound denigrating to other countries.' RTZ's strongest protection against market fluctuations is its sheer size. Although its heavy dependence on copper means that a 10 cent fall in the price knocks Pounds 53m off profits, the chances are that some other metal will be rising at the same time. Even so, the overall weakness of the commodity markets, which has seen metals prices fall on average 30 per cent over the past three years, has put a severe strain on the company's profits. From a pre-tax peak of Pounds 1.3bn in 1989, they fell to Pounds 537m last year. The company has also shown that size can be useful in mobilising resources for acquisitions and project developments. Having only just digested the BP deal, the company recently paid Dollars 470m for a large, open-cast coal operation in Wyoming, which has added a further facet to the business. (But RTZ will not be bidding for British Coal because it does not fit RTZ's low-cost, world-class formula.) RTZ's dominance of the mining business has a strong influence on the behaviour of its competitors. In the US, Cyprus Minerals and Amax are about to merge to form a Dollars 5bn mining company, in a move widely seen as a bid for greater size and muscle. Mr Allen Born, the chairman of Amax, says: 'RTZ has always been well run. Its size enables it to balance different commodities.' Even so, Cyprus Amax will only be half as big as RTZ. But size also has its drawbacks. One is conspicuousness, which RTZ deals with by being deliberately low key, and paying close attention to sensitive matters such as the environment and relations with host governments. Green pressures are now intense (one environmental lobby group, the London-based Partizans, was formed specifically to watch RTZ). The company tries to deal with them by setting common standards for the group, and anticipating the regulators. 'If you act responsibly, you're wanted,' says Sir Derek. Another drawback is vulnerability to the charge of monopolistic behaviour in an industry where markets are easily cornered. RTZ is cautious about the way it prices boron, for example, to avoid anti-trust action. 'Breaking the company up would be a great pity,' says Sir Derek. 'You've got to have clout to succeed in this business, clout with bankers and governments.' Although the gradual consolidation of RTZ's competitors means the pressures are rising, it is still the leader in the field, which means that much of the drive has to come from self-discipline. Mr Wilson, the chief executive, says: 'We have to guard against thinking the job is done. The object is not to think we're the best, but to be the best in five or 10 years.'</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The three companies of Toyota Motor, Nissan Motor,  and Isuzu Motors have agreed in principle to supply each other  with diesel engine parts in Thailand. They are filling in the  details and soon will sign an agreement. The Thai Government has  set forth an auto policy to boost the domestic production rate  for diesel engine parts to 70 percent (currently 50 percent) by  June 1996. Because each of the three companies has local  production bases, they will divide labor in production of engine  parts, effectively using each others' facilities and aiming to  achieve the domestic production rate within a short period while  pursuing merit of scale.    The target will be diesel engine parts for one-ton pickup  trucks (including for export) that they each produce locally in  Thailand.    Toyota has built a casting plant for engine manufacture in  the outskirts of Bangkok with "Siam Toyota Manufacturing," a  joint venture with Siam Cement Group, a large Thai conglomerate,  as the nucleus, and soon will put it in operation. The local  sales companies of Nissan and Isuzu have also inaugurated  "Naharoha Industries," a joint investment with Siam Naharoha  Foundry, a casting parts company of the Siam Cement Group, and  have a casting factory in the outskirts of Bangkok.    Siam Toyota will supply block castings to Nissan and Isuzu,  and Naharoha Industries is studying in the direction of  supplying Toyota with head parts and crankshafts.    The Thai Investment Committee (BOI) is obligated to boost  the  domestic rate for diesel engine parts from the current 50  percent to 60 percent by fiscal 1994 (July 1994 to June 1995),  and to 70 percent during fiscal 1995 (July 1995 to June 1996).</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Gerald Ratner plans his comeback MR GERALD Ratner is already planning his comeback and could approach Ratners Group, the jewellery retailer from which he resigned on Wednesday, to buy back the Ratners chain, close associates said yesterday. Mr Ratner himself was not able to comment. The man who was never at a loss for words has finally been gagged. A confidentiality agreement signed with his former employers means he cannot speak publicly without risking losing his Pounds 375,000 pay-off. His cousin Mr Victor Ratner, who left the group in February, has opened a store and some think Mr Gerald Ratner could join forces with him. His agreement with Ratners allows him to open four competing shops over the next year. Ratners shares briefly rose yesterday but fell back to close down 1p at 17p. Mr John Richards, retail analyst at County NatWest WoodMac, said: 'There is a certain durability to what he did. Retail history will be a lot kinder to him than the tabloids.' However, Mr Richards felt Ratners would survive without its one-time chairman and chief executive. One rival jewellery retailer said he was sorry for Mr Ratner personally but glad that he had left Ratners. 'Gerald Ratner's going will be a great help to us,' he said. 'Their Christmas offer has been lacklustre, it just wasn't Gerald. They should be taking us on out there and they just are not.' Mr Ratner's friends say he could not agree with the strategy the group's new board was implementing, which is aimed at improving margins rather than going for volume with price cuts. 'He is a man of refreshing honesty, and he could not sit there following a strategy he does not intrinsically believe in,' one said. One stockbroker said: 'The strategy is really up to the bankers not the board. Only profitable companies have the luxury of choosing their own strategies.' Forecasts for the group's current year, to end-January, are for a loss of around Pounds 15m although analysts said the figure depended heavily on Christmas trading. They said the US business was faring better now and interest and exchange rates were moving in Ratners' favour. Mr Richards said, 'a small profit is not impossible'. Observer, Page 19</p>

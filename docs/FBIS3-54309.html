They said the committee, co-chaired by the chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff of Jordan and an assistant secretary of  the U.S. Defence Department, will discuss a broad range of  issues, including American military assistance programmes for  the Kingdom, joint exercises and training for Jordanian  servicemen.    Also discussed will be Jordan's military needs, including  spare parts for American equipment already in use by the  Kingdom's Armed Forces.    The sources noted that next week's meeting, which will  follow  talks between His Majesty King Husayn and President Bill Clinton  at the White House on Friday, would be the first after the  1990-91 Gulf crisis strained Amman-Washington relations.    Prior to the crisis, the commission used to meet annually in  Washington or in Amman to work out the year's cooperation  programmes.    Jordan depended on the U.S. for all its defence needs for  nearly 30 years until 1987, when Congress turned down a $1.6  billion arms package for the Kingdom, promoting Amman to turn to  France and the Soviet Union to meet its requirement.    Washington maintained a minimum level of military assistance  to Jordan throughout the years, including training programmes  for Jordanian servicemen and joint military execises.    Following the Gulf war, the U.S. administration has released  more than $35 million in military aid to Jordan after overcoming  congressional hurdles related to Jordan's adherence to and  enforcement of the international sanctions against Iraq and  overall Arab-Israeli peace-making.    The strain in bilateral ties resulting from the Gulf crisis  was gradually mended after mid-1992. King Husayn met with  President Clinton at the White House in June 1993, sealing  reconciliation.    Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, who headed for  Washington Tuesday to join the Jan. 21 White House meeting  between the King and President Clinton, said that  "Jordanian-American relations are continuously improving...  after traces of the Gulf crisis were removed."    Dr. al-Majali said earlier that during the King's meeting  with President Clinton he would raise the issue of American  military assistance for Jordan.    No precise figures were immmediately available on U.S.  military assistance. A State Department document dated July  referred to $10 million in military aid for the fiscal year  ending September 1993. It was not known whether this has been  released.    Jordan and the United States have held at least three joint  military exercises in the southern desert and the Red Sea since  the end of the Gulf war over Kuwait in February 1991.    The meetings of the joint commission will be attended by  senior officials from all branches of the U.S. defence  establishment, including the army, navy and air force, as well  as representatives of the Central Command.    General Joseph Hoar, head of the Central Command, was in  Amman last week in what was described as a routine visit.    Gen Hoar, who succeeded Gen Norman Schwartzkopf after the  war  of Kuwait, has visited Jordan at least twice before and during  joint American-Jordan military exercises.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Lloyds chief warns of large industry upheaval - Personnel conference told of tough financial environment / Call to employ older people Britain's financial services industry is facing an upheaval on the scale that has been experienced by manufacturing industry, according to Sir Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank. Sir Brian said that although about 160,000 jobs had already been lost in financial services in the past five years the competitive environment was going to get tougher still. If banks were to survive in the increasingly competitive market, he said, they would no longer be able to give automatic pay rises. He told the Institute of Personnel and Development annual conference in Harrogate that further bank branch rationalisation that was likely to cause unrest among bank employees. 'We have to be prepared in top management for massive resistance in this change,' he said. Sir Brian added: 'It is vital that top management is completely honest with employees.

In future the only good reason for a pay rise will be an increase in a firm's productivity or the particular performance of an individual team.' Widespread overcapacity at a time of low growth, he said, might produce unprecedented levels of competition in which only the most productive companies were going to win. For bank employees it meant facing enormous change. 'Having joined banking in the expectation of job security and steady career progression, many are now faced with branch network rationalisation, job losses and general uncertainty,' he added. Sir Brian was criticised afterwards by the banking union Bifu. Mr Ed Sweeny, deputy general secretary, said: 'He should stop, look and listen to what his staff and customers are saying. The opprobrium heaped on the banks during the last few years shows they are out of step with the public.'</p>

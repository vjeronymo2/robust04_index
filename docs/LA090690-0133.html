			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN IT COMES TO VALLEY PREP FOOTBALL, MUIR IS MERRIER  </P> <P> In recent seasons, there has been little movement at the top of the high school  football ranks in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> In the last two seasons, perennial powers Bishop Amat High and Muir were rated  the best teams in preseason polls. The same schools are favored again.  </P> <P> The only difference is that, unlike the past two seasons, Muir appears to be  leading the pack.  </P> <P> The two teams might be able to settle the issue of who is the area's top team  when they meet in a nonleague game Sept. 28 at La Canada High. For the moment,  the Mustangs, who tied Santa Barbara for the CIF Southern Section Division II  title last season, are favored over the Lancers.  </P> <P> The tradition-rich Mustangs were one of only two valley schools to win Southern  Section titles last season. The other was Glendora, which tied Ramona for the  Division IV championship.  </P> <P> After Muir and Bishop Amat, Damien of La Verne could be the next-best area  team. Other teams that should rank among the Valley's best include Nogales, Los  Altos, Claremont, Wilson, Temple City, Glendora and Covina.  </P> <P> Here is a look at the top 10 teams:  </P> <P> 1 -- Muir (Pacific League; Division II) -- The Mustangs were supposed to have  one of their most talented teams ever last season, and the end result was a  share of the Division II championship.  </P> <P> But as successful as last season's 11-1-2 squad was, Coach John Tyree insists  that this team could be even better.  </P> <P> "We're much more disciplined and we have a better grasp of what we're doing,"  the second-year coach said. "We've got some problems, but there's a lot more  purpose and unity than last year."  </P> <P> They might even have more talent than last year. Tyree said he expects at least  seven players to receive major-college scholarships. "We know we have a good  football team," he said. "We just don't know how good."  </P> <P> The most heavily recruited player of the group could be defensive back Reggie  Reser, who runs the 40-yard dash in 4.5 seconds.  </P> <P> Muir's defense will also include linemen Fred Sayegh (6-foot-2, 263 pounds) and  Hank Curtis (6-1, 251), linebackers Sedrick Thomas (6-1, 215) and Jelani  Pulliam (6-2, 210), and fleet-footed defensive backs Demetrice Martin, Hasan  McCullough and Thad Culpepper.  </P> <P> The Mustangs also have plenty of talent on offense, where either Martin or  Thomas -- both run the 40 in 4.5 seconds -- will start at quarterback. Muir  will also count on Shelton Malone (6-3, 210) at tight end, Curtis and Sayegh on  the line, and Reser at running back.  </P> <P> 2 -- Bishop Amat (Angelus; Division I) -- Unlike recent teams at Bishop Amat,  there are no marquee names playing for the Lancers this year.  </P> <P> Among the graduates from last year's team that went 8-3 were tight end Jason  Green, who is a freshman at UCLA, and wide receiver Jeremy Smith, a freshman at  UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> With 15 underclassmen expected to start, this will be one of the youngest teams  ever at Bishop Amat. Despite the inexperience, Coach Mark Paredes has a good  feeling about the squad.  </P> <P> "It's a funny thing, because on paper this team couldn't stand up to any of the  past Bishop Amat teams," Paredes said. "But I just have a feeling that this  team has the heart and desire to have a real good season."  </P> <P> With Smith and Green gone, the offense might not have as much big-play  potential as usual. But the Lancers have two outstanding players returning in  quarterback Zack Zertuche and fullback Jason Patterson (6-0, 215).  </P> <P> Zertuche passed for 1,675 yards and 19 touchdowns last season. Two other key  offensive players are tackle John Ludwiczak (6-3, 230) and tight end Ealar  Gallagher.  </P> <P> The strength of the team might be the defense. Headliners include linebackers  Miregi Huma, Peter Gomez, Scott Fields and Patterson -- the only senior in the  group. "I think our linebacker corps is as good as you get," Paredes said. "A  lot of pressure will be placed on them."  </P> <P> Several other starters on defense will be tackle Nick Hanamaikai (6-0, 220) and  defensive backs Jason Hernandez and Mike Velasco.  </P> <P> 3 -- Damien (Baseline; Division IV) -- With 15 starters and 57 lettermen  returning from a 7-5 squad that reached the Division IV quarterfinals, the  Spartans have the look of a powerhouse.  </P> <P> But Coach Dick Larson is not about to be presumptuous about his team's chances.  </P> <P> "You can't have a papier-mache team," Larson said. "We think we have some good  (players) here and we're going to do quite well. But there are still some  things we have to work on."  </P> <P> Larson shouldn't have to worry about is his defense, which has nine starters  returning. Topping the list is All-Southern Section nose guard Mike Balian  (6-4, 250), one of the valley's top linemen.  </P> <P> The defense also returns Larry Oliver (6-2, 225) at tackle and twin brother  Kurt (6-1, 220), at linebacker, and lineman Mark Freis, linebackers Steve  Esquibel and Ian Moreno, and defensive backs Roman DeLeon, Angelo Antonelli,  Nate Hernandez and Brian Roche.  </P> <P> There are a few more positions to fill on offense, but the core is solid with  the return of massive tackles Dan Holland (6-5, 250) and Cliff Sennett (6-8,  260), center John Lewis (6-2, 215), wide receiver Jamie Gutierrez, tight end  Basil Acree, and running backs Travis Castaldi and Jody Napuunoa. Gutierrez  caught 27 passes for 401 yards and Acree 17 for 221 yards last season.  </P> <P> About the only question is who will play quarterback. Competing for the  starting spot are seniors Tom Keller and Frank Czizinik and junior Matt  Bechtel.  </P> <P> 4 -- Nogales (Sierra; Division IV) -- As debuts go, Brian Beveridge's first  year as coach of the Nobles couldn't have been more impressive.  </P> <P> After winning a playoff game for the first time in school history, Nogales  advanced to the semifinals before losing to Glendora to finish 7-5-1.  </P> <P> Considering that they return 10 starters, mostly in the skill positions, there  is cause for high expectations this season.  </P> <P> "We're much farther ahead than we were last year," Beveridge said. "We've had a  more complete spring (practice) and a more complete summer. I just feel much  better about things this year."  </P> <P> The Nobles could have one of the most explosive offenses in the valley with the  return of highly regarded running back Tyrone Edwards, a senior who rushed for  1,100 yards last season, and running back Lawrence Lanham, a junior who rushed  for more than 1,400 yards on the junior varsity team last season.  </P> <P> "We have two good running backs but we have to find people to block for them,"  Beveridge said.  </P> <P> The line will be anchored by guard Todd Wild (5-9, 180), a three-year starter.  Two other key offensive performers are wide receiver Fred Thompson and  quarterback Fred Holquin.  </P> <P> Nogales is more experienced on defense, particularly at linebacker with the  return of Louis Cuevas, Marcos Alatorre and Dalyn Utley. Other starters include  linemen Tony Verran and Joel Delgado and Edwards in the secondary.  </P> <P> 5 -- Los Altos (Sierra; Division IV) -- When it comes to producing a winning  program, there is no team in the valley that can match the success of the  Conquerors since the early 1970s.  </P> <P> The Conquerors have reached the playoffs 18 consecutive seasons -- the longest  streak of any school in the Southern Section. Los Altos was 9-3 last season and  advanced to the Division IV quarterfinals.  </P> <P> The streak does not figure to end this season, although it could be put to a  test. With only three starters and six lettermen returning, Los Altos will have  its most inexperienced team in recent years.  </P> <P> Fortunately, one of the players returning is senior quarterback Mike Allen  (6-4, 210). As a starter the last two seasons, Allen has completed 226 of 413  passes -- a completion rate of 55.6% -- for 2,822 yards and 29 touchdowns with  only 11 interceptions. More important, with Allen in the lineup, Los Altos is  22-4.  </P> <P> Longtime Coach Dwayne DeSpain, who is closing in on the 200-win plateau with  196-64-7 record in 23 seasons, likes what what he has seen. "We don't have  anyone that jumps out at you except Mike," he said. "But they're hard workers  and they're not afraid of anything."  </P> <P> Besides Allen, the offense has several players with experience, including  tackles Joon Shin (5-9, 215) and Joe Brown (6-3, 210), wide receiver Ryan  Lauper, tight end Ben Hernandez, and running back Brian Martinez. The defense  will be led by lineman Steve Merchant and a strong secondary that includes  Jason Barron, Adan Salcedo and John Yeu.  </P> <P> 6 -- Claremont (Baseline; Division IV) -- Last season started out with great  promise but ended in disappointment for the Wolfpack.  </P> <P> They opened the season with six consecutive victories, then lost their last  four to miss the playoffs for only the second time in the 11 seasons in which  Bob Baiz has been coach.  </P> <P> But with 12 starters returning, Claremont figures to have a happier ending this  time.  </P> <P> "We're in better shape than we were last year . . . a lot better shape," Baiz  said. "We're a lot more experienced and we're looking for improvement."  </P> <P> Claremont is particularly strong on offense, where most of its top skill  players and linemen return. Leading the way are quarterback Adam Metwalli (6-1,  200), running back Ryan Williams (6-1, 195), and wide receivers Ryan Wall,  Brandy Braxton and Bill Battin.  </P> <P> "It's the best group of receivers we've ever had," Baiz said. "We may have had  better receivers before, but never as many."  </P> <P> The Wolfpack also has considerable experience on the offensive line with the  return of tackle Brian Jones (6-0, 215), center Bill Lerette (6-0, 205), and  guards Chad Ventriglia (6-3, 240) and Paul Holstrom (6-1, 225).  </P> <P> There is less experience on defense, but Claremont should have an outstanding  secondary that includes Wall, Darren Miller and Nick Baiz -- the coach's  youngest son. The defense will also include linemen Mark Brandel and Brandon  Griffin and linebacker Mike Moraga.  </P> <P> 7 -- Wilson (Sierra; Division IV) -- Judging strictly by numbers, the odds  would appear to be against the Wildcats repeating as champions of the rugged  Sierra League.  </P> <P> After all, the Wildcats return only six lettermen from last season's team that  finished 10-2 and reached the division quarterfinals. But after watching his  team practice during the summer, Coach David Merrill is optimistic.  </P> <P> "If you looked at what we had coming back, it looked dismal," he said. "But our  kids have worked very hard all summer because they knew the challenge that was  waiting for them."  </P> <P> One of Merrill's most difficult tasks was to find a quarterback to replace his  son, Ryan, who starred for the team last season. He might have solved that  dilemma when his nephew, senior Tommy Merrill, transferred to Wilson from  Northern California.  </P> <P> Merrill, who will also play safety, has an outstanding target in flanker Chris  Hansen and an offensive line that returns tackle Ed Quesada (6-3, 250), center  Steve Chiasson (6-4, 240), and guards Jesus Lara (5-11, 225) and Ryan Sokoda  (6-0, 190).  </P> <P> Chiasson, regarded as a major-college prospect, also anchors the defensive line  at tackle. Among other two-way players for the Wildcats are Lara and Sokoda at  linebacker and Hansen at safety.  </P> <P> 8 -- Temple City (Rio Hondo; Division VII) -- Here's a quick trivia quiz: Name  the only 11-man football program in the valley to reach the division semifinals  in each of the last two seasons.  </P> <P> The answer, of course, is Temple City. The Rams have gone 19-6-1 the last two  years, including 9-4 in 1989, and Coach Jim Walker thinks they have an even  better squad this season.  </P> <P> "This is the best team I've ever coached," Walker said. "It has the best  potential. If we measure up to that potential, we can be a pretty good football  team."  </P> <P> The strength of the Rams could be their offense, which will feature senior  quarterback Terry Fesler. As a junior, Fesler passed for 1,650 yards and 17  touchdowns.  </P> <P> Fesler will also have two capable passing targets in wide receiver Chris  Gonzalez and tight end Sean Dublin (6-2, 235) and a reliable ball-carrier in  fullback Brian Sulpizio (6-0, 205).  </P> <P> The Temple City defense should also be strong as usual. The unit is paced by  All-Division VII defensive end Matt Gilmour, a 6-5 and 220-pound senior who is  regarded as one of the top college prospects in the state.  </P> <P> The defense also returns defensive end Greg Tandolini and all-league selections  Bill Woodard and Joe Stampfel in the secondary. Two top newcomers are linemen  Robert Buccola (6-3, 200) and Rocky Foltz (6-2, 195).  </P> <P> 9 -- Glendora (Baseline; Division IV) -- It was a dream season for the Tartans  in 1989, when they were 12-1-1 and shared their first football championship  with a 28-28 tie with Ramona in the Division IV final.  </P> <P> It was a feat that Coach Dean Karnoski realizes will be difficult to duplicate  this season. So he merely wants this season's squad to stand on its own  accomplishments.  </P> <P> "One of the things we try to emphasize is that each team is its own team and  each team is a separate entity," Karnoski said. "This team is an entirely  different group, and they can be as strong as they want to be."  </P> <P> Well, not entirely different. The Tartans do have nine starters returning,  which should help Glendora remain among the best teams in the valley.  </P> <P> Leading the way is All-Southern Section running back Bill Zernickow, who was  the second-leading rusher in the valley last season with 1,761 yards and 17  touchdowns. He also caught 11 passes for 169 yards. Add fullback Bobby Baeza  and wingback Jesse Fernandez, and Glendora has the potential of another solid  rushing attack.  </P> <P> The Tartans will also have one of their biggest offensive lines ever headed by  juniors Kirk Bowman (6-4, 225) and Don Lydell (6-1, 265). The quarterback will  be either senior Craig Palmer or junior Tracy Thompson.  </P> <P> Glendora also expects to have one of its most talented defensive backfields  ever, including all-league selection Tim Flynn and Josh Romero at safety and  Scott Jacobsen and Fernandez at cornerback.  </P> <P> 10 -- Covina (Valle Vista; Division IV) -- In his first season as coach of the  Colts, Dick Sheehan will have the unenviable challenge of trying to live up to  what the team accomplished last season.  </P> <P> Covina won its first Valle Vista League title and first league title of any  kind since 1953. It also went 9-1 in the regular season before losing in the  first round of the Division IV playoffs.  </P> <P> Sheehan, an assistant at Charter Oak last year, is hoping that the success will  carry over to this season.  </P> <P> "It's a very positive group of kids here," he said. "It's been a good group to  work with. I think winning last year was a big help because winning breeds  winning."  </P> <P> Many of the top players from last season have graduated, but there are a few  holdovers remaining who should help keep the Colts successful. Covina will  build its offense around junior quarterback Brian Kearns, who was an all-league  selection at wide receiver, and junior fullback Marcus Aldridge, a top middle  linebacker as a sophomore.  </P> <P> The offense will also feature junior tackle Keith Pollock (6-2, 205), another  all-league selection last season, lineman Brian Linden (6-2, 220), running back  Eddie Howard and tight end Mike Mulree.  </P> <P> The Colts should be sparked on defense by linebackers Craig Pound, Mark Maybury  and Mulree. Two other starters returning are defensive backs Tim O'Leary and  John Suh.  </P> <P> Others teams to watch:  </P> <P> Arroyo (Mission Valley; Division V) -- Since the mid-1980s, Arroyo has had a  firm grip on first place in the Mission Valley League.  </P> <P> The Knights have won five of six league titles, including last season when they  went 8-2 before losing in first round of the Division V playoffs to eventual  champion Corona.  </P> <P> Arroyo is considered the team to beat for the league title again, although the  position might be a little more tenuous this time.  </P> <P> "This is probably the most inexperienced team I've had in a few years," Coach  Don MacKinnon said. "Two-thirds of our roster has never played a down of  varsity football."  </P> <P> Fortunately for MacKinnon, Arroyo does return 10 starters from its league  championship squad. Early in the season, the Knights will probably rely on  their defense, which includes all-league selections Chris Jacobson (6-4, 220)  at tackle and linebackers Keith MacLellan, Dominic Martinez and Danny Romero.  </P> <P> Arroyo's quarterback in its veer offense will be either Hines or MacLellan,  whose brother, Darren, was a standout a running back at the school the last  three seasons. Romero and Hoyt will see considerable playing time at running  back. Jacobsen, Martinez and tackle Phillip Cruz (5-11, 230) will anchor the  line.  </P> <P> Baldwin Park (Sierra; Division IV) -- Baldwin Park has established a winning  tradition with its wide-open passing attack.  </P> <P> But with a new quarterback and an inexperienced corps of receivers, Coach Tony  Zane said the Braves might emphasize the run more than usual.  </P> <P> "We may have to play a little more grind-it-out football than we're used to,"  he said. "We'll still throw (a lot) but probably not as much as we usually do."  </P> <P> The Braves, who were 6-3-1 last season, also have their biggest offensive line  in recent years, which should make running the football easier. The line will  include all-league tackle Peter Medrano (6-3, 245) and David Valentine (6-4,  265), a transfer from Azusa High.  </P> <P> "We will be a very big team," Zane said. "We're probably bigger than we've been  the in the last 15 years."  </P> <P> Not that the pass will cease to be a weapon for the Braves. Baldwin Park has a  highly regarded junior quarterback, junior varsity standout Mark Ruiz, and a  steady receiver, all-league selection Petey Limon.  </P> <P> The bulk of the rushing chores will fall on fullback Jay Sims and tailback Chad  Simko. The defense is headed by all-league nose guard Fernando Arredondo and  tackles Tony Duran (6-2, 250) and Valentine.  </P> <P> Bassett (Montview; Division VI) -- After the graduation of All-Southern Section  running back Marshawn Thompson and linebacker Richard Parham, two of the top  players in the school's history, some observers are anticipating a decline in  success for the Olympians this season.  </P> <P> That is evident in the preseason CIF Southern Section rankings, where Bassett  is nowhere to be found. Only Coach Mark Pettengill thinks people might be  underestimating his program.  </P> <P> With a surplus of talented players from the freshman team that won back-to-back  league titles and an excellent group of returning interior linemen, Pettengill  thinks this squad could be better last season's 7-5 team that reached the  Division V quarterfinals.  </P> <P> "We think it could be our best team ever," he said. "We're excited about it.  People still don't look our way when it comes to the CIF rankings, so we still  have a lot to prove but we think we can prove it."  </P> <P> Bassett's run-oriented offense is led by junior quarterback Tony Garcia,  sophomore tailback Greg Moore and senior fullback Dwayne Gillison. The line  includes center Simon Martinez (6-1, 255), guard Gus Gutierrez (5-8, 225), and  tackles Guy Muniz (6-1, 240) and Bernie Ray (6-1, 230).  </P> <P> On defense, the Olympians will rely on linebackers Michael Parham, Ed Trejo and  Abel Gutierrez, and linemen Sean Gonzalez (5-11, 200) and Benny Ramos (5-10,  200). Parhman, a junior, is Richard's younger brother.  </P> <P> Pasadena (Pacific; Division II) -- With only one starter returning at the start  of last season, Coach Gary Griffiths was bracing for the worst. The results  from a 2-7-1 season were predictable.  </P> <P> But with more experience returning this season, Pasadena has cause for  optimism.  </P> <P> "I think we have 15 to 20 kids now who have quite a lot of experience,"  Griffiths said. "It's a major difference when you have kids who have  experience."  </P> <P> Topping the list is senior fullback Jhayson Hall (6-1, 230), who was the team's  offensive leader with 934 rushing yards and five touchdowns in 123 carries.  "He's probably as good of a running back as there is around," Griffiths said.  </P> <P> Pasadena's option offense will also feature returning halfback Mario Gulley.  Kris Kohler is expected to be the quarterback. The offense includes tackles  Garo Dourenian (5-10, 240) and Seth Braithwaite (6-3, 250) and wide receiver  Kevin South.  </P> <P> The Bulldog defense includes linebackers Curtis Banks and Thad Johnson,  defensive end Tyrone Robinson, and LaRon Bond and South in the secondary.  </P> <P> Rosemead (Mission Valley; Division V) -- Under Coach Jim Hall, the Panthers  have been a regular participant in the Southern Section playoffs.  </P> <P> They finished 6-5 and reached the Southern Section playoffs last season. Hall  said this might be his most talented squad.  </P> <P> "We're real experienced in the skill positions," he said. "We're probably  better off in the skill positions than we've been in the last 10 years."  </P> <P> Rosemead should have one of the most potent passing attacks in the valley with  senior receivers Chang Weisberg and Jesus Huerta. Weisberg was one of the  leading receivers in the Southern Section with 80 catches for 811 yards, and  Huerta was an all-league receiver as a sophomore before playing quarterback  last season.  </P> <P> The Panthers also have an all-league tight end in Clint Kerr (6-2, 220) and  junior quarterback Matt Koffler. The presence of returning running backs John  Vigil and Pat AhHing (6-3, 255) will also help to balance the offensive attack.  </P> <P> The line includes center Ray Hernandez (5-11, 175) and guard Dante Gallindo  (6-1, 195). Rosemead will count on several two-way players on defense,  including Hernandez and AhHing on the line, Kerr and Weisberg at linebacker,  and Huerta at cornerback.  </P> <P> Rowland (Sierra; Division IV) -- The Raiders went away from their typical  grind-it-out rushing attack and the results were disappointing. They finished  3-7.  </P> <P> So Coach Harry Robinson said his team is going back to basics this year, and  the early prognosis for Rowland appears favorable.  </P> <P> "We feel good about it," Robinson said. "We're probably a little more  optimistic than we've been in recent years."  </P> <P> More important, the Raiders appear to have the running backs and linemen to do  the job. Big, swift running backs David Ferguson and Damon Washington return.  </P> <P> Rowland also has ample size on the line. Tackle Ronald Green (6-4, 275), a  junior transfer from Locke High, guard Kwon Park (6-0, 205), and returning  tight ends Casey Shaw and Ted Schell return.  </P> <P> The Raiders expect to be led on defense by a talented secondary that includes  cornerbacks Frankie Rodriguez, who intercepted seven passes, and Jason Torres.  Other defensive standouts include linebackers Clint Brunyer and Shaw and  lineman Kurt Compton.  </P> <P> San Marino (Rio Hondo; Division VII) -- Coach Bill Maloney said this will not  be the deepest or most-experienced team the Titans have ever fielded.  </P> <P> However, the results might be the same -- a challenger for the league title.  </P> <P> "We think we're going to be pretty good," he said. "How good depends on if we  get the right people in the right spots. But I think we have the people."  </P> <P> The Titans, who were 8-3 and reached the Division VII quarterfinals, have 10  starters returning. Leading the offense will be tailback Alfonso Montoya, a  senior who rushed for 679 yards and six touchdowns.  </P> <P> San Marino's offense will also include quarterback Eric Walcha, tackle Greg  Ames (6-4, 235), tight end Craig Chamberlain, and wide receivers Jeff LeSage  and D. R. Moreland.  </P> <P> With more inexperience on offense, Maloney said the team will count on its  defense. The leaders are tackles Nate Olsen and Mark Detar, both 6-3 and 225,  linebackers Chamberlain and Shannon Ching, and secondary standouts Montoya and  LeSage. Olsen's father, Merlin, is an NFL Hall of Fame lineman who starred for  the Rams.  </P></p>

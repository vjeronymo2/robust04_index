			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Recovery in rental levels behind Town Centre advance A recovery in rental levels helped Town Centre Securities, the Leeds-based property group, report a 9 per cent rise in annual profits to Pounds 8.81m. Mr Edward Ziff, chairman, said the company had increased its purchases in the retail market to take advantage of the rise, although this had so far been limited to the top end of the market. 'The prime retail market is stronger than its ever been in terms of rental value and incentives to let are being withdrawn at a rate of knots,' he said. An internal property valuation showed values increased by 11 per cent and helped net asset value per share rise 20 per cent to 150.63p (125.18p), and by 21 per cent to 148.98p (123.07p) on a diluted basis. The shares gained 5p to 122p yesterday. The freehold proportion of the group's investments jumped from 66 to 96 per cent following the purchase of the freeholds on the Merrion Centre in Leeds and a smaller site in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. These boosted the group's investment expenditure from Pounds 10m to Pounds 15m for the year. Mr Ziff said that secondary retail sites were still not showing any signs of rental growth. 'Rent review activity is very tough in those areas,' he said. The pre-tax figure was slightly ahead of most forecasts and prompted analysts to generally move their profit forecasts for 1994-95 ahead slightly. The average moved from about Pounds 8.5m to upwards of Pounds 9m, with a net asset value of about 170p. Gross revenue for the year to June 30 rose 10 per cent to Pounds 20m (Pounds 18.2m). The tax charge declined from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 1.89m, leaving earnings per share ahead 19 per cent to 6.75p (5.65p). The dividend is increased from 3.4p to 3.8p, with a final of 2.6p. A 1-for-4 scrip issue was also announced.</p>

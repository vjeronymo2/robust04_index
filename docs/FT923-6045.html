			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Long-term boost for Taiwan in split with S Korea TRADE between South Korea and Taiwan will suffer initial damage after diplomatic links end between the two, but some sectors of Taiwan industry expect to benefit in the long term from the split. Taiwan made known its intention to sever diplomatic ties with Mr Roh Tae-woo's government last weekend, calling the recent Seoul-Beijing reconciliation 'a hostile and unfriendly act'. At the same time, Mr Frederick Chien, foreign minister, said preferential import tariffs and quotas which helped create a Dollars 494m (Pounds 248m) deficit with South Korea in 1991 would be scrapped, and direct air links, except by foreign carriers, suspended on September 15. Despite pledges by Mr Vincent Siew, economics minister, that South Korea would receive the same treatment as non-privileged trading partners, Taiwan's anger at not being informed earlier of Seoul's decision to recognise Beijing has prompted some retaliatory action. South Korea's car import quota for 1992 will be cut short only two-thirds filled, the National Consumer Association has urged a boycott of South Korean goods, and Mr Eugene Chien, communications minister, has said South Korean bids for infrastructure projects in the six-year plan, assessed at Dollars 300bn, would not be welcome. The break was a blow for Taiwan's government, but analysts say trade volume with South Korea is too small to have much effect on the island's export-led economy. South Korea is Taiwan's 13th biggest trading partner, and two-way trade totalled Dollars 3.03bn last year. Mr Siew said Taiwan would 'maintain civilian, economic and trade ties with South Korea based on reciprocity and mutual benefit'. A South Korean delegation is expected in Taipei in September to discuss formation of unofficial ties; officials expect direct flights to return to normal once new links are cemented. News of the Taipei-Seoul split was welcomed in the steel, petrochemical and shipping industries, which have complained of dumping and undercutting of rates among their South Korean competitors. An official of Taiwan's Iron and Steel Industries Association said: 'We had plenty of evidence (of dumping), but when it got to the cabinet, diplomatic considerations came in, and nothing was done.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Arab Silence Over Israeli Report on the </F> Massacre of the Age"]    [Text] We believed that this or that Arab capital would  react to the report of the Israeli investigation commission on  the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which acquitted the Israeli  government, the Israeli Army, and settlers of the killing of  defenseless Palestinians who were performing their Ramadan  Friday prayers.    However, our belief was in vain, because the Israeli report  on the massacre of the age was received with complete silence.  This despite the fact that the report contains false  allegations and distorted facts. It also defends the crime of  the settler, who committed the crime through cooperation with  members of the army, by saying that he was insane when he  carried out the act.    The Israeli government is not innocent of the crime in which  scores of innocent children and old men were killed. It was  able, as usual, through its arrogance, to reverse facts and to  charge people, who are without conscience or ethics, with  writing a report which is far away from reality. Meanwhile, the  Arab capitals received this report with silence, as if they  approve of its contents.    Arab silence over Israeli crimes will encourage the Rabin  government not only to continue its crimes but also to impose  whatever it wants in the peace process. Thus, it will achieve  its ambitions and reach -- through the peace which it will  impose by deception -- what it failed to reach in its wars with  the Arabs.    The Arabs must place at the top of their priorities in the  peace process ending the Israeli crimes and the Israeli strategy  which is based on aggression and expansion. These two items are  as important as restoring the usurped Arab rights and respecting  the rights of others.    The objective of establishing a lasting, just, and  comprehensive peace should include the conditions that will  enable the coming generations to live in security and stability.  Otherwise, talk about peace will be nonsense and media uproar,  which has no basis on the ground.</p>

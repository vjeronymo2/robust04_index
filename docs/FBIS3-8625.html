			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Extremists of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO]  have violated the cease-fire on the territory of the First Corps  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army.    A Bosnia-Herzegovina Army soldier has been killed by a  sniper  bullet while another was wounded. One member of the civilian  police and one woman have also been wounded, which confirms that  the enemy, following its murderous instincts, does not  differentiate between civilians and soldiers [no date given].    HVO fired two artillery rounds and seven 60-mm shells on  positions held by units commanded by Avdija Rozajac in the  region of Smailovici and Vasino Brdo on 11 March. Intensive  sniper and small arms fire was opened along the entire defense  line manned by this unit, particularly in the area of Zavrtaljka  and Smailovici. Shortly after 1900 hours yesterday evening, HVO  extremists carried out combat actions from M-84 machine guns,  the so-called death- sowers, and anti-aircraft guns from the  region of Brestovica, while they were noticed to be entrenching  themselves intensively above the village of (?Gagve), which is a  clear indication of their future intentions.    While UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] military observers  were  trying to mediate in the exchange of the body of one  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army soldier which the HVO has held for a  long time, small arms fire was opened on the international  military observers from HVO positions. UNPROFOR members  assessed this as a serious indicent. [passage omitted]</p>

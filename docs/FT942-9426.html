			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Wellcome Wellcome's recent recovery has been nearly as startling as its decline. The shares have risen by 15 per cent in three weeks and on the evidence of Friday's 7p rise to 586p there is still some momentum. For investors who bought shares from Wellcome Trust at 800p two years ago, the rally will be of scant comfort. After a string of disappointments - culminating with the decision in March to abandon development of a new anti-viral compound - the company will struggle to regain a premium rating. There is no single reason for Wellcome's sudden rehabilitation. Although Retrovir will never be the money-spinner once hoped, the company has cemented its position in Aids therapy by signing a marketing agreement with Glaxo. Early data suggests Famvir, SmithKline Beecham's anti-viral treatment, will not elbow aside Zovirax, Wellcome's biggest selling drug. Roche's acquisition of US drugs company Syntex at a large premium to the market share price also pointed to value hidden elsewhere in the sector. On a multiple of around 10 times this year's forecast earnings at the depths, Wellcome certainly looked cheap on all but the bleakest diagnosis. But much still depends on the growth it can squeeze out of Zovirax in the face of competition and expiring patents. Disappointment on that score would cast doubt on Wellcome's ability to make the global grade as an independent company. The Trust - which still holds 40 per cent - might then wonder whether it would be better off with a smaller stake in a larger, less risky company.</p>

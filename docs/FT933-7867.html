			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Shell confirms talks on union derecognition OIL COMPANIES have been privately discussing union derecognition across the British oil industry, it was confirmed yesterday by Shell UK. But the company rejected a union accusation that the oil companies were in 'collusion' on a union-busting strategy. It said it was 'completely without foundation'. Mr Fred Higgs, the TGWU general union's officer for the oil industry, said that Shell and other oil companies had met at a hotel in Stratford upon Avon, Warwickshire, on March 5. Union derecognition had been discussed. Their next meeting was due next month. Shell UK in a written statement said that the Stratford meeting was 'one of a series of informal get-togethers held twice a year, on average, for many years'. It added: 'Union derecognition was an item on the agenda of this meeting along with a wide range of other issues such as quality management, suggestion schemes and sickness monitoring.' Last night Shell said: 'All companies with refineries in Britain are invited to the meetings.' Mr Higgs announced a national consumer boycott of Shell products sold at filling stations in protest at the company's plan to derecognise the unions at its Shell Haven refinery. Shell expressed 'regret' at the union call for a boycott, adding that it was 'not helpful at the current time'. It said: 'This will only exacerbate the already fragile situation at Shell Haven.' Its decision to derecognise the unions at the refinery had been 'motivated by commercial considerations only', Shell said. 'The simple fact is that the situation is so precarious that without a radical restructuring of all working arrangements on the site, we would have no option but to consider more drastic action.' This could have involved closing the refinery. Shell said that the system of three separate unions at Shell Haven was to be replaced by 'a simple and effective process of direct consultation between employees and line managers'. The company said it had 'no general policy of derecognition' and pointed out that it continued to operate union agreements elsewhere in its refineries. 'All employees have and will continue to have the right to join a union of their choice,' Shell said. Mr Higgs said the unions had been willing to negotiate a new deal at Shell Haven in line with Shell's policies. 'We have done this at the company's Stanlow refinery,' he said. Mr Higgs and Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's employment spokesman, will meet Shell managers at the Shell Haven refinery today to discuss the issue.</p>

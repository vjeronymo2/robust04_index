			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Salinas reshuffles cabinet PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico has reshuffled his cabinet for the second time this year and replaced the embattled head of his Institutional Revolutionary party in a move designed to bolster the party's standing before presidential elections next year. Mr Emilio Gamboa, a presidential aspirant, becomes minister of transport and communications, replacing Mr Andres Caso Lombardo who has been embroiled in controversy over the awarding of air traffic control contracts. Mr Gamboa, who was head of the Institute of Social Security, is close to Mr Salinas. He was also private secretary to former President Miguel de la Madrid for six years. Mr Genaro Borrego, president of the PRI for the past 10 months, moves on to head the Social Security Institute. He is seen within the party as a spent force politically. Mr Fernando Ortiz Arena, head of the PRI in the Chamber of Deputies and a more experienced political figure, takes over the party's leadership. He has contacts across the political spectrum that will stand him in good stead as the in-fighting over the presidential succession gathers pace. The president also removed officials seen as tainted by charges of corruption in the US, in an attempt to avoid damage to Mexico's image in the run-up to a US congressional vote on Nafta. Among them was Mr Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, former attorney-general and former governor of Jalisco state, removed as head of Banobras, the state bank.</p>

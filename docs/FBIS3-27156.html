			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Rome, February 21 (XINHUA) -- The commander of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) over Bosnia said on  Monday [21 February] that air strikes could still be launched if  Sarajevo is shelled again or the big guns withdrawn after a  Western ultimatum are brought back.    "Our mission is not over, any weapons found that are not  under control will be subject to air strike," U.S. Admiral  Jeremy Boorda, commander of NATO forces in southern Europe, told  a news conference at his headquarters in Italy's Naples.    NATO demanded that all the heavy weapons in and around  Sarajevo had to be withdrawn 20 kilometers from the center of  Sarajevo or placed under U.N. control.    Boorda said that after the expiry of a NATO deadline at  midnight GMT on Sunday, the threat of strikes from allied  warplanes based in Italy or on aircraft carriers in the Adriatic  remained in place.    He said air strikes could still be called in if the Serbs  attempted to move guns into the exclusion zone around Sarajevo  or recapture weapons surrendered to U.N. control, or shell the  capital from beyond the zone.    The commander also indicated that he could be ready to  extend  the threat of air strikes to other areas of Bosnia if the  alliance and the United Nations decided to deliver another  ultimatum.</p>

Cuban diplomatic sources denied Canada had expelled Adolfo  Martin and Orlando Brito, two officials of the Cuban Consulate  in Montreal, as Cuban dissidents Pedro Martori and Antonio Tang  reported in Montreal. Martori and Tang, who represent  Miami-based radical dissident groups told the Canadian media  that Canada had expelled Consul Martin and Vice Consul Brito.    Cuban Ambassador in Havana Carlos Castillo told NOTIMEX  diplomats from any country are subject to rotation and Martin  and Brito had completed their assignments a few weeks ago. A  Cuban diplomatic source concurred with the Canadian Attorney  General's Office in explaining that Martin and Brito had been  living in Montreal for years, and "their term had to end  someday."    Political sources told NOTIMEX the report on the expulsion  "is related to the expansion of economic relations between  Canada and Cuba," and, in particular, to the investments  Canadian mining and hotel companies and other sectors are making  in the Caribbean island.    Cuban solidarity groups stated the Cuban exiles in Canada,  linked to radical groups in the United States, are "upset" over  the Havana initiative of beginning this month a dialogue with  sectors of the Cuban exile community. "Alpha 66" -- a  Miami-based dissident group -- "continues to issue communiques,  stating it will attack Canadian tourists who go to Cuba. It is  a sign of their powerlessness regarding the dialogue" between  Havana and the Miami community, a Cuban source affirmed.    Canadian Government circles, which supported the idea of a  dialogue between Havana and the exiled community, admit Cuban  opposition groups are "very resentful" of the good relations  that exist between Canadian businesses and Cuba. The expulsion  story was a recent reaction by radical Cuban exiles aimed at  adversely affecting business contacts between Cuba and Canada.    In April 1993, Tang and Florencio Aspillaga Lombard --  another Cuban exile living in Miami -- told DIARIO LAS AMERICAS  of Miami that Ottawa had suspended the firm Rapitel  Communications S.I.'s permission to operate in Cuba. The  statement made by Tang and Aspillaga Lombard about this company,  which sells telephone communications service with Cuba, also  turned out to be false. Canadian analysts said the report was  aimed at eliminating telephone service between Canada and Cuba,  which serves as a bridge for numerous Cubans living in the  United States.    According to the sources that were consulted, another reason  for the "charge" made by Martori and Tang was a result of the  support given in Canada to the "Cuban friendship caravan," an  initiative to send humanitarian aid to the island. The caravan  left various Canadian cities on 20 February destined for Mexico  from where caravan members will sail to Cuba. The caravan will  pass through various U.S. cities and will join the efforts made  by the "Pastors for Peace," who for the third consecutive year  will send humanitarian aid to Cuba and will confront the  economic blockade imposed on Cuba by Washington three decades  ago.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jacques Amalric report: "Bosnia: Following the </F> Franco-American Muddle"]    [Text] Mrs. Sadako Ogata, UN high commissioner for  refugees, appealed to the international community in Paris on  Tuesday [25 January] to help the Bosnians "get through the  winter" and to "exert pressure" for a peaceful settlement of the  conflict. She was not willing to comment on the question of air  strikes.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher knows how not to  be a diplomat when he so wishes. His French interlocutors --  Francois Mitterrand, Edouard Balladur, and Alain Juppe --  experienced that on Monday when they discussed the Bosnian  crisis with him: All their demands, aimed at securing a clear  commitment from Washington in favor of the European peace plan  which makes provision for an unequal partition of Bosnia, were  rejected.    This plan, the head of U.S. diplomacy told them in  substance,  is "immoral" and "unjust" because it penalizes the "victims" of  an aggression which is essentially Serbian. Those victims  should have the right to defend themselves. Therefore the  United States will never exert pressure on the (Muslim) Bosnian  authorities to accept a solution which does not suit them, even  if they have reached a military effectiveness which is causing  problems for Bosnia's Serbian and Croatian armed forces. As in  May 1993, the United States is still in favor of lifting the  arms embargo which is affecting Bosnia -- a measure to which the  European countries which have sent contingents to the former  Yugoslavia are still hostile. If the UN bodies agree, Washington  will not oppose the use of air strikes to break the stranglehold  on Sarajevo, reopen Tuzla airport, and free the city of  Srebrenica, but is, however, completely opposed to sending  American troops to Bosnian soil to impose a settlement.    The French officials clearly did not expect such an outright  rejection. There was "misunderstanding" or "misinterpretation"  of our position, the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Affairs Ministry]  said on Tuesday. We did not ask for U.S. military intervention  and we did not put forward a new plan for a conference; we  simply asked them to support a political plan and to accept  increased cooperation with the Europeans and the Russians who,  within the Security Council framework, are increasingly clearly  opposing the use of force against the Serbs. And the question  was asked: "How can the Americans refuse this dialogue?" The  Twelve's plan, it was added, is not "intangible." Although the  Bosnians must be deterred from reviving the war, pressure must  be envisaged on the Serbs to make them concede certain regions  to the Muslims without which their territory would not be  "viable," and on the Croatians to accept that the Bosnians  should have access to the sea. But these geographical changes  in a plan which is changing constantly, because each side is  trying to maximize its profits and minimize its risks, cannot be  entrusted to the result of armed conflict. A resurgence of the  fighting would place the UN Protection Force troops in an  impossible situation which would result in their withdrawal.    But it is clear that for Washington, which only has a few  hundred men in Macedonia, the Bosnian crisis does not require an  urgent decision, because it does not threaten any vital American  interest: Bosnia, from this viewpoint, is much more similar to  Lebanon than to Kuwait. A top U.S. official passing through  Paris, who does not wish to be named, said on Tuesday morning  that pressure must naturally be brought to bear on the Serbs and  Croatians, but the best means of pressure is still the force of  Bosnian arms. And, after once again mentioning the notion of  "justice" to justify the American lack of action, this same  interlocutor gave a cruder description of the state of mind of  the American public ("only the big East coast newspapers are  worrying much about Bosnia") and of Congress, which is hostile  to any U.S. involvement in Bosnia following the problems  encountered by the United States in Somalia and Haiti. "To  impose a peace settlement in Bosnia," he added, "would take at  least 200,000 men, which cannot be envisaged in the present  situation," he added.    After such a rebuff, which says a great deal about the U.S.  desire to take the Europeans at their word when they demanded an  identity in the security and defense sphere at the last NATO  summit, the Twelve can only submit their work on the subject and  hope that a conflagration does not precipitate a chaotic  withdrawal. The task is particularly uninspiring because the  Bosnians will emerge strengthened in their conviction that this  Franco-American clash has ended to their advantage. The  Russians, who have never concealed their sympathy for the  Serbian camp, understood this immediately and, in an attempt to  freeze the situation to Belgrade's advantage, have just demanded  an emergency meeting of the Security Council in Geneva at  foreign ministers' level. The aim of the meeting, to which all  the parties to the conflict would be invited, is to adopt,  following the conclusion of a cease-fire, "an agreement in  principle on peace before examining the details." There is no  doubt that the Twelve could have done without such an initiative.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Intricate compromise a model for the railways: Signal workers' earnings rise by average 8% - Hours cut to 37 / New duties include cleaning signal boxes The complex deal hammered out over the past seven days of intense negotiations to settle the four-month rail dispute appears to have pleased everybody. 'A victory for commonsense,' said Railtrack chairman Mr Robert Horton. 'An excellent package by any standards,' said Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT transport union's general secretary. Many observers wondered why such a settlement could not have been achieved in the early summer before disruption of the rail network began. Analysis of the intricate details of the deal suggests that Railtrack, the state-owned company in charge of the infrastructure, should be pleased with the longer-term outcome of what has been achieved, while RMT negotiators were able to bargain a productivity package which gives signal workers a big boost in their pay packets, at least for this year. Railtrack has achieved most of what it wanted in the modernisation of working practices that will produce annual efficiency savings amounting to Pounds 7.6m while adding only 3.4 per cent to its annual paybill. The company insists that it has not conceded any of the RMT's claim for an interim rise for past productivity that sparked off the strikes. None of the package will be backdated. The signal workers have certainly secured pre-tax pay rises of a minimum of Pounds 15 a week for the next two years. This year their earnings will rise on average by 8 per cent while their basic rates will increase on average by 20 per cent. A basic 2.5 per cent pay increase backdated to April in line with other Railtrack staff along with a one-off lump sum payment averaging Pounds 480 - mainly to buy-out working practices - will provide most signal workers with a substantial pay boost. This should ease some of the pain caused by the loss of more than Pounds 1,000 each they have suffered because of the strikes. On top of their pay increase, the signal workers have secured a cut in their basic working week from 39 hours to 37 hours. If they vote to back the deal in their union's telephone poll by Friday, an extra Pounds 50m will be allocated to their new pension scheme. In return, many working practices are to be transformed. The deal means the introduction of flexible rostering with turns of duty from six to up to 12 hours - although Railtrack has dropped its demand to include Sunday as part of the normal working week. Signal workers will also have to take on a wider range of duties, such as cleaning the signal boxes and using new equipment. Many old allowances are being bought out. They will also be expected to accept more efficient relief working, the introduction of job evaluation, annual development reviews and flexible career structures. These reforms were all covered in Railtrack's original restructuring package presented to the RMT in July. The company has not insisted on a complete upheaval - signal workers will continue to be paid premiums for overtime and unsocial hours. The RMT leadership says the deal it has negotiated is better than might have been expected. The union faced the serious prospect of a revolt among many of the well-disciplined signal workers if the strikes had dragged on for much longer. It had been clear for some weeks that the strike was failing to bite. By the most recent strikes about half the rail network was operating normally and few people were being disrupted. But in spite of the pressures building up on an increasingly isolated RMT, the union's negotiators were able to extract more than a face-saving formula. The exhausted negotiators who emerged from the conciliation office as dawn broke yesterday morning could still squabble in public about the meaning of the deal they had reached. But enough common ground had been found between them to produce a deal that satisfies all sides. There has been no surrender or climbdown - it was a compromise. But the conflict has done enormous damage to the railway industry which will take a long time to overcome. Moreover, it is just the beginning in changing the culture of railway industrial relations. The deal for signal workers will be a model for other groups on the railways, which must modernise to survive.</p>

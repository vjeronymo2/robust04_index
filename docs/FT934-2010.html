			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Public won over to Gatt cause - Japan In recent weeks Japanese bureaucrats, business leaders, politicians and media have shown unusual solidarity in rallying behind the cause of world trade reform. The message they brought to the Japanese public has been straightforward - as a nation of few resources, Japan depends heavily on maintaining global free trade and failure of the Uruguay Round could jeopardise the country's economic foundations. Japan's acceptance of the accord is a testimony to the success with which that message has been delivered. The benefits to be derived from the successful conclusion of the Round, though substantial, will only have come at a high cost. The deal on rice imports threatened to split the Social Democratic Party and topple the coalition led by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, who was criticised for his handling of the affair. The denial to the last moment by members of the government, including Mr Hosokawa, that a deal on rice existed, could be a costly mistake for the prime minister, who is sustained in power largely by his high popularity rating. It has long been agreed that the country's main industries will benefit from tariff reductions for electronics, particularly in the EU, and lower tariffs for construction machinery and other manufactured goods. It has become increasingly clear in recent years that the advantages to Japan of agreement on Gatt are not restricted to the substantial growth in trade that might be expected. As a country which not only depends on the free flow of goods for its wealth but which has come under growing criticism from its trading partners, Japan has much to gain from a strengthened international organisation which could set the rules for global trade and arbitrate in disputes. The importance to Japan of a multilateral trading organisation such as Gatt has been underlined in recent years by its many trade disputes with its major trading partners, in particular the US. Demands by the US that Japan set quantitative indicators to boost imports of foreign products, abuse of anti-dumping measures by its trading partners and disagreements between the US and Japan threatening to lead to sanctions, have highlighted the need for clearly defined multilateral trading rules and a dispute settlement organisation to prevent damaging unilateral action. The drive in Japan to support a stronger multilateral trade system has been helped by its unfortunate experience with several bilateral trade agreements, such as the semiconductor arrangement with the US under which Japan is supposed to increase the foreign share of its semiconductor market to 20 per cent. Simultaneously and more fundamentally, a successful Round will help the country take difficult steps towards restructuring its economy. Public opinion has been increasingly won over to the need for reform to Japan's outdated agricultural system or to the relationship between government and the private sector. But the will to confront such sensitive issues would probably not have arisen without outside pressure.</p>

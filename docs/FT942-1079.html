			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Sport (World Cup '94): Colombians trip up tipster - Soccer Betting-wise, my strategy of backing South American teams has been rocked, but not wrecked, by Colombia's gutless performance and (almost certain) elimination, writes Michael Thompson-Noel. They were my big winners. After Romania beat them, I took another wrong step by betting Pounds 10 each way on Romania at 25-1 (Pounds 10 to win at 25-1 and Pounds 10, at half-odds, to reach the final). My other bets - Brazil (3-1) and Argentina (9-1) - could still show a small overall profit, which means that the time to pump up the volume is fast approaching. If Brazil and Argentina win their first-round groups, they will not meet before the final (assuming they survive). But so greedy are Britain's bookmakers that Brazil have been clipped to 7-4. If Romania are eliminated, my combined losses on them and Colombia will total 53 per cent of my stakes to date - a disgraceful position to be in. For my next trick, I will probably quadruple my Pounds 20 bet on the Argies, but not until they have played Nigeria. Coolness is required. It is what the bookies dread.</p>

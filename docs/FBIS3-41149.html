The press report states that during the meeting it was  agreed  that from now on the government will use the criminal  organization's financial resources for purposes other than  subversive activities. [sentence as published]    Fujimori, after asserting that he has not and will not hold  a  meeting with Guzman, said the report was "biased and ill  intended" but did not refer to the media.    Fujimori also confirmed that drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez  Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," has been placed at the disposal of  Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate] after it was  established he had clear connections with terrorist groups,  especially the Shining Path.    He went on to immediately explain that that does not mean  Dinandro [the Police Antidrug Division] will stop its  investigations into drug trafficking. He said: "Investigations  will continue simultaneously." [passage omitted]</p>

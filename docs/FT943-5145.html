			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / US leads growth in world medicines sales Sales of US prescription medicines have rebounded this year in spite of healthcare reforms, while Japanese and European markets for medicines continued to splutter. The US pharmacy drugs market has recovered strongly, rising 7 per cent during the first six months, compared with growth of only 3 per cent during the same period last year. Sales increased from Dollars 22.7bn (Pounds 14.6bn) to Dollars 24.3bn, according to IMS International, specialist market research company. Pharmacy sales in Japan rose from Dollars 9.4bn to Dollars 10.4bn, but rose only 1 per cent in yen terms. The sector has been hit by government-inspired price cuts introduced in April. In Europe's seven largest markets, drugs sales slipped from Dollars 23bn during the first six months last year to Dollars 22.2bn in the same period this year. The figures, however, were distorted by currency devaluations and fluctuations. In local currency terms, sales increased 2 per cent compared with a growth rate of 10 per cent during the first half of 1992 and 1 per cent in the 1993 period. The German market continued to recover from last year's steep falls. Sales rose 6 per cent compared with an 11 per cent fall during the same six months last year. All therapeutic categories registered growth, apart from asthma products, which fell 1 per cent. All other European markets registered decelerating growth or even falls in sales. The Italian market fell 7 per cent, following last year's drop of 2 per cent. The French market was static after growth last year of 7 per cent. The UK remained Europe's fastest growing market, up 8 per cent, though this was less than last year's 13 per cent growth. The Spanish market also decelerated, growing at 3 per cent compared with 11 per cent. Sales in the Netherlands rose 5 per cent, (13 per cent). and those in Belgium 4 per cent (6 per cent).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD PHARMACY DRUG PURCHASES, JANUARY-JUNE 1994 (in US Dollars m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      N America     Japan*    Germany    France   Italy  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular           4,228     1,619       1,543     1,487     866 Alimentary/Metabolism    4,238     2,005       1,136     1,010     670 Central Nervous System   4,355       525         683       691     353 Anti-infectives          2,512     1,343         403       673     470 Respiratory              2,713       793         681       463     241 Musculo-Skeletal         1,141     1,005         347       263     204 Blood Agents             1,160       852         249       365     215 Others                   3,939     2,243       1,363     1,006     704 Total                   24,286    10,385       6,405     5,958   3,723 % Change**                   7         1           6         0      -7  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             UK     Spain    Netherlands   Belgium  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular             446       380            154       157 Alimentary/Metabolism      520       312            185       124 Central Nervous System     356       217             98       124 Anti-infectives            188       243             50        91 Respiratory                406       200            115        76 Musculo-Skeletal           176       103             37        44 Blood Agents                43       109             35        32 Others                     510       348            146       134 Total                    2,645     1,912            820       782 % Change**                   8         3              5         4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Non-hospital market only   **Increase excluding currencies Source: IMS International  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

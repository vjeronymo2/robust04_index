			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Philippines push for investment faces formidable hurdles: A look at the politically unpalatable measures included in reforms aimed at boosting economic confidence THE Philippines' new government appears headed for some rough waters in its attempts to lift investor confidence, vital for sustained economic recovery. Mr Fidel Ramos, the former army general who became the new president on June 30, has said his administration will aim to attract increased investment and trade, generating more jobs in the nation of 62m people. However, a number of politically unpalatable measures - including new taxes and the easing of protective regulations on domestic industry - are included in reforms seen as essential for the absorption of increased investment. Experts believe that unless these reforms are implemented, the economy could only hope to grow by 3-4 per cent a year. While the local business sector has generally backed the new government's economic programmes, support could waver if reform begins to hurt local industries. The labour sector, whose plea for legislated wage increases has just been rejected by Mr Ramos, is also expected to oppose the planned tax measures and press for pay rises compensating for loss of purchasing power over the past two years. The government's difficulties are illustrated by the recent decision to raise import tariffs on sugar, which the Philippines exports in large volumes. The tariff increase was prompted by sugar-industry leaders' protest against the planned opening up of the local market to sugar imports from October, but the move contradicts Mr Ramos' repeated satements that he would strive for more deregulation and liberalisation of the economy. Despite the difficulties, the Ramos administration's economic managers are confident they can pull off 'the next economic miracle' in Asia. They say there is a positive outlook among foreign investors and creditors to back up their optimism. Mr Ramon del Rosario, finance secretary, and Mr Jose Cuisia, governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines, are in the thick of a campaign to reduce the overall public-sector budget deficit to levels required under an International Monetary Fund-supported economic stabilisation programme. The central bank has been sopping up excess cash on the streets via high-yielding Treasury bills. Interest rates on the issues have so far been only slightly above normal levels, but some bankers see the rates surging in coming weeks. Any big jump in commercial lending rates, which could fuel inflation, will be a drag on industrial activity, which is only starting to recover from the dampening effect of an import levy early this year. The IMF has been asking local finance officials to sell off more state corporations to bring down the government budget deficit, but Manila had fended off the pressures, opting instead to raise revenues through new tax measures and improved collection. Adherence to IMF conditions is crucial for continued access to commercial and official credit. Any disruption in that, Mr del Rosario says, could derail recovery efforts. He hopes that by keeping a stable relationship with the international financial community, the Philippines could 'again attract flows from the voluntary capital markets'. After ensuring continued links with the country's creditors, the government also plans to present to the IMF for credit support a 'growth-oriented, medium-term programme'. Senior officials at the policy-making National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) are focusing on the long-term objectives, instead of worrying over possible short-term distractions. Mr Cielito Habito, economic planning secretary and Neda director-general, says the Ramos administration targets a 'double-digit annual growth rate' in GNP by the end of its term in 1998. That should put per capita GNP - now at about Dollars 750 (Pounds 393) - at Dollars 1,000, which would elevate the Philippines to the upper ranks of the region's newly industrialising economies. The aim is also to instil 'world competitiveness' into domestic industry, according to Mr Habito. For the short-term, he says, there will be no pump-priming scheme similar to that witnessed in the early years of the previous administration. But there will be a deliberate move to prevent a decline in investments in capital expenditures. In the proposed 1993 budget approved by the Ramos cabinet yesterday, capital investments are targeted at 5.8 per cent of GNP. The allocations will include power plants and other infrastructure projects that could attract more private investors. Mr Habito says new foreign financing, which costs less than domestic credit, will be sought for the government's growth-oriented strategies over the next two to three years.</p>

General Enforcement Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> EPA, as authorized in the CAA, would enforce nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards in a manner similar to on-highway standards. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 213(d) of the Act provides that the standards promulgated under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 213 ``shall be subject to sections (206, 207, 208, and 209), with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such modifications of the applicable regulations implementing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such sections as the Administrator deems appropriate, and shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be enforced in the same manner as standards prescribed under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section (202).'' Section 206 specifies requirements for motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles and motor vehicle engine compliance testing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification; section 207 requires manufacturers to warrant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance by motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines in actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use; section 208 requires recordkeeping by manufacturers of new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines and authorizes EPA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collect information and require reports; and section 209 preempts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states and political subdivisions from adopting or enforcing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards relating to emission control, certification, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless specifically authorized to do so by EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to this authority, EPA is proposing in today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action regulations that require manufacturers of new small SI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines to obtain certification and that subject them to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Selective Enforcement Auditing. Any manufacturer of a new small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SI engine would be responsible for obtaining from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator a certificate of conformity covering any engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduced into commerce in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is also proposing certain prohibited acts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general enforcement provisions similar to those for on-highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles under sections 203, 204, 205, and 208 of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 203 specifies prohibited acts; section 204 provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for federal court injunctions of violations of section 203(a);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 205 provides for assessment of civil penalties for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations of section 203; and section 208 provides the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with information collection authority. The general enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language of section 213(d) provides the Agency's authority for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying section 203, 204, 205, and 208 of the CAA to new small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SI engines and equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As applied to nonroad engines, vehicles and equipment under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 213(d), Phase 1 prohibited acts would include, but would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An engine manufacturer's introduction into commerce of new small SI engines that are not covered by a certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity issued by EPA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The introduction into commerce of new small SI equipment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles which do not incorporate the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonhandheld or handheld certified nonroad engine,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Tampering with emission control devices or elements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design installed on or in a small SI engine, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Failure to provide information to the Agency if requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> EPA is also proposing regulations, under the authority of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 205 of the Act, which set forth the maximum statutory penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for violating the prohibitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> EPA is proposing general information collection provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to current on-highway provisions under section 208 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act which would include, but would not be limited to, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's responsibility to provide information to EPA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform testing if requested by EPA, and maintain records. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, EPA is proposing emission system defect reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations which require manufacturers to report to EPA emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system-related defects that affect a given class or category of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines. EPA enforcement personnel would be authorized to gain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entry and access to various facilities under section 208 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's action proposes these entry and access provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Australia has approved a request to change the name  of the Canberra office of the Palestine Liberation Organization.  The title of the PLO office will be changed to the General  Palestinian Delegation.    Announcing the move, Australia's foreign minister, Gareth  Evans, said it did not involve any change in the diplomatic  status of the PLO's representation. It did not involve the  granting of any diplomatic privileges or immunities.    Senator Evans said conditions had not been satisfied for  Australia to recognize Palestine as a sovereign state or the PLO  as a government of a state. Australia's foreign minister has  said the creation of an independent state of Palestine might  well be the independent ultimate outcome of the peace process,  but it was premature to anticipate the process at this stage.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: AUTOMOTIVE  </P> <P> They Can Hardly Wait: At Mitsubishi Motor Sales headquarters in Cypress, the  adrenaline is pumping as Oct. 1 approaches.  </P> <P> That's when the company -- experiencing its best year since hitting the United  States in 1983 -- unleashes its $30,000, 300-horsepower, 150-m.p.h.,  dual-turbocharged, all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-steering 3000 GT VR-4, and its  less-expensive sibling, the 3000 GT.  </P> <P> Dealers across the country initially will receive a skimpy allotment of the  low-slung 2+2 coupes -- only 2,000 are expected to be sent to 400 dealers by  the end of the year.  </P> <P> Rick Lepley, vice president of sales for the Mitsubishi division, said the  company already has received orders and deposits for 1,500 of the cars -- most  for the beefier 3000 GT VR-4.  </P></p>

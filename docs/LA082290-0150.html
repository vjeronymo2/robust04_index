			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> STUDIO TOUR SUES RIDE DESIGNER  </P> <P> Universal Studios Florida has sued the designer of "Jaws" and "Earthquake --  The Big One," two highly touted thrill rides that have been shut down except  for brief periods since the park's June 7 opening.  </P> <P> The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Orange County (Fla.)  </P> <P> Circuit Court against Ride &amp; Show Engineering Inc. of San Dimas, Calif.,  claims the company used poor design and workmanship on the rides and failed to  have them operating by the grand opening of the $630-million studio tour.  </P> <P> Ride &amp; Show Engineering plans to fight the suit and is considering a  counterclaim against the theme park, said Joseph B. McHugh, the firm's vice  president of marketing and administration.  </P> <P> "We strongly disagree with Universal's claims," McHugh said. "Except for the  expense of litigation, we welcome the chance to vindicate our company."  </P></p>

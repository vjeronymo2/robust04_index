			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Libyans dash Israel hopes of recognition ISRAELI hopes of a breakthrough in relations with Libya ended abruptly yesterday when a group of pilgrims sent by the Tripoli regime demanded the liberation of Jerusalem and its recognition as the capital of Palestine. The arrival of nearly 200 Libyans on Monday to visit Islamic sites had triggered speculation that it could lead to the recognition of Israel by Col Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader. The group had travelled overland, via Egypt, having apparently been refused permission by Saudi Arabia to visit Mecca and Medina. But yesterday, Mr Daw Tajouri, the leader of the Libyan group, declared at a news conference: 'From here, we call on Moslems from all over the world to contribute to the liberation of Jerusalem, which must be the capital of the Palestinian state. 'Since the holy places in Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are all occupied, there is no difference between going to Mecca or coming to Jerusalem. Indeed, it seems as though Jerusalem can be reached more easily,' he said. Mr Uzi Baram, Israel's minister of tourism, immediately announced that all official contact with the group had been terminated. Later, the Libyan delegation said they would be leaving today. . Arab east Jerusalem was occupied by Israel during the the 1967 Middle East war and subsequently annexed. Earlier, Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, had said Israel would offer a warm welcome to Col Gadaffi if he decided to become the second Arab leader, after the late President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, to visit Israel. Foreign ministry officials said they believed that Col Gadaffi had sent the delegation primarily to persuade western nations to ease the sanctions imposed on Libya more than a year ago over its alleged role in the 1988 destruction of an airliner over Scotland. A spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organisation said Palestinians had been 'shocked and dismayed' by the Libyan initiative. He added that the Libyan regime had been warned about the dangers of making such a gesture when Col Gadaffi first raised the issue more than a month ago.</p>

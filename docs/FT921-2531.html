			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Manifesto to manifesto THE Conservative manifesto published yesterday is twice the length and twice the price of Labour's. This does not mean it is twice as good, although Mr Major's programme contains more novelties than Mr Kinnock's. Whereas Labour's document is the umpteenth in a series which began with the watershed policy review in 1987, Mr Major's is the work of a team which achieved power suddenly and has never quite had time to think through what it stands for. With Labour, the game is to study the passage in successive documents on, say, energy, and then to try to work out whether a change in wording represents a policy shift or just word processor blindness. Because Labour has been in opposition so long, all we have to go on is its language, which all too often buckles under the strain of scrutiny. It is fitting that the Tory document should have on its cover a picture of the prime minister. This really is the book of the man: level-headed and clear about the central principles of individual choice and market forces, supplemented by a commitment to better public services. The challenge of Mr Major's second administration, if there is to be one, will be to reconcile these two themes. In this document, that reconciliation is not achieved. The strongest parts of the manifesto are those Mr Major inherited from Mrs Thatcher and upon which he has built: increased competition in public utilities, privatisation, performance-raising new structures in health and a genuine commitment to the minimum necessary regulation of enterprise. Its line on Europe is Thatcherism modified more in style than substance: no to the social charter, but yes to a community of 22 by the end of the decade, and an open-ish mind on monetary union. Vague targets Like his predecessor, Mr Major favours lower taxes; unlike her, he is prepared to tilt that policy in favour of the lower paid. His targets for balanced budgets and reduced public spending are vague. But it is in wrestling with the public sector and regulating the lives of citizens that the new approach emerges. This is a world of badge-wearing civil servants; inspectors for everything that moves, from social workers to firemen; task forces on truancy and empty government property; a new Urban Regeneration Agency and an Environment Agency; even a Hedgerow Incentive Scheme. Proud reference is made to the Safer Cities programme and its '124 schemes to improve street lighting'. Who said this was a government that had run out of ideas? It has ideas on elephants, battery hens, joy riders, caravan sites and even on the millennium, which is to have its very own fund, paid for by a lottery. Nanny state What shall we name this vision? Surely it is none other than the nanny state, wearing a smart blue pinafore. There she beckons, as through every chartered street we go. The central problem is that these Christmas stockings full of policies and quangos, some good, some bad, hang from a tree of centralised government, which is wilting under the burden. The Tories are so opposed to constitutional reform, strong local government or even lucid debate on the democratic accountability of public services, that such issues are nowhere addressed. Instead of a city-wide government, London is to be supervised by a minister of London public transport and a cabinet committee chaired by the environment secretary. Labour, to its credit, is thinking its way through this inescapable agenda of governance, proposing substantial decentralisation and reform, albeit with gaps and self-contradictions. The worry with Labour's manifesto is the old one. On markets, the party talks the talk, but will it walk the walk? Government is there 'to ensure that the market works properly'. But Labour will renationalise the electricity grid, block competitive tendering in the NHS and local authorities, introduce a minimum wage, cut coal imports. It wants a National Investment Bank, but one 'operating on strictly commercial lines', in which case, it must be inquired: what's the point? At heart, Labour still believes that enhanced performance can be delivered at least as well by administrative fiat as by competitive forces. There are, of course, also policy overlaps and common blind spots. Both parties want a broadcasting and arts ministry and neither has a credible plan to revive the rental market in housing. But, taken with their sharply differing views on personal taxation, these two manifestos confirm that Britain faces a choice. It lies between parties which are distinctive from each other, but neither of which has a monopoly of good sense.</p>

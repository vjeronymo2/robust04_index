			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Downturn in futures sends Nikkei lower JAPANESE equities fell back in late-afternoon trading as enthusiasm waned after a fall in the futures market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 116.85 to 17,068.41, having risen to the day's high of 17,306.02 on buying by dealers on the first day of trading for November accounts. Higher bond prices also fuelled hopes of lower interest rates, prompting buying by investment trusts. However, a downturn in futures prices prompted position unwinding, and the index fell to the day's low of 17,068.30 just before the close. Volume improved marginally to 200m shares from 150m. Declines led advances by 491 to 410, with 200 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first sections fell 5.14 to 1,292.39 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.21 to 1042.37. Traders said that while overall buying interest among investors remained low, hopes of lower interest rates were still providing underlying support. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said that lower interest rates towards the end of the year could prompt a rally among interest rate-sensitive issues, especially non-life insurers, which have remained low relative to the Nikkei. Dealers bought theme stocks for quick profits, but the lack of interest among investors triggered a sell-off towards the end of the day. Aisin Seiki, the day's most active issue, fell Y10 to Y1,150 and Nikken Chemicals lost Y40 to Y1,120. Some investors sought 'defensive' food stocks, which are unaffected by currency movements. Traders said that the recent trend for businessmen to eat at home would push up demand for foodstuffs. Kagome, the ketchup maker, gained Y30 to Y1,050 and Nichirei Y16 to Y674. Housing stocks rose on reports of a 28.3 per cent increase in mortgage loans for individuals by the Housing Loan Corporation in the third quarter. Misawa Homes rose Y90 to Y1,100 and Taisei Prefab gained Y40 to Y2,040. Gajoen Kanko, the hotel operator, failed to trade owing to the lack of buyers and closed at an offered price of Y201, down from Monday's close of Y281. The issue was suspended on Tuesday following reports of alleged window dressing of its financial account for the year to February 1992. Investors ignored the company's denials and rushed to place sell orders. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 27.50 to 18,771.43 in volume of 11.6m shares. Small-lot buying by dealers pushed up the index despite the decline in Tokyo. Roundup THE region's markets were mixed yesterday. HONG KONG slid in the afternoon ahead of a statement by the governor, Mr Chris Patten. The Hang Seng index fell 91.03 to 6,126.98 in low turnover of HLDollars 2.5bn. After the close, Mr Patten denied that there had been an agreement between London and Beijing in 1990 on the future of democracy in the colony. Sentiment was further un-settled by rumours of imminent share placements by Citic Pacific and New World following Bank of East Asia's HKDollars 3.79bn placement on Tuesday. Citic Pacific fell to HKDollars 13.40 before closing unchanged at HKDollars 13.60. SEOUL saw late institutional buying help the composite index to a gain of 1.24 at 585.34. Brokers commented that the market had earlier lost ground on rumours, later denied, that the government was investigating whether Daewoo group companies had subsidised the group chairman's political ambitions. All 19 of Daewoo's listed shares went limit-down, with Daewoo Corporation and Daewoo Heavy Industries both losing Won400 to Won8,700 and Won9,000 respectively. BOMBAY was dragged down by heavy speculative selling ahead of the end of account today. The BSE index fell 110.51 or 3.7 per cent to 2,876.70. Brokers said carry-forward charges for the business done in the last three weeks would rise to 3.5 per cent a month from 2 per cent because of a cash shortage. SINGAPORE saw Singapore Airlines foreign shares rise 80 cents at SDollars 15.10 despite reporting lower interim earnings. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 0.97 to 1,391.88 in volume of 103.3m shares. AUSTRALIA failed to get support from good inflation data as sentiment was depressed by a weak domestic dollar. The All Ordinaries index fell 18.2 to 1,418.2 in turnover of ADollars 265.9m. NEW ZEALAND was depressed by a statement from Fletcher Challenge that it would find it difficult to match last year's profits. The NZSE-40 lost 2.66 to 1,380.78 in turnover of NZDollars 19m as Fletcher Challenge fell to an all-time low, down 3 cents at NZDollars 1.73.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Premier attacked over war apology PREMIER Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan yesterday came under fire in parliament for extending his recent apologies for Japan's war record to include allied as well as Asian victims. Mr Shintaro Ishihara, a staunch nationalist in the opposition Liberal Democratic party, told the lower house: 'Japan does feel guilty for what it did in Asian countries, but there is no need for us to apologise to the allied countries that won the war, like Britain, the US, Holland and France.' Mr Hosokawa has aroused the anger of traditionalists in the LDP by facing Japan's wartime responsibilities more explicitly than any prime minister. Most, but not all, his supporters in the seven-party coalition see this as essential to Japan's attempts to take a more prominent part in international diplomacy. But Mr Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's wartime aggression, first voiced soon after he became prime minister in early August, have prompted protests both from the opposition and inside his own coalition. 'There were many people from the allied countries in Asia during the war and they endured great pain. It is natural that they too be included,' Mr Hosokawa argued yesterday. Mr Ishihara's attack is significant because he is a popular symbol of nationalist sentiment, as author of a best-seller, The Japan That Can Say No. In an emotional speech, Mr Ishihara declared: 'Japan also suffered in the war. Many were killed in the atomic bombing but we've not heard one word of apology. . . You have erred in your war remarks and I demand that you admit it.' Mr Hosokawa countered that he was fully aware of Japan's wartime sufferings. Other LDP members of parliament alleged Mr Hosokawa's apologies had triggered compensation claims from former British prisoners of war, and from Asian women forced into wartime prostitution. The government's response is that compensation was legally settled in the post-war San Francisco peace treaty.</p>

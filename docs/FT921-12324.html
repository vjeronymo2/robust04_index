			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Pakistan backs UN peace talks THE Pakistan government yesterday threw its weight behind UN-sponsored talks to end Afghanistan's civil war, a policy switch UN officials say removes a key obstacle to the peace talks, AP reports from Islamabad. Pakistan,said the Moslem rebels now had to negotiate with their one-time communist foes. The fundamentalist guerrillas, however, have continued to reject negotiation.

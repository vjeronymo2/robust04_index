Joint Stock Company, Novosibirsk; UDC  577.152.314]    [Abstract] Continuing interest in finding new restriction  endonucleases aimed at discovering new prototypes or more  practicable isoschizomers prompted a study of approximately 200  strains isolated by routine methods from the soil in various  regions throughout Russia. The strains were selected on the  basis of the following criteria: the thermophilic property of  the bacteria, the ability to generate endospores, and the  possibility of using conventional and easily available nutrient  media, such as RPA and RPB, for cultivating microorganisms. The  experimental procedure is described. As a result, 26 feasible  products of restriction endonucleases were isolated; recognition  sequences were identified for all 26 products and cleavage  sites--for 15 of them. It is demonstrated that the enzymes are  isoschizomers of the following known endonucleases:  BstNI, EarI, HaeIII,  HpaII, Cfr10I, BsiYI,  BclI, BbvII, BbvI,  BstEII, BsaBI, BsrI,  FspI, ClaI, and SfeI. The  findings make it possible to assert that thermophilic bacteria  of the Bacillus genus are a promising source of  restriction endonucleases. Tables 1; references 5: 4 Russian, 1  Western.</p>

The ranks of officials at the "power-wielding" agencies are  one or two grades higher than those of other public officials  with similar qualifications and experience, and have long been a  target of complaint for the latter.    For instance, a newly commissioned public prosecutor, after  two years at the judicial research and training institute and  then passing the higher judicial service examinations, is given  a rank two grades higher than new public officials in other  government agencies who passed the higher civil service  examinations.    Ranks of officials at the NSP and the BAI are also higher  than those at other agencies, while field-grade officers of the  Armed Forces are two grades higher than their counterparts in  the civil service.    To rectify this situation, the administrative reform  committee will shortly study the downgrading plan, a committee  source said, adding the committee is taking suggestions about  readjusting the ranks of officials at power-related agencies.    Another source said it would be difficult to readjust  downward public prosecutors' ranks because they were set on a  par with courthouse judges.    The ranks of officials at power-related agencies were  upgraded under the authoritarian governments of Pak Chong-hui  and Chon Tu-hwan in a bid to strengthen their power base.</p>

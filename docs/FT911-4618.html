			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Safe haven plan brings relief to Turkey: Ankara let off the hook of international criticism over refugee hard line TURKEY'S sense of relief was all too apparent yesterday after the announcement that the US military is to help establish safe havens in northern Iraq for the thousands of refugees camped on the Turkish border. Although officials emphasise it is only a temporary solution for the Kurds, the plan clearly lets Turkey off the hook. Turkey has faced growing criticism from the aid community for confining the refugees to border areas inaccessible to normal relief operations - the main reason for this week's US led-helicopter airlift to the estimated 300,000 refugees on Turkey's southern border. Ankara has argued that the nature of the terrain makes it more practical to assist the refugees inside Iraq. As one official explained, the Iraqi lowlands are some 10km from the border areas while Turkey's flat lands suitable for camps are 150km away. Voicing support for the plan, Mr Yacob Youssif, a member of the Iraqi opposition, predicted last week that 80 per cent of the refugees would return if their security could be guaranteed. Ankara's worry now is that the safe havens could all too easily become a permanent Kurdish presence on its southern borders. A main concern for Turkey has been to avoid a repeat of the 1988 crisis when it opened its borders to 60,000 Kurds fleeing President Saddam Hussein's chemical attacks. Of these, fewer than 2,000 were resettled, while almost 28,000 remain in three Turkish camps in the south-east. The US was flying reconnaisance missions yesterday while US officials confirmed that experts from the Disaster Assistance Response Teams (Dart) were already inside northern Iraq surveying possible sites. Meanwhile in Diyarbakir, UK and French officials were in talks with the US military. One diplomat suggested the plain between Habur bridge on the Turkish border and the Kurdish town of Zakho might prove the most suitable site. Yesterday a US military official confidently predicted the refugees could be back inside Iraq within 30 to 40 days. Mr Murat Sungar, the foreign ministry spokesman, said the plight of refugees could not just be ignored 'because there is no consensus in the UN'. Earlier this week, Mr Kurtcebe Alptemocin, the foreign minister, said there would have to be a UN sanction for the plan. However, the ministry said yesterday it was unlikely the Security Council would pass 'anything more forceful than 688' - which states that Iraq's repression of the Kurds constitutes a threat to international peace and security. Before Tuesday's announcement of the safe havens, Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said the aid community had to be 'imaginative' while conceding that a US military presence might be necessary to secure the safe haven plan. For all that, it remains unclear how the US can hand over the operation to the UN without further Security Council resolutions. Turkey says it will provide logistical support to the refugees returning home, airbases to supply the safe havens and national TV and radio to give information on the best routes back into Iraq. Turkey says it has no plans for a military role inside Iraq. However, its bases at Incirlik and Batman are likely to be used by US and other allied aircraft to police the skies. The local governor's announcement this week that 40,000 would be moved down onto lower ground near Silopi was described as the humanitarian gesture, and a not a change in policy.</p>

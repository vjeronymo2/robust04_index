			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service published a notice of public hearing on the proposed rule on December 19, 1991 (56 FR 65877). Public hearings were conducted in California on January 9, 1992, in Sacramento; on January 14, 1992, in Santa Monica; and on January 16, 1992, in Visalia. At each meeting, testimony was taken from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species was published on March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854). In the final rule, the Service postponed the decision on critical habitat designation for up to 1 year beyond the date that the final rule was due (October 3, 1993) in accordance with section 4(b)(6)(C)(ii) of the Act. The economic analysis necessary to determine critical habitat was still in progress at that time. On March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14199), the Service published a notice that the public comment period on the proposed designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt was reopened until April 30, 1993, to allow the Service to consider any information that previously had not been submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Revisions to the October 3, 1991, Critical Habitat Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service is required to base critical habitat designations on the best scientific and commercial data available (50 CFR 424.12). Subsequent to publication of the October 3, 1991, proposed rule, the Service received new information on the current distribution of the delta smelt, primarily from other State and Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based primarily on information gathered by the California Department of Fish and Game (Dale Sweetnam, California Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm., 1993) and University of California, Davis (Lesa Meng, University of California, pers. comm., 1993), the Service proposes to expand the geographic extent of critical habitat to include additional areas now known to constitute important spawning habitat. In 1993, delta smelt spawned in the Sacramento River, at least as far upstream as Sacramento and Barker, Lindsey, Cache, Georgiana, Prospect, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore Sloughs (Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993). In 1991, when delta smelt had all but disappeared from Suisun Marsh, relatively large numbers of delta smelt were caught in Suisun Slough, as far upstream as Suisun City (Lesa Meng, pers. comm., 1993). For these reasons, the proposed critical habitat has been revised to encompass these upstream habitats. Protection of these upstream spawning habitats is essential to ensure recovery of the species. Hence, this rule proposes critical habitat for the following geographic area: Areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded by and contained in Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays); the length of Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, First Mallard (Spring Branch), and Montezuma Sloughs; and the existing contiguous waters contained within the Delta. As used in this rule, the term ``Delta'' refers to all tidal waters contained within the legal definition of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, as delineated by section 12220 of the State of California's Water Code of 1969.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an April 23, 1993, letter, received during the public comment period, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requested that new scientific information presented in its draft proposed Bay/Delta water quality standards be considered in the Service's designation of critical habitat. The Service has used this information to refine the primary constituent elements described in the original critical habitat proposal. (The term ``primary constituent element'' is defined in the ``Primary Constituent Elements'' section of this rule.) The Service's original proposal listed the following constituent elements: Space for population growth, cover or shelter, maintenance of appropriate littoral zone reproduction habitat to sustain embryos and to rear larvae and juveniles, and 0&hyph;2 parts per thousand (ppt) salinities during the January to June delta smelt reproductive season. As part of the background for formulation of its proposed water quality standards, EPA analyzed the number of days that low salinity (2 ppt) water historically was located at three positions in Suisun Bay. The revised primary constituent elements incorporate this new information. As described in the ``Primary Constituent Elements'' section of this rule, the Service has revised the primary constituent elements to include those features that provide temporal and spatial variability of low salinity waters that will deter further invasion of exotic species, produce high zooplankton densities for food, and simulate natural processes and historical conditions. The primary constituent elements also describe in detail the months that each delta smelt life stage requires protective habitat conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

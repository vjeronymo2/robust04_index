			<p>BFN     [Text] The national protest staff of Solidarity has decided  to continue the protest action. Here is [Solidarity Chairman]  Marian Krzaklewski .    [Begin Krzaklewski recording] The protest staff has taken  the  decision to intensify the protest actions of the union after 3  May.    All union structures will be expected to hold active strikes  between 4 and 7 May. We call on all workers, including those  belonging to other trade unions, to take an active part in the  action of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union [NSZZ]  Solidarity.    The demands put forward by NSZZ Solidarity, which the  government of the Polish Republic is stubbornly ignoring, are  important demands made by workers and citizens.    I was counting on the Prime Minister to put forward some  concept, in a decisive manner, but the Prime Minister chose the  tactic of a confrontational speech.    Given that he was speaking in such a confrontational manner  about our union and that his speech was in such very bad taste  as far as we were concerned, perhaps this time we shall manage  to do something with this government--[laughing] because I don't  know any more how to interpret all this.

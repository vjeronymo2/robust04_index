This was an important meeting  between the presidents of political blocs and permanent  committees on 6 January at the Legislative Palace. The great  majority of the 20 parliamentarians who participated in this  meeting supported the idea of holding a national conference in  Haiti with the participation of all sectors involved in the  crisis. Chamber of Deputies President Antoine Joseph asserts  that the issue of the parliamentarians elected on 18 January was  also tackled. Joseph refused to announce the decision on that  issue made by the presidents of the political blocs within the  Chamber of Deputies. Let us listen to Antoine Joseph:    [Begin recording, in Creole] The first point on the agenda  was an analysis of the general situation of the country. Then  there was an inventory or outline of the legislative works to  set up during the seventh ordinary session of the 45th  Legislature. Finally, we had questions of general interest. We  have not yet gone through the second point, but there was great  debate as to the general situation of the country.    One of the main ideas that has come out is that all  political  groups that were present...[rephrases] the presidents of the  political groups encourage, on behalf of the groups, the idea  that a national conference be held in the country with the  participation of all sectors concerned in the Haitian crisis and  all those who are examining the country's situation. With the  exception of the National Front for Change and Democracy, which  says it has a slight reservation, between now and tomorrow [7  January] we will sign a common document in which we will  formally encourage the national conference. But it is clear that  something has been accomplished. There are four political groups  which numerically are a majority within the Chamber of Deputies;  we can say the majority of the Chamber of Deputies encourages  the idea of a national conference. [end recording]    This was Deputy Antoine Joseph, president of the Chamber of  Deputies that supports the idea of holding a national conference  in Haiti with the participation of all sectors involved in the  Haitian crisis.</p>

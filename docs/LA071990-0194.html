			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> PARAMEDICS WON'T BE FREE ANY LONGER  </P> <P> Residents now must pay for paramedic services under a new program approved this  week by the City Council.  </P> <P> The Paramedic Subscription Program allows residents and business owners to  choose whether they want to pay a yearly rate of $36.  </P> <P> The fee may be in bimonthly installments of $6 and covers all members of a  household and up to 10 employees per business.  </P> <P> Those who choose not to participate will be billed for any use of paramedic  services, ranging from $125 to $250 for a call.  </P> <P> Provisions are made to reduce the rate for the elderly or poor.  </P> <P> Ron Burch, a retired fireman, was the only resident to speak in opposition to  the fee.  </P> <P> "I think it is a hidden tax," Burch told the council Monday night. "I think it  is just wrong."  </P> <P> Councilman Kenneth B. Jones agreed with Burch, but said: "We have to do this  whether we want to or not."  </P> <P> The program is aimed at offsetting the cost of providing emergency services and  at bolstering the city's ailing budget. Paramedic services cost the city more  than $1.1 million last year, Fire Marshal Don Tully said.  </P> <P> Last year, the city had an operating deficit of $1 million, which officials  took from the reserve fund.  </P> <P> Officials estimate that the paramedic fee program will recoup as much as 50% of  the loss, or $500,000. At least 30% of the population is expected to  participate, Tully said.LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

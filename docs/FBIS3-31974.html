			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Managua, 29 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- The National  Transportation Commission [CNT] today ignored the agreements the  government and four transportation sector organizations signed  early this morning and called for the continuation of the  transportation strike throughout the country.    During this morning's meeting with the government, the  Nicaraguan Freight Transportation Federation [Federacion de  Transporte Carga de Nicaragua], the National Chamber of  Transportation [Camara Nacional del Transporte], and the  National Association of Transportation [Asociacion Nacional del  Transporte] committed themselves to suspending the  transportation strike, which entered on its sixth day today.    The authorities agreed to freeze the prices of gasoline and  diesel fuel until May and April, respectively, granted a subsidy  to cooperatives of taxis and commercial delivery vehicles during  the next four months, and granted tax exonerations and  concessions.    The government also released the 209 drivers arrested 26 and  27 January during police operations in the Nicaraguan capital,  because they had obstructed the free movement of people.    After dismissing the agreement, Gustavo Aguiluz, a spokesman  for the Sandinist CNT, described this morning's agreement,  however, as a show mounted by the government in alliance with  other organizations to unsettle or weaken the strike.    He said unilateral decisions do not resolve the demands on  the gasoline issue. He said in four months a new demonstration  would be necessary to prevent a fuel price increase. The  passenger service strike continues, and only a few buses and  taxis are circulating in Managua.    The CNT has called a demonstration of force for 31 January  in  this capital, where it will rally all of the country's buses and  taxis.</p>

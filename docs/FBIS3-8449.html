			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Slovak National Party [SNS] Chairman Jan Slota told  a TASR correspondent that his party had suggested to the Party  of the Democratic Left [SDL] chairman that it would withdraw  from the coalition with the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia] if it was inevitable in order to form an HZDS-SDL  coalition before early parliamentary elections. He said that  the SNS was aware that the problem that has arisen was not a  result of politicking but of the economic collapse of this young  republic.    SDL Chairman Peter Weiss reacted to Slota's offer to  withdraw  from the coalition with the following words: We are willing to  negotiate with anyone, but today, after the president's speech,  the situation is different from what it was yesterday.    Asked whether the SDL was united, Weiss responded that four  deputies had not signed the proposal to dismiss the prime  minister because they insisted that the issue of early elections  should be resolved first. He added that the current crisis in  the country could not be resolved by passing a vote of no  confidence in Vladimir Meciar without agreeing on a date for  early elections.</p>

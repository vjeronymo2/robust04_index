			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MYTH' SERIES AT U. OF JUDAISM  </P> <P> Pop culture picks through the vast treasure chest of myths and fairy tales,  uses what's "commercial," throws aside what isn't, and changes them along the  way. Perhaps this myth form is better than none at all -- that great myth  lover, Joseph Campbell, also loved "Star Wars." But what do the original  stories sound like?  </P> <P> Diane Wolkstein, a leading member of a small, hardy band of storytellers who  travel the country and the world, is providing a glimpse into this world at a  three-evening presentation, "Fairy Tale, Myth and Narrative," which ends  tonight at the University of Judaism.  </P> <P> Each evening's program varies a bit. Tuesday's reading, despite the Judaic  surroundings, was catholic in taste and scope. The first tale was about a magic  orange tree, while the second was about how a good little girl can outwit an  evil stepmother and an acquisitive opportunist. In both, the woods are where  life is changed, and they exemplified how a story can best teach lessons in  decent behavior.  </P> <P> The lessons were more overt in Hans Christian Andersen's "The Most Incredible  Thing of All" (which Wolkstein repeats tonight) and "The Clay Digger," a  compressed saga with an ironic moral. "It's about hope," said Wolkstein, who  sometimes adds her own post-narrative comments.  </P> <P> These don't get in the way of the tales, though, because Wolkstein functions  equally as a teacher and a performer. She saved her best performances for the  concluding tales, an Eskimo adventure as told to film maker Robert Flaherty and  a fragment from the Sumerian myth of the goddess Inanna. Wolkstein's is an oral  art, in which she modulates her voice from a booming bass to a willowy whisper,  but never for mere effect. Like a good actor serving the play, she serves the  story. The story is enough.  </P> <P>  At 15600 Mulholland Drive, Bel-Air, tonight at 7:45. Tickets: $15; (213)  783-3833 Ext. 246.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Last night, Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman, received the  U.S. Ambassador in Sanaa, Arthur Hughes. They discussed  developments in the situation in our country in light of the  comprehensive war that traitor al-Bid has declared against the  homeland and unity.    The U.S. ambassador reiterated his country's support for  unity and democracy and his country's concern for stability and  peace in Yemen. The brother chairman expressed our country's  appreciation of the U.S. position. He stressed that the Yemen  of unity, democracy, and respect for human rights will always be  eager to bolster its relations with all brothers and friends,  chiefly the United States, on the basis of mutual interests  serving the objectives of the two friendly countries and peoples.    The meeting was attended by brother 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani,  minister of planning and development.    Brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih also received individually the  ambassadors of the permanent UN Security Council states. He  received the charge d'affaires of the PRC Embassy, French  Ambassador Marcel (le Gelle), Russian Ambassador (P. Chencko),  and UK Ambassador Douglas (Gordon). During the meetings,  discussions dealt with the developments in the situation in our  country and bilateral relations. The ambassadors reiterated  their countries' support for Yemen's unity and democracy. They  indicated that this is a firm stand that stems from their  countries' interest in Yemen's stability and peace. During the  meetings, the brother chairman expressed appreciation of the  PRC, France, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom for  supporting unity and democracy in our country. He stressed our  country's eagerness to bolster its relations with those  countries, proceeding from friendship, joint interests, mutual  benefits, and positive, productive cooperation in all fields.    Referring to the current situation in our country, the  brother chairman expressed confidence that brothers and friends  understand that what is going on is an internal affair that  concerns Yemen, and that the ongoing war ignited by traitor  al-Bid against the homeland and its unity is a war between the  Yemeni people with their various segments, political forces, and  national and social organizations on the one hand and a small  clique that has rebelled against the legitimate authority and  conspired against unity and the homeland on the other. He  stressed that some news media allegations that what is going on  is a war between the north and south are unfounded. He stressed  that there are over 11 military brigades from southern and  eastern governorates now fighting at the forefront of the forces  of unity in defense of Constitutional legitimacy, valiantly  confronting the rebellious, secessionist gang.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIP OF THE WEEK: IT'S SNOW SEASON AGAIN IN THE SIERRA  </P> <P> Mammoth Mountain was the first ski area in the Western United States to open  this season, thanks to late-October storms that left two to four feet of snow  on its slopes. With last weekend's snowfall there is still a base of three to  four feet as the resort gears up for the winter.  </P> <P> Average annual snowfall on the mountain is 18 feet. Thirty lifts transport  thousands of skiers to the maze of downhill runs. Other skiers tour Mammoth's  scenic countryside over cross-country trails.  </P> <P> But skiing isn't Mammoth's only wintertime attraction. Visitors can ride  through the snow on a dog sled, a horse-drawn sleigh or a snowmobile. Or they  can sightsee in a hot-air balloon equipped with a basket mounted on skis that  skim over the snow during landing. Other sports options are ice skating,  snowshoe walking and sledding.  </P> <P> The main draw of this resort town is its 11,053-foot inactive volcano that  offers 3,500 acres of gentle-to-steep terrain for downhill skiers. Thirty  percent of the slopes are designed for beginners, 40% for intermediates and 30%  for advanced skiers. The longest run is 2.5 miles.  </P> <P> Even if you don't ski, it's worth a ride to the summit of Mammoth Mountain in a  pair of gondolas for a sweeping vista of the Eastern Sierra. Take Gondola 1  from the Main Lodge to Mid-Chalet where refreshments are available, then  continue to the mountaintop on Gondola 2. Round-trip sightseeing tickets are  $6, children $3.  </P> <P> For skiers, all-day lift tickets cost $35, half-day $25. Children pay half  price, except those 6 years and under, who ski free. Skiers 65 and older also  ride the lifts without charge.  </P> <P> A new 10-X Ticket Book costs $290 (children $145) and lets you ski for 10 days  at Mammoth and neighboring June Mountain any time during the season. Lower  priced three- to five-day consecutive midweek, non-holiday tickets also are  available.  </P> <P> You'll find midweek lift and lodging packages at Mammoth Mountain Inn, which is  a few steps from Main Lodge and the slopes. The per-person rate begins at $189  for three days/three nights in a hotel-type room or $260 in a condo suite,  including lift tickets.  </P> <P> Regular per-night hotel room rates (single or double) at the inn are $69/$125  midweek, $85/$140 on weekends. Some suites accommodate up to 13 guests and cost  $200 midweek, $255 weekends. Call toll-free (800) 228-4947 or (619) 934-2581  for reservations.  </P> <P> The 214-room Mammoth Mountain Inn is at the Main Lodge ski area about six miles  from the town of Mammoth Lakes, where there are many other accommodations in  motels, condos and cabins.  </P> <P> This season you can ride free to and from the slopes and around the town aboard  a fleet of Mammoth Area Shuttle (MAS) buses. All are equipped with racks for  skis and snow boards.  </P> <P> Several companies offer activities in the snow, and you can book them through  Mammoth Adventure Connection at the Mammoth Mountain Inn. Call (619) 934-0606.  </P> <P> Especially popular are the dog sled excursions that depart from the inn through  the woods to Minaret Vista. Mush with the huskies for a half hour ($27.50;  children 12 years and under $16.50) or an hour ($60.50, children $27.50). Kids  under 3 are free.  </P> <P> You also can take a romantic dog-sled ride in the moonlight that begins with  champagne and ends with dinner at the inn's Mountainside Grill or Yodler  restaurant. The outings are operated by Dog Sled Adventures. Call (619)  934-6270.  </P> <P> The same company runs a team of sled dogs at Sierra Meadows at the edge of  town. That's also where sleighs pulled by pairs of draft horses make excursions  on Friday, Saturday and holiday evenings. Some include hot spiced wine and  cider, others feature hearty ranch-style dinners after the ride. Call (619)  934-6161 for rates and reservations.  </P> <P> Guided hourlong horseback rides over rolling hills along Mammoth Creek also are  offered at Sierra Meadows. And you can rent skis, boots and poles and take  lessons for cross-country ski touring, as well as arrange for snowmobile  rentals.  </P> <P> DJ's Snowmobile Adventures has rentals and guided tours along U.S. 395 at  Smokey Bear Flat, where there are 50 miles of trails to explore.

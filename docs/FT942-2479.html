			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Short - not necessarily sweet: The weighty political and economic significance of a truncated name Last week The Spectator received advance notice of an impending political disaster. It came in the form of a letter from David de Pinna, which warned that 'there is a possibility that Great Britain could have a prime minister named Tony. Tony]' Following the disastrous showing of the government in the European elections, and the cracking start by Tony Blair in the campaign for the Labour leadership, there is indeed a good chance of de Pinna's nightmare becoming reality. He concludes: 'That an important section of the western world could be 'led' by Bill and Tony does not inspire. What lack of dignity. Flower-pot men indeed]' It is less surprising that an American President could be called 'Bill'. One of the characteristics which distinguishes our former colony from the motherland is the way in which its citizens make haste to shorten their given names. Have you ever heard of an American called Charles? Only 'Chuck' will do. If you are called 'Charles' and you have spent any time in America, you will know, all too embarrassingly, what I mean. The Australians are similarly besotted with the instantly familiar abbreviation. I have never been called anything other than 'Dom' by Australians, something which no Englishman has ever attempted even as a joke. But if it was Prime Minister 'Bob' Hawke, who am I to complain? It is a pity, though, that the habit has caught on in Britain. I used to enjoy teasing 'Chris' Patten at his insistence on the chummy familiar, and I believe that it sounds even odder for a governor of Hong Kong. If Patten had stuck to his baptismal name of Christopher, he could have enjoyed wearing a plumed hat at his inauguration. But as 'Chris' he had no choice but to break with tradition, and take the oath bare-headed. The last time I raised this matter with Patten, he pointed out that at least he, on attaining high office as a Cabinet minister, had not suddenly and mysteriously transformed himself back into a Christopher. I believe he was referring to Ken Baker, who reinstalled his 'neth' on becoming a member of one of Thatcher's cabinets. I have a sneaking feeling that Clarke has also encouraged more of the Kenneth and less of the 'Ken' since he became chancellor of the exchequer. I would have said that this was an essential political act, that a chancellor called Ken was no sort of guarantee of the value of the pound. But look, we now have a Governor of the Bank of England called 'Eddie'. At first I thought this a national disgrace, but recently I have come round to seeing the virtue in it. Just as a Labour government needs to be far more financially prudent than a Conservative one to keep the markets happy, so I believe that a Bank of England Governor called 'Eddie' needs to behave with a wholly admirable caution in order to be taken seriously by teenage currency traders who might very well also be called 'Eddie'. A grandee called Sir Edward George might think he could get away with any sort of nonsense. However, what is good enough for the Bank of England and the future of the currency is clearly not good enough for the residents of a private housing estate in the town of Midsomer Norton. Those people are very unhappy that the local council had determined to call the new estate 'Reg Jones Close', after a miner who died two years ago. The residents, apparently, had assumed that their estate was going to be called Wellow Brook Meadow, and were convinced that the name Reg Jones Close would cause the value of their property to suffer. It was not the fact that Jones was a miner which was the problem, nor even his given name. It was that damned abbreviation. One of the residents, complained: 'I wouldn't mind Reginald at all. But 'Reg' sounds so ridiculous.' Will the prospect of posthumous ridicule from irate property owners cause Blair to reassume the dignity of 'Anthony'? No. I believe we will have a Labour prime minister named 'Tony'. But at least he won't be called Benn. That really would have been flower-pot time. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

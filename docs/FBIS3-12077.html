			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Costa Rican economic developments monitored through  29 March.    Central Bank President Jorge Corrales has reported that  Costa  Rica's net international reserves totalled $964 million in  January 1994, while in December 1993 these reserves reached $945  million. Corrales added that in January the Central Bank  obtained important amounts of foreign currency through the sale  of $50 million in bonds issued by the Costa Rican Electricity  Institute. (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 12 March 94 p 11A)    Deputy Finance Minister Jose Rafael Brenes has reported that  Costa Rica's internal public debt increased from 182 billion  colones in 1992 to 242.7 billion colones in 1993. Brenes  explained that the debt rose because the government had to make  heavy payments to clear up its debts with state banks and with  the Social Security Fund, as well as heavy payments on its  foreign debt. (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 13 March 94 p  12A)    Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas has reported that the  Mexican companies resident in Costa Rica generate 8 percent of  the gross domestic product of this Central American country,  equivalent to approximately $523 million per year. This figure  will probably grow to nearly 10 percent, some $50 million, once  the bilateral free trade enters into effect in January 1995.  (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0905 GMT 16 March 94)    The Exports and Investments Promotion Center (Cenpro) has  reported that Costa Rican exports of edible roots have increased  at an annual rate of 26 percent from 1990 to 1993. Cenpro  reported these exports amounted to $30 million in 1993. (San  Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 18 Mar 94 p 13A)</p>

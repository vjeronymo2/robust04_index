			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Legal action threatened against Utd Newspapers NORTHERN &amp; Shell, publisher of Penthouse and Forum magazines, is threatening legal action against United Newspapers, publisher of the Express and Star national titles. The disagreement follows a highly unusual court case last week when United sued one of its own subsidiaries in order to break off a distribution contract with Northern. Northern yesterday decribed United's actions as 'a device and a sham' and said it would issue proceedings against United later this week. Northern and three other smaller magazine publishers signed a distribution agreement with United Magazine Distribution, a subsidiary of United, last summer. But relations soon turned sour and United claimed the contract was 'inoperable'. The two sides discussed changing the contract for a couple of months. However, United Newspapers Publications last week won a court judgment demanding repayment of a Pounds 256,902 inter-company loan extended from UNP to United Magazine Distributors. Under the terms of the distribution agreement with Northern, any judgment against UMD could lead to termination of the contract. UMD claimed the contract was terminated on the same day the repayment judgment was made. 'We were advised by our legal side that this was the best way of ending the contract,' United said. Northern further alleged that UMD immediately withheld repayment of advances previously made from Northern to UMD.</p>

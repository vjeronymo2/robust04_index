			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The final episode of NBC's "Family Ties" May 14 will be an unusual length: 70  minutes. The series was set to go out with a special hourlong finale, but when  the taping came up long, NBC told the producers they could include an  additional seven minutes of dialogue and three minutes of spontaneous farewells  and emotional curtain calls by cast and crew members. The show will air from  8-9:10 p.m., delaying the rest of the NBC lineup that night by 10 minutes. In  the last episode, Alex Keaton (Michael J. Fox) leaves his parents, sisters and  brother for a job on Wall Street. The series has been on the air since 1982.  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Leasing practices examined UK COMMERCIAL property leasing practices are significantly different from those of the US or continental Europe, says a report published yesterday by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The survey may give added impetus to the debate about the structure of UK commercial property leases, which has been the subject of increas-ing criticism from tenants. The study, which was carried out by the University of Reading, showed that England and Wales had longer leases than other countries. They were unusual as well in imposing full repair obligations on tenants. The convention of privity of contract, by which an original tenant is liable to pay the rent if a subsequent tenant defaults, is peculiar to England and Wales. In addition, England and Wales are unusual in lacking any form of condominium or joint ownership, which allows occupiers to participate in the growth of a building's capital values. Some of the practices highlighted in the report are being reviewed by the government. International Leasing Structures. RICS Bookshop, 12 Great George Street, Parliament Square, London SW1P 3AD.

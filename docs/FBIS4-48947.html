			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Murray] </F>   [Text] Chongqing, China, May 2 KYODO -- In the late 1970s,  the Jianshe manufacturing plant, one of the country's leading  gun makers, faced financial collapse due to a sudden drop in  military orders.    Driven largely by an instinct for survival, Chen Zisheng,  now  the factory director, recalls that he and his colleagues decided  to gamble on making trucks and sewing machines for the civilian  market.    "It was a last-ditch struggle," he explains.    What Chen had no way of knowing then was that he was paving  the way for most of the nation's war industry to make the switch  from armaments to consumer goods in the changed environment of  global detente and the Chinese adoption of a market economy.    Jianshe, eventually, was lucky to establish a link with the  Japanese motorcycle manufacturer Yamaha, which has been a  lucrative partnership for both sides.    Yamaha continues to pour big investment into the venture to  build new assembly lines turning Jianshe into the country's  second biggest motorcycle producer, lagging only behind another  Chongqing-based company, Jialing, which was hived off from the  Norinco (China North Industries) arms manufacturing group and  was able to form a technical cooperation agreement with Honda.  Together they produce 1.3 million machines a year, more than a  third of China's current output.    Jialing alone will be producing one million machines a year  by 1997.    It is an amazing turnaround for China, given its long  obsession with national security and perceived threats from all  directions.    In order to prepare for national defense in the 1960s, when  China seemed to face a threat from the Soviet Union and the  United States (plus the U.S.-backed nationalist forces on  Taiwan), the best talent, the most advanced technology and  equipment, with unlimited funds was concentrating on  establishing a complete defense industry in the remote  mountainous areas of inland provinces, notably Sichuan, Hunan,  Yunnan and Guizhou.    Meticulous government planning used to guard military  manufacturers from worries such as supply of materials, funds  and market conditions. But as the threat of war eased, the  central government decided to put an end to the wartime footing  of the military in the 1970s, and in the early 1980s to trim one  million soldiers from the bloated People's Liberation Army (PLA).    Orders for weapons and ammunition fell sharply, and, to  survive, much of the defense industry was told to forget the  guns and start thinking about producing something more mundane  -- like refrigerators and color television sets.    The government strategy for the conversion was to set up so-  called "window enterprises" in the special economic zones and  other experimental coastal economic development zones during the  1980s to introduce foreign technology and capital for the  development of a limited range of 100 products. These window  enterprises then became information centers and bridgeheads for  the inland ordnance enterprises to develop an export-oriented  economy.    The changeover seems to have worked. Over the past decade,  the defense industry in southwest China has manufactured four  million motorcycles, nearly 500,000 refrigerators, about 700,000  cameras, over 100,000 minibuses and 1,000 heavy trucks.    It is reported that 70 percent of China's defense plants are  now turning out products for civilian use. The industry as a  whole has a target of manufacturing civilian goods valued at 10  billion yuan in 1995.    Honda's partner, Norinco, one of the country's biggest  military suppliers, has diversified so much that 70 percent of  the output of its 300 units and subsidiaries is civilian goods.  It has even brought the amusement arcade concept to war through  the operation of a unique weapons range north of Beijing where  paying customers can shoot everything from hand guns to antitank  rockets.    Now it is looking for foreign joint venture parts for at  least 200 projects in advanced machinery, motor vehicle  assembly, optical, electrical and chemical products. An  official of its development planning department acknowledged  that Norinco was hindered by having many of its manufacturing  plants located in remote interior regions, but this could be  overcome by moving them to central or coastal areas.    The former mayor of Chongqing -- wartime capital of  nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek -- used to refer to defense  industry as "a tiger sleeping in the remote mountains." City  officials have now turned that round to describe the current  transformation as involving a "tiger leaping down the mountains."    There have been no shortage of foreign takers given the  loving care lavished in the past on companies in the military  sector. At least 20 joint ventures have been created, primarily  in vehicle manufacturing. And the Japanese connection in this  military-to- civilian transformation is extremely strong.    Apart from those already mentioned, another success has been  the Jiangling machinery plant, which switched from military  hardware to the production of car engines with technological  help from Suzuki Motors. It is now the city's number two engine  maker, its main customer being the Changan machinery factory,  which produces minicars with Honda.    The transition from swords to plowshares, however, has not  always been smooth. Ni Runfeng, director of the Changhong  machinery plant, a military radar producer, in Mianyang, a  remote city in eastern Sichuan, recalled how he was caught in a  vice between higher-ups demanding he convert to civilian  production and military workers who refused assignments to new  workshops set up to produce television sets.    But that is now a distant memory. After more than a decade  of technical cooperation with Japan's National Panasonic Corp.  (Matsushita) has laid a solid foundation for Changhong's  upgrading.    Their self-designed color television production line  introduced in 1989 as the first of its kind in the country is  regarded as up to the quality of imported lines and now poses a  serious challenge to Matsushita's own factories.    Having won a firm footing in Southeast Asia and Eastern  Europe, Changhong set up a joint venture in Indonesia to produce  300,000 television sets annually. It has been turned into a  stock company -- Changhong Electric Appliances Co. -- and with  two new color television assembly lines added to the existing  six, the company ranked first in production and profits in the  nation's electronics industry for four successive years  (1989-92).</p>

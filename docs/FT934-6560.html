			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: NSM Pounds 699,000 in the black NSM, the heavily-indebted international coal company, showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 699,000 for the six months to September 30, compared with losses of Pounds 1.98m last time. The results are the first since the completion of a series of disposals designed to reduce borrowings which began in March 1991. Borrowings had fallen to Pounds 88.6m (Pounds 94.6m) at the half-way stage, amounting to some 158 per cent (200 per cent) of shareholders' funds of Pounds 56m (Pounds 47.2m). Interest payments of Pounds 3.94m (Pounds 4.96m) eroded profits, mainly struck on coal businesses in the UK and the US, of Pounds 4.64m (Pounds 2.98m), including a Pounds 576,000 contribution (Pounds 621,000 loss) from discontinued operations. Turnover fell to Pounds 56.9m (Pounds 62.3m) without the benefit of last time's Pounds 5.44m contribution from discontinued operations. Future growth in the UK would come from cutting costs and selling additional tonnage to the electricity generators 'in due course', said Mr John Jermine, chief executive. In the US, the company's operations were well placed to benefit from clean air legislation planned to be in force by 1995. NSM was also due to see income from renting out landfill sites likely to start in the early part of 1994: 'Ex-coal sites are ideally engineered to operate as landfill sites,' said Mr Jermine. He had joined the company in 1991 and admitted NSM had a history of ill-starred diversifications: 'I have no plans to diversify. The key objective remains to build on the US operations and reduce debt.' He said there were 'no obvious ways for reducing the debt' further, barring small rump disposals. The company was only likely to consider a rights issue to cover the cost of any future acquisition which is not currently foreseen. NSM's shares are roughly 90 per cent held by institutions, including the Kuwait Investment Office, whose resources have been depleted by the costs of the Gulf war and losses on Spanish investments. NSM said the KIO had a 9 per cent stake which it had so far said it had no plans to sell. Earnings per share were 4.3p (10.5p losses) but the company has no plans to return to the dividend list in the near future.</p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CAN CALL REAGAN TO TESTIFY: JUDGE  </P> <P> The judge in the Iran-Contra criminal case said today he has the legal power to  force former President Reagan and President Bush to testify at the trial of  ex-White House aide Oliver L. North.  </P> <P> But U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell put off any decision on whether to  throw out the defense subpoenas, which have been challenged by government  lawyers as unprecedented. They argued that Reagan and Bush enjoy executive  privilege and cannot be forced to testify.  </P> <P> "As far as the power of the court to require testimony of Reagan or Bush, I do  not think there is any question," Gesell ruled from the bench. "I have no doubt  of the naked power if I have to use it."  </P></p>

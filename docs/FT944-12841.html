			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Major set for sleaze fightback Mr John Major yesterday offered strong backing for Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary, as the government prepared for a Commons confrontation over allegations of ministerial sleaze. The prime minister's stance came amid strong attacks by Conservative MPs on Mr Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian, following the disclosure that his newspaper had used House of Commons notepaper to obtain a copy of Mr Aitken's Pounds 1,000 bill for a stay at the Ritz Hotel in Paris last year. Mr Preston said the note-paper, bearing Mr Aitken's name, had not been used to deceive or mislead, but to protect the newspaper's source - Mr Mohamed Fayed, the owner of Harrods and the Ritz. But Sir James Spicer, a member of the powerful privileges committee, was among a number of senior Conservative MPs condemning the action and demanding an investigation by the Commons into the news-paper's action. Mr Aitken - at the centre of a political row over the payment of his bill at the Ritz - meanwhile dismissed suggestions that he had broken parliamentary rules by not declaring a company directorship. Friends of the Treasury minister said the company involved - Fadace Ltd - was an inconsequential offshoot of another company, Al Bilah Co UK, which had been declared by the minister in the register of MPs' interests. Mr Aitken received no salary or fees from Fadace. Mr Major's backing for Mr Aitken followed renewed demands from Labour for the Commons to hold public rather than private hearings into allegations of financial impropriety. But Downing Street said Mr Major had not budged from his view that public hearings would prompt unfounded smears against innocent MPs. Senior Conservatives added that the government could not intervene in the work of the all-party privileges committee without challenging its long-standing tradition of independence. Labour, whose MPs are boycotting the present investigations, has tabled a motion for today's Commons debate demanding public hearings by the privileges committee of charges against individual MPs. But a government amendment says the committee itself must decide on its procedures. In spite of today's expected confrontation senior Conservatives stressed that there was still scope for a compromise between Labour and Tory MPs on the committee. One suggestion was that individuals' evidence could be heard in private while the committee held public sessions to debate wider points of principle.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Letter: Customer service the key factor Sir, British Rail's director of public affairs uses your columns to list the achievements of his organisation over recent years (Letters, February 13). There is a striking absence in this list of any mention of tangible achievement in the area of customer service. This is, of course, because, by any objective measure, service has fallen substantially. Until BR understands that success in this area is the most important measure, it should desist from blowing its own trumpet. All the customer seeks is satisfaction in the three basic areas of cleanliness, comfort and - most important - reliability. Alan Burton, 1 Wealden View, Burwash, Sussex TN19 7BW</p>

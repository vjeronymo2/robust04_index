			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Musical farce may sharpen the batons - Music Any bets on the fate of the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1994? The Great London Orchestra Farce came to an end in the middle of last month, and mockery and abuse then rained down on the whole organisation  - accompanied by more than one public call for it to be wound up altogether, and replaced by a line of direct government funding of the arts. The hilarious yet heartbreaking saga of administrative tomfoolery that led to the outcry may be briefly summarised as follows: an independent team set up by the musical panel of the Arts Council to decide, by means of a 'beauty contest' which one of three London orchestras would become a super-orchestra and, in counterbalance, which other two would lose their grant; a huge outcry by supporters of all three orchestras elicited by the beauty contest; a concluding judgment by the independent team then completely ignored by the Council; a final decision on orchestral funding for 1994-95 amounting to a comprehensive fudge of the whole issue. The questions which arise out of the settling dust and all the merriment at the Council's expense are the following: does a body that in the last few years has shown both an inability to support all its clients effectively, and a propensity to turn against some of those clients on what has often looked like the merest whim - does such a body deserve to exist any longer? There is no predicting with confidence either its survival or disintegration. But, in curious and rather satisfyingly unexpected fashion, one side-effect of the 'beauty contest' seems to have been a greatly increased sense of artistic urgency among the London orchestras recently under scrutiny - a sense of sharpened concern to raise the standard and 'interest-quotient' of both programmes and roster of conductors and soloists. The Philharmonia, with an exceptionally interesting programme of early-evening contemporary-music concerts already in its second year of existence, seems to have woken up the most. The London Philharmonic, though its recent welcoming-on-board of Harrison Birtwistle and Roger Norrington had the look of a desperate face-saving exercise, now looks set to follow suit. (Neither of those orchestras will really gain full credibility, however, until the question-marks hanging over their far-from-infallible Chief Conductors are resolved - in the case of the Philharmonia's Giuseppe Sinopoli, the naming of a successor, and in that of the LPO's Franz Welser-Most, greater evidence of artistic maturity than he has so far shown.) The Royal Philharmonic, least-encouraged of the trio, has come out of the experience with dignity and new sponsorship from Classic FM; its seeking-out of a 'National Orchestra' identity, and its exciting new links forged with the Kirov Opera (as witnessed in the splendid concert performance of Tchaikovksy's opera Iolanta early last month), are two clear tokens of new vigour there too. And, as everyone has commented, the London Symphony, safe in its Barbican Hall home, goes from strength to strength: the appointment of Colin Davis as Chief Conductor (from 1995) has already cast a glow over all its activities. So could 1994 be a boom period for London orchestral concerts? Here again, easy, surefire predictions are not on offer. As my colleague Antony Thorncroft suggested a few Saturdays ago, the idea of the London super-orchestra may well come back from the dead in a few years time. And the basically shaky financial condition of the three beauty-contestant orchestras should not be forgotten. But I shall not be at all surprised if, for some while at least through 1994, one result of the London orchestral brouhaha is a pleasingly ironic one: a newly vital, uncomplacent London orchestral scene.</p>

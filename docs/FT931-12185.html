			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): Nine shelters for the far-sighted - The Tax Deadline 3, Investments / Tessas, Peps and National Savings are ideal for the small saver. Higher-rate taxpayers may need to approach life policies with some caution, while the BES still has something to offer them ARE YOU paying more tax than you should? One way of reducing bills is to employ a clever accountant; another is to take advantage of any number of tax-efficient investments which have been designed to attract savers. . . Personal equity plans. You can hold Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 in a single-company Pep in any single tax year. A Pep is free of both income and capital gains tax, but charges can be high (see the survey starting on page 18 of this Review). Tax-exempt special savings accounts. These are aimed at the small saver, and the most you can shelter from tax is Pounds 9,000 staggered over five years. Tessas were introduced on January 1, 1991. The maximum investment allowed in the first year is Pounds 3,000, and the ceiling for deposits in subsequent years is Pounds 1,800 subject to the Pounds 9,000 maximum. Deposits are made on the anniversary of the account. Net interest can be withdrawn without penalty, but the capital must remain untouched over five years to get the tax break. National Savings. Index-linked and fixed-rate certificates are free of income and capital gains tax, and are particularly suitable for higher-rate taxpayers. The 40th issue savings certificates offer 5.75 per cent per annum compound if held for five years. The maximum investment is Pounds 5,000, although you can reinvest an additional Pounds 10,000 of matured certificates. The 6th index-linked certificates guarantee to pay 3.25 per cent per annum compound above the retail prices index, if held for five years. Once again the maximum investment is Pounds 5,000, and the same conditions on reinvested certificates apply. Investors can hold both index-linked and savings certificates. Basic-rate taxpayers fared well with the First Option Bond when it was launched last summer, but it has since been withdrawn. They can consider Capital Bonds as an alternative to certificates, although these are subject to tax, which is payable throughout the life of the bond. Series G offers a guaranteed 7.75 per cent gross per annum compound if held for five years. The maximum investment is Pounds 100,000. Pensions: Pension contributions, as discussed on the previous page, normally enjoy tax relief, as do additional voluntary contributions. The fund into which they are paid is exempt from income or capital gains tax, so the return on investments should be higher than on other savings schemes. There are limits on the amounts of contributions qualifying for relief in any one year. If your employer's scheme is contributory, you get tax relief at your highest rate on your contributions. The tax limit on contributions into a personal pension plan depends on the time you took out the plan. If it was before July 1, 1988, you make gross payments and get basic-rate and higher-rate tax relief through the PAYE system, a rebate or a lower tax bill. If you decide to receive some of your pension as a lump sum on retirement, this will be paid to you tax-free; and the pension itself is taxed as earned income, not investment income. Friendly Societies. A 10-year regular savings plan pays out a lump sum at a fixed date or on death. The fund in which the money is invested is tax-free, and the pay-out is also free of income and capital gains tax. However, the maximum annual contributions are limited to Pounds 200. Friendly societies also offer baby bonds, which are a way to shelter gifts from parents to children. However, the societies have recently been criticised for inefficiency and high administrative charges which tend to reduce the tax-free advantage given to their funds. Life policies. Originally designed to pay out to dependants on death, many - such as 10-year endowments - have become savings plans in their own right. Basic-rate taxpayers do not have to pay tax on the proceeds of a life insurance policy, but the rules are different for higher-rate taxpayers. The amount they have to pay is dependent on the length of time they have held a policy, and whether it is a 'qualifying' policy or not. A 'qualifying' policy is one into which regular annual premiums are paid, usually for at least 10 years. Higher-rate taxpayers will not have to pay tax on the proceeds of a qualifying policy as long as they have held it for at least three-quarters of the term of the policy, or for 10 years, whichever is shorter. The amount of tax that a higher-rate taxpayer may have to pay on a non-qualifying policy depends on the gain. This is calculated as the amount received when the policy comes to an end, less the total premiums paid - unless the policy is cashed early. Business Expansion Scheme: 'Buy now while stocks last' will be the marketing motto of the BES this year, because it is to be abolished in December (see also, next page). The maximum that can be invested is Pounds 40,000 and the total value of the investment is deducted from the investor's total taxable income. A 40 per cent taxpayer will therefore receive a rebate of 40 per cent of the amount invested. The least risky form of BES is the 'buy back' scheme, where a BES company buys accommodation on behalf of a third party - usually a college or a housing association - and receives a covenant to buy back the property at a fixed price after five years. Provided the third party does not go bankrupt in the meantime, and can raise the money, the risk is minimised. Enterprise Zones: EZs are government-selected run-down regions which need investment; they are only allowed for non-residential property. Top-rate taxpayers get a rebate of 40 per cent on the value of their investment. There is no maximum limit on investment, but investors must usually commit themselves to a 25-year term. Enterprise Zone Trusts buy properties and split them into units, allowing investors to buy a share of a building which might otherwise be too expensive. The minimum for most schemes is Pounds 5,000. Because of the property slump, there are now few EZs on the market. Trusts: An accumulation and maintenance trust is one way of reducing the inheritance tax burden. Income made by the trust is kept in it (accumulated), although some income can be drawn if it is for the 'maintenance, education or benefit' of the children. The trust comes to an end, once the child is between 18 and 25 years old, when the estate is passed over to them.</p>

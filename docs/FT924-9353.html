			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: UK government auctions privatised companies' debt THE auction of debt owed by companies privatised by the British government is set for November 19, with the results due to be announced on November 20. The total amount of debt available at the auction totals Pounds 3.7bn (Dollars 5.73bn), consisting of Pounds 1.69bn of BT debt and Pounds 2.05bn of electricity companies' debt. The Treasury has increased the cash value of bids it plans to accept from Pounds 1bn to Pounds 1.25bn, as a result of strong interest from both the privatised companies and third parties. Proceeds will be received by the Treasury on December 15. Bids will be made on a yield basis, expressed as margins over specified gilt issues. The disposal, which is part of the Treasury's plans to raise Pounds 8bn from privatisations this year, had been scheduled to proceed at the beginning of October, when potential buyers were to register their interest. BT has undertaken that it will bid for a minimum of Pounds 750m of its debt. A BT Treasury official said that the company would be able to repay that amount of debt out of its cash holdings without needing to seek fresh financing. However, a total of Pounds 700m of debt falls due in the first quarter of next year, ahead of BT's financial year-end in March. If BT bids successfully for Pounds 750m, then it is likely that the company will need to seek refinancing for some of that debt, the official said. In that case, the company would seek to secure long-term funding, in order to prevent any potential bunching of debt. However, the official added that plans to sell the company's 22 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular Communications to American Telegraph &amp; Telephone might provide BT with further cash, thus reducing financing needs.</p>

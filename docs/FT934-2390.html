			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BTG asks SE to investigate shares rise Business Technology Group has asked the Stock Exchange to investigate the 'substantial' increase in its share price following the completion of the pre-marketing of a placing and open offer last week. The office equipment supplier is raising an unspecified amount at 12 3/4 p a share for working capital and to help pay for an acquisition. BTG said that adverse trading in the third quarter of 1993 had resulted in significant losses, increasing pressure on finances and requiring an immediate injection of equity. It added that it was in discussions which might lead to a significant acquisition. Yesterday the shares slipped 1 1/2 p to 13p.</p>

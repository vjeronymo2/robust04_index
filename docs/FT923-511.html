			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Letter: Why not told? Sir, Samuel Brittan, in his Economic Viewpoint (September 24), tells us that he has known since December last year that 'something would have to give', but in the interests of the stability of the realm he decided to keep his counsel and not to share his prescience with me and your other readers. For whose benefit is your Mr Brittan writing: your readers or the realm? Who does he think he is? Who do you think you are: the Thunderer?

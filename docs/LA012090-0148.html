			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PIECE WORK;  </P> <P> BROKEN TILES BECOME FUNCTIONAL ART IN HANDS OF LAGUNA BEACH CERAMIST  </P> <P> You may not know Marlo Bartels by name, but chances are you sat on his art.  </P> <P> At the Laguna Art Museum, you may have rested on "Elements," a bench aptly  titled for the sphere, cube, cone and cylindrical shapes that adorn it. You may  have quenched your thirst at his drinking fountain wall. Or watched the sun set  while relaxing at his "Canyon Chess Table and Chairs," a permanent exhibit at  Laguna's Main Beach.  </P> <P> Bartels transforms mundane subjects -- furniture, bathrooms, Jacuzzis -- into  functional art from broken tiles that he buys secondhand or finds while rooting  through dumpsters behind commercial tile companies. He crowns each piece with  handmade tiles of swirls and flame shapes he designs in his Laguna Canyon  studio.  </P> <P> His work can be found in homes throughout Orange County and the nation.  </P> <P> The 41-year-old former art teacher claims inspiration from Antonio Gaudi, an  internationally acclaimed Barcelona architect and pioneer in organic  architecture.  </P> <P> In 1973, Bartels and his wife Cathy -- also an artist -- visited Spain and were  excited by Gaudi's work. "Organic architecture follows the laws of nature. The  Parque Guell is a huge park that Gaudi designed. He added benches that he had  his assistant, Jujol, create out of broken, colored tiles," he said.  </P> <P> This came about, he explains, when one of Gaudi's patrons who owned a tile  plant gave the assistant access to castoffs that later became an integral part  of Gaudi's creation.  </P> <P> Taking the idea a step further seemed natural to the ceramist, who sought to  express his feelings about Southern California life style through his art.  </P> <P> Enamored of the American Arts and Crafts Movement of 1880-1930 and the vivid  bursts of color found in tableware and pottery during the period, Bartels began  incorporating bold colors into his tile work.  </P> <P> "During the early 1970s, artists were producing art that related to them and  their environment. My experience wasn't 'gritty New York'; it was California  landscapes, the beach, the bold sunsets in reds and blues and purples."  </P> <P> As a child growing up in Los Angeles, the native says he knew early on that he  "wanted to leave a lasting impression on the world." At 20, he took a first  step on the road he was to travel: "I happened upon a ceramics class in junior  college and it just felt right; I found that I liked working with my hands."  </P> <P> He went on to earn a master's degree in art at Cal State Fullerton. His  one-of-a-kind pottery caught the attention of a tableware design broker who  hired him to create dinnerware patterns for a Japan-based manufacturer.  </P> <P> From 1974 until 1977, Bartels taught art classes at the Art Institute of  Southern California (formerly the Laguna Beach School of Art) and continues to  serve on the Artists' Advisory Board.  </P> <P> "I am very much into recycling. I prefer using castoffs. I hate to throw  anything away. I save bits and scraps until I have a use for them." His first  creation -- a chair -- evolved from a base of polystyrene remnants that he  pieced together and used as a form.  </P> <P> The best results have often come by accident, Bartels said.  </P> <P> "One of the side effects of working in clay is breakage. Tiles crack, they  warp, they shatter. I go with the flow." According to Bartels, when he started  making murals, tile borders would invariably warp during the drying phase: "I  thought this shape would make an interesting chair back."  </P> <P> Starting with a form made from wood and polystyrene or steel covered with metal  mesh, Bartels then coats the foundation with mortar.  </P> <P> Next, he applies the broken tile pieces. Handmade tile shapes are added to fit  the form; swirled tiles for armrests, curved tiles for backs and around  corners. Several painstaking steps follow -- drying, bisque firing, glaze  applications and glaze firing.  </P> <P> Finally, the handmade tiles can be applied to the surface with a thin-set  mortar. The last step is grouting to fill spaces between tile. He delivers  finished pieces within a few days of completion, but it may take up to a month  for grout work to "cure."  </P> <P> Home Savings -- famous for exterior murals -- has commissioned his design work  at branches in California, Florida and Ohio.  </P> <P> But Bartels' favorite clients are ones who give him carte blanche; clients  including CBS Morning News' Kathleen Sullivan, whose New York penthouse kitchen  features his work. Or Steven Gumpert, a Newport Beach commercial real estate  developer and his wife, Cassandra. They gave him artistic license to design a  wall headboard and bedside tables, hat rack and umbrella stand to complement  their Belcourt home.  </P> <P> "The Gumperts had seen photographs of the Sullivan kitchen during a visit to  New York. They had an idea of what they wanted, then let me take over," Bartels  said.  </P> <P> Steven Gumpert said he likes black as a color. "Marlo uses a lot of black with  bright color; his work is very exciting to me," Gumpert said.  </P> <P> For Cassandra Gumpert, it was a combination of drama and fun that struck her  fancy. "When we were at his studio looking at his pieces it was so tempting to  say 'Let's do the whole house in Marlo's work,' " she said.  </P> <P> Ted Paulson, a Newport Beach stockbroker, and his wife, Suzanne, imposed no  restrictions when Bartels designed the electric blue Jacuzzi and oversized  shower stall for their newly remodeled Emerald Bay master bedroom. "Suzanne and  I were leaving for India (and) Nepal; we said, 'Surprise us.' We were very  pleased with the results," he said.  </P> <P> Future plans include grand corporate projects for clients in Japan, Italy and  Spain. "I find Spain a most inspiring country because of the Moorish tile  influence."  </P> <P> Other plans include the completion of the family "dream home" in Bluebird  Canyon.  </P> <P> "We're very excited because our neighbor and architect, Dann McMann,  specializes in hillside homes. This living space will be a laboratory; a  testing ground for tile ideas I am experimenting with," he said. The entire  home will be "festooned with tile."  </P> <P> From the time a custom order is confirmed -- his trademark multicolor bordered  bench is $2,000 -- it takes Bartels about six weeks to deliver. A recently  completed 9-by-5-foot fountain with five-foot long ceramic, mythical,  dragonlike fish sold for $10,000. Large commercial murals range from $30,000 to  $50,000.  </P> <P> Bartels' passion extends beyond working in tile; he lends his staunch support  to Tile Heritage, based in Northern California, and Friends of Terra Cotta,  based in New York.  </P> <P> Both groups are made up of artists and tile historians devoted to preserving  the history of American tile and architectural ceramics.  </P> <P> "Architectural terra cotta became an art form unto itself; it was an  inexpensive way of reproducing neoclassic carved stone on building facades," he  said. "It is imperative that building owners be aware of the care needed to  preserve the lasting beauty of this incredible material."  </P></p>

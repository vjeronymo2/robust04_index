			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Taking a position in the market - Unshackled from B&amp;C, Exco is set to regain its listing Moneybroking is an industry the profitability of which seems to run in inverse proportion to its respectability. It is the business which bankrolled British &amp; Commonwealth, the financial conglomerate, on the ambitious path that ended in receivership, and which has underwritten Lord Hollick's high profile push into television, through MAI. Yet, moneybrokers have tended to be the hidden source of vast cash flows, rather than the public focus of the holding companies which own them. Moneybrokers act as intermediaries - primarily between the banks - in the trading of international and domestic deposits, derivative products, and foreign exchange, the world's largest traded market. The operators have also tended to build up fixed interest securities businesses. The brokers write billions of dollars of transactions daily, in frantic trading rooms banked with screens and microphones, yet business risk is limited to client default, or mismatches. The companies do not take house positions in the markets. The industry's reputation can be explained in part by the image of excess held by the foreign exchange trader, and staff costs are certainly high. Exco, which is being floated this week by the administrators of British &amp; Commonwealth, paid Pounds 109m in staff costs last year, or an average of Pounds 55,000 per head. In addition, listed moneybroking businesses have had a somewhat chequered history. However, the impending flotation of Exco is underlining the fact that the big players within the industry have not only survived the recession unscarred, but are seeing an explosion of profits. There are four large broadly-based global players in moneybroking, MAI, Exco, Marshalls and Tullett &amp; Tokyo, and then an enormous number of company's focusing on niche markets. According to Mr Ron Sandler, chief executive of Exco: 'The big are getting bigger, and the small are either getting increasingly specialised, or just smaller.' The victims within the industry have generally involved lack of breadth, disastrous diversification, or parentage problems. Prebon Yamane was a core part of York Trust (renamed Babcock Prebon), which went into receivership in 1991, although moneybroking was not the focus of its problems. Exco and Marshalls had turbulent ownership histories, but they both remained profitable. The most recent addition to the listed sector, Trio, has not rewarded subscribers to its flotation, but it is a smaller business, with a heavy concentration on dollar/D-Mark foreign exchange trading. Mr Charles Gregson, MAI's deputy group managing director, said: 'In a niche business, it is possible to set up in a garret with a few telephones and deal successfully, but to broaden the business requires a substantial investment in information technology and people.' Both MAI and Exco spend some Pounds 8m a year on IT, which creates a considerable barrier to competition. For the global players, the market has been far steadier. 'The historic record speaks for itself. With the exception of a crash year in 1987, profits have grown every year in the last 20,' said Mr Gregson, of MAI's moneybroking business. The broader range of activities ensures a larger customer base for the global businesses, given the growing inter-dependence of money market products. But ironing out the cycles is a important inducement to going global. For example, Exco's strong position in the Asian markets was affected by a slump in the Japanese banking sector, but this has been more than replaced by surging securities trading in the US. Japan is now recovering, while the securities markets may suffer a downturn. The build up of capital adequacy regulations weakened the market for cash deposits, but this has been counterbalanced by activity in off-balance sheet products, such as forward rate agreements. On the foreign exchange side, competition remains tight, and brokers have been losing market share to direct trading between the banks, and also, to a lesser extent, to the three automated trading systems. The last detailed survey by the Bank for International Settlements, published in March 1993, showed that foreign exchange brokers' market share in the UK had fallen from 43 per cent in 1986 to 34 per cent in 1992. However, increased volumes - more than Dollars 100bn per day in London by 1992 - have more than made up for the loss of market share. In addition, derivatives, the third leg of the moneybroking business, has shown enormous growth. There is less competition for broking new products, and fatter profit margins can be achieved. The fixed interest securities arms have had a fantastic 18 months, but with the turning of the interest rate cycle, 'some of the steam may have been taken out of the securities market for the time being', according to Mr Sandler. Further competition could also come from the threatened entry of Liberty into the UK gilts market. However, governments have had limited success in reducing their deficits, which should ensure that while volumes may fall to more sustainable levels, it will not be a dramatic decline. Longer term growth for the moneybrokers should come from the development of new products, such as FRA options and swap options, and the brokers are also beginning to focus on emerging markets, such as China and India. The moneybroking businesses of both MAI and Exco are expected to achieve double digit profits growth in the current financial year. Exco should further benefit from its release from the spectre of B&amp;C, which is selling its 40 per cent stake in the flotation. Caledonia Investments, a highly respected investment company, has demonstrated commitment to the industry by agreeing not only to retain its 27 per cent stake in Exco, but taking pre-flotation dividends in scrip form. Exco exceeded investors' highest hopes during its six years as a listed company in the early 1980s, and it will struggle to match that performance second time around. But Mr Gregson argues: 'All the evidence suggests that there is still growth in these markets as the product range and the customer base increases, and new financial centres are established in developing countries.'</p>

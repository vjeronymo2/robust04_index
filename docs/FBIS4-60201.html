			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A responsible military source at the armed forces  command in the Democratic Republic of Yemen has denied what has  been reported by the French news agency. The agency, quoting a  military spokesman in Sanaa, said that the forces of the  al-Ahmar gang shot down a southern aircraft over the Abyan area.  The source also denied that the northern forces had seized any  equipment or war materiel in this governorate. The source said  that the forces of the adventurous al-Ahmar gang in the  Governorate of Abyan were not in a position to shoot down  aircraft or seize any other military equipment. What was  reported was no more than cheap media reporting and feverish  psychological warfare. [passage omitted]</p>

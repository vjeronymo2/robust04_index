			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: CHICKEN SAYS HE'S RUFFLING NO ONE'S FEATHERS NOW  </P> <P> So what ever happened to Orned (Chicken) Gabriel?  </P> <P> In April, 1988, Gabriel told The Times that he had been beaten by a "Rambo  squad" of sheriff's deputies at the El Cajon jail.  </P> <P> The fast-talking martial-arts expert had been jailed for non-payment of child  support. His allegations of abuse emboldened other inmates to speak out.  </P> <P> The grand jury investigated. Sheriff John Duffy, after initially branding  Gabriel and others as liars, punished several deputies and vowed that brutality  would never again occur.  </P> <P> Duffy's once rock-solid popularity was hurt by his blustery behavior and  out-of-touch management style. Later, he decided to take his 100% pension and  not seek a sixth term.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Gabriel has started to reshape his life.  </P> <P> He just opened a martial arts studio, the United Karate Federation, in National  City. He's born-again. Also married-again.  </P> <P> He has reconciled with his teen-age son. He's teaching Bible classes at Bethel  Baptist Church. And preaching a new, upbeat attitude.  </P> <P> "I've never felt better in my life: mentally, physically and spiritually," said  Gabriel, 39. "My only battle is with Satan. I pray for those deputies and I  forgive them completely."  </P> <P> Well, not completely completely. His $2-million legal claim against the county  is pending, with a court date set for May 30.  </P> <P> He vows to stay out of trouble. In the past he's done jail stretches for  forgery, assault and vandalism.  </P> <P> Among those patronizing his studio are longtime friend Sagon Penn and at least  two law enforcement officers. One, a sheriff's deputy, asks that his name not  be used.  </P> <P> The other, San Diego police detective Tyrone Crosby, says he's known Chicken --  so named because of his head movements during karate bouts -- since they were  kids.  </P> <P> "I think Chicken has turned his life around," Crosby said. "He's taken a lot in  his life, but he's got a lot to offer to the community.  </P> <P> "I think he's going to make it this time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Homes on the Range?  </P> <P> Try one of these.  </P> <P> * Look for a head-on collision today when the Board of Supervisors discusses  requiring property owners to grant easements for horse trails in the  backcountry.  </P> <P> Horse lovers will be there.  </P> <P> So will the opponents: the Farm Bureau, Cattlemen's Assn., STOPP (Stop Taking  Our Private Property), and WHOA (Worried Homeowners Organized &amp; Angry).  </P> <P> * North County bumper sticker: God Is Awesome.  </P> <P> Yes, it was on a mini-truck, and yes, the mini-truck was carrying a surfboard.  </P> <P> * Fully-loaded Flipper?  </P> <P> The Miami Herald reported Tuesday that the Navy is training killer dolphins in  San Diego, Florida and Hawaii.  </P> <P> A former civilian trainer says the dolphins are being taught to carry  .45-caliber guns on their snouts to kill enemy frogmen.  </P> <P> A Navy spokesman says the marine mammal program is top secret. But he adds that  the dolphins are not in any danger.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cruise Control  </P> <P> An early brochure for congressional candidate Randall (Duke) Cunningham showed  the retired Navy fighter pilot with actor Tom Cruise during the filming of "Top  Gun" at Miramar Naval Air Station.  </P> <P> Nothing dresses up campaign literature like a celebrity.  </P> <P> But in a recent reprinting, the buddy-buddy picture is gone, replaced by a shot  of Cunningham's family.  </P> <P> Explanation: Cruise's agent informed Cunningham that Cruise does not endorse  political candidates and does not want candidates using pictures that might  imply otherwise.  </P> <P> Cruise was sent the brochure by Jim Lantry, one of Cunningham's rivals for the  Republican nomination in the 44th District.  </P> <P> Among other things, Lantry informed Cruise that Cunningham is anti-abortion.  Cruise favors keeping abortion legal.  </P></p>

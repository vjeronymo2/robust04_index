			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen -- </F> recorded]    [Text] [Rosen] It may well be that the basic problem is  that al-Asad still believes he is being lied to. Several days  ago, so we have learned, al-Asad asked UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali whether he can believe the Israelis.  Butrus-Ghali told him that yes, he can -- at least according to  what he later told Israeli elements.    Warren Christopher arrived in Damascus yesterday after  making  an effort to lower everybody's expectations. Yet, anyone who  examines his reservation for King David Hotel rooms will find  signs of optimism. The rooms are booked until the morning of 19  May, which means that this time the secretary plans a double  Damascus-Jerusalem trip. This is Christopher's third shuttle  mission to the region. It took James Baker, his predecessor,  seven such tours to convene the Madrid conference. But,  Christopher is not given too much credit. They say that he is  not a middleman but a mailman. He lacks initiatives and ideas,  and often falls asleep during discussions.    [Eytan Bentzur, deputy Foreign Ministry director general] I  certainly do not share this criticism. I believe it is not  warranted. I believe that the secretary and the team that  accompanies him make a skilled and very experienced team which  makes a real contribution to the process.    [Rosen] Baker sewed the seeds; Christopher is yet to reap  the fruit, but his caution is a matter of policy, and does not  only correspond with his personal character. Eytan Bentzur says  that Madrid was an entirely different ball game, and that  Baker's disposition could have caused a crisis here at this time.    [Bentzur] He believes that the process of negotiations will  develop gradually; that his role is to bring the stands closer  together, make them clearer and, when the time comes, perhaps to  bridge the gaps between the stands.    [Rosen] Al-Asad is very disappointed and mad at the  Americans. They do not apply enough pressure on Israel. And,  what is worse, they do not make the bilateral moves toward Syria  and are not removing it from the list of countries which sponsor  terror and drug trade. This, perhaps, explains the unscheduled  meeting Christopher, who was on his way to the airport, held  this morning with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'.    Jerusalem does not yet know whether Washington will accept  the Israeli security demands, not to mention whether Washington  will skip summer vacation to conduct negotiations. The key,  however, is still in the hands of Hafiz al-Asad. His agreement  for the convention in Washington of teams of military experts to  discuss security arrangements will be considered a great  achievement. If al-Asad makes such a move, Rabin may follow it  with a very meaningful statement on, for example, eliminating  the Golan Law; recognizing Syria's demand for sovereignty over  the Golan Heights; or mentioning the government resolution from  June 1967 about a full withdrawal to the international borders,  with a deliberately vague definition of the term international  border. Rabin has recently rejected suggestions by senior  Foreign Ministry officials to make such a statement at this  time. If al-Asad moves forward, Rabin will be willing to  favorably reconsider the suggestion.</p>

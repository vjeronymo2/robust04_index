			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TRACY;  </P> <P> YOUTH IN DELINQUENT PROGRAM DROWNS  </P> <P> A youth enrolled in a VisionQuest program featuring a wagon train that traveled  from Arizona to California has drowned while trying to escape, authorities  said.  </P> <P> John Vincent Garrison, 18, of Stockton, drowned in the Grant Line Canal north  of Tracy, a San Joaquin County sheriff's spokesman said. Garrison and two other  youths were attempting to swim the canal to escape authorities when he went  under. The spokesman said VisionQuest supervisors tracked the boys and when  they were confronted, the boys apparently decided to swim across the  75-yard-wide canal. The boys who survived, a 16-year-old from Imperial County,  and a 17-year-old from Stockton, were placed in Juvenile Hall.  </P></p>

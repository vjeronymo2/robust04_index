			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Fishing quota plea FISHERMEN in England and Wales yesterday proposed measures aimed at persuading the government to abandon its controversial limits on the number of days trawlers can spend at sea. The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which will seek judicial review of the limits on days at sea in the High Court on November 1, called for increases in minimum landing sizes for fish and no-fishing zones to protect young and breeding fish.</p>

The complaint alleges that an abandoned oil reprocessing facility near Glenrock, Wyoming, commonly known as Powder River Crude Processors or Big Muddy Oil Processors (the ``Site''), may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties for violations of administrative orders issued by EPA under Section 7003 of RCRA for a cleanup of the Site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the stipulation, one of the ten defendants named in the action, Richard Wallace, will pay a civil penalty of $30,000 to the United States for violations of the administrative order issued by EPA to him on October 3, 1991. The stipulation provides that the penalty claim alleged in the Complaint will be dismissed with prejudice, and all other claims alleged in the Complaint, which include the claims for injunctive relief, will be dismissed without prejudice. This settlement is based in part on information provided to the United States by Defendant Wallace indicating that his financial ability to pay a civil penalty is limited. Five other defendants in this action are performing work pursuant to a consent decree entered by the Court on June 21, 1994, designed to address conditions at the Site which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments relating to the proposed stipulation of settlement.

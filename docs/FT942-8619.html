			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sharp fall at Olympus Optical Olympus Optical, the Japanese camera and precision instrument maker, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Y6.32bn (Dollars 60.6m) for the year ended March, down 32.5 per cent from the Y9.3bn of the previous year. The company said it was suffering from the worldwide economic slump, weak domestic demand and the yen's appreciation. However, the board decided to maintain the dividend at Y13 per share. Olympus' turnover declined by 5.8 per cent from Y187bn to Y17bn. This was in spite of efforts to boost compact camera sales and to expand sales of endoscopes and microscopes. The scientific equipment business has been plagued by poor demand in the US and the strength of the yen, which has made Japanese machines expensive. For the current year Olympus predicts that pre-tax profits will rise to Y6.5bn, while post-tax profits are also expected to increase, reaching Y3.3bn. Turnover is forecast to reach Y180bn. In 1992, the group was forced to provide for a substantial extraordinary item, following a Dollars 34.7m out of court settlement to Honeywell, the US electronics group for infringing autofocus patents.</p>

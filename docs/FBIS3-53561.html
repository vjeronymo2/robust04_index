			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz with </F> unidentified correspondents' after his meeting with Prime  Minister Rafiq al-Hariri in Beirut on 17 January--recorded]    [Text] [Buwayz] Doubtlessly, the U.S.-Syrian summit shows  clear indications about the future of the peace negotiations.  The first signs coming from this summit suggest that the  principle of achieving progress on all the negotiating tracks  has been accepted. Formerly, there were numerous attempts to  isolate the Arab parties and deal with each of them separately.  The U.S.-Syrian meeting also appears to have clarified other  basic principles of the peace process. I have said that it is  wrong to believe that a meeting of heads of state would deal  with details. It is also wrong to believe that such a summit  meeting is an uncalculated adventure. In other words, I believe  that the summit has successfully laid down general principles  and fundamental policies in connection with the peace operation.  I am sure that this will have a favorable effect on the  Lebanese negotiating track [words indistinct].    [Correspondent] Has there been any contact between you and  the Syrian foreign minister?    [Buwayz] I believe that a meeting will be held shortly to  clarify certain points that have not been fully outlined.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, you have noted that the summit  will have a favorable effect on the Lebanese negotiating track.  In what way do you think this will happen?    [Buwayz] You know that the Lebanese negotiating track and  the  issue of south Lebanon, though primarily dealing with private  Lebanese affairs, are also linked to the general regional  situation, both with regard to the peace process and a  prospective peace agreement. Lebanon has repeatedly declared  that it will not sign a peace agreement except in concert with  the other Arab brothers and after all Arab rights have been  secured. Additionally, there are actual conditions in the field  that are connected to the regional situation. Doubtlessly, the  broad outlines agreed upon yesterday will have a positive effect  on these conditions and give fresh impetus to the negotiations.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what impressions did you get  while following the U.S.-Syrian summit yesterday?    [Buwayz] Of course, it was a summit meeting between the  President of the United States whose decisions, following the  dissolution of the Eastern Bloc, are significant on the  international level, and President al-Asad, who holds several  cards enabling him to negotiate from a position of power. The  dialogue, therefore, took place between two strong figures who  were able to make decisions and commitments. This is a very  important point. I also feel that the dialogue was between two  people fully conversant with the complexity of the Middle East  crisis and its secondary problems and able to handle them.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what do you think about the  Israeli condition to halt resistance operations before a  solution is reached?    [Buwayz] We have repeatedly said that the resistance in the  south is a consequence of the occupation and can never end until  the occupation is terminated.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHIONABLE FURNISHINGS;  </P> <P> BLANKET CASE FOR THE RUGGED LOOK  </P> <P> Whether you drape one over a sofa or over your shoulder, rugged wool blankets  are all the rage. Yards of woolly Indian patterns, buffalo plaids and bold  stripes in earthy reds and golds are on display this winter, both at home and  on the fashion range.  </P> <P> The "Twin Peaks" factor seems to be encouraging the trend. The Northwest  produced all those Pendleton Mills (as in Pendleton, Ore.) blankets and shawls  now found at flea markets and in such upscale antique stores as Indigo Seas,  which provided items for the horsy corner (pictured). Environmental,  save-the-forest concerns may also be subtly inspiring the northern-woods look.  </P> <P> And such designers as Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein have been glorifying  anoraks and outsdoorsy sportswear of all kinds. Whatever the inspiration,  fashion and interior designers are on the same wavelength, and it's  all-American.  </P> <P> Shown here is I. Magnin Design Studio's Indian blanket coat, $225, at all I.  Magnin stores. Pendleton blankets are $300, Mexican blankets are $400, and  serape-covered cushions are $115, all at Indigo Seas, 123 N. Robertson Blvd.,  Los Angeles. BETTY GOODWIN  </P></p>

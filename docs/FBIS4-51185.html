			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Exercise Strict Management Over </F> Armed Forces"]    [Text] In strengthening management over the armed forces,  there is quite an important point to stress: Management work  must proceed in accordance with the principle of being strict  with the armed forces, and style and discipline improvement must  be taken as the key issue.    Exercising strict management over the armed forces and  strengthening discipline are ancient yet realistic issues. We  say these are ancient issues because all philosophers and  far-sighted militarists in the past stressed that "discipline is  the lifeblood of the armed forces" and explained the basic law  of armed forces formation from different perceptions. We say  they are realistic issues because our armed forces are in a  period of peace and are experiencing the test of reform in the  great tide of economic construction. The prolonged peaceful  environment and colorful social phenomena are affecting the  armed forces through various channels and are causing soldiers  to slacken their vigilance and loosen their discipline. In  recent years, the class status of personnel in the armed forces  has changed a lot. Soldiers had different qualifications before  they joined the armed forces and cadres and soldiers have many  employment options after demobilization. All these affect their  minds, concepts, and behavior. There are all sorts of frictions  between an open society and the armed forces' strict  disciplinary restrictions and authority. Therefore, some  comrades mistakenly think that since the state has implemented  many open policies, it is no longer necessary for the armed  forces to exercise strict management. Guided by this idea, some  units have lowered their criteria and requirements for  implementing discipline, and some have even taken the wrong  approach of "counteracting" the higher authorities' regulations,  decrees, and rules. As a result, some units have relaxed their  management and slackened their style and discipline. This  situation suggests that the more peaceful the environment and  the more open the policy, the more necessary it is for the armed  forces to exercise strict management. This is an objective  demand for the improvement of the armed forces in peacetime.    In exercising strict management over the armed forces in  this  new situation, officers and soldiers of the entire armed forces  should cultivate this clear idea: Discipline must be enforced  to the letter and acting willfully is not permissible.  Discipline is a behavior rule all members of the armed forces  must strictly observe and is an indispensable condition for the  armed forces to survive. As special armed organizations, only by  observing strict discipline can the armed forces shape their  personnel and complicated equipment into a strong combat  collective and build individual and scattered forces into a  powerful entity. The Chinese Army's Disciplinary Orders  explicitly point out: "Under all circumstances, all soldiers  must strictly abide by discipline, and no violations of  discipline whatsoever are allowed." We may say that a basic  demand on soldiers is strictly and thoroughly implementing  discipline. Our armed forces must be able to stand the test of  a prolonged peaceful environment and must always preserve the  Red Army's tradition of being strict in discipline; at no time  should they slacken their vigilance.    Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin stressed:  "Strict management must be exercised over the armed forces. It  is necessary to use orders and regulations to standardize the  armed forces' behavior." In exercising strict management over  the armed forces, it is necessary to strictly implement orders  and regulations to strictly implement discipline and to strictly  apply the principle of reward and punishment. Orders and  regulations are the codes for exercising strict management over  the armed forces and serve as the basis for implementing  discipline. Whatever situations appear in armed forces  management in this new period, we must unflinchingly implement  orders and regulations; use orders and regulations to  standardize officers' and soldiers' words and deeds, as well as  units' war preparedness, training, work, and life order; and  cultivate officers' and soldiers' concepts about orders and  regulations, as well as their mentality of obeying orders. All  commanders and soldiers in the armed forces are equal before  orders and regulations. In implementing discipline, "the higher  level should set a good example for the lower level to follow,"  and the practice of "counteracting the policies of the higher  authorities" must be overcome to ensure the smooth relay of  government and military orders.    Strict management will yield good results and loose  management will cause faults. As long as all armed forces units  use orders and regulations to train officers and soldiers in  strictly observing organizational discipline and following  orders and prohibitions, this glorious People's Army of ours  will establish stricter discipline, cultivate a fine style, and  create the brilliant image of a majestic and civilized army.</p>

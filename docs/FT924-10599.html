			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Photos fetch a record price: Saleroom A PHOTOGRAPH by the Russian Constructivist artist Alexander Rodchenko sold for Pounds 115,500 at Christie's to a German collector yesterday. It was a record price for any 20th-century photographic image. The print was taken in 1934 and shows the photographer Evgeniia Lemberg holding a Leica camera. It carried an estimate of up to Pounds 16,000. Rodchenko renounced 'easel painting' in 1921 and from 1924 concentrated on recording Soviet society through the camera. The other remarkable price in the auction was Pounds 74,800 for each of two 'Vortographs' - attempts to interpret Vorticist art and regarded as the first abstract photographs. They are the work of Alvin Langdon Coburn, in 1917, and depict fractured light. They were estimated to fetch up to Pounds 18,000 each. Christie's and Sotheby's have been holding important English silver sales in New York this week. Christie's set an auction record for 20th-century English silver when the London dealer Hancocks paid Dollars 154,000 (Pounds 97,240) for 'Dream Ship', a silver, silver-gilt and enamel nef, or ship model, by the celebrated Omar Ramsden. Ramsden created the ship, which depicts a 15th-century three-masted carrack, in 1922, when it was bought by Henry Ford, whose estate sold it at Sotheby's in 1951 for Dollars 625. Its estimate this week was about Dollars 50,000, but the Columbus 500th voyage celebrations undoubtedly increased its appeal. The top price at Sotheby's silver auction was Dollars 165,000 (Pounds 104,762) paid for a pair of George II silver-gilt salvers made in London in 1743 by David Willaume II. Meanwhile in Hong Kong a Taiwanese dealer paid HKDollars 7.48m (Pounds 614,444) for a 'Grand View of the Blue Mountains' by Zhang Daqian, who died in 1983. It was a record for a modern Chinese painting.</p>

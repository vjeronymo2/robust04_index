Today France included Peru on the  list of countries authorized to export its products to the  French market.    A Foreign Ministry press release reported today that the  French official newspaper has published information directed to  French importers of fishing products, incorporating Peru on the  list of nations authorized to sell them their products.    The note adds that the French Government has fulfilled the  administrative requirement of including Peru on the list of  countries permitted to export to their market, as it committed  itself on 24 February when it announced it would do so "as soon  as possible."    On that date, a Peruvian Foreign Ministry note reported that  French authorities had communicated to the Peruvian Government  that they were taking the necessary steps to fulfill the  administrative requirements for publication of the list of  accepted Peruvian firms.    The French Government said on that occasion that "there is  no  discrimination" affecting Peruvian fishing products' entry into  the French market.    On 22 February, it was reported in Lima that France had  forbidden the importation of Peruvian hake as a result of French  unions' protests demanding protective measures from their  government.</p>

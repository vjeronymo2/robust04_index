			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Provisional Airport Authority has appointed  Hank Townsend as its Chief Executive Officer for the next three  years. But as Cliff Bale reports, the appointment is likely to  be criticized by legislative councillors.    [Begin Bale recording] Dr. Townsend was appointed as Chief  Executive Officer one year ago following the sudden departure of  Richard Allen. He was seconded from the International Bechtel  which is in charge of the project management of the airport core  program. The Provisional Airport authority said in a statement  that Dr Townsend would now sever his links with Bechtel and the  Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod was quoted as welcoming  the three-year appointment. He said he was sure Dr Townsend  would provide the authority with the confidence and continuity  needed to complete the airport to the maximum extent possible by  mid-1997. However that is unlikely to calm the worries of  legislative councillors over the appointment. The infrastruture  spokesman for the United Democrats, Albert Chan, says that the  move violates the authority's localization and open recruitment  policy. He will discuss the issue with the Secretary for  Economic Services, Gordon Siu, this afternoon [end recording].</p>

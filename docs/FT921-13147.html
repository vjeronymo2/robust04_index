			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Arts: The Philharmonia Orchestra - Royal Festival Hall Whether intentionally or not, a superficial link brought together the two halves of the Philharmonia's concert on Tuesday. In later life both Dvorak and Rakhmaninov found themselves in the New World, far from the homelands they held dear, and it was a single work from each of their American periods that was included. It would be fanciful to suggest that the performers had taken this chance connection into account when they were rehearsing the programme and yet I have not previously felt either piece speak so longingly of people and places out of reach. The main work was Rakhmaninov's Third Symphony - a difficult score to place geographically anyway and in this performance, conducted by Kurt Sanderling, rendered a strangely rootless and troubling masterpiece. Sanderling is always a welcome guest at the Philharmonia. To my mind, now that a generation of venerable maestros has gone, he is one of the great conductors of the day and if he wants to conduct this symphony in so individual a way, then it is best to respect his ideas. For there was none of the usual Hollywood glitz in his performance. No lush Philadelphia-like strings. Not even much Russian red-blooded excitement, if one looked to that tradition. Instead the whole symphony spoke of an enormous and burdensome longing. The emphasis was on slow speeds and sombre textures, lowering deep brass in particular. Every detail carried import and it says a lot for the work that conductor and players must have put in that the music left such a convincing message as one came away: that this often spurned work is a serious symphony and Rakhmaninov meant what he wrote in every note of it. In Dvorak's Cello Concerto a wistful longing for home is never far from the surface. Yo-Yo Ma made much of its poetic cello writing, with some notably exquisite soft playing in the slow movement, while Sanderling brought to the accompaniment the same strength of purpose for which he is known in the German classics. Again this was a performance which took nothing for granted and the orchestra gave it playing of its best quality. If the Philharmonia is to lift its international profile as it hopes, there are two objectives to meet: it will have to offer unusual programmes and make those which are usual something out of the ordinary. This concert was a superb example of the second case and I cannot put forward a stronger recommendation for Sanderling's other concert tonight, when he conducts Mahler's Ninth Symphony.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 20 TASS -- A nation-wide  poaching-control operation called "Zaslon" which was launched on  Monday, will protect Russia's national wealth, said here on  Monday Rear-Admiral Sergey Skalinov, deputy commander of Russian  naval border forces, in an interview with ITAR-TASS.    According to the admiral, all ships took their assigned  positions and started fulfilling their duties.    The poaching-control operation is being conducted on the  Barents, Baltic, Black, Azov and Caspian seas, Lake Chudskoye,  the Amur and Ussuri rivers. It involves, along with border  forces, ships of the Russian Navy, Aviation, the Customs Service  and other state structures.    In the opinion of Skalinov, experience accumulated during  the  first stage of a previous poaching-control operation which was  carried out in the Pacific, enabled military authorities to  deploy forces in a short period of time and establish  cooperation between them.    The admiral said that the second stage of the  poaching-control operation in the Pacific was launched  successfully on Monday. Vice-Admiral Nikolay Kudinov, commander  of naval forces of Russian border troops, is in charge of this  operation.    "The main task of these large-scale operations is to prevent  the pillage of Russia's national wealth, along with strict  observance of international norms and rules," the admiral  concluded.</p>

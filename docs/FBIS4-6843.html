			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- Korea Exchange Bank  President Ho Chun resigned Saturday for allegedly tampering with  the bidding price for the public auction of  soon-to-be-privatized Korea Telecom [KT] stocks. Ho, who took  up the post in June last year, handed in his resignation at a  board meeting with Managing Director Yi Chang-u to act on his  behalf until a replacement is named.    Korea Exchange Bank, commissioned by KT to receive bids for  its shares, nevertheless took part in the two-day public bidding  from Monday and allegedly used inside information to match the  lowest offer. Just before the application deadline, the  Exchange Bank bid for 900,000 shares at 34,800 won per share  with a deposit of 3.13 billion won. The price reportedly  matched the successful lowest bid.    Rumors then spread fast that the bank, taking advantage of  inside information, knew in advance about the bidding price by  examining the offers of investors. Amidst public criticism, the  bank withdrew on Thursday after falsely claiming it had lost the  bid by pledging 34,600 won, 200 won off its actual bid price.  It announced that the successful figure was 34,700 won and that  it lost because it offered a lower price, despite its  application to the Bank of Korea showing a bid price of 34,800  won.    Ho explained the situation to reporters Friday and again  lied  while admitting the false announcement. He showed reporters the  manipulated computer data stating 34,600 won as the bank's bid.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Manila's fifth consecutive gain achieves record high THE region's major markets were firmer yesterday. Tokyo, Bangkok and Seoul were closed for holidays. MANILA advanced for the fifth consecutive trading day, closing at an all-time high on active buying. The composite index gained 17.87 to 1,654.39 in spite of profit-taking by some institutions. Traders said that the rally was driven by lower interest rates, with local institutions moving funds to the equity market from the treasury bill market, which is yielding 10.8 per cent down from 14 per cent at the start of the year. Mr Anton Periquet of Asia Equity said that the bottom for the treasury bill yield would be the peak of the stock market. 'The rally could last another two weeks at the most,' he said. KUALA LUMPUR advanced marginally after a rise in some blue chip issues, amid low volumes ahead of today's national holiday. The composite index rose 0.38 to 706.46 in volume of 359.4m shares against 430.5m. Traders said that investors had already discounted rumours over the health of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, which depressed share prices on Tuesday. However, aside from short-term buying in smaller stocks by local investors, an analyst at Kim Eng Securities in London said that he doubted whether there would be a further rally in the market, since leading blue chip stocks look reasonably valued. AUSTRALIA saw a strong rise led by advances in the banking and gold sectors. The All Ordinaries index jumped 10.4 to 1,664.3, rising for the first time since April 26. Some traders, however, said that the gains were technical after the declines. The gold sub-index rose 4.6 per cent to 1,492, with Plutonic Resources up 30 cents to ADollars 4.60, while North Flinders Mines advanced ADollars 1.30 to ADollars 8.80. Westpac advanced 11 cents to ADollars 3.50, while Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group, which announces its earnings on May 14, advanced 9 cents to ADollars 3.50 on speculation that its bad debt charges would fall sharply. NEW ZEALAND shrugged off Tuesday's 1.9 per cent fall and moved firmly ahead, taking the NZSE-40 index 13.43 higher to 1,577.54. Forestry shares, which bore the brunt of Tuesday's selling, recouped some of their losses. Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey both added 5 cents to NZDollars 2.65 and NZDollars 2.95 respectively. Lion Nathan, the brewer, rose 10 cents to NZDollars 3.55 after announcing that interim profit before extraordinaries rose to NZDollars 87.4m from NZDollars 46.0m. TAIWAN closed mixed after late buying cut early losses, but trade remained very sluggish. The weighted index, which was down more than 30 points at mid-morning, ended 1.14 ahead at 4,449.32 in turnover of TDollars 22bn. The mood was unsettled by poor April trade figures announced late on Tuesday. But the market found support near the 4,400 level on hopes that the central bank might ease monetary policy in the medium term, after parliament passed a non-binding resolution requesting the central bank to cut reserve requirements. HONG KONG held on to small gains at the close after an afternoon rebound from morning losses. The Hang Seng index finished 2.04 higher at 6,829.33, after a day's high of 6,856.46. Turnover rose to HKDollars 4.54bn from HKDollars 3.71bn. Rumours, confirmed after the market closed, that the Sino-British Land Commission, which regulates Hong Kong government land sales, would meet soon brought out bargain-hunters. Retail investors continued to switch to second and third liners, while fund managers remained buyers of blue chips. Cheung Kong topped the most active list, putting on 30 cents to HKDollars 26.80. HSBC Holdings was down 50 cents to HKDollars 70.50. SINGAPORE bounced off lows to end firmer ahead of today's holiday. The Straits Times Industrial index closed up 3.56 at 1,780.20 in volume of 162m shares compared with Tuesday's 238m. Sembawang Shipyard, which saw a block trade of 5m shares at SDollars 11.30, closed 20 cents higher at SDollars 11.40 in total volume of 5.6m shares. JAKARTA, also on holiday today, was steady in moderate trade and the official index closed 0.30 lower at 313.61. Astra International dropped Rp300 to Rp11,500 in spite of its rise in first quarter profit. BOMBAY picked up late in the session after languishing for much of the day as speculators bought on expectations that carry forward costs after Friday's account closure would be low. The BSE index closed 40.33 higher at 2,168.70.</p>

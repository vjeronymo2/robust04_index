During the trial, numerous questions were raised about the  circumstances engulfing the assault and about al-Turabi's  health. Since the court issued its verdict, numerous pending  issues have continued, such as: how has the incident affected  al-Turabi physically and psychologically? Has he recovered from  it or is he still suffering from some of its effects? Was there  really a plot behind the assault, as some parties have implied,  or was the attack an individual act motivated by a "feeling of  being wronged by what is going on in Sudan," as Hashim  Badr-al-Din has said? What are the causes of the clamor which  accompanied al-Turabi's visit to Canada? Why did the Canadian  consular office in Washington refuse to grant al-Turabi an entry  visa initially but changed its mind afterward? Was the visit to  Canada a missionary and call-oriented visit, as al-Turabi said,  or was it to hold political and trade talks and to discuss  transactions in the areas of transportation, banking,  communications, and pharmaceuticals, according to one of three  Canadian parliamentary deputies who were to meet with al-Turabi  during his visit?    There are other questions: how did the Sudanese opposition  in  Canada learn of al-Turabi's itinerary, even though it had not  been announced officially? What are the circumstances that led  to the lack of guards to protect al-Turabi before he left  Ottawa? Was al-Turabi traveling under his real name or under the  assumed name of "Martin Loony," as some parties have implied?    These questions and others were raised during the trial, and  some of them have remained unanswered, thus adding more mystery  and excitement to this issue.    In a series of articles, AL-MAJALLAH will review some  aspects  of the case, of the trial, and of the accompanying controversy.  It will also publish for the first time a photograph of Dr.  al-Turabi in the hospital room immediately after the incident.  This was the first photograph presented to the jury as part of  the evidence aimed at acquainting the court with the injuries  sustained by al-Turabi in the incident. Following is the second  part of this report:    Since the assault on Dr. Hasan al-Turabi at Ottawa Airport  in  May 1992, numerous questions have been raised regarding the  health of the Sudanese National Islamic Front secretary general  and on whether al-Turabi has recovered from the consequences of  the incident or whether he is still suffering from it physically  and psychologically despite the lapse of 19 months since the  assault. Even though al-Turabi has resumed his activities and  even though he made his first two "official" foreign trips last  year, visiting Afghanistan, via Pakistan, and the Vatican,  numerous Sudanese, including some officials and some who are  close to al-Turabi's family, say that the incident has left its  imprints on al-Turabi physically and psychologically. These  people reiterate that al-Turabi "disappears" from time to time  for a period of one week for treatment from the effects of the  Ottawa incident. Interpretations vary on the details. Some say  that the NIF secretary general is taken to a place known only to  a few, where he stays for a week out of sight to be treated with  some drugs that have an evident effect on the man and on his  general capabilities. Others say that he resorts to complete  rest during this disappearance because he feels extremely tired  and exhausted after any effort that he exerts.    In addition to some officials who work with the current  regime and who do not wish to reveal their identity, Aldo Ajo  Deng, deputy speaker of Sudan's Transitional National Assembly  (parliament) who broke away from the government last month and  applied for political asylum in England, has also talked about  this issue. He said that al-Turabi "is hidden" from sight for  one week a month to rest and regain his energy, which seems to  have declined greatly since the Ottawa incident. He added that  numerous people have noticed that al-Turabi tires quickly and  that his train of thought is affected if he takes part in a long  conversation or in a public event that requires one to stand and  concentrate for a long time.  <H5>  Feeling of Exhaustion </H5>   In a press interview in the wake of the incident, al-Turabi  said that he felt exhausted. Moreover, the physician who treated  him at Civic Hospital in Canada told the court which considered  Hashim Badr-al-Din's case last year that the patient (al-Turabi)  had not regained his normal condition when he left the hospital.  On top of this, the medical report that was submitted to the  court noted that al-Turabi may need treatment in a "special  unit" in the United States or Switzerland to regain his fitness.  It is not known to date whether al-Turabi has received such  special treatment, keeping in mind that he has not visited the  United States since the Ottawa incident and that it has not been  announced or learned that he has visited Switzerland since that  date, even though rumors were circulated in Sudanese circles  last year about a "secret visit" al-Turabi made to Switzerland.  <H5>  Extent of Injuries </H5>   Al-Turabi (62) suffered a brain concussion, lost his speech,  and experienced extreme weakness on the right side of his body  as a result of the incident. A Canadian police officer is  reported to have said in the wake of the incident that the blow  al-Turabi received from Badr-al-Din did not cause much damage  and that the main injury resulted when al-Turabi's head collided  with the ground when he fell. That collision caused a nearly  two-inch long wound on the right side of the back of his head.  The wound did not need to be surgically stitched but it caused a  brain concussion, which began as minor but intensified by the  third day, according to the report of Dr. Vasco da Silva, the  physician who treated al-Turabi at Civic Hospital.    Before the court considering Badr-al-Din's case, da Silva  described al-Turabi's injuries as follows: "The injuries can be  described as three parts: al-Turabi suffered a superficial wound  to the scalp, and this is the first part. The second part is the  slight concussion which basically manifests itself in a passing  or transient loss of consciousness lasting between 15 to 20  minutes. The more serious injury, which represents the third  part, was suffered in what can be characterized as a brain  concussion.    "As a result of these injuries, especially the third part,  al-Turabi experienced unconsciousness and exhaustion. He started  to breathe haltingly, and he lost all ability to speak and to  respond to verbal commands. This dictated his return to the  intensive care room on the third day of his admission to the  hospital." da Silva characterized the loss of ability to respond  to verbal commands as the "worrying element" which alerted him  to the fact that al-Turabi's head injury was not as slight as it  had seemed to be initially.    In his testimony before the court, Dasilva added: "I  realized  then that there was something worrying about him (al-Turabi)  because he wasn't able to talk properly. When one spoke to him,  he answered on a totally different issue, meaning that his  disturbed ability to speak made me conclude that there was a  positional fault in the brain. This was confirmed by our [later]  diagnosis, which showed what I have characterized as a brain  concussion."  <H5>  Court Dialogue </H5>   The following dialogue then took place between Dr. da Silva  and the attorney defending Badr-al-Din (the defendant) in court:    Attorney: When you say that he (al-Turabi) was  giving illogical answers, do you mean that he was unable to talk?    Da Silva: He talked. Yes, he talked on the first  and second day after his admission to the hospital. But if one  asked him: How are you? He would respond: in Toronto, thank you.    Attorney: But there was no problem in his ability  to speak?    Da Silva: This is what one can call impossible or  disturbed speech. What I mean is this sort of illogical  responses.    Attorney: Did you decide that there was a  concussion after the sectional scanning of the brain, or did you  make your decision before the scan was conducted.    Da Silva: I felt that there was something wrong  with the brain before the sectional scan was made. The result of  the scan confirmed my doubts.    Questions and answers then revolved around permission given  by Dr. da Silva to a physician named 'Abd-al-Amin, who arrived  from Chicago on 27 May 1992 (two days after the incident), to  examine Dr. al-Turabi at his family's request. The attorney  wondered if it was normal to permit Dr. 'Abd-al-Amin to examine  al-Turabi even though he had come from abroad, meaning that he  did not belong to the staff working at Civic Hospital. In  response, Dr. da Silva said that this was not unusual and noted  that Dr. al-Amin suggested two kinds of drugs to treat al-Turabi.    According to the medical report, Dr. al-Turabi had an  allergic reaction and developed a skin rash because of one of  the two drugs. Dr. al-Turabi also experienced weakness on the  right side of his body and a total loss of his speech ability.  After 19 days in the hospital, there was improvement in the  condition of Dr. al-Turabi, who regained his ability to speak  and started to walk a little around his room. He also continued  to take his medication.  <H5>  Condition Engulfed in Ambiguity </H5>   Al-Turabi's health condition was encircled by walls of  "official" silence through his stay at the hospital. Civic  Hospital officials were asked not to make any statements about  his health. Reporters' questions were referred to the Sudanese  Embassy in Ottawa, which either refused to answer the questions  or offered vague answers.    Ambiguity continued to engulf al-Turabi's condition even  after his return to Khartoum on 21 June 1992. The authorities  concerned prevented people from visiting him, and only a few  relatives and close associates saw him. Writing about  al-Turabi's return, AL-INQADH AL-WATANI, the government paper,  said, "al-Turabi's kinsmen, and those who love him and who are  close to him and who were around him or in contact with the  Canadian hospital where he was being treated, received saddening  medical reports at times and encouraging reports at other times.  But the final days of his weeks of recuperation witnessed  improvement that doctors could not believe and that surprised  observers, considering that he began to regain his health and to  act as if nothing had happened."    SUNA, the Sudanese News Agency, also circulated a report on  al-Turabi's return to Khartoum from Ottawa in which it said that  he was "in good health." But all other reports and sources said  that, even though al-Turabi felt great improvement in his  health, he continued to suffer from the effects of the incident  for a long time. The first time the Sudanese people saw  al-Turabi after his incident was in a "silent film" shown by  Sudanese television on a visit which Lieutenant-General 'Umar  al-Bashir, the Revolutionary Command Council chairman, paid to  al-Turabi's home to reassure himself about al-Turabi's health  nearly one week after he had returned to Khartoum. In the film,  the NIF secretary general looked pale and exhausted and his  voice could not be heard during his conversation with  Lieutenant-General al-Bashir.    Some people who were permitted to visit al-Turabi weeks  after  his return have reported that he could not stand for a long  time, even though he leaned on a walking stick, and that he also  had difficulty moving his right arm and foot because of a slight  paralysis resulting form the incident. He seemed to have  difficulty speaking. It was also noticed that he talked about  nothing other than the incident. Some people interpreted this as  part of the psychological effect of the assault and injury.    On 31 July 1992, a ceremony was held in the Green Square in  Khartoum on the occasion of al-Turabi's return and "recovery."  Al-Turabi delivered an address in which he said, according to  SUNA, "God fated me to survive and He prolonged my life after  they paralyzed a part of my body and stopped my tongue from  speaking. But God has restored my speech to me and has healed my  paralyzed side." Al-Turabi added, "Muslims are the source of the  invocation for my recovery." He also alluded to a plot to  assassinate him.    Despite the lapse of 18 months since that ceremony, there  are  still those who say that al-Turabi, even though he has largely  recovered his health and his abilities, continues to suffer from  some effects of that incident and that he still needs medication  and periods of treatment and rest.  <H5>  Questions About His Future </H5>   The assault on al-Turabi created great confusion within the  NIF ranks and it almost touched off an open conflict within the  NIF leadership ranks between those aspiring to succeed al-Turabi  and those advocating a change in the leadership system so as to  fill the void that developed at the time or that could develop  in the future if the incident were to leave lasting effects on  the secretary general's health. According to reports leaked at  the time, a number of the NIF leaders raised the issue of  forming a collective leadership to fill the void during  al-Turabi's presence in the hospital for treatment and to  replace him in case he disappears or becomes unable to work. It  was reported that the names proposed to form that leadership  were those of NIF Deputy Secretary General 'Ali 'Uthman Muhammad  Taha, Ahmad 'Abd-al-Rahman, Ibrahim al-Sinusi, Yasin 'Umar  al-Imam, and 'Uthman Khalid Mudawi. But the proposal was  rejected by 'Ali 'Uthman, who insisted that the adoption of such  a step could produce adverse results and reflect the regime as a  regime experiencing void or weakness because of al-Turabi's  absence.    'Ali 'Uthman's argument did not convince the NIF's "old  generation" who saw that 'Uthman was trying to gain sole control  of the decisionmaking and to succeed al-Turabi "even while he is  still alive." The feelings of annoyance among the ranks of the  "old generation" began to appear in what this generation's men  said in their private sessions. Some of them talked about  endeavors by 'Ali 'Uthman to marginalize others and about  'Uthman's efforts to gain control of affairs and to impose his  tendencies on the NIF and on the regime.    It is to be noted that the majority of the Sudanese speak of  'Ali 'Uthman as the planning head behind the 30 June 1989 coup  and as the real director of numerous domestic affairs,  especially since al-Turabi is inclined to devote a large part of  his time to working and planning with the other movements  connected with the NIF in the region. It has been noticed that  since the assault on al-Turabi, 'Ali 'Uthman has begun to figure  more prominently in the political arena, has begun to assume  ministerial positions, and has begun to expand his powers and to  enlarge the sphere of his influence by giving positions to the  Front's "young generation" and by marginalizing the "old  generation" that can dispute his leadership of the NIF action.    Even though al-Turabi has begun to exercise his leadership  tasks since his return and, to a large degree, his recovery,  some sort of division of roles has surfaced between him and 'Ali  'Uthman, with al-Turabi devoting most of his attention and time  to the foreign movement and contacts and to coordination with  other fundamentalist movements through the facade of the Islamic  Arab Popular Conference. Meanwhile, 'Ali 'Uthman takes charge of  domestic executive action, with the role of grand "master" and  guide maintained by al-Turabi in the domestic arena as well.    Many in the NIF and outside it realize that it will be  difficult for 'Uthman to fill the void created in case al-Turabi  disappears. This is because 'Uthman lacks al-Turabi's long  experience and his extensive network of foreign relations.  'Uthman is not even known to many beyond Sudan's border, and  some view him as more of a political figure than a religious  leader.    This is why NIF cohesion and unity seem to be tied to  al-Turabi and to the extent of his ability to overcome the  effects of the Ottawa incident, especially in light of the  growing crises and pressures confronting the Sudanese regime  internally and externally.</p>

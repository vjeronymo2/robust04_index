During his stay in Saudi Arabia, the  president performed umrah [minor pilgrimage] and held talks with  King Fahd of Saudi Arabia on a wide range of issues.    In an airport statement before his departure from al-Madina  al-Munawarrah, President Farooq Leghari said that during the  talks with King Fahd the most important issues which came under  discussion were recent developments in Indian-occupied Kashmir,  situation in Afghanistan, and the plight of the Bosnian Muslims.

He said he also informed King Fahd that Pakistan had  accepted  the Indian offer of talks at the foreign secretary's level in  good faith and hopes that India would engage in a meaningful  dialogue for resolving Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance  with the UN Security Council resolutions and the Simla  Agreement.

			<p>940428 FT  28 APR 94 / Canberra caution on interest rates Australia's consumer price index rose by 0.4 per cent in the March quarter, putting the country's annual inflation rate at 1.4 per cent, writes Nikki Tait. This represents a dip from the December quarter, when the CPI increased by 0.2 per cent, to give an annual rate of 1.9 per cent. Mr Ralph Willis, the Australian treasurer, took advantage of the news to stress that there was no reason for interest rates to rise in the 'foreseeable future', and to criticise dealers who have driven money market rates higher, largely in response to interest rates rises in the US. Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, added that he believed the bond markets - where yields have also been rising - had lost credibility as a guide to inflationary expectations.</p>

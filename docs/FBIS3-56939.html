			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, 20 Jan--"Incomprehension and indignation"  has been provoked in Moscow by the official reaction in Latvia,  Lithuania, and Estonia and a number of other countries to the  statements of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the  conference of Russian ambassadors to CIS and Baltic countries on  18 January, reaction which was based on a distorted  interpretation of the minister's words. This was stated today  at a briefing by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Information  and Press Department of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Foreign Affairs.    He stressed that "without waiting for explanations about  what  the minister of foreign affairs was really saying, or at least  for the full text of his speech, representatives of the U.S.  Department of State and some Baltic states deemed it possible to  make hasty and unfounded statements."    One gets the impression, the Russian Foreign Ministry  spokesman noted, that "instead of concentrating on the  continuation of constructive work to finalize the agreements and  treaties that are now the subject of negotiation, our Baltic  partners have lifted individual quotations out of context in  order to attract world attention yet again and to try and gain  certain political dividends from this." According to Karasin,  "another aim of this maneuver is to whip up an artificial  hullabaloo and avoid making decisions on how the rights of the  Russian-speaking communities in Latvia and Estonia can be  properly safeguarded."    "In our view, the West should also be concentrating  attention  on these problems rather than criticizing a Russian minister in  the way that an official spokesman for the U.S. State Department  allowed himself to do," Karasin declared.    According to the Russian representative, the heart of the  matter was "explained at length by the Russian foreign minister  during yesterday's television address, and then again in the  closing stage of the conference. "We do not see any need for  additional clarifications," Karasin concluded.</p>

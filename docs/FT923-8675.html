			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Hurd wary of sending ground troops to war zone THE USE of force to deliver humanitarian aid to victims of the fighting in Bosnia may well be necessary, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, acknowledged yesterday. He emphasised, however, that the identity of the forces who might provide this protection had 'not yet been worked out'. As public pressure on the government to do something to end the suffering of the region's inhabitants continued to mount, Mr Hurd again underlined the reluctance of Britain, the US and Germany to commit ground troops to the former Yugoslavia. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, he said talks between Britain, the US and others were focusing on ways of affording better protection 'with the UN agencies and the humanitarian effort already on the ground rather than replacing it'. As the likelihood of a UN resolution on protecting the flow of aid to the region appeared to be growing, Mr Hurd said 'a certain amount' of Nato contingency planning had been going on. But he ruled out exerting military force to separate the combatants. Speaking on the eve of a visit to Brussels by Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister, to discuss the proposed London conference later this month on the region's problems, Mr Hurd said he hoped the UN would pass a separate resolution on conditions in the notorious Serb-run camps. Conditions in the camps are to be inspected this week by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, on a visit to Bosnia. Mr Ashdown yesterday called for action by the west to ensure the conflict 'is brought to a lower level of intensity'. Mr Hogg's meeting with the European Commission today will include discussions on how to improve the effectiveness of economic sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro - which together make up what remains of Yugoslavia - after concerns about oil traffic on the Danube.</p>

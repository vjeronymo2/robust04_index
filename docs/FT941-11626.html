			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / News Corp investors upset over Doulton Holders of exchangeable preference shares issued by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation fear they may incur a considerable financial loss because of a legal wrangle over the ownership of shares in Royal Doulton, the fine china manufacturer. When Pearson, the media, banking and industrial group which publishes the Financial Times, demerged Royal Doulton last year, it offered its shareholders one Royal Doulton share for every 10 held in the parent. Since News Corp's preference shares were exchangeable into shares which the company had bought in Pearson in the late 1980s, the holders anticipated that when they exercised their exchange right they would receive Royal Doulton shares in addition to shares in Pearson. Indeed, a notice published on behalf of a subsidiary of News Corp in the FT on December 13 advised holders of the preference shares that they were entitled to the Royal Doulton shares as part of the exchange property. As a result, many holders decided to exchange and traders adjusted the price of the preference shares to reflect the value of the Royal Doulton shares. However, the market was thrown into confusion this week by a notice in Monday's FT which said that News Corp was taking legal advice over whether the Royal Doulton shares were part of the exchange property after all. News Corp has declined to elaborate on the notice. The notice has serious financial implications for traders and investors who have made sales of Royal Doulton shares in the belief that they would receive them as part of the exchange property. They also face foreign exchange losses if they have to unwind their hedging positions. Traders said News Corp's efforts to improve its relationship with investors would be dealt a serious blow if it kept the Royal Doulton shares. 'The market will put News Corp through the works just when it is trying to improve its name,' said one dealer. In 1989, News Corp raised the equivalent of Dollars 375m (using current exchange rates) in sterling, guilders and D-Marks through issuing preference shares which were exchangeable for shares in Pearson. In the late 1980s, News Corp's stake in Pearson reached 20.5 per cent but it has subsequently been cut to 4.9 per cent.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Top Communist under pressure Mr Georges Marchais, secretary general of the Communist party. THE 72-year-old Mr Marchais has led what must be one of the last bastions of Stalinist orthodoxy in the world for the past 20 years. The Maastricht treaty's emphasis on economic liberalism and its social democratic values go against all his beliefs. His party supporters, who represent less than 10 per cent of the national vote, follow that line loyally. Even if there is no significant split on Maastricht among the Communists, Mr Marchais is under constant pressure from the growing minority in his party who want to update its creaking ideologies. He created turmoil in the ranks last month by admitting, on his first trip to the US, that the theory of democratic centralism might have had its day. But apart from that, Mr Marchais has played his anti-Maastricht campaign true to form, warning that the treaty will add to unemployment. He has urged voters to keep domestic politics out of the debate, if only because Mr Marchais knows that it is not in the Communists' interests to provoke a general election. Their popularity has suffered badly since the last legislative poll in 1988.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Grim forecast for Sweden THE SWEDISH economy will shrink by 2.8 per cent this year, its worst performance since the second world war, according to the government, writes Christopher Brown-Humes from Stockholm. The forecast is much more pessimistic than the one it gave in April predicting a 1.7 per cent decline. However, it expects 1993 to be the low point, with GNP growth of 1.9 per cent next year and 2.9 per cent in 1995. No growth in private consumption is likely next year, and public consumption is forecast to fall 1.3 per cent. Unemployment will rise to 8.4 per cent, excluding those on training schemes, before falling to 7.9 per cent in 1995. New measures to help achieve a targeted SKr81bn (Pounds 6.8bn) strengthening of the budget over five years were also unveiled yesterday. They include higher individual social security charges and reduced subsidies for dentistry and medical prescriptions.</p>

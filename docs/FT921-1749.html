			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Letters To The Editor: Women at the Bar May I correct two inaccuracies which crept into your otherwise excellent article on the forthcoming survey of women at the Bar ('Bar sets up probe into sex discrimination', March 16). First, women at present constitute 18.5 per cent of the total number of practising barristers in England and Wales, not 9 per cent. Second, the survey is being funded jointly by the Bar Council and the Lord Chancellor's department. The figure of Pounds 5,000 is the contribution from the Lord Chancellor's department towards the total cost of the survey. Stephen Sedley, chairman, sex discrimination committee, General Council of the Bar, 1 Pump Court, Temple, London EC4Y 7AA</p>

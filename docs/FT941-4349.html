			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Barclays back in the black with Pounds 664m: New chief executive Martin Taylor intends to reform bank's culture and structure Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' newly-appointed chief executive, declared yesterday that he intended to reform the culture and structure of the UK's largest bank as it disclosed a strong return to profit last year following its 1992 loss of Pounds 242m. Mr Taylor said that Barclays would use its capital better and not seek fresh equity except in an 'extraordinary and unforeseeable' circumstance. 'The game of over-distributing capital and then asking for it back is over,' he said. Barclays disclosed pre-tax profits of Pounds 664m, increasing earnings per share to 19.4p, compared with a 21.4p loss. It maintained its dividend at 15.15p, the level to which it was cut last year to prevent a further loss of capital. The banking division and BZW investment bank both performed well, the former making an Pounds 879m profit compared with a Pounds 195m loss (restated). However, profits were hit by a Pounds 675m loss in troubled US businesses which are being managed down. Mr Taylor defended Barclays' plan to cut costs by shedding 5,000 jobs within two years. 'I am absolutely astonished that what seem to me to be ordinary management principles are not yet established in this industry.' Mr Andrew Buxton, who was both chairman and chief executive until Mr Taylor was recruited from Courtaulds Textiles to take the latter role, said Mr Taylor's appointment had been among several 'stimulating changes' last year. The BZW division made a profit of Pounds 501m helped by a strong year in capital markets and derivatives trading and equity origination. Mr Buxton said BZW had concentrated on customer business, rather than proprietary trading. Dealing income rose to Pounds 781m, against Pounds 491m, helped by market volatility. The bank said that most of a Pounds 137m rise in staff salaries was attributable to salaries and bonuses at BZW, although it did not give a figure for bonuses. The bonuses were condemned by Bifu, the banking union. 'There can be no justification for sacking one group of staff and giving huge bonuses to another,' it said. The Pounds 675m loss in the 'United States transition' business included a Pounds 236m loss due to the writedown of mortgage servicing rights at the BarclaysAmerican/Mortgage business, and a Pounds 346m loss on poor loans. Operating profit before provisions rose 9 per cent to Pounds 2.56bn, against Pounds 2.34bn, and provisions fell 24 per cent from Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds 1.9bn. Operating profits on business with big companies in the UK rose 25 per cent. There was a Pounds 135m loss on continental European operations. The tier one ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets rose to the bank's target figure of 6 per cent, against 5.5 per cent, after it retained earnings of Pounds 67m (against a Pounds 586m loss). These were the first retained earnings for three years. Lex, Page 18</p>

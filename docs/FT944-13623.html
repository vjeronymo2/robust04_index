			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Berlusconi eases pensions pain The Berlusconi government yesterday agreed on a new decree to ease hardship caused by Italy's pension reform proposals in the 1995 budget. Mr Clemente Mastella, the labour minister, said 100,000 persons were affected and the extra cost in 1995 would be L600bn (Pounds 240m). The expense would be met from a treasury contingency fund. The cost of the amendments is lower than first projected; this is largely because the government has shifted the biggest burden of the changes on to the 1996 and 1997 budgets. The government decided to soften some aspects of pension reform in the wake of the huge nationwide demonstrations organised by the trade unions. The main hardship cases concern those who retired early hoping to collect more generous pensions next year by escaping expected benefit cuts. They risked being trapped by a government decision to stop paying pensions for the first six months of retirement to people who retired between September and February 1995. Now those with 37 years' contributions by July will have full access to their pensions. The government will also remove the penalty for those retiring early if their retirement is postponed to 1996 or, in the case of less than 30 years' contributions, to 1997.</p>

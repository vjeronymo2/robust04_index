			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Quiet day broken by late fall for Dow Wall Street A LACK of direction from overseas markets left US share prices little changed in light trading yesterday, in spite of some more bad economic news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 10.26 down at 3,257.35. It spent all day hovering just a few points either side of Friday's close, and only a late burst of selling sent the index into a double-digit loss. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased just 0.81 to 414.03, while the American SE composite was 0.40 softer at 380.78 and the Nasdaq composite 0.45 off at 563.11. New York SE turnover was light at 161m shares. With the foreign exchange markets subdued by the holiday in the UK, quiet overseas equity markets and little movement in US bond prices, share trading was thin in New York. Investors were also reluctant to enter the market ahead of Friday's employment report for August. The day's economic news was not positive, but it had little effect. New single-family home sales fell by 2.6 per cent in July, and the rise in June was revised down to 5.3 per cent from a previously estimated 7.9 per cent. The Chicago Purchasing Management Association's index for August declined from July's 59.2 per cent to 58.4 per cent, indicative of a slowdown in manufacturing activity in the midwest. Compaq put on Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 32 3/8 in turnover of 2.5m shares after the big computer company stated that it had entered into a pact under which it will receive licensing rights to the PostScript software produced by Adobe Systems. The latter, quoted on the Nasdaq market, shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32 1/2 . Merck dipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 48 5/8 after Mr James Keeney, an analyst at broking house Mabon Securities, lowered his rating on the drug group from 'buy' to 'hold', saying initial prescriptions for Merck's Proscar drug are below expectations. Other drug stocks retreated, Johnson &amp; Johnson relinquishing Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 49 1/4 and Pfizer also losing Dollars  7/8 , to Dollars 77 1/4 . Whirlpool firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 35 5/8 but Maytag eased Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 13 1/4 after Kidder Peabody, the securities firm, initiated coverage of the two appliance manufacturers with a 'buy' rating for Whirlpool and a 'hold' for Maytag. Kidder recommended that investors switch out of Maytag and into Whirlpool. Canada TORONTO stocks ended mixed to firmer, with solid gains in the gold and silver and real estate sectors. The TSE 300 index was 0.1 off at 3,402.9 after moderate volume of 25.1m shares valued at CDollars 274.9m, but rises outscored declines by 323 to 219. The gold and silver index added 1.47 per cent at 5,340.5.</p>

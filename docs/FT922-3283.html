			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Star-Track's next great adventure Lorry thieves watch out. A stolen vehicle can now be spotted by a satellite orbiting thousands of miles above the earth. As the vehicle moves away from the scene, an alarm sounds at a control base and an operator can guide police to the lorry's location as it moves across a digital map display. Star-Track, a new vehicle fleet management system launched by Marconi Systems Technology, of Hampshire, gives fleet operators real-time information about their vehicles' location and performance. The system comprises a base control station with a map and data display screen listing details of up to 30 vehicles, each of which is fitted with a box smaller than a car radio which contains a satellite navigation receiver, communications modem and interface for a range of on-board sensors. Marconi Systems Technology: UK, 0705 260024.</p>

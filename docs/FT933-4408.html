			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / S Korea warns North on N-arms SOUTH KOREA warned yesterday that it might toughen its stance against North Korea on the nuclear weapons issue unless Pyongyang resumes contacts with Seoul by tomorrow, writes John Burton in Seoul. North Korea last week offered to hold inter-Korean talks over inspection of its nuclear facilities, but later added preconditions for the meeting it had proposed for tomorrow. It demanded Seoul stop its support for international efforts to force nuclear inspections, and end 'nuclear war games', an apparent reference to its annual Team Spirit military exercise with the US. South Korea rejected the conditions. The US and South Korea have suggested they may ask the United Nations Security Council to impose economic sanctions on North Korea if it did not make progress in nuclear inspection negotiations.</p>

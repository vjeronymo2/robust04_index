			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Smiths Industries Dollars 32m US expansion Smiths Industries yesterday said it was expanding its industrial division with the Dollars 32m (Pounds 21.6m) cash acquisition of Tutco, the US heating element manufacturer. The privately-owned Tennessee-based group is expected to complement the division's air conditioning and ducting operations. Mr Roger Hurn, chairman, said: 'Recent acquisitions have given our industrial group a strong focus in the heating and ventilation markets. Tutco fits in well with these existing busin-esses.' Those subsidiaries are dominated by Vent-Axia, the fan company acquired for Pounds 58m in December 1992. An enlarged industrial division, however, is unlikely to overtake Smiths' main medical systems and aerospace activities. In the 12 months to July 31 last year, the division contributed Pounds 21m to pre-tax profits of Pounds 104.6m and accounted for Pounds 152m of the Pounds 725.8m turnover. Smiths predicted Tutco, which employs 360 people and produces more than 5m heating elements a year, would boost divisional turnover by 14 per cent.</p>

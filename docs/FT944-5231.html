			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): More bubbles for Jacuzzi The next time you step into a Jacuzzi whirlpool bath spare a thought for Roy Jacuzzi, 51, the man credited with bringing the bathtub out of the water closet, writes William Hall. He started in the business when he was 12, is responsible for more than half of Jacuzzi's 200 patents, and shows no sign of wanting to step down as the king of the world's whirlpool business. Roy's grandfather, who emigrated from north east Italy, set up a mechanical engineering workshop in California in 1910. Soon he was making aircraft propellers and built a passenger aircraft used by the US postal service. Having diversified into irrigation pumps, Roy, who was head of research, stumbled on the whirlpool by accident. One of his cousins suffered from arthritis and Roy built a pump into the bathtub so that his cousin could benefit from the water and air-jet treatment prescribed by the doctor. In 1968 Jacuzzi started selling his whirlpool baths - he called them Roman baths - from the back of a lorry at Dollars 700 a time. In 1974 President Ford installed a Jacuzzi in the White House and the business took off. Today the company has operations in Canada, Italy, Chile and Brazil, employs 2,200 people and turns over Dollars 400m a year. It has sailed through the recession with no problems. Indeed Hanson, which has owned the company since 1987, is so impressed with Jacuzzi's 'exemplary levels of profitability' that it has decided to make Roy (below) chairman of Jacuzzi Inc. Since he is already president and chief executive it does not mean an awful lot. But it is the sort of extra trimming which would have made his poor grandfather proud.</p>

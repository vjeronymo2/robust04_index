			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Australis Media in sport venture Australis Media, the fledgling pay-TV company in which TCI, the US cable giant, and associated companies have a 26.5 per cent interest, yesterday announced that it was forming a 50-50 joint venture with Liberty Sports/Prime International to broadcast a 24-hours-a-day sports channel, writes Nikki Tait. Liberty is the programming arm of TCI. The programming deal is the latest in a series of rapid developments at Australis, as it attempts to bring pay-TV into Australian homes before the end of 1994. There is still some scepticism about Australis' long-term chances of success, given the small size of the Australian market for pay-TV and the presence of some big entrenched media interests, including those of Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Kerry Packer.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hermes Sucre Serrano] </F>   [Text] Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement]  presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles has advocated the  creation of special commissions to investigate the scandal with  the Social Security Fund's (CSS) housing projects, the National  Financial Corporation's (COFINA) operations, and the Van Dam  Bridge project.    According to the former comptroller general, the  recommendations that the Directorate for the Recovery of State  Property (DRP) made to the Legislative Assembly must be made  again. These recommendations found no fertile ground before and  were rejected. In a document entitled, "The Position of  Presidential Candidate Ruben Dario Carles With Regard to  Corruption," the Molirena politician explains his views about  the creation of commissions to speed up the cases on dealings  investigated by the Comptroller's Office and the DRP.    Carles also recommended adopting legislation concerning  seized funds. These funds should be deposited at the National  Bank and used to finance social projects. With regard to legal  matters, Carles proposed profound changes to the penal and  judicial codes. As to the Fiscal Code, he maintained that it  must be modified in the area that pertains to contracts in which  the public sector is a party.    He also proposed serious regulation of the civil service  system to improve bureaucracy. According to Carles, corruption  does not only mean stealing but providing bad service.    Concerning the administration of justice, Carles noted that  since the outset of the democratic government in December 1989  the Attorney General's Office has experienced a continuous  crisis, one that "reached a climax with the investigation,  trial, and ruling on the case of former Attorney General Rogelio  Cruz. However, this did not end the crisis at the Attorney  General's Office. This government office is safeguarding dozens  of millions of dollars linked to drug trafficking or money  laundering without making any progress in the investigations  that are to lead to the respective trials," he stressed.</p>

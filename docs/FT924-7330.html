			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Platignum up 71% at Pounds 329,000 Platignum, the manufacturer of writing instruments, stationery, furniture and housewares, took an upward turn in the half year to September 30 with pre-tax profits advancing 71 per cent from Pounds 192,000 to Pounds 329,000. Turnover fell from Pounds 8.89m to Pounds 8.14m. Mr Simon Knott, chairman, said that both stationery and housewares were performing well in difficult markets. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 260,000 related to the disposal in June of Cousins and Matthews, the Elm Furniture subsidiary. Problems at Younger Furniture, which has incurred losses, continued to be 'addressed'. Earnings improved from 0.9p, adjusted for the 1-for-10 share consolidation which took place as part of the capital reorganisation in May, to 1.3p. As forecast with the open offer and placing in March, there is a return to the dividend list with an interim of 0.25p.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (8): Car maker's links go back over 50 years - Jaguar's long tradition in Coventry / In the late 1980s, Jaguar was producing 50,000 luxury cars a year in Coventry JAGUAR'S connections with Coventry go back a long time, almost to the origins of the motor industry, but question marks have recently hovered over whether the company will maintain its commitment to the city. Jaguar moved to Coventry from Blackpool in 1928. Under Sir William Lyons and his successors, it has survived with various partners and owners in Coventry for more than 50 years. The takeover in 1989 by the Ford group for Pounds 1.6bn and the impact on luxury car sales of the recession in the late 1980s has, however, made some employees question whether the company has a future as an independent marque, and what role if any Coventry would play. The company was hit particularly badly by the downturn in sales for its cars in the US. Exports account for something like two-thirds of sales. In the late 1980s, Jaguar was producing 50,000 luxury cars a year in Coventry, but last year output was only half that level and the company registered a loss of Pounds 226m in 1991. The battering that Jaguar took from the recession has led to a reduction in the total workforce from more than 10,000 in 1990 to 8,000 today. The numbers employed in the two manufacturing plants in Coventry has dropped to under 7,000. Reports at the time of the takeover that Ford executives were unhappy with low productivity at Jaguar has led to suggestions that production of engines would be moved elsewhere, and that assembly might also be transferred to other parts of the UK, or even to Europe, or, at the very least, that the Coventry plants could expect further drastic redundancies. Mr David Boole, the director of communications and public affairs for Jaguar, is at pains to dispel these unsubstantiated reports. 'Despite the softness of the market at the moment, Ford is convinced that there is a future market for luxury cars. 'The entry of Japanese manufacturers, Nissan and Toyota, have proved that. Ford are going to persevere with the Jaguar as an individual marque. 'Ford has has made a long-term commitment to Jaguar. It has said that it will invest Pounds 1bn in Jaguar. It is going to expand the product range, bring in new models, maintain the quality of Jaguars and improve efficiency.' One development being mentioned is the production a V8 engine for a new mid-series vehicle which would replace the XJ6 and compete with BMW. This does not mean, however, that the company will just be making bigger versions of Fords. Mr Boole insists also that Jaguar's future is inextricably bound up up with Coventry. 'Ford has made a firm commitment to remain in Coventry,' he says. Although there could be further job losses through natural wastage or increased automation, the numbers employed are not expected to decline substantially below the current figure of 8,000, and could even rise if the world economy improves. Over the next few years, Ford is looking to increase the numbers of cars produced to 150,000, tripling the peak output of two years ago. 'You are seeing the first smatterings of a recovery. Sales of Jaguars in April were 16 per cent higher that for the same month a year ago, compared with 9 per cent for the rest of the car market. 'Sales in the US were 2.5 per cent higher in April over the same month,' he says. But he does emphasise that despite the guarantees given, Ford will want to see productivity increases. Mr Boole feels that the Ford takeover will ultimately be seen as a good development, both for the Jaguar and for Coventry. 'The company enjoyed a sales spurt in the mid-1980s, particularly in the United States, but it was never really big enough to compete on a world scale. 'With a parent company developing a new generation of sports cars and saloons, and with enough 'muscle' to take full advantage of the market for these new models, it will be able to compete,' he says. 'That can only be good news for Coventry. It is part of Jaguar's tradition to be in this city.'</p>

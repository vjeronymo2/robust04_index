			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BM dives Pounds 116m into the red - Chief executive resigns as restructuring provisions unexpectedly soar BM Group, the debt-laden engineering company, yesterday announced greater than expected restructuring provisions and write-downs leaving it with a Pounds 116.6m pre-tax loss for the year to June 30, against a profit of Pounds 34.6m. The company also announced the resignation of its chief executive Mr Howard Sutton, one of the last remaining directors behind the acquisition strategy which burdened the group with debt of some Pounds 160m. Mr Sutton, who was on a three-year rolling contract with a salary of Pounds 200,000, will be replaced by Mr Cliff Walker, formerly of Dunlop and BTR. Mr Sutton will remain as deputy chairman until April. BM blamed its misfortunes on the acquisition in 1990 of Blackwood Hodge, the construction equipment distributor, for Pounds 54m and a further Pounds 118m in associated borrowings. The difficulty was compounded by the subsequent purchase of Thomas Robinson, the packaging group. 'These two acquisitions left BM in a dangerously weak position to face the recession,' said Mr Moger Woolley, chairman. As a result, initial estimates of a Pounds 41.6m charge to pay for the disposal programme had proved insufficient to clinch a financial restructuring. Further charges to pay for banking fees, additional closures, property losses and write-downs, and wider restructuring of remaining businesses resulted in a total hit of Pounds 119.5m. Shareholders funds dropped from Pounds 157.5m to Pounds 60.2m. At the operating level, BM announced profits of Pounds 16.6m, against Pounds 48.1m last time, on sales up from Pounds 519.5m to Pounds 547.2m. Mr Walker said the group had sold some 14 businesses so far, raising about Pounds 51m. BM was also in advanced talks over a further six disposals, including the Blackwood Hodge business in Canada, which were expected to raise about Pounds 40m and eliminate roughly Pounds 24m in associated debt. BM's debt, reported as Pounds 114m at the year end, had been reduced further to Pounds 86m. By the end of the disposal programme BM would comprise engineering businesses with turnover in 1993 of Pounds 154m and profits of Pounds 11.7m. Losses per share were 109.1p, against earnings of 25p. There is no final dividend, leaving the interim of 0.5p for the year (5p). The preference dividend is postponed. COMMENT These grim figures were wholly unexpected, but surprisingly, not unwelcome. There would appear to be little left to sweep out of the stable. For the first time in more than a year, BM appears to be confident it is over the worst. Warnings of a Pounds 55m provision, due to the almost academic write-off of goodwill on disposals, mean that the company is set for a sizeable loss this year. However, at the operating level analysts are looking for anything from breakeven to a relatively small deficit of Pounds 1m from continuing businesses after interest. In the short term, the shares still appear highly speculative. Much hinges on BM actually achieving those six disposals, particularly in Canada. After that, the downside compared to 1993's results is pretty limited.</p>

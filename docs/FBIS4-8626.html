			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] A leading parliamentary representative  of Egyutteles [Coexistence], the main political organization of  Slovakia's Hungarian minority--which numbers 600,000 in a  population of 5 million--said in a recent interview that he  believes the minority's political position is now considerably  stronger than it was under the recently ousted government of  Vladimir Meciar, despite the absence of Hungarians in Slovakia's  new government.    In an interview published on 18 March in the  Hungarian-language Bratislava daily UJ SZO, Istvan Harna, who  represented Egyutteles at the negotiations on the formation of  the cabinet, told an unidentified interviewer that the new  government will be forced to take into account the views of the  Hungarians because the Hungarians "now hold the balance in  parliament." Without their vote, Harna said, the parliament  "cannot pass any laws," and if the coalition parties fail to  "keep their promises" to the Hungarian minority, its  representatives can "hold back" their votes "at any time." As  he sees it, the Hungarians are in a more advantageous position  than if they were in the government, because "if we had even one  minister, we would share governmental responsibility, and we  would have to support the cabinet even if it did not satisfy our  demands."    At the same time, Harna expressed disappointment that the  anti-Meciar coalition had not been more willing to accommodate  the Hungarians. He dismissed as a political ploy the fact that  at one point during the negotiations the anti-Meciar groups had  offered him the post of finance minister, saying they had done  so "only because they were forced to" when all the other parties  refused "to accept the responsibility" for the ministry that is  the "most trouble." No serious attempt was made to include the  Hungarians in the government, Harna said, because the  anti-Meciar Slovaks contended that "Meciar would, with his  demagogic populist statements, use the Hungarians' participation  to incite public opinion against the new government." While  saying that there was "some truth" in such contentions, Harna  declared that it still was "not principled" to leave the  Hungarians out of the government, because if their vote is  needed, then "the rules of democracy" dictate that they should  be included.    Nevertheless, Harna indicated that the Hungarians will be  able to take advantage of the new political situation to get  some significant concessions. Taking into account the "public  mood and Slovakia's interests," he said, they agreed to support  the government even if they could not join it, but in return  they made eight demands. Evidently referring to Hungarian  demands for more local government power--which Slovaks have  criticized as an attempt to loosen Slovakia's hold on  Hungarian-inhabited areas--Harna said that at first the  anti-Meciar coalition called the demands "irredentist," but  later the coalition "realized that they are not, and accepted  them." Moreover, the Hungarians will apparently be given an  increased role in education, which they consider a key area.  According to Harna, the new government will establish a  "separate Hungarian division" in the Education Ministry, and its  leading officials will be chosen on the basis of the Hungarians'  recommendations. While the Hungarians will not get any state  secretary positions, Harna said, the government has agreed to  "take into account" the Hungarians' opinion when appointing  "leading officials" in any ministry that has a particular impact  on the Hungarian minority.</p>

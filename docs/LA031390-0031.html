			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANGEROUS OLD STATE BUILDINGS  </P> <P> Your March 2 editorial on seismic safety standards for state buildings  ("Shaken, but Not, Alas, Stirred") is much appreciated by those of us who have  to work in dangerous buildings, but the statistics (400 buildings, $376-million  bond issue, etc.) don't really reflect the realities confronting the people who  work in such structures.  </P> <P> I and most of my colleagues in the Graduate School of Education at UCLA work in  Moore Hall, which is one of several old buildings that have been designated as  among the dozen most dangerous buildings in the state. It is a massive,  three-story unreinforced masonry structure that is normally occupied by close  to 1,000 people throughout the day, every school day of the year.  </P> <P> My office is on the third floor of Moore Hall. When the 5.5 Upland quake hit, I  happened to be in a newer building only a few miles from campus and was not  even aware that there had been an earthquake. My associates on the third floor  of Moore Hall were so panicked by the moving and shaking that they ran for  doorways and dove under desks. Unfortunately, such defensive tactics will not  help us when a larger quake hits.  </P> <P> University and state officials have known about the hazards of Moore Hall and  several other old unreinforced masonry buildings on the campus for many years.  </P> <P> Unlike the collapsed freeway in Oakland, the governor, state legislators, the  regents and other public officials cannot claim ignorance concerning the  dangers associated with working in buildings like Moore Hall. The risks have  been well-documented, and public and private appeals for action have been made  repeatedly. Those officials who claim that seismic upgrading or replacement is  "too expensive" might well be advised to ponder the personal consequences of an  earthquake that would topple just Moore Hall: Do they really want to be the  defendants in litigation filed by the grief-stricken parents, spouses and  children of 1,000 earthquake victims?  </P> <P> ALEXANDER W.

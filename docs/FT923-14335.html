			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / More turmoil feared in Macedonia POLITICAL TURMOIL in the Balkans worsened last night as the government of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia fell - after failing to win international recognition for its declared independence. Collapse of the fragile ruling coalition raises serious questions about the future stability of Macedonia. It casts doubt on the political future of President Kiro Gligorov, who has gone on futile missions abroad for diplomatic recognition. The republic of 2m people - up to 30 per cent of them ethnic Albanians  - has strained relations with all four neighbours: Greece, Albania, Serbia and Bulgaria. Greece in particular has objected to its drive for recognition, fearing the effects on its own ethnic minorities. The EC and US have been reluctant to go against Greece's wishes. As frustration has grown in Macedonia, there has been pressure from the ultra-nationalist VMRO party for closer ties with Bulgaria, although Bulgaria yesterday pledged not to interfere in the Balkans. There is concern, too, that Macedonia might be destabilised if ethnic Albanians seek closer links with Albania or with ethnic Albanians in Serbia's Kosovo province. The coalition government collapsed when the republic's parliament passed a vote of no confidence in it by an overwhelming majority. Under the republic's constitution, President Gligorov has 10 days to appoint a new prime minister. Mr Slobodan Petrovic, editor of Puls, a Skopje weekly, last night said: 'The collapse could heighten instability. Mr Gligorov may not be able to appoint a prime minister within the next 10 days.' Macedonia is struggling to cope with the effects of fighting in other former Yugoslav republics, including an influx of 35,000 refugees from Bosnia. Mr Petrovic said: 'In the air we feel the scent of war. . . but emotions may cool down and people will realise the fall of the government is a Pyrrhic victory.'</p>

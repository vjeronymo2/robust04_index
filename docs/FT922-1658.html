			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Mortgage relief proposal TAX RELIEF on mortgages should be phased out, Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide Building Society, said yesterday. He called at a conference of the Institute of Housing in Harrogate for reforms to bring about 'a more effective and balanced housing policy'. He also said there should be 'a mortgage benefit subsidy to mirror housing benefits to provide support for those who own their homes, but are not eligible for income support'. Government figures showed that Department of Social Security assistance paid towards the mortgages of the unemployed reached Pounds 949m last year, almost double the 1990 level.</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Single market brings air fare cuts CHEAPER AIR fares arrived in the single European market right on schedule yesterday as Lufthansa, the German state carrier, began selling cut price return tickets between every European Community member state and a dozen German cities. Passengers can now, for a limited period, fly from the UK to Germany for Pounds 99 return and from France for FFr999 return. The lowest scheduled fare between the UK and Germany was previously about Pounds 125. Lufthansa's move has already prompted three other airlines - Air France, KLM of the Netherlands, and Copenhagen-based Scandinavian Airline System (SAS) - to match the cuts, although only on economy flights to Germany. British Airways says it has no plans to follow suit. The cuts have been made possible by the Third Airline Liberalisation package, agreed last summer by EC members. Under the rules, fares can be changed without consulting governments first. Only if governments at both ends of the route disapprove of a new fare must it be withdrawn. The Lufthansa cut-price offer applies to economy tickets sold before January 15 and is valid for flights until March 31. This could be followed by further offers by carriers as they adapt to the newly-liberalised market. Lufthansa prepared its pan-EC marketing assault amid strict secrecy. By its own admission it is more associated with business class customers and high ticket prices and wanted to maximise the element of surprise. The venture is already a success, it claims. In the first two days of promotion, Lufthansa's London offices received double the number of telephone inquiries than normal for the time of year. Technology has also come to the aid of the airline. 'We have electronic filing systems to computer reservations networks. We can announce a price cut today and be selling the tickets tomorrow,' said Mr Frank Zehle, Lufthansa's marketing manager for Great Britain and Ireland. It is not yet clear whether European fares can fall as far as they did in the US after deregulation in the 1970s. Landing fees, air traffic control charges and wages are often higher in Europe. On the other hand, many European carriers are state-owned and may be able to sustain losses longer than privately-owned companies. The combined losses of European airlines last year were Dollars 1.3bn. Airline traffic has yet to show a sustained recovery following the slump caused by the Gulf crisis and the recession.

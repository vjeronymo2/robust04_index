			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Varshava Maksimova] </F>   [Text] According to information received from the National  Strike Committee of the KNSB [Confederation of Independent Trade  Unions in Bulgaria], 844,599 people took part in today's  national warning strike, while 641,392 people took one-hour  effective strike action. Protest rallies were held at more than  half the enterprises in the country. Members of the Podkrepa  Labor Confederation, the Association of Democratic Trade Unions,  and the National Trade Union, as well as private drivers, also  took part in the protests.    In Plovdiv the city authorities banned the planned rally, as  a result of which health workers took part in a silent march  along several of the city's central streets. Over 30  organizations in the road transportation sector took part in the  strike, stopping work for periods varying from 15 to 60 minutes.    The following main roads were blocked for one hour: the  Sofia-Svilengrad road near Khaskovo; the Burgas-Sofia road at  Aytos; the Sofia-Kulata route at Dupnitsa; the Ruse-Silistra  road near Slivo Pole. The Varna-Burgas road was blocked for 20  minutes near the village of Kosharitsa. In Svishtov dockers  blocked the river port for one hour, while the Danube Bridge was  closed in both directions for one hour.    According to the KNSB National Strike Committee, the police  arrested four trade union leaders today when they attempted to  block the Burgas-Varna main road. Those detained included KNSB  Executive Secretary Doncho Donchev. Three trade union leaders  from Dupnitsa were also arrested. The National Strike Committee  delivered a sharp protest against these police actions and  stated in an official announcement that this step might lead to  a new escalation of the strike conflict. The KNSB will  immediately inform the European Trade Union Confederation, the  International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the  Council of Europe of these violations of the Social Charter and  European conventions. The same institutions will also receive  reports on the action taken to prevent workers from two  commercial enterprises holding a rally in front of the Council  of Ministers building in Sofia.    In connection with these statements issued by the KNSB  National Strike Committee, the Interior Ministry Press Center  disseminated an announcement that rejects these claims outright.  According to the Interior Ministry announcement, the attempts  to block the road in the region of Slunchev Bryag and the main  road near Dupnitsa represented offenses against the Road Traffic  Act, as a result of which the police filed charges against the  drivers involved. The statement notes that no force or special  equipment was used. Regarding the rally outside the Council of  Ministers building, the announcement states that the  participants were informed by law- enforcement agences that no  permit for the rally had been issued, following which they  quietly dispersed without any incident.    After teachers and kindergarten assistants in boarding  schools and children's and orphans homes had stopped work for  one hour, at 1600 today the National Strike Committee of the  Bulgarian Teachers Union signed a strike agreement with the  Ministry of Education and Science that partially satisfies the  teachers' demands.</p>

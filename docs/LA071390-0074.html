			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS 'UPBEAT' AS BUSH REPORTS ON SUMMIT GAINS  </P> <P> President Bush, just home from back-to-back summits with America's closest  military and economic allies, won congressional support Thursday for proposed  reforms of NATO and a go-slow approach to aid to Moscow.  </P> <P> During a half-hour meeting at the White House, Bush briefed Democratic and  Republican leaders on the results of his meeting last week with NATO leaders in  London and the seven-nation economic summit in Houston, which concluded  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "It was basically upbeat," House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante B.  Fascell (D-Fla.) said after the White House meeting, "and I think everybody  felt that way about what the United States was able to accomplish."  </P> <P> The session with congressional leaders followed a similar report to the  Cabinet. Bush also indicated to reporters that he had yet to telephone Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss the results of the two summits.  </P> <P> For the most part, Bush succeeded at London and Houston in winning strong  backing for his vision of how the Western allies should alter their defenses  and their economic relations with the Soviet Union in the post-Cold War era.  </P></p>

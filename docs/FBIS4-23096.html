			<p>In      the wake of their victory in the March-April Supreme Soviet  election, Communists and their leftist allies have taken control  of the new legislature, greatly diminishing the influence of the  Government establishment, the socalled "party of power" led by  President Leonid Kravchuk and Supreme Soviet Chairman Ivan  Plyushch.  Although Kravchuk and Plyushch joined forces with the  nationalists to prevent the leftists from gaining control of  parliament, they failed in their efforts to put together a strong  enough coalition to block the election of Socialist-Communist  candidate Oleksandr Moroz as Supreme Soviet chairman.  As the  June presidential election approaches, the nationalists have  decided to back Kravchuk or Plyushch rather than to run their own  candidate.  With seven candidates in the race there will probably  be a runoff.  If they make the runoff, Kravchuk or Plyushch would  still face a strong challenge from leftists, who are united  behind Moroz, and from former Premier Leonid Kuchma, who has  strong support in east Ukraine and leads in the early polls.                         END SUMMARY     Communists and Allies Take Control of New Parliament     The new parliament has been harder for Kravchuk and Plyushch to  influence because it contains fewer deputies linked to the  government than the old parliament did and far more deputies  affiliated with parties, particularly the leftist parties.  Even  though the government establishment had drawn up the election law  to discourage parties and aid the election of nonparty candidates  representing or favored by the government, the majority of  Supreme Soviet members elected in the 27 March-1O April  parliamentary elections, 169 of the 338 seats filled, according  to election officials (UNIAR, 13 April), and as many as 242  (according to the 28 April Narodna Armiya), are linked to  parties.  The Communist Party (CPU) won by far the most seats-  -86--and, with its allies, the 14 Socialists (SPU) and 18 Peasant  Party (SelPU), forms a leftist bloc of over one-third of the  Supreme Soviet.  Rukh won only 20, 26, or 30 seats (depending on  which source is doing the counting), and other nationalists did  worse, while non-nationalist democrats--including the  Interregional Bloc for Reforms (MBR) of Kuchma and former Supreme  Soviet Deputy Chairman Volodymyr Hrynyov--also won few seats.     In the face of the CPU victory, the Kravchuk-Plyushch forces took  steps to attempt to retain control of the Supreme Soviet against  the leftist challenge.  Incumbent Chairman Plyushch, whose  prospects for reelection as chairman appeared dim anyhow (Post-  Postup, 22-28 April), announced he would not run for reelection  because he was running for president (Kyivska Pravda, 26 April),  and First Deputy Chairman of the old Supreme Soviet Vasyl  Durdynets, viewed by many as most likely to become new Supreme  Soviet chairman (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 20 May), took over leadership  of the establishment forces in parliament.  Durdynets led the  group of oblast and party representatives that conducted the  preparatory work for organizing the new Supreme Soviet during  April and early May (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 12 May) and initiated  the founding of a new "Center" group of deputies (Holos Ukrainy,  11 May), aimed at uniting deputies of what he called a  "constructive centrist orientation" (Holos Ukrainy, 26 April).  At a 6 May meeting, the group elected Durdynets its "coordinator"  and claimed to have registered 59 members (Holos Ukrainy, 11  May).  The Center is composed largely of government officials,  although the leader of the DemPU (Democratic Party of Ukraine)-  -the party closest to the government--is also a member (See Box  One).     As factions began organizing in the new Supreme Soviet (See Box  Two), the centrist bloc formed by the "party of power" reached  out to form an alliance with Rukh and other democratic factions.  Durdynets' Center at a 6 May meeting appealed to other factions  to create a bloc of centrists entitled "For Accord and Joint  Work" (Holos Ukrainy, 11 May) and at a 10 May meeting appealed to  other factions to create a "bloc of centrist orientation" (Kiev  radio, 11 May).  Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil also favored  creation of a mechanism for working with the Center and other  factions to counter the left (Molod Ukrainy, 13 May) and on 10  May announced that leaders of the Center, Rukh, Derzhavnist  (Statehood), and Za Reformy Dlya Narodu (For Reforms for the  People) factions had agreed to form a "centrist bloc" (Kiev  radio, 10 May).  On 17 May the Center, "Reforms," Rukh, Yednist  (Unity), and Derzhavnist factions, and some Agrarians and MDF-  Center met and formed a bloc aimed at countering leftists and  "becoming the parliamentary majority" (Post-Postup, 19-25 May).  Derzhavnist leader Mykola Porovskyy contended that if  Derzhavnist, Rukh, Reforms, DemPU, and Center got together, they  could form a bloc of 130-140 (Kyivska Pravda, 24 May).     Election of Chairman     The centrist bloc at its 17 May meeting agreed to unite behind  Durdynets in the election of a new Supreme Soviet chairman (Post-  Postup, 19-25 May), but when the election was held by secret  ballot on 18 May they failed to come up with enough votes to  block the election of a leftist.  The CPU, SPU, and Agrarians  united behind SPU Chairman Moroz, while the MBR nominated  nonparty Kharkiv historian Oleksandr Karpov (Silski Visti, 19  May; 20 May), and the ultranationalistic UNA-UNSO backed nonparty  Ternopil teacher Yuriy Tyma (Silski Visti, 19 May, 20 May).  Moroz managed to attract just enough to win on the first ballot-  -171, (See Note 1) while Durdynets got 103, Karpov 14, and Tyma 9  (Kiev radio, 18 May).  Elected largely by CPU votes and with his  own SPU only able to contribute 14 votes, Moroz is largely  beholden to the CPU and will probably have to bow to the CPU's  wishes on most occasions.     (Note 1) The number of votes needed to win was reduced from 170  to 169 when the Supreme Soviet invalidated the election of  Hrynyov and Odesa deputy Pavlo Kudyukin because their opponents  in the runoffs had withdrawn leaving them unopposed (ITAR-TASS,  12 May).  Their exclusion reduced. the membership from 338 to 336.     The election of Moroz as chairman apparently stunned many of his  opponents, who immediately began accusing each other of selling  out to the leftists.  Moroz was able to garner a considerable  number of votes beyond the roughly 120-145 of the CPU, SPU, and  Agrarians, apparently attracting independents and even some  supposed Durdynets supporters.  Nationalists, who had apparently  calculated that Moroz could not attract enough votes for a  majority on the first ballot and had expected a chance to  eventually push through a compromise candidate, began speculating  that some Center deputies had swung to Moroz in return for  promises of jobs (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 20 May).  Even though Moroz's  election, by putting the Supreine Soviet in the hands of the  leftists, would appear to be a setback for Kravchuk, Chornovil  and some of his colleagues immediately after the election charged  that Kravchuk himself had engineered Moroz's election in order to  destroy his rival Plyushch as a presidential candidate.  Chornovil argued that Moroz's victory was mainly a victory for  Kravchuk since Moroz would now drop out of the presidential race  to retain the post of head of parliament (in fact, Moroz did not  drop out) and Plyushch would be weakened as a rival to Kravchuk  presumably because Durdynets' defeat deprives Plyushch of his  base as Supreme Soviet leader (Nezavisimost, 20 May; Silski  Visti, 20 May).  Environmental Minister Kostenko, a Rukh leader,  also categorized the Moroz election as a Kravchuk maneuver,  alleging that the Center, "supposedly set up to support V.  Durdynets, secretly voted for A. Moroz" in order to weaken  Plyushch's presidential campaign (Nezavisimost, 20 May).  Later,  democrats assailed Yednist, which had joined the Durdynets bloc,  for acting as a "Trojan horse" and helping elect Moroz  (Nezavisimost, 27 May) and accused leftists of favoring Yednist  in distribution of Supreme Soviet Presidium seats (UNIAN, 31  May).     Election of Deputy Chairmen     The election of deputy chairmen of the Supreme Soviet further  enhanced the dominance of leftists and easterners over the  establishment and nationalists.  The Center proposed Durdynets  for first deputy chairman to "halt the diktat of leftwing forces"  (UNIAN, 20 May), but Moroz declared Durdynets had no chance of  election and proposed Agrarian leader Oleksandr Tkachenko for  deputy chairman (UNIAN, 19 May).  CPU First Secretary Petro  Symonenko also backed Tkachenko.  Upset by the prospect of  another leftist being elected, Rukh, Reforms, Derzhavnist, and  some Center deputies called a boycott, refusing to register as  present and thereby temporarily preventing a quorum and blocking  the scheduled election of a deputy chairman on 19 and 20 May  (UNIAN, 19 May; Demokratychna Ukraina, 21 May; Silski Visti, 24  May).  Moroz eventually offered a compromise to centrists:  Durdynets as first deputy chairman and Tkachenko as deputy  chairman.  But this was voted down by the Supreme Soviet on 24-25  May when it voted on several such combinations and gave the  largest vote to a team of two leftists--Tkachenko and Vice  President of the Ukrainian-Siberian Investment Corporation Oleh  Dyomin. (See Note 2)  They received 181 votes, compared to only  92 for a Durdynets-Tkachenko combination (Vecherniy Kiev, 26  May).  Furious democrats felt cheated (Silski Visti, 27 May), and  Chornovil called the election of Tkachenko and Dyomin a  "communist coup carried out under Oleksandr Moroz's leadership"  and accused the Yednist faction of joining the CPU-SPU-SelPU bloc  in carrying out this "coup" (Nezavisimost, 27 May).     (Note 2) Dyomin was long a CPU leader but recently has been a  businessman and a defender of Kharkiv regional interests and the  Russian language (Khreshchatyk, 1 June).  He was Kharkiv CPU  secretary until the party was banned in 1991, after which he says  he was unemployed for a while (Khreshchatyk, 1 June).  He ran for  the Supreme Soviet as a nonparty candidate but had links to  Kuchma's MBR (Silski Visti, 26 May; Molod Ukrainy, 27 May) and  spent heavily to defeat a CPU candidate in the runoff  (Khreshchatyk, 1 June).     Leftists further extended their control over the leadership of  the Supreme Soviet by dominating the allocation of seats in the  Presidium and committee chairmanships, prompting sharp complaints  from democrats.  Leaders of Derzhavnist, Reforms, Rukh, and the  Center claimed that Agrarians and Yednist (which apparently  joined the leftists) had each received an extra seat in the  Presidium, while Reforms and Derzhavnist received only one seat  apiece, instead of the two they are entitled to (UNIAN, 31 May).  When the Supreme Soviet on 31 May approved the naming of 22  committee chairmen, the CPU got 6, Agrarians 3, Yednist 2, while  the Center got 4, MDF-Center 2, and Rukh, Derzhavnist, Reforms,  and SPU one each, and the foreign affairs committee went to a  Communist, defense to a Socialist, economic policy to Yednist,  budget to the MDF-Center, and finance to an Agrarian (UNIAR, 31  May).  Leaders of Rukh and Reforms prQtested some of the choices  (UNIAN, 31 May), and Rukh's Ivan Zayets complained that  Communists were taking over the main committees (UNIAR, 30 May).  Rukh tried to boycott again in protest, but, according to  Chornovil, "the Center betrayed us" and only 99 joined the  boycott (Vybir News Agency, 3 June).     Kuchma's Role     While Kuchma and his faction did not clearly ally with the  leftists, they lined up openly against Kravchuk, the Center, and  the nationalists.  Kuchma openly rejected Durdynets (UNIAN, 6  May), although he probably did not vote for Moroz.  The MDF-  Center nominated Karpov for chairman (Silski Visti, 19 May, 20  May), and the 20 May Ukraina Moloda said that Karpov got the  Kuchma-Hrynyov votes.  Karpov in fact was listed as one of the  leaders of the MDF-Center in the official list of factions  (UNIAR, 27 May) and therefore probably received its votes.  Although probably not voting for Moroz, Kuchma did have kind  words for him after the election, saying that Moroz is becoming  more moderate and does not make "excessively leftist" statements  (Nezavisimost, 20 May).  Kuchma did not participate in the  democrats' 19 May boycott protesting Moroz's nomination of  Tkachenko for first deputy chairman (judging by a 21 May  Demokratychna Ukraina list of those registering and not  registering).  When the Supreme Soviet deputy chairmen were  elected, an apparent associate of Kuchma's faction, Dyomin, won  the No. 3 post in the parliament's leadership.     Moreover, the Kuchma camp and the nationalists have been  attacking each other vigorously.  Chornovil recently declared  Kuchma's MBR "our biggest enemy" (Nezavisimost, 22 April) and  said that the MBR is a bigger threat to Ukrainian statehood than  the leftists because the demands of Kuchma's supporters "threaten  our independence" (Holos Ukrainy, 11 May).  Even though it was  leftists' leadership and votes that apparently caused the Supreme  Soviet to declare Hrynyov's election invalid, Kuchuma and Hrynyov  blamed the nationalists for Hrynyov's exclusion.  At a press  conference after the Supreme Soviet vote, Kuchma and Hrynyov  accused the nationalist democrats of tricking the "less  experienced communists" into this decision, which they apparently  felt was aimed at weakening support for Kuchma as the  presidential race began (Silski Visti, 17 May).  Hrynyov  especially blamed former Rukh leader Holovatiy for raising the  credentials case (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 18 May).     In fact, it appears that the leftists had played the main role in  Hrynyov's exclusion.  Nezavisimaya Gazeta said that it was the  CPU and SPU that had voted to unseat Hrynyov (29 May) and that  Moroz had acted "in a partisan manner" against Hrynyov and  Kudyukin during the Supreme Soviet discussion of their cases (21  May).  Moroz had presided when the credentials of seven deputies  came under discussion and he proposed separate votes on each  case; CPU leader Symonenko presided during the vote and also  insisted on separate votes.  Although most of the cases involved  alleged violations of the same rule involved in Hrynyov's  exclusion, the separate votes resulted in declaring the election  of some deputies valid but that of Hrynyov and Kudyukin invalid  (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 14 May), apparently on partisan bases.  The  Supreme Soviet voted 178 to 95 against Hrynyov (Vysokyy Zamok, 14  May).  According to the 19-25 May Post-Postup, Communists and  nationalists united to vote to unseat Hrynyov because one side  disliked his pro-capitalist views and the other his pro-Russian  views.  Kuchma said he angrily walked out of the Supreme Soviet  after it voted to unseat Hrynyov (Kievskiye Novosti, 20 May).     Crowded Field Likely To Force Runoffs in Presidential Race     The establishment and nationalists continue to work together as  the presidential election set for 26 June approaches, both in the  attempt to postpone the election and in opposing Kuchma and  Moroz.  Kravchuk, who at first said he would not run for  reelection (ITAR-TASS, 25 April), has urged postponing the  election (Demokratychna Ukraina, 29 April) but eventually filed  as a candidate.  His call to postpone the election won support  from most nationalists--Rukh and Christian Democrats (ITAR-TASS,  25 April), the URP (Molod Ukrainy, 26 April), and DemPU (Ratusha,  26 April).  A petition signed by 122 Supreme Soviet members  (including Chornovil, according to the 18 May Za Vilnu Ukrainu)  called for postponement (Molod Ukrainy, 13 May), but Plyushch  (Pravda Ukrainy, 5 April), SPU Chairman Moroz (Interfax, 29  April; ITAR-TASS, 1 May), CPU First Secretary Symonenko  (Interfax, 6 May), Kuchma and Hrynyov (Vysokyy Zamok, 14 May),  and even ultranationalist Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party  Chairman Khmara (Interfax, 12 May) announced opposition to  postponement.  It would take a two-thirds vote of the total  membership of the new Supreme Soviet (300 out of 450) to change a  decision by the previous Supreme Soviet (Molod Ukrainy, 13 May).  Such an action is virtually impossible, especially with only 336  members seated in the Supreme Soviet at present.  When Kravchuk  formally asked the Supreme Soviet to postpone the election, it  turned him down on 2 June, with 201 voting to go ahead with the  election (UNIAN, 2 June).     Since a majority of votes cast is needed to win the presidential  election, the current field of seven candidates will probably  splinter the votes and force a runoff.  While Kravchuk, Plyushch,  Kuchma, Moroz, director of the Center for Market Reforms  Volodymyr Lanovyy, President of the "Ukrainian Financial Group"  Valeriy Babych, and Education Minister Petro Talanchuk are all  registered candidates (Kiev radio, 26 May), the contest appears  likely to boil down to Kuchma and Moroz competing for eastern and  communist-conservative votes and Kravchuk and Plyushch competing  for western-central and nationalist votes.  Among minor  candidates, Lanovyy is an outspoken economic reformer who was  fired by Kravchuk as deputy premier and minister of the economy  in mid-1992.  Although a New Ukraine leader in the past and now  listed as nonparty, he was backed by Rukh in his successful  campaign for election to the Supreme Soviet in Kiev.  Babych  heads the Yednist faction which has apparently left the Center-  nationalist bloc of parties formed just before the opening of the  Supreme Soviet session and joined the leftists, but an analysis  of candidates in the 26 May Demokratychna Ukraina contended that  Babych has long been pro-Kravchuk and will be helpful to Kravchuk  in debating economic policy against Kuchma and Lanovyy.     Kravchuk and Plyushch     The pro-Russian stance of of Kuchma and Moroz and their apparent  strength have frightened nationalists into rallying behind  Kravchuk and Plyushch.  Rukh, after doing poorly in the  parliamentary election, decided that there was no prospect for  electing Chornovil or any other nationalist as president.  Chornovil declared that nomination of a Rukh candidate would only  help Kuchma and Moroz (ITAR-TASS, 18 April).  With Chornovil  declining to run, the west has no one to support except Kravchuk  and Plyushch.  In collecting signatures to qualify for the  presidential ballot, Kravchuk led all candidates in Lviv, getting  51,748, while Plyushch (backed by many Rukh leaders) got 20,669,  and Kuchma and Moroz got few (Nezavisimost, 25 May).     As between Kravchuk and Plyushch, Plyushch appears weaker,  especially after losing his base as Supreme Soviet chairman.  Kuchma earlier had said that Plyushch had the best chance to  become president because as Supreme Soviet chairman he was  "holding all power in Ukraine"  (Interfax, 26 April).  Despite  losing the chairmanship, Plyushch still has a base in the  relatively conservative agrarian lobby of kolkhoz and sovkhoz  leaders, according to Nezavisimost editor Vladimir Kuleba  (Nezavisimost, 29 April).  Moreover, he has won support among  some nationalists disillusioned with Kravchuk's inaction.  Democratic bloc leader Levko Lukyanenko, although usually pro-  Kravchuk, has declared his preference for Plyushch over Kravchuk,  calling the president too "indecisive" (Samostiyna Ukraina, 1-7  May) and arguing that Plyushch would better protect the state (Za  Vilnu Ukrainu, 13 May).  Stories are circulating that Chornovil  also prefers Plyushch as the standardbearer against Kuchma and  Moroz, but he denied this and insisted he was not taking sides  between Kravchuk and Plyushch (UNIAR, 21 April; Nezavisimost, 22  April).  At a 30 May press conference he said that "personally I  will vote for Lanovyy" (Robitnycha Hazeta, 1 June).  Unable to  choose between Kravchuk, Plyushch, and Lanovyy, Rukh's leadership  on 6 June decided not to back any of the candidates in the first  round (UNIAR, 6 June).     Moroz     Moroz has not dropped out of the presidential race following his  election as Supreme Soviet chairman and in fact has reaffirmed  his intention to continue his presidential bid (UNIAN, Interfax,  23 May; Silski Visti, 26 May).  His position was strengthened by  the decision of CPU First Secretary Symonenko to drop out of the  race (ITAR-TASS, 1 May) and endorse him (Interfax, 6 May),  forming a united left behind the Socialist leader.  Given the  leftists' striking strength in the Supreme Soviet election, Moroz  will probably run a strong race.     Kuchma     Kuchma, however, may be the biggest threat to Kravchuk and  Plyushch, even though his MBR won few seats in the Supreme  Soviet.  Recent polls have usually shown him running ahead of  others.  A nationwide poll of 1,200 people in April showed that  18 percent favor Kuchma, while 11 percent back Kravchuk and 10  percent Chornovil (Interfax, 30 April).  He has strength in his  home base of Dnipropetrovsk, where he was elected to the Supreme  Soviet with 90 percent of the vote (Post-Inform, 28 March).  His  popularity in the south was reflected in a recent Odesa poll that  showed 18 percent for Kuchma versus only 6 percent for Kravchuk  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 16 April).  Kravchuk himself at a 2 June  meeting categorized Kuchma as his main rival in the election  (Interfax, 3 June; Izvestiya, 4 June).     Prospects     Supreme Soviet maneuvering and the presidential race are shaping  up as a struggle between Kravchuk, Plyushch, nationalists, and  democrats against the more pro-Russian Kuchma, Moroz, and the  CPU--the present establishment versus the "outsiders" from the  east and leftist camp.  After the first round of the presidential  election, Kravchuk will probably emerge as the standardbearer for  Ukrainian nationalists against Kuchma, who is backed by the  populous east and south, making the election more of a referendum  on whether or not to draw closer to Russia, rather than on  economic or political reform.  With the strong CPU showing in the  Supreme Soviet election and leftists taking control of  parliament, a victory by Kuchma or Moroz in the presidential race  would put the east in control and swing Ukraine away from the  nationalist course it has followed since independence, a change  likely to cause further tension between Ukraine's east and west  regions.     Box One                Members of Durdynets' Center     The Center is largely a collection of of government officials,  who comprise over half of the 27 Center members listed in the 5  May Uryadovyy Kuryer.  Several Supreme Soviet officials, DemPU  Chairman Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, New Wave leader Ihor Yukhnovskyy,  and one Rukh member (Myroslav Horbatyuk) also belong.  Only two  government ministers elected to the Supreme Soviet did not join-  -Environmental Minister Yuriy Kostenko (a Rukh candidate) and  Agriculture Minister Yuriy Karasyk (a nonparty candidate but  probably close to the agrarians).  No pro-Kravchuk URP (Ukrainian  Republican Party) members apparently joined, much less any  leftists, Kuchma backers, New Ukraine, ultranationalists, or  well-known Rukh leaders.  The following members of the Center  were identified in the 5 May Uryadovyy Kuryer or 24 May Holos  Ukrainy:         Oleksandr Bandurka--MVD chief for Kharkiv oblast, no party      Volodymyr Bortnik--chairman of an agricultural equipment  company, no party      Anton Buteyko--director of Kravchuk's Service of  Administration, no party      Volodymyr Butkevich--head of department of international law  at Kiev State University, no party      Valeriy Cherep--chairman of the old Supreme Soviet Commission  on Questions of Construction, Architecture and Housing and  Communal Economy, no party      Anatoliy Dron--chairman of the State Committee for Housing  and Communal Economy, no party      Vasyl Durdynets--first deputy chairman of the old Supreme  Soviet      Anatoliy Holubchenko--industry minister, no party      Myroslav Horbatyuk--engineer at institute, Rukh      Viktor Kalnyk--deputy minister of economy, no party      Olymp Klympush--transport minister, no party      Valeriy Kolomoytsev--director of a small enterprise, no party      Mykhaylo Kovalko--chairman of State Committee for Oil and  Gas, no party      Vasyl Kostytskyy--department head at juridical faculty of  Pricarpathian University, no party      Mykhaylo Kostytskyy--dean of juridical faculty at Lviv State  University, no party      Valentyn Landyk--deputy premier, nonparty      Kostyantyn Piskunovskyy--director of Ukrainian Oil Products  Association, no party      Vadym Plotkin--director of an industrial enterprise, no party      Ivan Plyushch--chairman of the old Supreme Soviet, no party      Volodymyr Pylypchuk--Chairman of the old Supreme Soviet  Commission for Questions of Economic Reform and Managment of  Economy, listed as nonparty in Uryadovyy Kuryer, but elected as a  democratic bloc candidate, one of Rukh's main economists in past      Petro Sheyko--president's representative in a rayon in  Chernihiv, no party      Roman Shpek--economy minister, no party      Yuriy Spizhenko--health minister, no party      Mykola Surhay--chairman of the State Committee for the Coal  Industry, no party      Viktor Suslov--adviser to the premier, listed as nonparty in  Uryadovyy Kuryer, but later listed as Agrarian when named  chairman of the finance commission (UNIAR, 31 May)      Serhiy Ustych--deputy head of. Zakarpatsk 0blast State  Administration, no party      Volodymyr Yavorivskyy--Chairman of old Supreme Soviet  Commission on Questions of Chernobyl Disaster, DemPU chairman  Ihor Yukhnovskyy--member of old Supreme Soviet Presidium,  former First deputy premier, listed as no party by Uryadovyy  Kuryer but ran on New Wave ticket in Lviv      Mykola Zhulynskyy--deputy premier, no party      Yukhym Zvyahilskyy--acting premier, no party  End Box One     Box Two                     Factions in the New Supreme Soviet     When the Supreme Soviet opened in mid-May, it decided after  considerable debate that 25 members would be required to register  as an official faction with the right of representation in the  Supreme Soviet's Presidium and other advantages (Nezavisimaya  Gazeta, 20 May; Post-Postup, 19-25 May).  This forced small  groups such as the URP, DemPU, and MDF-Center to consider  combining with others to meet this requirement (Za Vilnu Ukrainu,  18 May).  As the eclectic membership of the factions  demonstrates, deputies elected on a party ticket sometimes did  not join their parties' Supreme Soviet factions and factions  sometimes took names other than that of the parties they are  based on.  In an effort to discourage separatism, the rules  adopted by the parliament banned factions formed on regional  bases, a move angering some southern and Donbass deputies who  wanted to form regional blocs (Robitnycha Hazeta, 13 May).     Leftists:   The CPU formed the biggest faction, named "For Social  Justice and People's Power" (Post-Postup, 19-25 May) and  initially including 95 members (Silski Visti, 19 May).  Since  only 86 deputies were elected on the CPU ticket, this indicates  that some non-CPU deputies have joined up with the victorious  faction.  The CPU had so many members that it reportedly sent 11  to join the SPU's 14 to help the SPU reach the 25 minimum  (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 20 May).  SelPU formed an "Agrarians of  Ukraine" faction consisting of 37 members (Nezavisimaya Gazeta,  20 May), with former Agriculture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko as  its organizer (Post-Postup, 22-28 April).     Nationalist Democrats:  Nationalist democrats decided not to  revive the umbrella Narodna Rada group that had united most  nationalists and democrats in the old Supreme Soviet.  Narodna  Rada Chairman Ivan Zayets argued for renewing the coalition, but  Chornovil preferred to create a mechanism for working with the  Center and other factions to counter the left (Molod Ukrainy, 13  May) and also argued that having several reform factions would be  better than just one because each would have a representative in  the Supreme Soviet Presidium (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 18 May).  Rukh  formed a faction of 32, including members of the Christian  Democratic Party and DemPU, but not the URP (Ukrainian Weekly, 1  May).  A Derzhavnist (Statehood) faction was formed by the URP's  9 elected members, according to its leader Mykola Porovskyy  (Kyivska Pravda, 24 May), but has only reached 16 members  (according to the 19-25 May Post-Postup) or 19 members (according  to the 12 May Interfax).  A "Faction of Reforms" was formed by  representatives of Lviv's New Wave and former Rukh leader Serhiy  Holovatiy (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 18 May).*  According to another  account, "Reforms" was formed by rival economic reformers  Volodymyr Lanovyy and Viktor Pynzenyk, and joined by Holovatiy,  PDVU (Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine) leader Taras  Stetskiv, Union of Officers of Ukraine leader Hryhoriy  Omelchenko, and some KUN (Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists)  members, and Serhiy Sobolev became its "coordinator" (Post-  Postup, 19-25 May).  Molod Ukrainy on 13 May reported that  Lanovyy had formed a faction of entrepreneurs.     *Holovatiy was excluded from Rukh's leadership by Chornovil at  Rukh's mid-April congress (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 21 April).     Non-Nationalistic Democrats:  The Interregional Bloc for Reform  (MBR) led by Kuchma and Hrynyov formed a faction also calling  itself the "Center"-- the "Interregional Deputies Faction (MDF)-  Center" (Vecherniy Kiev, 28 April).  At a 5 May meeting of this  group, Kuchma announced that he would not support Durdynets for  chairmanship of the Supreme Soviet, and the faction decided to  put off a decision until MBR Co-Chairman Hrynyov decided whether  to run for this post (UNIAN, 6 May).  The group is small,  although various numbers have been cited for its size.  Hrynyov  in a 11 May Holos Ukrainy interview said it had 21 members,  Vecherniy Kiev on 28 April said 21, Vysokyy Zamok on 14 May said  20, UNIAN on 20 April said 26, but Chornovil claimed it is less  than 12 (Holos Ukrainy, 11 May).     A group of industrialists formed Yednist (Unity) under the  nonparty deputy Valeriy Babych, president of the "Ukrainian  Financial Group" (Post-Postup, 19-25 May) and appeared to play a  devious role in the struggle between the Center and the leftists.  Although they joined the Center-nationalist bloc formed to back  Durdynets (Post-Postup, 19-25 May), Yednist members may have  actually voted for the leftist candidates for Supreme Soviet  chairman and deputy chairmen.  Rukh on 25 May declared that  Yednist had joined the CPU-SPU-Agrarian bloc (Vecherniy Kiev, 27  May) and bitterly assailed it for helping lead a "communist coup"  (Nezavisimost, 27 May); a 27 May Nezavisimost account called  Yednist a "Trojan horse" that helped elect Socialist Oleksandr  Moroz chairman; and democrats complained that Yednist had been  shown special favor by the newly-elected leftist leadership,  receiving one more seat in the Presidium than it was entitled to  (UNIAN, 31 May).     Rightists:  Ultranationalists--Stepan Khmara's Ukrainian  Conservative Republican Party, the Ukrainian National Assembly  (UNA), and KUN--won too few seats to quality for a 25-member  faction, even assuming they could agree to work together (Post-  Postup, 19-25 May).  KUN, which had managed to elect 6 or 8  members,** announced that it would form its own faction of 16  (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 11 May).     **See the Trends of 20 April 1994, page 18.     The figures for the size of various factions announced by the  Supreme Soviet leadership have been going up and down.  On 17 May  Moroz announced that the CPU faction had 95 members, the Center  31, Rukh 27, and Yednist 27 (Interfax report in Krymskaya Pravda,  19 May).  On 26 May he declared that the CPU faction had 87  members, the Center 43, Agrarians 33, Yednist 27, Reforms 26,  Derzhavnist 26, and Socialists 25, while 41 were independents  (Interfax, 26 May).  This time he did not mention Rukh.  On 27  May the Supreme Soviet Secretariat listed factions as of that  day:  Communists for Social Justice and Democracy 86, Center 38,  Agrarians 33, Rukh 27, Reforms 27, "Interregional Deputies Group"  27, Derzhavnist 26, Yednist 26, Socialists 25 (UNIAR, 27 May).

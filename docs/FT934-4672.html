			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (4): Wall of money rolls on - US cash has driven world markets this year US investors, led by the country's ballooning mutual funds, have provided much of the cash that has fuelled stock and bond markets around the world this year. The question is now: when will this wall of money subside - and what effect would a reversal have on the more overheated of the 'emerging country' stockmarkets? The move by US mutual funds to direct a larger proportion of their cash flow abroad is the latest twist in the search for higher yields which began with the flood of cash out of money market instruments and into US stocks and bonds. The flow of money abroad in earnest, from both bond and equity funds, dates from the first quarter of the year. So far in 1993, US mutual funds have bought an average of Dollars 20bn a month of foreign financial assets, split evenly between fixed income and equity investments. After the post-1987 lull in foreign investment, this renewed interest has pushed up US holdings of overseas financial assets: total holdings of foreign equities reached Dollars 210bn at the end of June - twice what they were two and half years before, according to the Securities Industry Association. The demand has caused a rapid growth in some US-based mutual funds. Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual fund group, has seen its six-year-old international growth and income fund jump from Dollars 100m in March to Dollars 1bn now. It is all eerily reminiscent of the pre-crash market in 1987. Then, the perception that US asset prices had become over-inflated encouraged funds to look for value - and higher yields - abroad. The ebb and flow of interest of US investors in foreign markets is clearly seen in the rise and fall, and rise again, of some of the big foreign mutual funds. Assets in Fidelity's main overseas fund, for instance, reached a record Dollars 3.2bn in 1987, the year of the crash. By the end of last year, the fund had fallen back to just Dollars 700-800m. This year's renewed interest, though - and the rising value of assets held in the fund, in dollar terms - has doubled it again, pushing the level back up to Dollars 1.5bn. One difference from 1987 has been the fad for emerging markets. Last year, US investors bought a net Dollars 5bn of shares in emerging markets, up from Dollars 2bn the previous year, while total net foreign equity purchases remained constant at about Dollars 30bn. In the first half of this year, emerging markets purchases reached nearly Dollars 4bn out of a total of Dollars 20bn. Mutual funds have not been the first, nor the only, US investors to drive this flow of capital abroad. US pension funds have also been forced to become more adventurous in overseas investing, though foreign assets continue to account for only a small portion of their portfolios. Declining investment returns in the US and burgeoning liabilities have together forced the pension funds to be more ambitious in the search for returns. The pressure on pension funds is not restricted to those, mainly in the steel and auto industries, which have the biggest deficits - though the extent of the underfunding has reached gargantuan proportions. The deficit in the 50 weakest funds jumped from Dollars 29bn to Dollars 38bn by the end of 1992, and will have jumped by as much again by the end of this year, While General Motors grabs the headlines for its Dollars 14bn deficit (it expects this to become Dollars 24bn this year), the overall picture shows a general weakening in the financial position of US pension plans. In 1988, according to Buck Consultants in the US, 95 per cent of corporate pension plans had sufficient assets to cover obligations. By the end of 1992 the proportion had fallen to 76 per cent. Over the period the average funding ratio of US plans has fallen from 158 per cent to 135 per cent. The funding levels have fallen fast as US interest bond yields have come down (the yields provide the discount rates used to calculate the present value of the funds' future liabilities, so falling falling bond yields have boosted liabilities). Falling bond yields have also hit investment returns, putting further pressure on funds to be more adventurous in their outlook. But what would happen if Treasury bond yields continued to climb, in turn helping to stimulate a rise in the US dollar? The returns (in dollar terms) available in some of the emerging markets would look far less stellar, prompting a retreat by some investors. An appreciation of the dollar against the European (and perhaps Japanese) currencies would also make US assets more attractive again. And, given that the long bond yield fell to nearly 5.5 per cent this autumn, a level of 6.5 per cent or even 7 per cent may not look so bad after all. 'The US has become the fountain of liquidity for the world. One thing that will shut it off overnight is a good correction,' says Mr John Hickling, manager of Fidelity's overseas fund. The Treasury bond market's losses so far are more of a hiccup than a correction, he adds - but it is a movement that is already sending jitters through stockmarkets around the world.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- NET PURCHASES OF FOREIGN EQUITIES BY US INVESTORS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- January-June 1993                        Dollars bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- European Union                                  9.2 Other Europe                                    2.3 Canada                                          2.6 Latin America                                   2.3 Hong Kong                                       1.8 Japan                                           2.3 Other                                           1.2 TOTAL                                          21.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Securities Industry Association  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- NET PURCHASES OF FOREIGN BONDS BY US INVESTORS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- January-June 1993                        Dollars bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- European Union                                 23.0 Other Europe                                    1.3 Canada                                          7.7 Mexico                                          2.0 Other Latin America                            -5.3 Japan                                          -0.7 Other                                          -0.7 TOTAL                                          27.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Securities Industry Association  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

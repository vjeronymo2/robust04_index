			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Bunzl pulls out of food distribution in the US BUNZL, the packaging distributor, plastics and cigarette filter company, yesterday completed the closure of its Californian food distribution activity, a further step in reversing the group's ambitious expansion in the 1980s. The closure of Collins Foodservice and Corsaro Produce, which will eliminate losses of about Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 275,000) a month, is the most significant step taken by Mr Anthony Habgood since he became chief executive in August 1991. Mr Habgood said yesterday 'It was my decision to shut them down if there were no buyers by the end of November.' The group acquired the businesses in May 1987, paying a total of Dollars 40m, but will realise less than 20 per cent of that in shutting them: Dollars 4m from stock and fixed assets and several million dollars from outstanding trade debts. Within three years combined turnover had fallen by more than 20 per cent to Dollars 241m in 1990 producing losses of Dollars 7m. In the year before they were acquired they made pre-tax profits of Dollars 6m on turnover of about Dollars 300m and had net assets of Dollars 20.5m. Bunzl said that a full provision for the food losses had been made in the 1990 annual accounts and in the interims to end-June 1991. It did not expect the exit to generate further costs. The move into food distribution was one of several unsuccessful strategies in the past five years initiated by the previous chief executive Mr James White, who left in November 1990. Following its success in building a US network in paper distribution in the mid 1980s, and anticipating the maturity of that business, the group attempted to build US distribution networks in food, building products and electrical products. However, paper distribution has continued to grow strongly, in contrast to the diversifications. Financial constraints prompted the group to sell the electricals business in 1989, just two years after acquisition, although it realised a profit. Building products have been hit by the severe US housing and construction recession. Mr Habgood said: 'I'll certainly wait for much better economic conditions to assess the building products potential, and unlike the food companies, while they are not making money they are not bleeding.'</p>

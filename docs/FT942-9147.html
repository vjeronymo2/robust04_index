			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: JP Morgan to take Dollars 200m profit on sale J. P. Morgan is to take a profit of more than Dollars 200m from the sale of part of its stake in Columbia/HCA, the US's biggest private hospital group. Morgan said it intended to sell 6m shares in the group, out of a total of 21.1m that it owns. At yesterday's closing price of Dollars 36 1/2 - down Dollars 1 1/2 - the sale would raise Dollars 220m, a pre-tax profit of about Dollars 205m. The 1989 buy-out of Nashville-based HCA, then an independent company, is the most successful merchant banking deal undertaken by the US bank. Morgan paid about Dollars 50m for a stake which at yesterday's price was worth Dollars 770m. HCA was taken public again in 1992 at Dollars 21.50 a share and last year agreed to an all-stock takeover by Kentucky-based Columbia, which valued it at about Dollars 32 a share. The sale seems likely to be followed by a rapid disposal of Morgan's remaining stake in the hospital group. The bank declined to say whether sales were planned, but added: 'Like any investment in that (venture capital) portfolio, it has a life cycle.' Most buy-out investors hope to liquidate their holdings and realise profits within five years or so of making an investment. The HCA stake accounted for about two thirds of the Dollars 1bn of unrealised investment gains reported by Morgan at the end of last year. During 1993, it realised profits of Dollars 246m from selling equity holdings, Dollars 86m of it related to HCA.</p>

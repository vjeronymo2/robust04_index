			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-takers cut into share prices PROFIT-TAKERS finally moved into the UK stock market yesterday, taking their cue from the failure of the stock index sector to hold new highs and a reminder from BOC, the industrial chemicals group, of the pressures on corporate profits. Selling pressure increased in the second half of the session when early trading on Wall Street saw the Dow Industrial Average slipping away from the peak levels of the previous session. Some surprise was expressed that UK equities should weaken when the bond market was still very firm. Some traders suggested that a rights issue might be in the offing. But the general view was that profit-taking was hardly unexpected after the strong advance in the stock market over the past month. The two week equity account, which has brought substantial paper profits for investors, closes on Friday and there is every inclination to cash in early. The FT-SE Index closed down 14.8 at 2,971.6 Shares opened higher, on the back of Wall Street's overnight peak, and edged forward in early trading. However, equities went into reverse when the September future on the Footsie started the day with a sharp sell-off. At mid-morning, the scene brightened when the futures contract pushed to a new peak of 3,006 but it was soon clear that buyers would not support this level. Dealers said that it was underlying weakness in equities that pulled the future down, rather than the other way round, as is more often the case. The BOC trading statement for the third quarter, read by analysts as an effective profits warning, hit hard at the market's new-found optimism, and also emphasised the question markets still overhanging the currently generous valuations on which UK shares are trading. However, nothing seemed able to halt the upward pace of the FT-SE MId 250 Index which yesterday added another 7.4 to break through to a new peak of 3,406.8. Demand for second line stocks also showed itself in the pattern of turnover. Around 61 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 771.9m shares was in non-Footsie shares. On Monday, 525.3m shares through the Seaq network were worth Pounds 1.19bn in retail business, slightly below recent averages but still comfortably profitable for the market professionals. The Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin, which appeared relatively cautious on hopes for an early base rate cut, was not released until after stock market hours. This morning will bring the first reaction to the bank's report from retail and consumer issues, which were steady yesterday as optimism on interest rates was buoyed by Monday's consumer lending data. International stocks drew little benefit from Wall Street's strength, oil shares mostly giving ground on uncertainty towards crude oil prices. Reuters, the global financial data group, came in for severe profit-taking after talks between the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) and Reuters' Globex subsidiary were suspended. The pharmaceutical sector held up well in the face of cuts in drug prices. The financial share sectors remained dull as attention switched from the UK banks to the insurance companies which are now reporting on recent trading.</p>

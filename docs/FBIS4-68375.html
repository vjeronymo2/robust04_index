			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with I.Ye. Terekhov, chairman of the Committee </F> for Labor and Employment of the Novosibirsk Mayoralty, by Irina  Kamenskaya; place and date not given: "No Unemployed With Tenure  Have Been Detected"]    [Text] The mayor of the city has approved the Program  for Facilitating Employment of the Population in Novosibirsk. We  asked Igor Yevgenyevich Terekhov, chairman of the Committee for  Labor and Employment of the mayoralty, to comment on the most  fundamental aspects of this document.    [Kamenskaya] What changes have occurred on the labor market  in the last year?    [Terekhov] As of 1 January 1993, 6,500 unemployed were  registered in Novosibirsk, whereas as of 1 April of this  year--6,180. This is to say that the number of unemployed has  not been growing, despite a slump in production. This is  associated with employees of state structures going over to the  sector of private trade (200,000 people since 1992). In  addition, hidden unemployment exists, which in the event of an  abrupt deterioration of the economic situation might become a  destabilizing factor.    The social breakdown of the unemployed has changed. In 1993  we referred to engineers, technicians, and clerical employees.  At present workers account for 30 percent of those registered by  the Employment Center. There are still complications with the  placement of women in jobs. They account for 76 percent of the  unemployed. One-third of those registered are under 30. The  proportion of this age bracket is growing, as is that of people  who have not turned 18 yet.    [Kamenskaya] What is the outlook for the next few months?    [Terekhov] The law on mass layoffs currently in effect  envisions a certain financial load on enterprises in the event  of their releasing large numbers of employees. This is a  restrictive factor. People mostly quit at their own request,  substantiating this by delays in paying wages. Of the 60  enterprises of the city that we checked, wages have been paid on  time at only six as of now.    Reinforcements are expected in the youth labor market.  According to our projections, between 5,000 and 9,000 current  graduates of educational establishments will be concerned about  finding employment.    [Kamenskaya] Does the form of providing assistance to  unemployed depend on the situation on the labor market?    [Terekhov] Yes. Previously we restricted ourselves to  consultations at the Employment Center, whereas other forms of  work are also in use at present. Their objective is to encourage  self-reliance in those who are going through a difficult time.    Of course, a number of measures to alleviate the situation  of  unemployed young people are envisioned separately. These are  traditional forms: retraining, organization of public works, and  also new forms--for example, half a year of on-the-job training  for graduates of special secondary and higher educational  establishments, incentives for entrepreneurs to create jobs for  young specialists. We will prepare young people for commercial  activities: instruct them in marketing and familiarize them with  legal documentation. The plan is to provide financial assistance  to novice entrepreneurs. In addition, a mayoralty decree on tax  relief for this group of the population is being developed.    [Kamenskaya] Tell us briefly about retraining the  unemployed.    [Terekhov] We have not given up retraining. Last year 700  people were trained in 20 occupations; 90 percent of them have  been placed in jobs. To be sure, I will note that training costs  us four times more than payment of benefits.    [Kamenskaya] What is the vacancy situation as of today?    [Terekhov] There are about 4,500 vacancies in the city.  Engineer and technician cadres, clerical employees, and managers  of various levels are sought. However, for the most part these  are blue-collar occupations.    Here is an interesting fact: There are about 50 vacancies  for  those with the occupation of accountant in the city; at the same  time there are about 200 representatives of this profession  among the unemployed. What is going on? Employers are not happy  with their professional competence. As you can see, quality  requirements for labor are now greater.    [Kamenskaya] Do we have unemployed with a long tenure?    [Terekhov] On average one succeeds in finding a job in four  months.    [Kamenskaya] How much does this program cost?    [Terekhov] About 10 billion rubles, including the payment of  benefits and support for planned projects. The program will be  financed out of 2 percent transfers from the wage fund of city  enterprises and organizations.</p>

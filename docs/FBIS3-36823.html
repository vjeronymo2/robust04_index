Uzbek TV Provoked It Later On"]    [Text] Yesterday morning the Ostankino TV channel twice  went off the air on Uzbekistan territory. Subjected to  censorship were news bulletins which contained, among other  things, footage about Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's  visit to Tashkent. This scandalous fact is most eloquent  testimony to the results of the Russian-Uzbek talks, whose main  agenda item was the situation of the republic's Russian-speaking  population.    It will be recalled that a not very pleasant incident  occurred in Tashkent last November with the participation of the  same actors: Attempts were twice made to prove to Kozyrev that  the line at the Russian Federation Embassy did not include  Uzbekistan citizens. This time the minister, prior to the talks  with his Uzbek counterpart, deemed it prudent to meet with  representatives of the Russian community who had gathered near  the embassy gate. According to INTERFAX, his fellow countrymen  complained to the minister about the difficulties involved in  leaving the country and the impossibility of selling their  housing, also citing acts of discrimination.    The press statement that Kozyrev made at the end of the  negotiations sounds extremely flaccid [vyalyy] and is hardly  capable of instilling hope. "It seems that the element of  mutual misunderstanding has lessened," the minister told  journalists. "The problems are acute but we discuss them in a  constructive key, without mutual hysteria." Kozyrev also added  that he does not belong "among those statesmen who expect the  discussion of the issue of Russian-speakers' rights to generate  a scandal and who are themselves pouring fuel on the fire,  trying to gain some additional points." This text markedly  differs from the reciprocal eulogies that were heard two weeks  ago in Bishkek. In fact this is the limit of diplomatic  courteousness, which is usually followed by a protest note.  Confidential sources in the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry  say that the Central Asian leaders are exerting most heavy  pressure on Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev, considering his  position on the issue of dual nationality to be too soft. There  is every reason to believe that Islam Karimov is among such  leaders.</p>

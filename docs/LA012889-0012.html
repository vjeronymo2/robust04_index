			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SLUMLORD SENTENCED TO HOUSE ARREST  </P> <P> A convicted Los Angeles slumlord whom City Atty. James K. Hahn said has refused  to repair "inhuman conditions" in his run-down hotel was ordered to spend 45  days in the building under house arrest.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Municipal Judge Carol Boas-Goodson imposed the sentence on Aaron G.  Kempe, 63, of Beverly Hills after he admitted violating his probation from his  conviction last year by failing to upgrade conditions at the Stratford Hotel at  2629 W. 8th St.  </P> <P> Kempe was fitted with an electronic monitoring device that will allow  authorities to make sure he does not leave his first-floor room except for two  hours each day -- one hour to supervise repair work at the hotel, and a second  hour to attend religious services.  </P> <P> Kempe was charged last March with maintaining slum conditions at the  four-story, 93-unit brick hotel, including vermin infestation, defective  bathrooms, broken windows, defective smoke detectors, faulty plumbing and  damaged walls, floors and ceilings.  </P> <P> Kempe is the third Los Angeles slumlord to be sentenced to house arrest in his  own building.  </P></p>

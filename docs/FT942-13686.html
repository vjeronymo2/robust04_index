			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / International Company News: Banesto bidders fear the wild card - The contestants will place their offers on Monday Mr Emilio Botin and Mr Emilio Ybarra - respectively the heads of Banco Santander and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya - interrupted their family holidays at Christmas to hurry to the wood-panelled inner sanctum of the Bank of Spain. Their meeting with central bank officials was the starting pistol for a series of rapidly unfolding developments that by next week will have changed the face of Spanish banking and created a group that will rank among the biggest banks in Europe. Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, told the two bank presidents that Banesto, the most traditional and fourth largest of Spain's financial institutions, was on the point of bank-ruptcy and asked for their help. On December 28, Mr Rojo sacked Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's mercurial chairman, and appointed a team of BBV officials to reorganise the institution and put it up for sale. The rescue by the Bank of Spain and the rest of the domestic financial community absorbed some Dollars 4m in one of the biggest bank support operations ever mounted, On Monday, just before the Madrid market closes at five in the afternoon, Mr Botin and Mr Ybarra, will each send an emissary to the central bank with a sealed bid to acquire Banesto. For the two men, and Spanish banking as a whole, it will be a heady moment, the culmination of a momentous poker game. There is likely to be up to Pta240bn (Dollars 1.7bn) on the table. The cash bids are for 73.5 per cent of the reconstituted Banesto equity following a Pta180bn injection of capital as part the bank's rescue. Such bids represent a pricing of Pta500-Pta550 for Banesto shares against the Pta750 at which they change hands currently in the Madrid stock market. Neither Mr Botin nor Mr Ybarra are gamblers but both know enough about high stake games to fear the wild card in the pack. This is the third potential buyer in Monday's auction, Mr Francisco Luzon, a former senior BBV executive who now runs Argentaria, the partially-privatised state-controlled banking corporation. Price and only price, the Bank of Spain insists, will be the factor that will decide who wins Banesto. Because of this the eight member panel which will examine the bids is expected to announce the winner soon after they are delivered. Unless the government, fearing a political controversy, dissuades him, Mr Luzon is believed ready to dig deep into Argentaria's pockets in order to obtain Banesto. 'The price of Banesto is a different one for the different banks,' Mr Luzon said recently in an unguarded moment. Argentaria, which has a comparatively small retail network, is anxious to own Banesto's extensive branch empire while Santander covets its small town outlets. BBV has demonstrated its management depth as Banesto's caretaker and is determined to consolidate itself as the leading Spanish bank. Whichever bank takes over Banesto will become the indisputable reference point for banking in Spain. With Banesto on board, any one of the three will become by far the biggest domestic bank in terms of assets, loans, deposits, bank branches and funds under management. However, Banesto will sorely test its buyer. The acquisition of Banesto will weaken the capital ratios of the winning bank. According to IBCA, the London-based credit rating agency, a consolidation of Banesto at December 31 last year would have brought down Argentaria's return on assets to 0.40 from 0.74, BBV's to 0.44 from 0.80 and Santander's to 0.42 from 0.97. IBCA warned that it would consider downgrading whichever bank acquires Banesto. A succession of brokers have in the meantime switched their equity recommendations for the bidding banks to hold, and in some cases, to sell. Mr Luis Abril, one of the 10 officials seconded by BBV to run Banesto, says a 'huge management effort' will be required by whoever manages to win Banesto. The caretaker team, Mr Abril says, is 'handing over a bank that has been put together again and has a reasonable quality of assets'. The caretaker team projects that Banesto could be returning pre-tax profits of Pta8.6bn-Pta16bn by 1996 with strong growth thereafter. Some analysts believe these estimates to be too conservative. 'It is now a very clean bank, cleaner perhaps than some of those bidding for it,' says Mr Jose Sevilla of Madrid brokers FG.</p>

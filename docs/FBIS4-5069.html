			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["On Review of Performance of DPRK State Budget for 1993 and </F> State Budget for 1994" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- Deputy Yun Ki-chong,  minister of finance, delivered a report on the second agenda  item "On the Review of the Performance of the State Budget of  the DPRK for 1993 and the State Budget for 1994" at the  second-day sitting of the 7th session of the Ninth Supreme  People's Assembly [SPA] today.    Yun Ki-chong quoted the great leader President Kim Il-song  as  saying:    "Last year, while achieving one victory after another under  the party's leadership in the political and military  confrontation with the enemy, our people glorified the final  year of the Third Seven-Year Plan by displaying great  revolutionary enthusiasm and accelerating the construction of  the socialist economy."    According to the report, the state budget was successfully  performed last year with a great upswing in socialist economic  construction.    The total revenue of the state budget last year was  40,571,200,000 won, or 100.3 percent of the plan and 2.6 percent  up on the previous year, and the total expenditure of the state  budget was 40,242,970,000 won, or 99.5 percent of the plan and  2.4 percent up on the previous year.    As a result, the state budget last year was successfully  performed, leaving a financial reserve of 328,230,000 won after  fully meeting the increasing financial demands of various  sectors of socialist construction.    During the Third Seven-Year plan, the state budgetary  revenue  of the DPRK Government increased at the rate of 5.2 percent on a  yearly average, augmenting the total scale of the budgetary  revenue 40 percent.    Thus, the state budget in Korea has greatly contributed to  increasing the potential of the socialist independent economy,  developing socialist national culture, promoting the material  and cultural welfare of the people and bringing into full play  the advantages of Korean-style socialism. This eloquently shows  the great advantages and solidity of the state budget of Korea  developing in a planned way in reliance on the independent  financial basis and the validity of the financial policy of the  Workers' Party of Korea [WPK].    Last year, the DPRK Government increased the appropriations  for the national economy 2.5 percent as against the previous  year and markedly boosted the investments in the preferential  sectors of the national economy, the light industry and  agriculture.    The investments in the coal industry, the mining industry,  the power industry and the metal industry rose 3.5 percent  compared with the previous year.    The coal production capacity has grown remarkably with the  construction projects of new coal mines and new pits including  the Hwaphong coal mine of the Anju District coal mining complex  and the expansion projects of the existing pits promoted and  completed last year.    The Komdok general mining enterprise and other big promising  mines were expanded, with the result that the output of the  concentrates of lead and zinc and other valuable ores augmented.    The construction of the Kumgangsan and Yongwon power  stations  and other large-scale hydraulic power stations and thermal power  stations was promoted vigorously. The metal plants were  consolidated as self-reliant and modern metallurgical bases.    Last year the DPRK Government allotted to the light industry  vast amount of fund 4 percent greater than the previous year.    As a result, great innovations were effected in the  production of daily necessities in urgent need for the  improvement of the people's living standard.    The capacity expansion project of the Kusong textile mill  and  the construction projects of the March 4 factory, the Nanam  garment factory and other modern textile and garment factories,  shoe-making factories and food processing factories were  completed and the equipment of the light industrial factories  was streamlined energetically.    The large appropriations for rail transport last year was 3  percent up on the previous year. Heavy rails were introduced  and railway lines were modernised at an accelerated pace, and  the electrification of various railway sections and the laying  of new rails were completed, with the result that the rail  transport capacity grew considerably.    Last year the DPRK Government increased the investment in  agriculture 2.8 percent as against the previous year.    President Kim Il-song in his historic letter to the national  agricultural conference held on the lapse of 30 years since the  publication of "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our  Country" reviewed the great achievements made by our party and  people in the efforts to implement the rural theses. He  declared that with the realization of irrigation,  electrification and mechanization of agriculture, and with an  extensive application of chemicals in farming in Korea, the  historic task of the rural technical revolution set forth in the  socialist rural theses has been carried out in the main.    This is an epoch-making change in the countryside of Korea  and the most brilliant victory in the efforts to implement the  rural theses.    The material and technical foundations of agriculture were  strengthened and the chuche method of farming strictly applied,  with the result that bumper crops were reaped last year in spite  of unfavourable weather.    Last year, the DPRK Government channelled funds 1.5 percent  greater than the previous year into housing construction and the  management of towns and land.    The state increased the appropriations for scientific and  technological development 7 percent and those for education 3.5  percent last year as against the previous year.    More than 20 universities and colleges including  universities  of technology, agriculture and physical education made their  appearance last year.    The appropriations for various popular measures to further  promote the wellbeing of the people was increased in the last  year's state budget, granting them great additional benefits at  the expense of the state.    In our country where the tax system was totally abolished 20  years ago, the factory and office employees are supplied with  food almost free of charge at the expense of the state, the  universal free education and medical care are in force and  factory and office workers and peasants are given dwelling  houses free of charge. Billions of won were disbursed for these  policies last year, too.    During the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan, the WPK and  the DPRK Government invariably took various communistic, popular  measures for the people, not decreasing the huge financial  burden of the state even under the rapidly changing situation.  In this period, epochal measures were taken to raise the  salaries of the factory and office workers and technicians 43.4  percent on an average, largely increase the pensions of those  who benefit by social security and the scholarship of students  of schools at all levels and raise the purchase price of some  farm products including rice and maize so that the peasants  might earn a larger income share.    Last year, the DPRK Government directed 11.5 percent of  the total expenditure of the state budget to national defence to  firmly defend the security of the socialist motherland and the  gains of the revolution.    Today our military potential has become mighty enough to  drive back any provocation and surprise attack of the enemy.    Referring to the state budget for 1994, the reporter said:    This year's state budget has been made according to the new  revolutionary economic strategy shaped by the WPK in such a  manner as to concentrate the nation's financial resources on  implementing the agriculture-first, light industry-first and  foreign trade-first policies and giving priority to the  preferential sectors of the national economy and further  increase the might of the country's socialist independent  economy.    In the state budget the total revenue and the total  expenditure are equally set at 41,525,190,000 won, the former  2.4 percent up and the latter 3.2 percent up on last year.    This year, the DPRK Government will increase appropriations  for the national economy 3.2 percent as against last year, of  which a large amount of the state fund will be directed  preferentially to developing agriculture, light industry and  foreign trade.    The state is expected to increase the investment in  agriculture 6 percent and that in light industry 5.4 percent  above last year.    The state investment in the expansion and consolidation of  the export goods production bases will go up 4.1 percent above  last year.    This year's state budget envisages that the investment in  coal and power industries and railway transport will be  increased 3 percent and that in metal industry 26 percent as  compared with last year.    The DPRK Government will increase the appropriations for the  socialist cultural policies at 2.8 percent, those for scientific  development 4 percent and education 2 percent above last year.    This year, the government will increase the appropriations  for the popular measures so that the people may enjoy greater  state benefits in the form of free education and medical care,  the upbringing and education of children at the expense of the  state, social insurance and social security, etc.    This year, too, it will send a large amount of educational  aid funds and stipends to Korean children in Japan.    It will allocate 11.6 percent of the total expenditure of  the  state budget to national defence to consolidate the defence  capacity of the nation in face of the enemy's war provocation  moves.    The reporter said this year's state budget submitted for  deliberation at the SPA was a chuche-based, defendable budget  that definitely guarantees the fulfilment of the vast tasks of  the economic construction set by the party with domestic  financial resources in reliance on the solid foundations of the  socialist independent economy. She also said it was a popular  and revolutionary budget that will help improve the material and  cultural living standard of the people, increase the might of  the country and bring the advantages of Korean-style socialism  into full play.</p>

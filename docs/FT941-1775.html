			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Key Bundesbank rate falls The Bundesbank yesterday sanctioned another drop in the key securities repurchase rate, from 5.88 per cent last week to 5.80 per cent. But the independent DIW institute for economic research said in its weekly report that the central bank's tentative interest rate cuts were prolonging Germany's recession and causing unemployment to rise more sharply than would otherwise be the case. The institute said there was room for lower interest rates because unit labour costs fell seasonally in 1993 and were likely to fall again in 1994. It also questioned the reliability of M3 as a guide for the central bank's monetary policies. The institute said the high interest rates would also 'choke off' the next economic recovery and prevent prolonged growth.</p>

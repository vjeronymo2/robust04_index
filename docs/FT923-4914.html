			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Knightsbridge plan approved A PROPOSAL for a new shopping and office complex covering four acres of Knightsbridge has won planning permission from Westminster City Council. The project - comprising 308,000 sq ft of shops, 737,000 sq ft of offices and 27 homes - is likely to cost more than Pounds 300m. The scheme will mean the demolition of all buildings on the site, which is near Harrods, the department store. Prudential, the life assurance group which owns most of the site, does not expect to complete the project for at least five years.</p>

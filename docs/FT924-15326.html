			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (8): Appeal of the cordless office - Telecommunications SOMETHING usually goes wrong when you leave your desk and rely on a secretary or a colleague to take telephone messages. If you get a message at all, the chances are you will be given the wrong number, the wrong name, a confused message, or one that comes a day too late. If people could take their phones with them about the workplace, the problems would not arise. And the use of mobile or cordless telephones would have the added benefit of saving time and money for the telecommunications manager who currently has to rewire the office each time staff are relocated. The appeal of a cordless office has not escaped the attention of telecommunications equipment manufacturers such as the UK-based GPT and North American companies Motorola and Northern Telecom who have been developing cordless telephone products for the past two to three years. This involves the development of both cordless telephone handsets and office switches, known as a private automatic branch exchanges (pabx), that can route calls to and from people using the cordless handsets. Until now, telecommunications managers have been somewhat sceptical of cordless office products. This is largely because they rely on the same technology, called CT2, as the mobile telephone service known as telepoint. Handsets designed for the cordless office are the same as those for telepoint services and can also be used as cordless telephones in the home. CT2 got off to a bad start because the three telepoint services that were launched in the UK in 1989 have all since closed because of their failure to capture subscribers. Misplaced marketing strategies were partly behind their demise, but another factor was the poor functioning of the equipment. Unless business users can be guaranteed a quality of service that at least matches a wired telephone system, it seems most unlikely that they would opt for a cordless system for use in the office. But telepoint, and CT2 products generally, are being given a second chance. Whereas the first telepoint operators used proprietary CT2 technology with the result that products for different services were incompatible, all telepoint services in future will be based on a European standard. In Singapore and Hong Kong, telepoint services based on this standard have been launched within the past few months and are already proving to be more reliable and popular than the original UK services. Users have also been sceptical about cordless office products because suppliers have been talking about the systems they are developing since 1989 but have been slow to bring out products. The first products are, however, now beginning to appear. GPT launched its GPT 2030 cordless system in the UK in April and will bring out more sophisticated products for larger offices at the end of this year and early next year. GPT is hoping that Mercury will become a main distributor for its cordless systems. Motorola, the US mobile communications equipment manufacturer, is supplying its Silverlink cordless office systems through UK telephone equipment distributor Rocom while the Canadian manufacturer Northern Telecom will be launching office systems in 1992 and 1993. Northern Telecom systems will be distributed by BT which already sells its wired telephone systems. Japanese companies including Sony, Matsushita and Kokusai are all keeping a close eye on the market with a view to developing their own products. Initially, cordless office products will be significantly more expensive than conventional office systems and of more limited use. Mel Ziziros, a senior consultant at MZA, a specialist communications consultancy, says that the cordless systems currently on the market are at least double the price of conventional fixed systems. But Gl'T Mobile Systems marketing manager Bichard Field, says that GPT is only now ramping up to volume, and as costs come down, GFT will re-evaluate its pricing. In this respect, the success of cordless office products is tied with the fortunes of telepoint. If telepoint is successful, handset prices for both telepoint and cordless office systems will fall as manufacturers derive economies of scale. Nevertheless, GPT believes that users will be prepared to pay a premium for cordless products because of their advantages over wired systems. This view is shared by Ziziros who reckons: 'Once the price differential comes down to 25 per cent, it will be an entirely different ball game.' The GPT 2030 system is only suitable for a few users because the system can connect only three exchange lines and manage, therefore, three simultaneous conversations. More advanced CT2 cordless office products will support as many as 20 or 30 simultaneous conversations, but manufacturers recognise that it will not be possible to develop bigger systems using CT2 technology. This means that CT2 cordless office systems will only be suited to small offices, or for a certain category of office worker such as maintenance staff in bigger companies who tend to spend most of their day moving between different departments or floors. For large offices, manufacturers are developing systems using another European standard known as the digital European cordless telephone (Dect) system. Manufacturers such as Sweden's Ericsson or Siemens of Germany that have backed the Dect standard believe that they can develop cordless telephone systems for whole office blocks, and that eventually there will be no need to wire offices. But the European standard for Dect was only approved this year and the first demonstrations of Dect products will not take place until 1993. Tony Warwick, Motorola's director of cordless systems, believes it will be a further two years until Dect products are launched commercially. There are different views on whether cordless office systems will ultimately mean that the wiring of offices becomes a thing of the past. Ziziros is confident that 'most systems will ultimately be cordless.' But users are less clear about the future. John Skarrat, director of the UK Telecommunications Users Foundation, says that 'radio is always going to have problems with interference' and that users will remain convinced that it is better to stick to conventional cable. Dick Cawdell, director of telecommunications at the Grand Metropolitan leisure group, thinks that cordless office products are interesting because they will remove the need for rewiring. This causes particular problems for Grand Metropolitan whose head office is in a listed building. Nevertheless, Cawdell recognises that the risk of replacing wired systems with radio means that 'wired offices are not going to go away.'</p>

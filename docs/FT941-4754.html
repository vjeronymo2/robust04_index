			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Christopher's mission imperfect: A look at a difficult visit to Beijing by the US secretary of state Such is the fragile state of Sino-US relations and the high stakes involved that Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, arrives in Beijing tomorrow just a day after China's annual parliamentary session convenes. Normally, foreign envoys would be discouraged from visiting during this two-week period in early spring when 3,000 delegates to China's parliament gather in the Great Hall of the People, but Mr Christopher's is no ordinary mission. The US official, who has met his counterpart, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, three times since last year will try to engage the Chinese further on a range of issues, while at the same time warning them of the seriousness of the human rights issue. Judging by the recent spate of arrests of prominent Chinese dissidents, Mr Christopher faces significant difficulties in his efforts to persuade his hosts that such persistent harassment threatens renewal of China's preferential trading status in the US. More to the point, argument over human rights risks undermining the Clinton administration's attempts to broaden its links with Beijing that followed a decision last September to halt the 'downward spiral' in relations. Washington's Pacific strategy, based on enhancing the role of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum with China as a key partner, may also be jeopardised. Not least of the regional issues in which China and the US have a vital interest is that of trying to ensure that the simmering argument over North Korea's nuclear ambitions does not boil over in a way that might destabilise the Korean peninsula. A rupture over human rights could also threaten a booming commercial relationship that saw two-way trade exceed Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27.3bn) last year, with the balance heavily in China's favour. The World Bank estimates that 96 per cent of China's exports to the US are covered by preferential tariffs. Mr Christopher was understandably exasperated in remarks to reporters in Canberra this week when he observed that China was 'going in the wrong direction' on human rights. Indeed, he was reported to have even canvassed the possibility of abandoning his Beijing visit in protest at the recent arrests. Chinese officials remain confident, however, that in the end Mr Clinton will feel obliged to renew China's most favoured nation trading status. This calculation - American officials worry about China under-estimating the strength of US sentiment on human rights - may in part explain Beijing's playing 'hardball' on the eve of the visit. 'The Clinton administration will renew China's MFN status because of the pressure of different groups in the US who have a vested interest in China's enormous market,' said a senior Chinese adviser on US policy. 'However, from now until June, there will be a process of hard barg-aining.' A possible complication for Mr Christopher and Chinese leaders during their talks in the next few days is that, with parliament in session, no official will want to be seen adopting a quiescent attitude in what are certain to be difficult discussions. US officials should steel themselves for some sharp exchanges. The US has prepared carefully for the Christopher mission with several visits recently to Beijing by Mr John Shattuck, the assistant secretary of state for human rights. He spelled out American requirements for MFN renewal to meet the criteria of 'overall significant improvement' laid down by Mr Clinton. These include access to prisons for the International Committee of the Red Cross, an end to prison-made exports to the US, the further release of dissidents, human rights improvements in Tibet and steps toward making it easier for Chinese to emigrate. The US could hardly have done more to improve relations since its decision last September to 'engage' China. Apart from Mr Clinton's meetings in Seattle with President Jiang Zemin in November, a succession of senior administration officials have passed through Beijing, including Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, and Mr Charles Freeman, an assistant secretary of defence. Indeed, defence co-operation is high on the agenda for Mr Christopher's visit. The secretary's party includes Mr Frank Wisner, undersecretary of defence for policy, who is scheduled to stay on in Beijing next week to discuss ways in which defence relations may be upgraded. Among various options being considered are expanding co-operation in peacekeeping and disaster relief operations in the Asian region, and the establishment of a Joint Commission of Defence Conversion to facilitate exchanges on converting military factories to civilian use. This will be the highest level visit by a US defence official since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. All this is a long way from the angry exchanges that followed Washington's decision last August to impose sanctions on the transfer of high-technology items to China in retaliation for the export of Chinese components to Pakistan for the M-11 missile. China denied that it had contravened guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTRC). The episode marked something of a nadir in Sino-US relations. Mr Christopher will be anxious to avoid another downward spiral, but equally the US will want to see some early dividends, especially on human rights, from its policy of constructive engagement.</p>

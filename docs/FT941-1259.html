			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Private finance planned for Codelco Non-core divisions of Codelco, Chile's state copper company, will be allowed to raise private finance and to form joint ventures if proposals put forward yesterday by Mr Juan Villarzu, Codelco's new president, are accepted. Mr Villarzu said non-copper divisions, such as the 530MW Tocopilla power station, would be able to raise finance through flotation of shares or the issue of bonds. This would allow Codelco to concentrate on exploiting, refining and selling copper, he said. To recovery efficiency, lost largely during the military regime, Codelco would need to increase its annual investment budget to Dollars 400m-Dollars 450m, to be spent primarily on the expansion of Andina and the start-up of Radomiro Tomic. Mr Villarzu set targets for the year 2000, which he said were 'tremendously demanding' but 'achievable'. These were: to cut output costs to 50 cents a pound from 69 cents; to raise productivity by 8 per cent a year to 80 tonnes of copper annually per worker; to halve the accident rate; and to spend 15 per cent of the annual budget on improving Codelco's patchy environmental record. To sharpen Codelco's management structure, Mr Villarzu confirmed his intention to allow divisions to operate autonomously under the umbrella of a holding company. He also said he wanted to change the 'anomalous' role of the board of directors which currently has little control over the day-to-day running of the company. Codelco would no longer speculate on metals futures, Mr Villarzu said, but would continue to use the market to cover risk. Mr Juan Pablo Davila, the former trader accused of losing Codelco Dollars 206m, was charged earlier this week with defrauding the state.</p>

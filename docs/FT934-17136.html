			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Audiences squeezed out Sir, Re your article 'The men of violins fight for the loot: The future of London's orchestras' (September 25), surely one of the main reasons for the falling off of the Royal Festival Hall's audience is the extreme discomfort of the seats for anyone 5ft 10in tall or above. There is far too little knee room. Go the new Birmingham hall and experience the difference. L A Pirie, Coombe Cottage, West Meon, Petersfield, Hants GU32 1NB</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Tougher regulation of BT satellite business urged THE SATELLITE business of British Telecommunications would be subject to more detailed regulation under proposals published yesterday by Oftel, the telecommunications regulator. Under Oftel's plans, BT would have to publish a financial statement covering the activities of the division, which is responsible for selling satellite capacity to rival operators. BT would be barred from seeking investment contributions from other operators. The move marks a further extension of regulatory pressure by Oftel, coming after a series of recent proposals to make the company more open to its competitors. The review of existing arrangements between BT and other companies offering satellite links concerns the provision of satellite capacity with Intelsat and Eutelsat - satellites funded and operated by consortia of state telecommunications companies. Three years ago BT established a 'signatory affairs office' to give independent satellite service operators access to capacity. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said: 'The proposed changes will help create the right conditions for greater competition in the UK satellite service market, which will mean a wider range of innovative and keenly priced services being made available to customers.' He said the new arrangements would give competitors 'confidence' in the signatory affairs office, 'although as the satellite consortia move towards direct access for capacity the role of the SAO will naturally diminish'. BT welcomed the plans but said it needed to consider the implications of some of the regulatory proposals.</p>

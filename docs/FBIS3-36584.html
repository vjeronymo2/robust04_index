			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 25 (515) for 7 </F> February 1994]    [Text] Russian and Belarusian experts have ended a  three-day meeting at a government retreat outside Minsk by  narrowing differences on the four main directions in a mechanism  for creating a monetary union between Russia and Belarus, one  senior negotiator told Interfax on condition of anonymity.    These include a mechanism of account-settling, budgetary  problems, the rate of exchange of the Russian and Belarussian  currencies and a single price system.    Unlike Moscow which insists on a single budget, Belarus  wants  to hold back to its own budget because of fearing to forfeit its  sovereignty.    It was agreed that the Russian and Belarusian currencies  would be exchanged at a one-to-three rate for non-cash  operations and a one-to-one rate in cash settlements. (In a  formal letter to the Belarusian government, the IMF recommended  a 1:2.5-3 rate of exchange. IF). The agreed rate of exchange  is not final being subject to substantial change, the negotiator  said.    Nor was there any final agreement reached on uniform price  policies. But preliminary counts indicate Minsk will inevitably  have to sustain part of the cost for the maintenance of Russian  army bases deploying long-range nuclear weapons there if a  monetary union deal is signed.    Contrary to local expectations, Russian Prime Minister  Viktor  Chernomyrdin, who was due to arrive in Minsk next week to sign a  package of agreements on the monetary union, was unlikely to  arrive there until February 18, the official said.</p>

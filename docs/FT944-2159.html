			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Wrapped up in cable: Tony Jackson previews the explosion in home TV services How many TV channels can you handle? If you are British, you may get by quite happily with four. If you live in parts of New York, you could be faced with 150. If that seems daunting, a new system shown this week in the town of Orlando, Florida, by the US media giant Time Warner is calculated to terrify. In this system of the future, the number of channels is theoretically limitless: hundreds, thousands or even millions - as many channels as the system has users. The immediately striking part of the new system - installed on a test basis in a handful of Florida homes - is so-called video on demand. Suppose you want to watch the film Basic Instinct. You call it up with your remote control, press the button and it starts immediately. If the phone rings, you stop the film. If you get to a boring bit, you skip forward or rewind. As Time Warner's chairman, Mr Gerald Levin, told reporters in Orlando on Wednesday, the aim is to do everything a conventional video recorder can do, without having to go out and rent the video. In itself, that is a trivial improvement. But it has profound implications for home entertainment services. The system works by storing films in a kind of digital warehouse, from which they can be instantly recalled. Just as the whole contents of the Library of Congress could eventually be stored digitally for access by computer users, so a system like Time Warner's could ultimately contain every film ever made. The system also contains home shopping. Conventional US home shopping channels, such as QVC, offer products at the times the broadcaster decides. If the channel is showing DIY goods when you want children's toys, hard luck. The Time Warner system takes you into a mock-up of a shopping mall and walks you around. When you get to the right store, you press the button and go in. The Chrysler showroom shows you the latest models; for technical details, press the button and they appear from the printer next to the TV set. Go into the post office, and you can order a book of stamps to be delivered with your mail the next morning, or ask for a postman to pick up a parcel within three hours. Or take video games. The system has the usual state-of-the-art arcade games, where you roam around corridors shooting at things. But it also lets you play games with other people. Wednesday's demonstration in Orlando offered the curious spectacle of the chairman of Time Warner playing a hand of gin rummy with a family on the other side of town. As Time Warner insists, all this is merely illustrative. Nobody knows what kind of services consumers will want, or how much they will pay for them. Now the system is set up, it will be used as a test-bed. Over the coming months, up to 4,000 homes will be plugged in, and their inhabitants watched like laboratory rats. Early in the new year will come news on demand: if you arrive home 10 minutes late for the six o'clock news, you can still call it up from the beginning. Next will arrive sports on demand, music and educational services. As Time Warner says, the applications are practically limitless, at any rate in theory. The printer can provide you with a catalogue, a theatre ticket or an individually compiled home newspaper. It all depends on what people want. The answer to that will also determine whether Time Warner has wasted a great deal of money. The project was first announced early last year, and is badly behind schedule. It has also been roundly condemned in parts of the US press as an unaffordable white elephant. At Wednesday's grand-scale demonstration, the sense of relief among Time Warner executives as the system went through its paces was almost palpable. The project may lack believers, but at least it works. How much money is at stake is a matter for conjecture. According to Mr Levin, Time Warner will invest Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3bn) in round terms over the next five years. But as he is also careful to point out, most of the money would have been spent anyway in upgrading its existing cable network. As a result of competitive pressure within the cable industry, Time Warner and its rivals are already investing heavily in broadband networks, based on optical fibre, which will provide a better version of their existing service. This technology has as its by-product an enormous increase in capacity. Much of the innovation by the cable companies is an attempt to put that spare capacity to work. The next step is to take on the telephone companies. From the middle of next year, Time Warner will be using its fibre optic system to provide a local telephone service to businesses in the Orlando area (it is already doing this in New York). Eventually, when the regulations that currently prevent cable companies from offering telephone services more widely permit, it will do the same for the general public. And, of course, the telephone companies will be moving into cable. In the early stages of this revolution, the new services demonstrated this week will be no more than the icing on the cake. Mr Levin candidly admits he does not know how successful they will prove. 'There are so many opportunities that I'm not smart enough to know what they are,' he says. Or, as a colleague puts it, 'even if the big winner is a business nobody's thought of yet, that's OK. It'll still have to come down the broadband pipe.' Two central questions remain. First, as the explosion of channels is duplicated across the nation, what will be found to fill them? Second, the average American family spends a great deal of its time in front of the TV set already. How much time will families have to spend to feed the monster which is being created? The first question is probably a matter of timing. The growth in distribution channels has been so sudden that it has outpaced the ability of the entertainment industry to supply it. But American popular culture is robust, and many of the entertainment giants are scrambling to catch up. The second question is less certain. Already in parts of the US, the only observable form of life is the car, shuttling between the shopping mall, the school and the office. In time, the TV could render even the car redundant. If Orlando is the future, the American's home could end up not so much his castle as his prison.</p>

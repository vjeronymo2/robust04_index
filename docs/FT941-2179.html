			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banks near accord on FFr13bn Euro Disney rescue plan The Euro Disney banks are expected formally to approve a FFr13bn (Dollars 2.25bn) rescue package for the stricken leisure group within the next few weeks. Lenders representing more than 50 per cent of its FFr20.3bn loans have already agreed to participate. Euro Disney last Monday announced that Walt Disney, its US parent company, had secured an outline agreement with its banks for a restructuring plan that would enable a reduction in its net debt to FFr10bn. This was on condition that the banks agreed to an 18-month interest holiday. A senior banker within the Euro Disney loan syndicates said yesterday that every bank on the steering committee that negotiated the restructuring had already agreed in principle to support it. Several banks outside the committee have also signalled approval. The consenting banks include: Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Agricole and Banque Indosuez of France, Barclays and National Westminster of the UK, and Deutsche Bank of Germany. Caisse des Depots, the state-controlled French financial institution, has already publicly stated its support for the rescue. The steering committee is negotiating with the other members of the 63-strong syndicate to try to secure their consent. 'So far, no-one has actually said 'no',' said the banker. It is common in such large corporate restructurings for a few small lenders to object to the terms of the deal. However, the terms of the Euro Disney rescue do not require any of the banks to provide extra capital. It is also understood that the steering committee, chaired by BNP and Indosuez, is empowered by its mandate to accept an agreement on behalf of all the banks. The committee is believed to be willing to exercise that right as the package has already secured so much support. Walt Disney, which is bankrolling Euro Disney, has been pressing the banks to finalise the rescue as quickly as possible. However the legal process is expected to take a few weeks, and will not be completed in time for Disney's original March 31 deadline.</p>

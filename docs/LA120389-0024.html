			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> A LABOUR PARTY: Hollywood isn't the only place that has sequel-itis. Reggae  dynamos UB40, whose 1983 album, "Labour of Love," went platinum after "Red Red  Wine" became a pop smash last year, return next week with (you guessed it)  "Labour of Love II." The collection features a host of new versions of reggae  and soul chestnuts, including the Rascals' "Groovin," Al Green's "Here I Am,"  the Temptations' "The Way You Do the Things You Do" and the Chi-Lites' "Homely  Girl." Expect a big U.S. tour in March. . . . Johnny Clegg and Savuka's new  album, which is due out early next year, will be titled "Cruel Crazy Beautiful  World." . . . Bryan Adams is still in the studio working on his new album --  he's switched producers from Steve Lillywhite to Mutt Lange. . . . Are you  ready for Debbie Gibson's (!) autobiography? That's right -- the 19-year-old  popster (who's preparing to make her movie debut in "Skirts") has just  published her life story, titled "Between the Lines."  </P></p>

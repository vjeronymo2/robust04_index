			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Letter: Myth and whimsey surrounding VAT and food Sir, The debate in your pages on VAT, which prompts Mr Ben Patterson to write to you (Letters, October 22), is in danger of perpetuating the widely believed myth that food in Britain is zero-rated. Although you refer, in one of the articles he mentions ('VAT headache', October 13), to the zero-rating of 'many' rather than 'all' foods, I suspect very few of your readers realise that in their average spend at a superstore, having excluded all non-food purchases, they will have paid about 6 per cent VAT. British consumers were seriously misled by the stirring Europhobic tones of Mrs Thatcher when she said 'I shall never put VAT on food]' They would be amazed by the reality as the table shows. The list is endless. Perhaps the most whimsical decision relates to frozen yoghurt: if it requires defrosting before eating it is zero-rated but if it can be spooned when frozen it bears VAT at 17.5 per cent. The consistency and the logic of the current system could have been devised by Lewis Carroll. We should recognise the reality of the situation and - like the French with their 5.5 per cent VAT on all food - apply a uniform rate. The processes of harmonisation are not helped by our arcane habits.

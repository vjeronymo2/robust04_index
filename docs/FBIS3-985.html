Addressing a rally at Mothibistad near Kuruman,  Mr. Modise said the target was not homeland government's but the  government in Pretoria. He said victory would be claimed after  President F.W. de Klerk had been removed from power.    The office of the kwaZulu chief minister says the ANC  alliance and certain trade unions will not succeed in sowing  distrust between kwaZulu public servants and the kwaZulu  government. The kwaZulu government said allegations of misuse  of pension funds were untrue as it paid the pension  contributions of kwaZulu public servants to the South African  Government on a monthly basis for investment.</p>

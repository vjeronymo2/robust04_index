			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Survey of Mid Glamorgan (3): Cleaning up the town - Urban regeneration FOR THE best part of two centuries, a vast unsightly mound known as the Georgetown tip has dominated the centre of Merthyr Tydfil, 'capital' of the valleys of south Wales. Over the years, it has become covered by scrub, bushes and the detritus of modern life. The tip is iron ore, industrial despoil from when Merthyr was the undisputed iron town of the world. Today, bulldozers are working flat out to remove the tip and create land which can be turned to creative use. What is happening in Merthyr is not unique. Throughout Mid Glamorgan, indeed across the whole of Wales, urban improvements are being undertaken. Partly, the reason is commercial: to create the sort of conditions that would appeal to inward investment. Partly, though, it is also an acceptance that people in towns which prosperity has only lightly touched are equally entitled to live in pleasant surroundings. The government, acting through the Welsh Development Agency, has an important programme of urban regeneration schemes for Wales. Last December Mr David Hunt, the former Welsh secretary, announced a Pounds 28.4m package of urban aid in the present financial year for 228 projects, 10 more than last year. A third is going to what Mr Hunt called 'the most deprived parts'. Mid Glamorgan qualifies under that heading. Schemes in Caerphilly, Pontypridd, Tylerstown and Tonypandy in the Rhondda, and the Cynon Valley as well as Merthyr have been backed. In Caerphilly, car parking and what the bureaucrats call 'traffic calming' are to be supported. In Cynon Valley, largely Aberdare and Mountain Ash, road schemes, business development and general environmental projects are being backed. In the Rhondda an important investment is to take place at the heritage park, once a large colliery. Footpaths, car parks, commercial developments, wash-and-brushups for shops and factories, landscaping, pedestrianisation projects and relief roads have or are all being backed. General responsibility for these projects has been delegated to the WDA, although they are all joint ventures between the agency, the government and the local authorities, often with participation from the private sector. David Farnsworth, director of urban development at the WDA, is in charge of the programme. He emphasises that the essential characteristic of the programme is a joint venture among all concerned. Beyond that, though, he believes the agency is pioneering a new form of approach. 'What we are doing is undertaking an all-Wales programme, an approach that is almost certainly unique in Europe. We want to help each town find its niche in the new economy that is emerging here,' he says. 'Urban regeneration has never been seen positively before. It has always been something undertaken in reaction to a set of events, a reaction to industrial despoilage, to personal deprivation, to environmental shortcomings. Now, our programme is about the way ahead. 'The key to our approach lies in effective public-sector management. It is not about money, though that is certainly needed. It is about public management. 'The traditional approach to the management of towns has been to spend money on a problem when it arises. But towns are complicated market places that succeed as a result of their ability to attract the investment that will provide jobs and economic uplift. 'The Welsh urban programme is attempting to change traditional approaches so that opportunities become the most important factor in the equation. This means that instead of taking a departmental approach, as town halls have invariably done in the past, looking at roads for instance through the eyes of the chief engineer, we want to see the town as a whole. 'Because we at the agency are outside, though close to, the nexus of local and central government we can stand back and reconcile traditional differences between Whitehall and the town hall. Internecine arguments between these centres of government put off investors and so create potential harm for a town's future.' The European Commission was sufficiently impressed by this approach to call David Farnsworth to Brussels at the end of March for a meeting with DG 16, the regional directorate. 'The commission felt our approach represented a model for other parts of Europe,' Mr Farnsworth says. 'Consequently, the EC wants to talk to us again about aspects of our programme which could be used as a model for other parts of the community. They are keen for us to package our concept of public-sector management in a way that can be used by others.' Meetings behind closed doors in an office in Brussels may seem a long way from what is happening at the Georgetown tip in Merthyr Tydfil. Looked at from the other side, though, the bulldozers in Merthyr represent the active end of a policy the European Commission thinks might be equally applicable in Lombardy or Navarre. Certainly, the urban programme being led by the WDA is seen as a priority by the agency's board. This year it will be investing some Pounds 30m alongside partners in 32 towns across Wales. That sum represents about a fifth of the agency's budget. Four years ago, when David Farnsworth arrived at the Cardiff headquarters of the agency, that budget was just Pounds 4m. 'We have found a way of using money effectively which is to the benefit of the whole economy,' he says. 'Effectiveness is the current buzzword. It's what the Americans call the big bang for the buck. It is bringing together resources, perspectives, energy and ideas.' It is, and always will be, he insists, a joint approach, a joint venture between all the partners associated with any urban community.</p>

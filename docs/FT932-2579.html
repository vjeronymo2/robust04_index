			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Trade deficit spurs US growth call THE Clinton administration yesterday demanded more expansionary economic policies in other industrialised countries following figures showing that the US ran a trade deficit of more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) for the second month running. Mr Ron Brown, Commerce Secretary, said the unexpectedly large April deficit reflected faster growth in the US than in Europe and Japan, which needed to do more to promote domestic growth. 'Large trade surpluses among our trading partners are indications of unfulfilled opportunities for economic growth, just as our own trade deficit demonstrates we are helping to trigger global economic expansion,' he said. The figures seem certain to exacerbate trade tensions between Washington and Tokyo as more than half of the shortfall was in trade with Japan. The Clinton administration is pressing Tokyo to open its markets more fully in order to curb the growing bilateral deficit, which rose to Dollars 53bn in the year to April. The overall deficit of Dollars 10.5bn in April was much larger than analysts had predicted and indicated a similar-sized deficit in March may not have been an aberration as previously assumed. The poor figures may prompt analysts to revise down growth estimates in the second quarter to an annual rate of 2-2.5 per cent. Exports fell 1.3 per cent between March and April to Dollars 38.4bn, reflecting economic weakness in many of the US's main trading partners. Imports fell 1 per cent to Dollars 48.9bn, but remained at a disturbingly high level given the sluggish recent pace of economic growth in the US. The longer-term trends are not enouraging. In the three months to April, US imports rose 12.6 per cent relative to the same period last year. Exports grew only 2.8 per cent over the same period. The underlying monthly trade deficit could be as high as Dollars 9bn, pointing to an annual deficit of more than Dollars 100bn, according to Mr Geoffrey Dennis, a New York-based economist for James Capel, the stockbroker.</p>

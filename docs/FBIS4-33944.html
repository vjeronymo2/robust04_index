			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 9  June.    Beginning in February, the Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo  stock  market operations experienced a sharp drop. The Sao Paulo stock  market suffered losses in real value unit terms of 20.95 percent  in April, while the Rio de Janeiro stock market lost 22 percent  during the same period of time. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in  Portuguese 27 May 94 p 21)    Compared to the same month in 1993, when it totaled $902  million, the April trade surplus increased 56.98 percent and  totaled $1.416 billion; exports totaled $3.635 billion and  imports $2.219 billion. Exports accumulated over the last 12  months have reached the historic level of $38.931 billion, and  imports $26.537 billion. Trade volume, i.e. the two operations  added, totaled $65.468 billion in this period, with the balance  a surplus of $12.394 billion. Compared to March, exports  increased by 8.4 percent, imports dropped by 4.4 percent, and  the balance increased by 37.4 percent. Compared to 1993, during  the January to May period exports increased by 1.8 percent, from  $12.284 billion to $12.514 billion; imports increased 12.03  percent, from $7.356 billion to $8.241 billion; and the balance  surplus decreased by 13.29 percent, from $4.928 billion to  $4.273 billion. Trade volume in the period totaled $20.775  billion, which is 5.68 percent higher that the $19.64 billion  registered in 1993. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in  Portuguese 2 Jun 94 p B11)    The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, IBGE,  has reported that the May inflation rate in Sao Paulo and Rio de  Janeiro totaled an average 44.11 percent, which is 0.59 percent  lower than in April. In Sao Paulo the Broad Consumer Price  Index totaled 44.32 percent, and in Rio de Janeiro 43.52  percent. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1727 GMT 3 Jun  94)    The Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Ministry closed on 29  April an investigation into "dumping" charges against imported  Greek canned peaches. The investigation was requested by the  Pelotas Union of Fruit and Preserves Industries in October 1993.  A lawsuit was opened one month later, and in December a 44  percent tax began to be collected on these imports. Brazil will  now have to return the tax collected from December 1993 to  April, as the government has recognized that this is its second  mistake regarding "dumping" charges. The first was with  reference to the alleged dumping of EC powdered milk imports.  International trade adviser Adimar Schievelbeing insists,  however, that the Greek peaches reach Brazil at the price of  $0.40 per can, while the price in Greece is $1.22. (Sao Paulo  GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 6 Jun 94 p 5)    Implementation of the real will result in the closure of 188  Bank of Brazil branches in the interior of the country. In  addition to being permanently in deficit, these branches are  located in towns where most of the banking operations are  concentrated in branches of the Federal Savings Bank and of the  Northeast Bank. The strategy for closing the branches will be  gradual, but will have to be concluded by November. (Brasilia  Radio Nacional da Amazonia Network in Portuguese 1000 GMT 7 Jun  94)    According to data reported by the Foreign Trade Secretariat,  Brazilian oil imports from January to March totaled $504 million  FOB (Free on Board). This represents a 32 percent drop compared  to the same period in 1993. Brazilian oil imports in April  totaled $151 million FOB, i.e., 57.3 percent greater than in  March, when the oil imports totaled $96 million FOB. Compared  to April 1993, when products totaling $153 million FOB were  imported, there has been a 1.3 percent drop. (Sao Paulo FOLHA  DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 7 Jun 94 Section 2 p 2)    As a result of exports and foreign investment, $3.62 billion  have entered the country so far this year. This sum is  equivalent to more than the overall amount in real cruzeiros  currently in circulation. In April the amount totaled only  $2.82 billion, but investment in the stock market this month  alone totaled $710 million net. Despite reports of the  suspension of foreign investment in the stock market in March  and April, figures show that $295 million were invested in March  and $415 million in April, and that no net foreign capital left  the market during these months. Trade operations -- exports  minus imports -- reached in May the record level of $3.02  billion, although in April they totaled only $2.61 billion.  These figures, however, do not reflect the amount of exported  products, but investment made in the futures market. The  financial balance surplus in May totaled $610 million, while the  total in April had been $45 million. The best level, however,  was obtained in January, when it totaled $1.15 billion. Foreign  reserves currently total $38.2 billion, and less than $9 billion  will be used to guarantee the real. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO  PAULO in Portuguese 7 Jun 94 Section 1 p 4)    Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero reported to the Rural  Democratic Union congressional bloc on the morning of 8 June  that a study conducted by Anfavea, the Applied Economic-Social  Research Institute, indicates that the agricultural sector will  grow 6.6 percent this year. He said that Anfavea data confirm  this, and show an increase of 90 percent in the sale of tractors  and of 70 percent in the sale of agricultural machinery on the  domestic market. Ricupero also explained that the price of  agricultural produce has remained 25 percent above the average  price for the last 60 months, and that the Treasury has already  allocated almost $1 billion to the sector this year, although  the entire amount allocated last year was only $1.2 billion.  The government plans to allocate a total of $2.6 billion to the  sector this year. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1720  GMT 8 Jun 94)    During the first five months in 1994 the car manufacturing  industry produced a record number of 630,825 vehicles: 475,776  of them remained in the domestic market, and 148,913 were  exported. Luiz Adelar Scheuer, president of the National  Association of Automotive Vehicle Manufacturers, said that by  December 1.5 million cars will have easily been manufactured in  the country. He criticized, however, the government decision to  increase interest rates before implementing the new currency.  He said this will divert money from production into investment.  (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1720 GMT 8 Jun 94)    The number of cars sold on the domestic market in May  increased by 18.5 percent compared to April, and totaled 111,483  units. Compared to the same month in 1993, this number increased  by 24 percent. This number includes the sale of Brazilian-made  cars, of cars assembled in the country, and of cars imported by  companies affiliated to the Brazilian Association of Automotive  Vehicle Importing Companies, Abeiva. (Sao Paulo GAZETA  MERCANTIL in Portuguese 8 Jun 94 p 1)    A poll conducted by the National Confederation of  Industries,  CNI, the results of which were announced by its President Mario  Amato, indicates that competition with imported products has  forced Brazilian entrepreneurs to improve their quality control  and rationalize production. The opening of the national market  to imported products has made companies reduce costs, increase  productivity, and improve technologies. Nearly 80 percent of  the interviewed entrepreneurs, who work for 1,136 different  companies, said that the opening resulted in greater  productivity and lower costs. Forty percent of them, however,  believe there has been an increase in the number of products  being dumped, or sold for prices lower than those in the  countries from which they were imported. Nearly 70 percent of  those interviewed, however, pointed out that profitability has  decreased. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2106 GMT 9  Jun 94)    An IBGE poll conducted from 30 April to 30 May indicates  that  the Expanded Consumer Price Index rate, which reflects the  behavior of prices for families with earnings from one up to 40  minimum wages, in the month of May increased by 44.03 percent.  According to the National Consumer Price Index, which considers  families living on one to eight minimum wages per month, the  inflation rate totaled 42.73 percent, 0.13 percent less than in  April.

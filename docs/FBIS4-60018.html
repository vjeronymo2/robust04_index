			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in </F> Tunis, by Shihatah Abu-al-Majd in Cairo; date not given; from  the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] Dear Arab brothers, peace be upon you.  The Arab and Islamic nation is celebrating two happy occasions:  The blessed 'Id al-Adha and the return of the Palestinian  people and the Palestinian authority to their land. Your  Excellency President 'Arafat: Congratulations to the  Palestinian people on these two occasions. Perhaps we should  start with a word to the struggling Palestinian people and the  Arab and Islamic nation.    ['Arafat] First, I thank you very much for giving me this  good chance to speak through the Voice of the Arabs, the voice  of the Arab nation, in these blessed and holy days. Within  hours, God willing, Muslims will pray on 'Arafat Mount [in  Mecca] and we hope that prayers will soon be held, God willing,  in holy Jerusalem, the first of the two qiblahs [direction in  which Muslims turn to pray] and the third of the holy shrines,  the city to which Prophet Muhammad, may God's peace and prayers  be upon him, journeyed, and the cradle of Jesus, peace be upon  him.    As we mark this occasion, the Palestinian police force has  entered Jericho and Gaza, from which the Israelis fully withdrew  hours ago. Gaza and Jericho became the first liberated  Palestinian territory over which the Palestinian flag was  raised. And it is the first over which Palestinian authority is  being exercised since the beginning of this century. This  signifies much and indicates many things, not only on the  political, national, and pan-Arab levels, but on the level of  history and the region as a whole.    I must note the good efforts of my brother President  Muhammad  Husni Mubarak, who, using everything in his power, helped us to  advance this process. The blessed efforts of President Mubarak  and my other brothers in Egypt were crowned by the agreement we  signed in Cairo under his patronage and supervision.    [Abu-al-Majd] The main question now is: When can the Voice  of the Arabs speak with Your Excellency in Jericho, the land of  Palestinian authority now, so that we can all rejoice in your  return and you can assume your duties among your kin and in your  homeland?    ['Arafat] Soon, God willing. We hope that in June we will  contact you either from Gaza or from Jericho and I will speak  through the Voice of the Arabs, which is dear to me and to all  your mujahid Palestinian brothers.    [Abu-al-Majd] Many tasks await you. You must have prepared  plans and programs to carry out these tasks in Gaza and Jericho  first. Can we hear of these tasks and plans, which are designed  for the wellbeing of the Palestinian people?    ['Arafat] We have received 38 tasks, that is, the  responsibilities in Gaza and Jericho. Now we are assuming  between five and seven other responsibilities in the West Bank  and, God willing, we will begin talks immediately after 'Id  al-Adha on all the arrangements concerning the West Bank. We  hope the talks will be held in Cairo. You must be patient with  us. I am sure my brothers in Egypt tolerate us. But, after all,  this is what you expect from brothers.    [Abu-al-Majd] Naturally we were pleased to see the  Palestinian people retrieve their rights in Cairo, Egypt, a  country that loves Arabism and the struggle for its nation and  bears the burden of its causes. You met Israeli Foreign  Minsiter Shim'on Peres in Oslo recently and reports indicate  that you agreed to pursue negotiations on implementing  Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip, the Jericho area, and  later in the West Bank. What are the most important tasks that  you are expected to assume in the West Bank and when will the...    ['Arafat, interrupting] There are at least five to seven  tasks concerning basic fields, such as education, health,  tourism, social affairs, work, culture, taxes, and possibly some  security issues. Then we must agree with them on redeploying  their forces outside cities and populous areas on sites to be  agreed upon on 15 July. This is a very important point.    [Abu-al-Majd] When will the Palestinian elections take place  within the framework of the National Authority?    ['Arafat] Following the Israeli forces' redeployment and  withdrawal from residential areas in the West Bank after their  complete withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, we are supposed to  initiate measures for elections on our Palestinian land, God  willing.    [Abu-al-Majd] What are the features and dimensions of the  future Egyptian-Palestinian political and economic cooperation  from the security, national, and pan-Arab points of view?    ['Arafat] Let me tell you something. This Palestinian body  cannot but be connected with its Arab nation, especially the  loving brothers in Egypt and Jordan, its two close neighbors.  We are linked with the Arab nation. Our true supporter is the  Arab nation. It was no coincidence that the political  negotiations were held there and the handover of authority and  the entry of forces into our liberated land began from these  places. It is no coincidence that the Egyptian experts provided  us with great help in the economic talks, because we needed this  Egyptian expertise as well as the expertise of our Jordanian  brothers, who supported and extended help to us through their  experts. Nothing can happen except through our agreement and  reliance on this warm Arab lap on every level.    [Abu-al-Majd] The international community has promised to  give you 2 billion [currency not specified] over five years  after the launch of Palestinian self-rule. And we know that the  Gaza Strip and Jericho are suffering a severe lack of economic  potential, especially when it comes to the infrastructure. Have  any of these promises been made good or is there at least a  contingency plan to begin ...    ['Arafat, interrupting] We have submitted a snap contingency  plan worth $590 million to the World Bank. The donor parties  are scheduled to meet on 1 June to look into this plan, which  was agreed upon in principle in the previous Paris meeting.    We need a concerted effort, not only with the World Bank and  donors, but with all our friends and brothers, because what we  need is great, very great. Don't forget that all our  infrastructure has been destroyed by the Israeli occupation and  we must start from scratch in every area. This is a great  effort and it requires huge resources but we are confident that  our Arab nation and friends throughout the world together with  the Palestinian people's resources can prove themselves and  confront all these important responsibilities that we shoulder.  "And we wished to be gracious to those who were being depressed  in the land, to make them leaders (in faith) and make them  heirs, to establish a firm place for them in the land" [Koranic  verses].    [Abu-al-Majd] When will the names of the Palestinian  Authority members be announced?    ['Arafat] We have announced 17 names. God willing, we will  announce most of the remaining names within a week at most.  This is because we will leave some names unannounced until the  picture becomes complete. We might announce another three or  four names. God willing, the first meeting of the National  Authority, that is, the first Palestinian ministerial meeting,  will be held next week. Portfolios and responsibilities will be  distributed during this meeting.    [Abu-al-Majd] Will the meeting be held in Jericho or Tunis?    ['Arafat] It could be held in Jericho or elsewhere.    [Abu-al-Majd] But will all the PLO institutions move with  you  to Jericho or will some remain in Tunis?    ['Arafat] Only the political department will remain abroad.  The remaining institutions will gradually move inside.    [Abu-al-Majd] Why the political department?    ['Arafat] Because the Palestinian National Authority is  represented in foreign relations by the PLO. It cannot  establish diplomatic representation except through the PLO.    [Abu-al-Majd] Discussing the Arab situation, we do not  forget  the regrettable events in Yemen. These events naturally affect  us all. What is your view of the situation in Yemen and will  you undertake an initiative to solve this crisis?    ['Arafat] I have been in constant touch with my brothers the  Yemeni leaders in the past 48 hours. I have left my telephone  number with my brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih so that he  will contact me as soon as possible. We will do our best to  stop the bloodbath in Arab Yemen.    [Abu-al-Majd] While we are on the phone between Cairo and  Tunis, we ask Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to address the Arab and  Islamic nations.    ['Arafat] I want to remind my brothers of something. Once, a  Soviet leader asked me: After you leave Beirut, where will you  go? I told him: To Palestine. God willing, my brothers and I  will go to Palestine. "On that day the believers shall rejoice.  With the help of God, he helps whom he will. And he is exalted  in might, most merciful." [Koranic verse] Verily, God told the  truth.    [Abu-al-Majd] At the end of this interesting dialogue with  Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine, we say:  Thank you very much. Thank you.    ['Arafat] My good wishes, thanks, and congratulations to my  brother struggling President Husni Mubarak and to the Egyptian  people and to my brothers in the whole Arab nation.</p>

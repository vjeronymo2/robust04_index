			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] La Paz, 28 Mar (EFE) -- The Bolivian Government  today denied statements by former Bolivian President Jaime Paz  Zamora, who claimed investigations into his alleged ties with  drug-trafficking activities had "political designs" and were  "malicious" in nature.    The Special Force for the Struggle Against Drug Trafficking  [Fuerza Especial de Lucha Contra el Narcotrafico -- FELCN] has  disclosed evidence indicating that Paz Zamora received and  obeyed instructions from alleged drug trafficker Isaac "Oso"  Echevarria. The FELCN also reported the alleged ties of several  leaders of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) with  drug-trafficking activities during Paz Zamora's administration  (1989-93).    In a short communique, the Ministry of Social Communications  said, "The FELCN investigations against several MIR leaders are  not political in nature and, instead, result from the law's  mandate."    In a message to the nation broadcast Saturday night, Paz  Zamora asserted, "it seems this case is being given perverse  treatment." He also said that the charges against him were  "ill-intentioned" and attempted "to cause political damage and  slander the dignity of the people."    The government, however, said, "actions have to be carried  out in the future by the Judicial Branch and, in some cases, by  the Legislative Branch," to clarify the charges. Regarding Paz  Zamora's "irrevocable resignation" announcement saying that he  would withdraw from politics, the Social Communications Ministry  said this is Paz Zamora's "personal decision" and that the  people will be the ones to assess judge it.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AGENCY FORCED FERRUZZI TO TRIM SOYBEAN HOLDINGS  </P> <P> The Chicago Board of Trade, engaged in a bitter fight with a giant Italian  agricultural firm over a possible attempt to corner the soybean futures market,  revealed Thursday that federal regulators had separately ordered the Italian  company to reduce its soybean contract holdings.  </P> <P> The order caused the loss of millions of dollars for Ferruzzi Finanziaria  S.p.A., an Italian company that held contracts calling for delivery of 23  million bushels of soybeans, far more than the actual supply of available  soybeans in warehouses totaling about 10 million to 12 million bushels.  </P> <P> The company claimed that it was buying big supplies of actual soybeans, and  contracts for deliveries of millions of bushels more, for use by its Central  Soya subsidiary, which makes soybean products.  </P> <P> Karsten Mahlmann, the Board of Trade chairman, said Thursday that regulators at  the Commodity Futures Trading Commission decided on the morning of July 11 to  order a reduction of soybean holdings to 3 million bushels. The action applied  only to Ferruzzi, which had a special exemption from normal trading limits.  </P> <P> Mahlmann's revelation came as a surprise to the members of the House  Agriculture conservation and credit subcommittee. Wendy Gramm, the Commodity  Futures Trading Commission chairman, told the subcommittee earlier this week  that she had been in contact with the Board of Trade during the current  controversy. But she made no mention of her own agency's moves against  Ferruzzi's position in soybeans.  </P> <P> Kate Hathaway, CFTC spokeswoman, said Thursday that there was no intention to  mislead. She acknowledged that the agency had revoked one firm's special  exemption allowing larger than normal trading activity. But she refused to  confirm that Ferruzzi was the firm mentioned.  </P> <P> "On Tuesday we did not comment on this letter or other actions we had taken  because the market was still trading," she said. "We feared that disclosing any  action would have a market effect." Mahlmann testified on the last active day  for July soybean contracts, after the market had closed, she noted.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the soybean futures contract for July dropped 59 cents a bushel  Thursday, closing at $6.88, 55 cents below the price on July 11, when the Board  of Trade ordered traders to reduce their contracts to no more than a million  bushels. In issuing their order, Board of Trade officials presumably feared a  squeeze in the market by Ferruzzi. Each contract obligates the holder to buy or  sell 5,000 bushels of soybeans for delivery at a future date. Ferruzzi had  accumulated a huge position, with contracts to purchase more soybeans than  actually existed.  </P> <P> Persons who had contracts to sell soybeans would be unable to meet their  obligations since Ferruzzi held so much of the supply, and presumably would be  able to dictate the terms of any financial settlement from the sellers.  </P> <P> The board ordered that all soybean traders reduce their holdings to no more  than a million bushels by Thursday, the date of expiration for the July futures  contract.  </P> <P> Ferruzzi has sued the Board of Trade, arguing that the order to reduce  contracts changed the trading rules and caused the company big losses by  driving down the value of a futures contract. Foreign investors were reportedly  worried that the board's action indicated discrimination against non-American  players in the volatile commodity futures business. Mahlmann defended the  board's action in ordering the soybean contract reduction. The step  "dramatically enhanced the credibility of the board," demonstrating that an  individual market participant "is not bigger than the market itself," he told a  news conference after testifying at the congressional hearing.  </P> <P> Both the CFTC and the Board of Trade are watching the August futures market  with some apprehension. There are open contracts for August delivery of more  than 80 million bushels of soybeans, compared to supplies of 12 million bushels  in warehouses.  </P> <P> Hathaway of the CFTC said: "We are completely aware of the market situation and  who is in it." She refused to discuss whether Ferruzzi is under restrictions.  "It is an active market, and we are not able to talk about specific actions,"  she said.  </P></p>

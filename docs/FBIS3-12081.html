"I believe all Guatemalans should be pleased with the  progress made in the negotiations process," the head of state  said on Radio "Sonora."    De Leon explained that he cannot express any opinions  concerning the agreement because he pledged not to do so during  the talks. Only the UN moderator, Frenchman Jean Arnault, can  provide details.    Nevertheless, he emphasized that "considerable progress has  been made" with the signing of the general agreement on human  rights which excludes the Truth Commission, which was formed to  investigate violations of individual guarantees throughout the  34 years of the armed conflict.    The president said that he and the Armed Forces High  Command,  which he also heads, have been in permanent contact with the  National Commission for the Consolidation of Peace (COPAZ)  presided over by Hector Rosada, examining each of the points as  they were agreed upon.    "We have been fully informed, and we ought to be pleased  because considerable progress has been made," de Leon stressed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent N. Nedosekina from Pskov; from the "Vesti" </F> newscast]    [Text] Pskov has become the first oblast in Russia where  the Latvian Republic has opened its consulate. This is not  accidental. The whole state border between Russia and Latvia  goes through Pskov oblast.    A lot is being expected from the new consulate. It will make  it possible for people who have been suddenly divided by state  borders to preserve kinship and friendly ties. In the past one  had to travel from the border to St. Petersburg to get a visa.    Strengthening economic contacts between Russia and Latvia is  another important thing. Around 40 joint ventures are operating  in Pskov oblast alone.    Today's event is the first sign. Estonia's consulate and an  office of the Russian Foreign Ministry are to be opened in Pskov  in the future.</p>

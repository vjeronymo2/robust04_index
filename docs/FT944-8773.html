			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Property: Signs of life on the sites - Activity is picking up but financing remains a problem The chill wind of recession sent property developers into hibernation, and the warm glow of recovery has brought them blinking back into the light. Land Securities, the largest quoted UK property company, this week announced that it was gearing up its development programme. It plans to spend Pounds 350m over the next two to three years, its biggest burst of development activity since the late 1980s. Smaller developers are also starting to stir, including some notable figures from the past. Mr Godfrey Bradman, former chairman of Rosehaugh and one of the biggest casualties of the bust, is now operating from offices overlooking Regent's Park. Yet the development climate is hardly balmy. As the graph shows, planning permission has been granted for an additional 13.6m sq ft (1.26m sq m) of office space within the City of London. Of this, more than 7m sq ft (630,000 sq m) covers sites which are currently empty and waiting for work to start. Yet during the first six months of this year construction started on only 1.7m sq ft, only a shade more than in the same period of last year. The reason for the modest pace of activity is that rents are too low and property yields too high to give developers a clear profit. For example, with top City rents at Pounds 35 per sq ft and new office developments being sold forward to investment institutions on yields of 6.5 per cent, a 30,000 sq ft development might have a finished capital value of about Pounds 15.5m. Yet building 30,000 sq ft of office space for much less is difficult, unless the developer has bought the site cheaply. The following hypothetical example assumes that the developer has paid about Pounds 175 per sq ft for the site. This is not unreasonable, given that one core City site is rumoured to have changed hands for Pounds 250 per sq ft last week. Land cost: Pounds 175 per sq ft + building costs: Pounds 130 per sq ft + professional fees: Pounds 25 per sq ft x 30,000 sq ft = Pounds 10m capital value. So far so good, except that the developer needs to finance the project. Awareness of the risks and uncertainty about the outlook mean that banks are extremely wary of financing speculative developments. 'There is only a handful of banks willing to look at speculative development projects and they are understandably discreet about it,' said Mr Peter Champness, partner at surveyors Gerald Eve. Only big property companies such as Land Securities can attract sufficient bank loans to finance large speculative development programmes. Smaller developers are forced to rely on investment institutions such as pension funds and life insurance companies. Small, independent developers also recognise that speculative projects financed with bank debt expose them to very high risks. At this early stage of recovery, most would anyway prefer to share the risks with an institutional partner. Under this type of funding arrangement, the developer usually agrees to sell the finished building to the institution at an agreed yield. If the property market weakens during construction, it is the institution rather than the developer which suffers. The pay-off is that the institution gets the building at a higher yield than it could be sold for on the open market. Our hypothetical City office block could probably be sold for 5.5 per cent on the open market, yet the institution is paying 6.5 per cent as part of the funding agreement. The details of an institutional funding package could be complex. But if the developer arranges finance over a four-year period at, say, 2 percentage points over base interest rates, an all-in funding cost of about Pounds 3m-Pounds 3.5m would be about right. It is also likely that the developer will have to contribute to fitting-out costs for the tenant, in which case another Pounds 1m will have to be set aside. In total, the hypothetical office block has cost the developer Pounds 14.5m to build and fit-out. Since the institution is getting the finished building cheaply, this leaves a development profit of less than Pounds 1m, or about 5 per cent of the capital value. Such calculations explain why development activity is still muted. Either rents need to rise or property yields need to fall before many projects become viable. Moreover, institutional appetite for development finance is limited. Even large pension funds cannot afford to have more than a few speculative schemes in hand at any one time. Smaller funds are often wary of getting involved with development activity at all. One reason is that fund managers have historically seen poor returns from development. Figures from the Investment Property Databank, a research group, show that development activity has been a drag on the performance of institutional investors in 14 out of the past 19 years. Only in the period from 1983-87 did development actually enhance investment returns from commercial property. Unless this changes, the flow of institutional development funding will be steady rather than spectacular. Fund managers are also likely to demand good terms from developers, which will keep development margins under pressure. Much therefore depends on whether banks start funding speculative development projects again and whether the developers themselves feel confident enough about the outlook to proceed without an institutional partner. In the current climate, with little sign of rental growth and uncertainty about the economic prospects, the banks have no reason to rush back into the market. Developers point out that the debt-financed development peak of the late 1980s was unusual. Previous property cycles were funded by institutional investors rather than banks. The extent of over-building was far less severe as a result. While the pace of development activity is sure to pick up as rents rise and more projects become viable, there are signs that developers will have to rely far more on institutional finance. If that holds back the pace of development until tenants are ready to fill the space, the property market will be healthier for all concerned.</p>

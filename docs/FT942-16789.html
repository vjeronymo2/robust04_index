			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / People: Laurentian Financial Group After more than a year without a chief executive, Laurentian Financial Group, of which the main element is a life assurance company, has appointed Roland Ward to the post. In the months following the departure of Paul Seymour, Ward and three colleagues jointly ran the business, reporting record profits of Pounds 7.3m in 1993. The board then decided to choose the chief executive from among the four; remarkably, at present the other three have decided to stay with the group. 'We have a very good relationship - it could have gone to any of the others,' Ward says. He sees a big task for Laurentian, and for the life industry in general, to win the trust and confidence of the public; earlier this year Laurentian Life was fined Pounds 70,000 by its regulators for serious rule breaches, including a failure to ensure sales agents gave best advice to investors. For Laurentian in particular, Ward also believes it will be important to develop innovative products, in areas such as protection, since it cannot compete with leading companies in the sector in terms of size. He comes from a banking background, having been with bank of America before becoming deputy chief executive of The Mortgage Corporation when it was set up in the late 1980s. While there, he was approached by Laurentian, which he joined in 1992 as group finance director. He is succeeded in that post by Michael Tallet-Williams, finance director of Laurentian Life.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: The week ahead ANALYSTS are on Monday expecting annual pre-tax profits of about Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m from Lucas Industries, the motor components and aerospace group, compared with Pounds 22.5m last time. This year's total will be flattered by about Pounds 12m of disposal profits. Trading continues to be tough and some fear the dividend may be cut. The City will also be interested in what the group has to say about its search for a chief executive, which has become something of a soap opera. Interim results to the end of August from Body Shop, the natural cosmetics and toiletries retailer, are expected to show pre-tax profits of Pounds 9m to Pounds 9.3m, against Pounds 8.3m last time. The UK is likely still to be depressed compared with a relatively good first half last year. The US contribution will be affected by currency translation, although stores in the region are expected to have traded well. Highland Distilleries is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits on Monday of about Pounds 39m, including Pounds 10m from the change to equity accounting of its 35 per cent stake in Robertson &amp; Baxter, the whisky distiller. At the trading level, profits are likely to show a near-10 per cent increase to Pounds 24m, with continuing benefits coming from Remy Cointreau's distribution of Highland's Famous Grouse whisky. On Tuesday St Ives, the UK's largest independent printer, is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 22m, slightly ahead of last year's Pounds 21.1m. The results will be the first since Miles Emley took over as chairman from Robert Gavron earlier this year.</p>

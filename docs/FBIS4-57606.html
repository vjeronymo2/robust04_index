			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 22 May (DPA) -- More than 1,000  Haitians gathered today in a vigil, rejecting the new economic  and commercial embargo, almost a total embargo, imposed against  the ruling military in Haiti.    The demonstrators, who termed the event a nonpartisan show  of  patriotism, were flanked by military security patrols, a safety  measure never before offered to exiled President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide's supporters.    A witness said the demonstrators shouted chants against  foreigners. The chants are evidence of an increasing negative  sentiment against foreigners, confirmed by several expatriates  as the deadline for the enforcement of the new measures  approaches. Several foreign news teams had reportedly been  arrested and detained for a few hours by the Haitian police in  recent days.</p>

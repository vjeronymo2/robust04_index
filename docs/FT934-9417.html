			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (15): Cost of credit is still too high after privatisation - Banking THE EUPHORIA that followed the privatisation of Mexico's 18 state-owned banks has come to an end. Last year and the year before Mexico's business elite paid out Dollars 12.4bn for the banks - paying around 3.1 times book value - in the belief that the economy would grow by at least 4 per cent a year, and the financial sector by twice that. The rosy forecasts have turned out to be too optimistic. The economy is almost stagnant, loan losses have increased sharply, and the banks have had to increase their provisions. Profitability, while still high by international standards, has begun to fall, as measured by a return on assets or equity. The private sector, which had hoped privatisation would cut funding costs, has complained about the persistently high spreads between lending and borrowing. The government has responded by authorising nine new banks this year, and seems set to authorise several more next year. The troubles in the banking sector have already provoked a shake-out. Three financial groups have merged: Banca Cremi and Banco Union, two multiregional banks; Bancreser and Banoro, a multiregional and regional bank; and Afin and Banorte, a brokerage and bank. Other mergers, or alliances are expected. Bancomer and Banamex, Mexico's two largest banks, are undertaking sweeping changes to make themselves more competitive. Mr Ricardo Guajardo, chief executive of Bancomer, says Bancomer will reduce staff by 6,000 out of a total of 40,000 this year, but net cuts will be deeper, because slow economic growth has reduced by about half the numbers of new branch openings. The banks will face still more pressure next year when Mexico is expected to allow foreign competition. If Nafta is agreed by the US Congress, US and Canadian banks, and other foreign banks with subsidiaries in the US and Canada, will be permitted to set up branches over 10 years. If Nafta is not approved, Mexico will still open up, probably in the form of bilateral investment treaties. 'It is in the interest of Mexico to have financial intermediaries from abroad,' says Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the under-minister of finance in charge of banking regulation. While foreigners are not expected to open many bank branches, they will probably cherry-pick the most profitable segments in the corporate and retail sector. Under present law, foreigners in the aggregate are allowed up to 30 per cent of a financial group, which may increase to 49 per cent under the new foreign investment law. So far the Bank of Nova Scotia of Canada has taken a 5 per cent stake in Comermex-Inverlat; Spain's Banco Bilbao-Vizcaya a 20 per cent stake in Mercantil-Pobursa; and Spain's Banco Central Hispano a 20 per cent stake in Prime-Internacional. The banks are in trouble largely because they have little experience in lending to individuals and businesses. In the 1980s, the banks lent most of their money to the public sector and hardly anything to the private sector. Now the public sector has largely stopped borrowing, while credit to the private sector has exploded - up 327 per cent from 1989 to 1992. While spreads are higher on private-sector loans, so is the chance of default. With the economy stagnant, growing numbers of companies and individuals have stopped paying their debts. Net past due loans as a promotion of net loans increased from 0.71 per cent in December 1991 to 4.37 per cent in June 1993. The banks contend that the high rate of default forces them to keep interest rate spreads high. Contrary to expectations, the Mexican bank's net interest margin has increased since privatisation, from 5.61 per cent in 1991, to 6.56 per cent in June 1993. Some steps are now being taken to help banks analyse risk more efficiently. The government recently passed new laws that will allow banks to share the credit history of customers. This should help them to avoid making loans to customers with a history of default. A new national credit bureau, the product of a joint venture between Mexican banks and specialist US credit companies, is being set up. The banks are investing tens of millions of dollars in improving computer systems. The banks say that still further de-regulation is necessary before interest spreads fall. Mr Roberto Hernandez, chief executive of Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, urged the authorities at the Bankers Convention in September to reduce obstacles to banks' use of derivatives, international emission of peso bonds, and external funding. 'Foreign bankers are arriving in our country proposing schemes in a few days that takes us several months to receive authorisation for,' he said. 'It is urgent that the authorities allow the banks to act with more liberty in the definition of operations, assets and liabilities.' Mr Hernandez launched into an attack on Mexico's legal system, that he said made it difficult to recover collateral. 'The implementation of justice is not always agile and efficient,' he said. 'All kinds of subterfuges are used to delay trials. The judicial processes frequently last for years. And when they are resolved, the (bank) guarantees have lost significant value.' Mr Guajardo of Bancomer complains that it can take three years or more to win a settlement in the case of a mortgage default, and that the law is not clear on ranking of creditors. He says these problems can add 2.5 to 3 percentage points on the cost of credit on mortgages and to small- and medium-sized businesses, and leads banks to insist on more collateral when lending than in the past. Mr Ortiz admits that deregulation has to go further. He says the government will propose later this year new laws that should help a secondary mortgage market develop, by removing restrictions on the transfer of property titles. The government will also gradually loosen restrictions on Mexican bank's participation in derivatives, once a correct capitalisation regime is in place. However, the government is worried about the capacity of banks to take risks in an unregulated environment. It likes to remind those who favour more aggressive deregulation, that four years ago Mexican banks were state-owned, forced to lend to the public sector at subsidised interest rates, and protected from foreign competition.</p>

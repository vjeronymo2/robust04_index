			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Dull final quarter at large US store chains TWO LARGE US department store chains, Arkansas-based Dillard's and May Department Stores, unveiled earnings figures yesterday which provided further evidence of a dull final quarter in the retail sector. May, which operates 318 department stores and almost 3,300 Payless ShoeSource outlets, said after-tax profits in the 13 weeks to February 1 rose only modestly, from Dollars 252m a year ago to Dollars 266m. Sales in the important fourth quarter rose from Dollars 3.28bn to Dollars 3.36bn, but on a same-store basis there was an overall 0.5 per cent drop, reflecting a 0.7 per cent fall in the department store division and a 1.5 per cent gain on the shoe store side. For the year, May saw net profits of Dollars 515m, against Dollars 500m in 1990-91, on sales of Dollars 10.4bn, against Dollars 9.86bn. Its shares gained  7/8 at Dollars 57 1/8 . May, which opened 14 department stores and 328 Payless outlets last year, said it planned to add six department stores and 270 Payless units in the current 12 months. At Dillard's, which owns 198 department stores, mainly in the midwest and south-west, after-tax profits in the fourth quarter totalled Dollars 93.3m, against Dollars 92.3m. Sales reached Dollars 1.32bn against Dollars 1.22bn, but same-store sales rose a modest 2 per cent. For the year overall, sales rose 12 per cent to Dollars 4.07bn, with comparable-store advancing by half this amount. Net profits for the period were Dollars 206.2m against Dollars 182.8m. The drab figures follow news of a fourth-quarter profits fall at Nordstrom, the Seattle-based fashion store chain.</p>

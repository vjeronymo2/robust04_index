At a meeting, not included on the agenda of a visit of the  Polish minister, the Polish delegation again stressed the need  to eliminate the so-called "grey spheres" of influence in  Europe. In the interest of the lasting peace on the continent,  the West should cover the region of Central and Eastern Europe  with a "political screen," the Polish delegation claimed.    Earlier in the day, the Polish minister-led delegation met  with Senate speaker Romeo Leblanc to discuss some European  political issues, including the developments in the east of the  continent. The politicians stressed the importance of friendly  relations between Poland and Canada. Leblanc said he is  satisfied with the signing of a package of military cooperation  agreements between the two countries.    Later in the day, Kolodziejdzyk took part in the  wreath-laying ceremony at the monument to the Canadian soldiers  killed during the two world wars and then went to the Polish  house in Ottawa to decorate twelve war veterans with the  military crosses.    Kolodziejdzyk invited David Collenette to pay a visit to  Poland. Minister Kolodziejdzyk in expected to hold a news  conference on the results of his North American visit on  Thursday.</p>

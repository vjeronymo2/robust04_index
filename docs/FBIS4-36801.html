			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sami Kulayb in Paris] </F>   [Excerpts] 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the  Yemeni Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of  the General People's Congress, has placed much of the blame for  the current fighting in Yemen on the Arabian Gulf states,  particularly Saudi Arabia. Their support for the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP], he believes, is aimed at taking the issue  to the Security Council for it to acknowledge the secession.    In a statement to AL-SAFIR at his place of residence in  Paris, where he seeks meetings with French officials,  'Abd-al-Ghani stressed that what is taking place in Yemen now  "was not born on the spur of moment, but is the natural result  of several steps made by the YSP, especially during and after  the signing of the Pledge and Accord document in Amman."  [passage omitted]    Asked why the YSP is blamed for the war, 'Abd-al-Ghani said:  "Since the signing of the Pledge and Accord document in Jordan,  'Ali Salim al-Bid has been preparing for secession. He ordered  that the northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade be besieged, and he  wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia immediately after the signing  to say that the military situation dictated secession. But the  Army's Signal Corps, which was united, discovered the scheme,  and the Jordanian hospitality forced al-Bid to stay in Amman  longer than he expected. [no closing quotation marks as  published]    Asked whether al-Bid and Saudi Arabia had agreed in advance  about the secession, the northern official answered: "Al-Bid  himself said that in an interview to a Gulf newspaper. Indeed,  he later blamed his brothers in the Gulf because they had  abandoned him. All this indicates that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,  and the United Arab Emirates have something to do, near or far,  with what is taking place."    He added: "Perhaps no one likes to see his neighbor stronger  than himself. Perhaps the discovery of oil helped strengthen  the feelings of anxiety in the neighboring countries, which  still attach great importance to the land. We suspect that some  countries are working to divide Yemen, not only into two parts,  but into many regions."    He said: "Calls by the Gulf countries to impose a cease-fire  on the Yemeni Government are aimed at portraying the government  as objector to a cease-fire. This would help bring the issue to  the Security Council, and perhaps lead the latter to recognize  the status quo and to the provision of direct and public support  for the southerners." [passage omitted]    Concerning other foreign interventions affecting  developments  in Yemen, 'Abd-al-Ghani suggested that the Egyptian position is  vague and directly linked to the Saudi position. He said the  claim that Iraq is supporting the north contains much  fabrication and falsehood. "How can one believe al-Bid's claim  that Baghdad sent us warplanes when no Iraqi Air Force plane can  take off without the permission of the international forces?" he  asked.    'Abd-al-Ghani also noted the negative Russian position,  reflected by the absence of the Russian ambassador from  'Abd-al-Ghani's meeting with the ambassadors of the Security  Council permanent member states. This position, 'Abd-al-Ghani  said, proceeds from Russia's economic interests in the Gulf  states. As regard to the United States and Britain "they have  no interest in breaking up Yemen unless interests are given  precedence over principles and stability of nations."    He denied that the current situation has isolated the Yemeni  president. He said: "Our contacts with the Gulf states and  other countries have continued, and we are intensifying  initiatives to stop the bloodshed among the sons of the  homeland." He added: "Let us assume that we made a mistake in  the past. We apologized, but we cannot continue to endlessly  pay a price."    'Abd-al-Ghani ruled out the involvement of the Islamic  trends  or tribes in the situation. He explained: "Al-Bid tried to  suggest that Islamic trends are influencing the decisions of the  president and that Yemen will turn into an Islamic country like  Sudan, but the facts disprove this, just as they prove that the  legitimate army is alone in the battlefield. We are avoiding  bringing the tribes into the conflict or arming the people  because we are not engaged in a civil war."    The northern official stressed that the oil wells are far  from the centers of the struggle "and that Washington asked for  them to be neutralized."</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / IG Metall hints at deal to avert strike in east IG Metall, Germany's engineering union, yesterday hinted it might accept a compromise with employers if it meant averting an all-out strike in eastern Germany. But Mr Franz Steinkuhler, IG Metall's president, warned that all demands of the steel, metal and electrical employers' associations could not be met. The employers have already recommended pay increases of 9 per cent this year for eastern Germany's steel, electrical and metal sectors. This is instead of rises of up to 26 per cent agreed in March 1991 under a contract that envisaged bringing east German wages up to west German levels by April 1994. The employers, invoking a revision clause, pulled out of that contract last month on the grounds of deteriorating economic circumstances. Mr Steinkuhler, in a pre-recorded radio interview, said his union would be prepared to accept 'a compromise which might hurt'. Although he did not give details, he said eastern Germany would have 'wage contracts with many companies but there will no longer be one broad wage contract'. Some large companies in eastern Germany, notably Opel, are already outside IG Metall's wage structure. Meanwhile, Mr Norbert Blum, the federal labour minister, who is increasingly concerned about the impact of a strike on unemployment levels in eastern Germany, has proposed introduction of a new wage system. He said wage increases could be linked to a profit-related pay scheme.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 16 Jun (Notimex) -- Cuban  parliament leader Ricardo Alarcon said today that the Summit of  the Americas will represent "a challenge and an opportunity"  because it may suggest a desire on the part of the United States  to restate its relations with the region.    Alarcon said the meeting -- requested by the United States  and scheduled for December in Miami, Florida -- is "a source of  concern" because there have been no consultations to establish a  date, agenda, and possible resolutions for the meeting.    This failure to establish the content of the meeting  "deserves the deepest thought," said Alarcon, who was a member  of the Cuban delegation to the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of  Heads of State and Government, which ended yesterday in  Cartagena de Indias.    The former Cuban foreign minister said the U.S. Government  talks "of a new system of relations regarding security, which  would not be based on troops and military bases," and also of  having "good intentions where trade is concerned."    "The fact that Cuba and Haiti will not attend the  hemispheric  meeting will not undermine its merits, if something like this is  accomplished," he said. However, "if this is not the case,  there might be cause for even greater concern."    The president of the Cuban National Assembly of the Peoples  Government told reporters he has reservations because the  summons to the meeting comes "from the place that has summoned  the countries of the region that have hidden agendas."    In my opinion the presence of U.S. OAS Ambassador Harriet  Babbit at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit was disadvantageous  because the forum has thus far abstained from granting observer  status to third country governments.    "Babbit is involved in the organization of the Miami Summit  for purposes that may differ from the original plan," he said.    Alarcon explained that due to this situation Cuban President  Fidel Castro expressed in his speech at the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit on Tuesday, "certain ideas which we  believe Latin America should discuss" at the Miami meeting.    Castro denied that Cuba will oppose the Summit of the  Americas, adding that "we are pleased that our neighboring  countries of Latin America and the Caribbean can firmly and  vigorously defend our peoples' interest at that meeting."    The Cuban leader remains in Cartagena de Indias -- a port on  Colombia's Caribbean coast, 1,200 km north of Bogota -- where he  plans to hold bilateral meetings on Thursday with other regional  leaders.</p>

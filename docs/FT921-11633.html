			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Traffic wardens brought to book THE POPULAR image of traffic wardens as a ruthlessly efficient machine for persecuting motorists takes an unprecedented bashing today, writes Richard Tomkins. As neglected by their employers as they are unloved by the public, traffic wardens emerge as a badly managed crew which spends less than half its average working day sticking tickets to motorists' windscreens. A highly critical report by the Audit Commission portrays them not as petty Hitlers, but as the Cinderellas of law enforcement, neglected by the police forces and local authorities which employ them. In what amounts to a 24-page ticket of violations against management of parking enforcement, the commission paints a dismal picture of indifference. Objectives are 'vague and unquantified' and day-to-day management is often 'languid'. Many motorists might view the identified management failings as a blessing in disguise. The commission says, for example, that traffic wardens spend up to 45 per cent of their working day walking to and from their beat. With morning parades and tea breaks added in, less than half the working day is spent productively. Among the report's other indictments of the service are: Supervision of wardens on the streets is minimal or absent, and no analysis is undertaken to check how they spend their hours on duty. Sickness levels average 30 days a year - double the level of police officers in the same forces and four times the UK average for manual workers. Working hours are inflexible. In one town centre where waiting restrictions apply until 6.30pm, all wardens leave the streets at 4.30pm, just as the evening rush hour starts. The number of tickets issued daily by wardens varies. It is four times as high in some forces as it is in others. The proportion of unpaid tickets written off by police forces outside London varies from 3 per cent to 13 per cent. In the 30 years since the creation of the traffic warden service, the police have failed to devise an appropriate measure of performance. Traffic warden numbers tend to be based on historic decisions, not justified by the economies of substituting wardens for police officers. The report concludes that a well-managed and efficient service would save money and reduce inconvenience. 'If it is worth the police service spending Pounds 50m a year on traffic wardens, it is worth managing them well,' it says. 'If the subject is not worth this expenditure, then it is worth reviewing it to identify the scope for savings.' Fine Lines: Improving the Traffic Warden Service. The Audit Commission. HMSO. Pounds 6.</p>

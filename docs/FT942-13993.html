			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Le cut-price ticket 'by invitation only' Eurotunnel yesterday unveiled plans for a limited 'by invitation only' service through the Channel tunnel during the summer months until a full freight and passenger timetable can be run from October. The announcement was made as the company unveiled its preliminary annual report for 1993. Shareholders, business contacts, long-term supporters of the tunnel, the travel trade and the press will be offered reduced fares under Eurotunnel's 'overture service'. The reduced-fare services will start after the official opening on May 6. The company hopes that 50,000 cars will have gone through the tunnel 'to create more positive awareness' before full-price tickets go on sale in October. However, delays in getting rolling stock into service will mean that the full programme of four passenger shuttle trains an hour will not be possible until spring next year. Eurotunnel is currently carrying out a seven-day series of full-scale tests running trains through the tunnel. The company said yesterday that it had negotiated rates with nearly 900 freight customers which account for 80 per cent of the market for driver-accompanied trucks crossing the Channel. It plans to start its limited freight shuttle by invitation in May. Invitation passenger shuttles are due to start in July. Eurotunnel expects to announce revised projections of traffic levels and revenues at the time of its rights issue prospectus, due between May 17 and the end of June. It plans to raise at least Pounds 1.1bn. Equity will account for less than half the total, but the final figure will depend on the debt equity mix and sum needed to cover additional interest payments. Much of Eurotunnel's debt - 60 per cent of sterling debt and 21 per cent of French debt - was at fixed rates at the end of 1993. The aim is have 75 per cent of both currencies fixed for four to six years. Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, yesterday said the explanation for delays in opening the tunnel included the need for 4,000 contractors' staff to work alongside Eurotunnel staff after the official handover in December.</p>

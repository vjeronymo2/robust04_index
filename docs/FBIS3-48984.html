The new defence and reconstruction tax,  which is effective as of this month, was agreed in a law passed  by Bosnia's collective presidency, the television said. It will  be levied on Bosnians living in Bosnia-Herzegovina and on  Bosnian nationals working abroad. Observers noted were the main  targets of the new legislation [sentence as received]. A  presidency statement said: "Bosnian workers abroad will thus be  able to participate in an organised way in efforts to defend the  country."</p>

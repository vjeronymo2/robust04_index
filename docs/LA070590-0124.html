			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY'S KCAL COMES UNDER FIRE;  </P> <P> MARKETING: STATION'S ADVERTISING PLOY TO GET ITSELF ON SANTA BARBARA CABLE  SYSTEM HAS ANGERED MANY IN THE FIRE-RAVAGED AREA.  </P> <P> Some TV officials in fire-ravaged Santa Barbara are burning mad at Los Angeles  station KCAL Channel 9 for using the tragedy there last week as a marketing  ploy to boost its own fortunes.  </P> <P> The Disney-owned station took out a full-page ad in the Santa Barbara  News-Press on Monday that championed KCAL's coverage of the city's devastating  fire and asked Santa Barbara residents to call their cable company to ask that  KCAL be added to the programming lineup.  </P> <P> Cox Cable, which carries the other six Los Angeles VHF stations on its Santa  Barbara system, called the ad "unconscionable" and "offensive." And sources at  KEYT Channel 3, Santa Barbara's only local television station, said that many  in their community are outraged that KCAL would try to capitalize on the  tragedy.  </P> <P> After seeing the ad in her hometown paper, Sandra Benton, the general manager  of KEYT, an ABC affiliate that supplied KCAL with coverage of the fire before  KCAL was able to rush its own personnel and equipment some 90 miles up the  coast, sent a letter to KCAL general manager Blake Byrne chastising his station  for the marketing move.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, KCAL said that it would air one hour of the six-hour fire relief  telethon that KEYT plans to broadcast Saturday.  </P> <P> Benton refused to speculate on whether KCAL's decision was an attempt to make  up for a public relations blunder. But Bobbi Didier, director of public affairs  at Cox Cable, saw it that way. "It's a nice effort, but it doesn't undo the  damage they have already done," she said.  </P> <P> Because of the Independence Day holiday, executives at KCAL were unavailable  for comment.  </P> <P> The telethon, which is designed to raise money for the victims of the Santa  Barbara fire, will air live on KEYT and on Cox cable's Telemundo Spanish  channel from 6 p.m. to midnight. KCAL will air the final hour of the telethon.  </P> <P> The story behind the KCAL ad actually begins several years ago, prior to  Disney's purchase of the station in 1988. Cox officials, citing the fact that  the station, then KHJ, was garnering very low ratings in the Santa Barbara  area, dropped it from the cable system to make way for other channels. That  effectively shut off any opportunity of Channel 9 reaching viewers in the city,  where the mountainous terrain makes cable a necessity for most homes.  </P> <P> Just two weeks ago, however, Cox sent a survey to its 61,000 subscribers,  asking them to rate their current programming choices and to comment on a list  of new options, including KCAL, that they might like to receive.  </P> <P> Rather than waiting for the results of the survey or appealing to Cox directly,  KCAL took matters into its own hands by buying the ad in Monday's Santa Barbara  News-Press. The ad featured a group photo of nine anchors and other members of  the Channel 9 news team alongside copy that read: "Last week Santa Barbara and  much of Southern California experienced horribly tragic fires. KCAL-TV,  California 9, covered all of these fires in depth with: live reports,  helicopter coverage, frequent live cut-ins, and most importantly, three full  hours of coverage in prime time, 8-11 p.m., where we have local news every week  day. Unfortunately, you can't get California 9 on your cable system."  </P> <P> It then asked readers to call the Cox general manager at a phone number listed  in the ad to request "that KCAL-TV be added to your cable system. Because what  you don't know . . . can hurt you."  </P> <P> KCAL did not run ads about its fire coverage in Los Angeles area newspapers.  </P> <P> "Many people see it as an inappropriate lobbying effort to get themselves back  on the cable system," said a KEYT employee who did not want to be identified.  "It looked like they were trying to capitalize on our tragedy."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Benton refused to say anything negative about KCAL  for fear of jeopardizing its commitment to air one hour of Saturday's telethon.  </P> <P> "I'm thankful that they're going to run the telethon for whatever reason they  are choosing to do it," she said. "I don't want to say anything that would hurt  the good that might come out of that. We are so devastated and we are such a  small community, everyone knows a friend or a co-worker here at the station who  has lost their home."  </P> <P> But Cox was pulling no punches.  </P> <P> Since Disney bought the station, no one from KCAL or Disney has ever contacted  Cox directly about their desire to be added to the system, Didier said.  </P> <P> And to make matters worse, she said, the phone number that KCAL printed in the  ad was not an administrative number, but Cox's customer service line, which was  already swamped with calls from customers trying to get their cable service  restored. Didier said that 16 1/2 miles of the cable system was destroyed by  the fire, and that crews had been working around the clock to repair the  damage.  </P> <P> Giving out the customer service number to serve "their lust for profits,"  Didier said, resulted in unnecessary calls on a line already overburdened with  requests for assistance from victims of the fire.  </P> <P> "Forget about tasteless," she said. "The ad just continued to hurt Santa  Barbara."  </P> <P> As for the news coverage that KCAL claimed Santa Barbara viewers missed, KEYT  news employees said that none of the Los Angeles stations were on the scene in  time to get anything of their own on the air before about 10 p.m. the first  evening, June 27. By that time, KEYT had already been supplying local residents  with continuous coverage of the fire for 3 1/2 hours. The station stayed on the  air with news from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m. KCAL finished its news reports at 11 p.m.  Moreover, some of what KCAL aired from Santa Barbara was supplied by KEYT,  which also shared videotape with KABC Channel 7 and KTTV Channel 11.  </P> <P> In a letter to the Santa Barbara News-Press on behalf of Cox, Didier wrote: "If  KCAL is so interested in Santa Barbara, they should put their resources into  helping our fire victims, not buying expensive and offensive ads."  </P> <P> Will such feelings keep KCAL from getting back on the Cox cable lineup?  </P> <P> "If our customers tell us they want it, we would provide it for them," Didier  said. "But I think now it would be more difficult to grin and bear them."  </P></p>

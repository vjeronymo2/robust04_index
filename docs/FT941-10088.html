			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US wants Japanese trade 'clean break' US and Japanese officials resumed trade negotiations yesterday, but US officials insisted this weekend's trade summit between President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokowa still must produce 'a clear break from the past'. 'It is not clear whether we'll have any agreement at all,' said a senior US official. 'It's very clear that the US position will not change on these critical issues. The status quo has got to be altered.' The talks - on market access for cars, car parts, insurance, telecommunications, and medical equipment - had broken off Wednesday. They were restarted after a lengthy breakfast meeting between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Mr C. Bowman Cutter of the National Economic Council, who ordered their deputies to try again. The ministers were to meet again to review the progress. If there was a chance of success - and Mr Kantor is a great believer in last minute deal-making - then the talks would resume. US officials indicated a partial agreement might be possible as long as Japan agrees to 'objective criteria' to measure gains achieved for 'competitive foreign goods'. They continued to be vague, however, about the interpretation of the 'quantitative and qualitative' indicators they want, except to reject the notion that it means they want market share targets. Another US official said the administration was unified, resolved and specific about its goal in a way it never has been in previous talks. 'Things have gotten worse,' he said of the nearly Dollars 60bn (Pounds 40bn) US trade deficit to Japan last year. 'We've learned a lot.' The Clinton administration has concluded that it has nothing to gain by waiting for further reforms promised by Mr Hosokowa because of his disappointing performance on deregulation. 'We've held our fire,' the official said. 'Its all rhetoric and there's no deregulation that we can find at all.' If Tokyo really wanted reform, he said, it would have agreed to the zero tariff initiative in the Uruguay Round, particularly on wood, since it could have slashed housing costs. Cars imports must still face an 'elaborate testing system' which raise prices and car parts have to deal with a costly licensing regime. 'That's why we are dealing with these indicators.' the official said. 'We do not know any other way of prying it open. The frustrating fact is that this is all we have left.'</p>

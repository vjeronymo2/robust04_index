			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Ground crews' strike ends at USAir THE strike by some 8,300 ground crew workers against USAir, the US airline in which British Airways wants to invest, ended yesterday morning after a 'tenative contract agreement' between management and the International Association of Machinists, writes Nikki Tait in New York. The IAM has indicated that it will recommend the accord to its members, said USAir, but ratification by the rank-and-file is required. The strike began on Monday and caused USAir to cut daily jet departures by 40 per cent. The carrier said that normal schedules should be on again by Monday. The three largest US airlines yesterday claimed BA's warning that US disapproval for the USAir deal would have severe consequences for airline deregulation was 'baseless'.</p>

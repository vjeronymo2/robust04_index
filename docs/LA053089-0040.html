			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKIES CLEAR FOR WINDUP OF HOLIDAY FESTIVITIES  </P> <P> After overcast skies over the weekend gave way to a clear and sunny Memorial  Day, more than 400,000 Southern Californians marked the traditional start of  the summer season by heading to local beaches.  </P> <P> Although winds hovered around 20 m.p.h. and temperatures failed to rise above  70 degrees in some places, visitors sunbathed, picnicked and roamed the piers  and beach bicycle paths.  </P> <P> "It's not a perfect beach day," said Los Angeles County Lifeguard Lt. Wally  Millican at Hermosa Beach, "but it's the perfect way to end the weekend."  </P> <P> The final day of the long holiday weekend saw other time-honored Memorial Day  activities, including a ceremony at the Los Angeles National Cemetery in  Westwood -- this one marking its 100th anniversary.  </P> <P> About 1,000 veterans and family members gathered to hear Sen. Pete Wilson  (R-Calif.) remember servicemen and women who have died in American military  conflicts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cannon Fired  </P> <P> "What we owe to the men and women in this garden of stone is that their  sacrifice was not in vain," Wilson said. The ceremony included the firing of a  Civil War cannon that was damaged by vandals eight years ago but was recently  refitted.  </P> <P> Elsewhere as the tourist season unfolded, thousands of visitors jammed into  Yosemite National Park, claiming all available campground and hotel space.  Heavy traffic forced some motorists in the park to spend more than two hours in  their vehicles, rangers said.  </P> <P> Traffic fatalities across the state, meanwhile, claimed the lives of at least  43 people, the California Highway Patrol reported. At least five of the  fatalities were in Los Angeles County, the coroner reported.  </P> <P> In addition, nearly 1,000 motorists had been arrested in the county as of  Monday morning for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the  holiday weekend. About 400 of the arrests were made Saturday night in a  coordinated effort by 33 law enforcement agencies at 16 sobriety checkpoints,  according to Gardena police, who tallied results of the effort.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Statewide Totals  </P> <P> An additional 577 people were arrested in the Los Angeles area by the CHP,  which made a total of 2,105 such arrests statewide.  </P> <P> The CHP statistics, which covered the period from 6 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m.  Monday, were running higher than a year ago, Officer Andy Gutierrez said, with  10 more traffic deaths and 334 more arrests than over the same period of 1988.  </P> <P> The holiday weekend also was marked by tragedy and violence. An 11-month-old  Lennox girl, Roxanne Diaz-Molina, died Monday of head injuries inflicted by her  mother's boyfriend, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. The baby was  injured early Sunday morning in a quarrel between her mother, Rosa Molina, and  Jacinto Peres, 31, of Lennox, authorities said.  </P> <P> "Peres is being charged with murder and will remain in custody without bail,"  Sheriff's Deputy Bill Wehner said. The infant's mother, who also was injured,  was treated at County-Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and released.  </P> <P> An 8-year-old Lancaster girl, Saquita Marie Simons, apparently drowned about  noon Monday when the 19-foot ski boat in which she was riding sank after it was  was swamped by high winds and waves in Lake Isabella in Kern County.  </P> <P> Two 19-year-olds from Lancaster, who also were in the boat, were pulled to  safety by another boater. But the child, who was not wearing a preserver, sank  with the boat, the Kern County Sheriff's Department said. A two-hour search  failed to find the body.  </P> <P> There were no casualties, however, when a 50-foot yacht sank in heavy seas  Monday while returning to Santa Barbara from a holiday trip. Two couples aboard  the mahogany-hulled Royal Caprice, heading back from Santa Cruz Island about  3:40 p.m., were rescued when a fleet of boats responded to its distress call,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Before the rescue boats arrived, the four passengers "got into a skiff, but it  quickly capsized," tumbling them into 62-degree water, said Steve Lewis, harbor  master with the Santa Barbara Harbor Patrol. One of the women was treated for  hypothermia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drowning Victim  </P> <P> On Sunday, a Huntington Park man drowned while swimming in Lake Mead, Nev., the  National Park Service reported, as winds gusted up to 60 m.p.h. and caused  choppy water. The victim, who was not identified pending notification of  relatives, "had been drinking" and then decided to swim, Park Service spokesman  Don Hamilton said.  </P> <P> "He went into an area six to eight feet deep," Hamilton added. "His friends  stated he was yelling in Spanish and waving his hands, but didn't appear in any  difficulty. For some reason he went underwater and did not come back up."  </P> <P> Over the long weekend, authorities reported that at least 13 people were killed  in the Los Angeles area in shootings and other violence.  </P> <P> In an apparently gang-related incident in South-Central Los Angeles, five  people at a back-yard barbecue near 78th Street and Stanford Avenue were shot  by an unknown number of assailants about 1 a.m. Monday, Los Angeles Police Lt.  Frank Valdez said.  </P> <P> The victims, three males and two females aged 15 to 24, never saw their  attackers, he said, because "their backs were to the street." One victim was  hospitalized and listed in serious condition, Valdez added, while the others  were treated and released. The attackers fled on foot, police said.  </P> <P> In a second gang-related incident Monday, a 17-year-old youth was shot in the  abdomen in a drive-by shooting at 62nd Street and Vermont Avenue, Valdez said.  He was listed in critical condition at Martin Luther King General Hospital.  </P></p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / BR's condom-flag advert is labelled 'irresponsible' A British Rail advertisement featuring 12 yellow condoms arranged in a circle against a blue background was criticised yesterday by the Advertising Standards Authority for being 'grossly irresponsible in its encouragement of promiscuity', and for denigrating the flag of the European Union. The newspaper advertisement, intended to boost sales of the Young Person's European rail pass, was headed 'Inter-Rail. You've got the rest of your life to be good'. It also referred to the European Commission's 'Europe Against Aids' initiative. The ASA, the advertising watchdog, received 164 complaints. It ruled that the advertisement's approach was irresponsible and had caused widespread offence. British Rail denied encouraging promiscuity, saying research showed a significant proportion of 18-to-25-year-olds had sexual encounters without a condom on holiday, and Inter-Rail supports the European Aids initiative. BR was asked to avoid similar style advertisements. The ASA rejected complaints about a British Telecommunications advertisement which was headed 'Do you ever wish your kids would use the phone more?' The ASA ruled that the advertisement was 'a legitimate attempt by the advertisers to encourage greater use of their product'.</p>

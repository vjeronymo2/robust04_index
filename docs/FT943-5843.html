			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Mexican rates rise Interest rates on Mexican short- and long-term government paper rose sharply yesterday, reflecting concern over the country's political and economic situation, writes Damian Fraser. The interest rate on 28-day paper rose by 51 basis points to 14 per cent, and on one-year paper by 75 points to 13.18 per cent. The rise in interest rates follows weakness in the peso against the dollar in recent days. Market analysts attributed the rise to investor nervousness about Mexico after the election last month and about the incoming government's exchange rate policy.</p>

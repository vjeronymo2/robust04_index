			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN'S BASKETBALL COACH IS FIRED BY SDSU;  </P> <P> EARNEST RIGGINS HAS BEEN WITH AZTECS SINCE 1983; NO REPLACEMENT NAMED  </P> <P> Earnest Riggins has been fired as San Diego State women's basketball coach,  Athletic Director Fred Miller announced Monday.  </P> <P> Miller would not comment on the reasons for the firing, calling it "a personnel  matter."  </P> <P> Riggins, 52, said he learned about the firing when a reporter called his house  late Monday afternoon.  </P> <P> "It's news to me," said Riggins, who said last week that Miller had asked him  to resign but he had refused. "I haven't heard one word today. Not one word.  I've been home most of the day, and I haven't talked to anyone.  </P> <P> "I guess my reaction now is the same as it was last week. I'm shocked and  surprised. Obviously, they see a need to make a change. That's their  prerogative. But my character and my future are at stake."  </P> <P> Riggins said one year remains on his contract, but Miller said Riggins likely  will not be reassigned at SDSU.  </P> <P> "That is not our intent," Miller said.  </P> <P> When asked to confirm that one year does indeed remain on Riggins' contract,  Miller said, "No comment. I don't want to get into a public debate on that."  </P> <P> Riggins took over the women's program in 1983 and has posted a 118-67 record.  The Aztecs finished the 1988-89 season 25-9 and lost to Oregon in the  championship game of the Women's National Invitation Tournament.  </P> <P> Riggins' tenure was not trouble-free, however. Star players Jessica Haynes and  Tina Hutchinson, for example, both left the school in previous seasons because  of academic troubles.  </P> <P> Jayne Hancock, associate athletic director, will head a search for a  replacement. She was unavailable for comment, but Miller said the SDSU women's  basketball coaching position is "an open situation."  </P> <P> Several SDSU basketball players declined comment on Monday's firing.  </P></p>

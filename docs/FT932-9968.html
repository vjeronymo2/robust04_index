			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Thoughts on a rate cut STERLING money market dealers resumed speculation that the UK might cut base rates again this year as Mr John Major's premiership remained under pressure following electoral defeats last week, writes James Blitz. For the last two months, the yield curve in short-dated sterling futures has sloped upwards as dealers took the view that UK base rates had bottomed at 6 per cent. However, the government's savage defeat last week in both the Newbury by-election and the county council elections has led to some small speculation that the government might be panicked into another base rate cut to stimulate the economy further. One major London dealer claimed he was looking for a  1/2 to 1 percentage point cut in base rates because recent political embarrassment had raised the possibility of a short-term setback in the UK's economic recovery. Another factor compounding the hopes of the rate cut bulls was yesterday's producer price inflation data for April. This was on the modest side, giving the government a little more room to ease policy if it so wished. Output prices rose an annualised 3.8 per cent in the year to April, compared to 3.7 per cent in the year to March. Input prices actually fell between March and April. Last night, the futures yield curve once again reflected downward sloping interest rates between June and September. The June contract closed at 94.05, a level anticipating three-month money at 5.95 per cent by the middle of next month. There was far heavier trading in the September contract, however, which finished 9 basis points higher on the day at 94.15. At this level it is pricing three-month money in the autumn at 5.85 per cent. Short-dated interest rates in the sterling cash market responded similarly, declining by at least  1/16 percentage point across the board. The three-month sterling deposit rate ended at 5 7/8 per cent from a previous close of 5 15/16 per cent. The one-year rate finished at around 6 1/32 per cent from a previous close of 6 3/16 per cent. This was in spite of difficulties removing a daily shortage which was forecast in the morning at Pounds 850m. There was late assistance of Pounds 355m. Speculation of lower base rates was also felt by sterling, which fell 3 pfennigs against the D-Mark.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 22 KYODO -- The United States  will welcome the opportunity to resume stalled framework trade  talks with Japan following the installation of a new government  in Tokyo, a top White House official said Friday [22 April].    "We would very much welcome the opportunity to continue  discussion at an appropriate time," Robert Rubin, director of  the White House National Economic Council, said.    Rubin made the remarks following reports from Tokyo that  Japan's ruling coalition parties have decided to back Tsutomu  Hata, currently the foreign minister, as their candidate to  replace outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    A vote by Japan's parliament is scheduled for Monday.    Rubin told reporters he is aware that Hata has been chosen  as  the prime ministerial candidate, but declined to comment whether  Hata's elevation to the prime ministership would bring changes  to the troubled U.S.-Japan economic relations.    "We have enormous respect for Japan... Our relations with  Japan are extremely important to us in all respects, including  economics," Rubin said.    In an address he made earlier in the day to a group of  American business executives, Rubin reiterated that the U.S. is  not seeking "quotas" or "market shares" for U.S. products in  Japan.    "We are dedicated to try to gain fair access to sell in  Japan," he said.</p>

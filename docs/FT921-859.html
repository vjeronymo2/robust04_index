			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / CSCE agrees principle of peace-keeping FOREIGN Ministers from the 51-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe wound up a three-day ministerial session yesterday with wide agreement on the principle that the CSCE should be given a peace-keeping capability. But Mr Paavo Vayrynen, the Finnish foreign minister, said differences had to be ironed out over the nature of the forces to be used in peace-keeping operations This is one of the main issues on the agenda of senior officials, who will meet for the next three months to work out a blue-print for strengthening the CSCE's capacity to deal with the many European crises and conflicts of the post-cold war era. Their work will be crowned by a full-scale summit in Helsinki at the beginning of July. Delegates said that, while there was general agreement that the CSCE was the best forum for taking the political decisions on whether peace-keeping forces were needed to settle conflicts in Europe, there was still no consensus on whether the organisation should have its own peace-keeping forces, as Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, has proposed. The view of the US, Britain and several other delegations is that the CSCE does not have a military function and that peace-keeping forces should be provided, at the request of the CSCE, by other more specialised organisations such as Nato, the nine-nation Western European Union or the United Nations. Mr Vayrynen indicated that such a solution had not been ruled out by anyone. But his own government's position, shared by a number of other countries, was that the CSCE members should each earmark national contingents for use in CSCE peace-making operations when called upon to do so. The problem of the transcaucasian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, a conflict which might well require a CSCE decision to send peace-keeping forces in the near future, was again the subject of a sharp exchange between the Armenian and Azerbaijani representatives. Their statements demonstrated that the contentious issue of Nagorno-Karabakh participation in the 10-nation CSCE peace conference, due to be held in Minsk at a date yet to be decided, was far from settled, in spite of Tuesday's agreement by the disputing parties to attend. Mr Raffi Hovanissian, the Armenian foreign minister, reiterated his demand that Nagorno-Karabakh should be represented separately and independently at the conference. But Mr Albert Salamov, Azerbaijan's deputy foreign minister, insisted that the enclave's delegates could not attend as the representatives of 'the so-called parliament' of Nagorno-Karabakh, elected after a referendum last December on independence, which Azerbaijan has declared null and void. They could only represent Nagorno-Karabakh's two ethnic communities, he said.</p>

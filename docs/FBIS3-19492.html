			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed NN/BN: "Second Day of the Pan-European </F> Conference on Transport -- the European Union Urges Quick  Response From Switzerland"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA  database]    [Text] Heraklion, 15 Mar (ATS) -- Federal Counselor Adolf  Ogi had talks with European Commissioner for Transport Abel  Matutes Tuesday morning [15 March]. On the second day of the  conference of EU transport ministers in Crete, they examined the  consequences of the Alpine project's approval for the European  transport sector and the negotiations mandate between the  European Union (EU) and Switzerland.    "We have a scheduling problem," Abel Matutes said at the end  of the talks. "We have raised some technical questions to  assess to what extent the Alpine project is compatible with the  transport agreements. If we receive quick answers to those  questions, we will do our best to ensure that negotiations begin  at the European Council meeting on transport on 18 April," he  added.    In the afternoon, Adolf Ogi is to meet with his Austrian and  German counterparts, Messrs Viktor Klima and Matthias Wissman,  respectively. The day before, he had a long conversation with  French Minister Bernard Bosson.    While agreeing to the sovereignty of the Swiss decision, Mr.  Bosson held very strongly to the French position. "Today, 90  percent of all the trucks that cross Switzerland are carried by  rail. The Swiss want to protect themselves against the  remaining 10 percent; this is causing problems for France since  the protection of some [states] means expenditure for other  [states]," he stated.  <H5>  No Retaliatory Measures </H5>   Even though Mr. Bosson ruled out retaliatory measures  against  Switzerland, he underlined the "incomprehension arising from the  20 February vote. Banning trucks at home while allowing trucks  in other countries is too much," he said. "There is heavy  traffic between the north and the south and our respective  citizens want no more trucks. How can we settle this issue  together," Mr. Bosson asked, while insisting on the need for  European leaders to tackle this common problem together.    Mr. Ogi for his part remains optimistic. "The transport  policy must develop into an ecological and modern policy. It  will take a long time to achieve this, and we have to persuade  our partners. In fact, our message is being heard slowly but  surely," the federal counselor said.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NUMBER COULD BE UP FOR BINGO HALL;  </P> <P> CHARITY: THE FOUNDER OF THE WOODLAND HILLS GAMES DENIES DIVERTING MONEY. SHE  SAYS SHE WILL SHUT DOWN AFTER CLEARING HER NAME.  </P> <P> The tables in the cavernous bingo hall at Identity Inc. in Woodland Hills are  mostly empty. Bingo nights that once drew 800 players are fetching fewer than  250.  </P> <P> Presiding over the decline on a recent evening is the "Queen of Bingo," Edith  Ryan, the embattled founder of a charity for the physically disabled.  </P> <P> Lower income and government investigations into her operation signal that her  reign as Los Angeles' biggest bingo operator may be nearing an end.  </P> <P> The charity and its 64-year-old founder face accusations by ex-associates that  thousands of dollars in player fees were diverted from the charity on bingo  nights.  </P> <P> And, for the second time in six years, the city is seeking to revoke the  charity's bingo license, based on allegations that Ryan illegally paid  bingo-game operators who by law are supposed to be volunteers. Hearings  continued before a city administrative hearing officer last week.  </P> <P> Ryan vigorously denies any wrongdoing but said she will close her charity,  Identity Inc., after clearing her name. "Who will be the loser then?" she asked  tearfully. "The city's crippled and poor."  </P> <P> The eight-year saga of the bingo queen tells of repeated clashes with city  officials. The details include a minor police scandal, bitter betrayals by  longtime associates and even a shoe box filled with a fortune in gold.  </P> <P> Most of all, it is about Ryan, whose gruffness and aggressiveness were forged  during the Depression, when she was one of seven children being reared by a  widow.  </P> <P> Ryan left Akron, Ohio, to start a new life in Canoga Park after her second  marriage ended in 1978. She brought a dream of starting a charity for the  handicapped, born years earlier when her 11-year-old stepson, Shawn Ryan, was  permanently disabled in a car accident.  </P> <P> She also said she brought a shoe box filled with gold hoarded for a decade. It  was worth more than $750,000 after the price of gold skyrocketed in the early  1980s, she says.  </P> <P> After buying a four-bedroom house in what is now West Hills, Ryan established  Identity in 1979 simply by filing papers with the California secretary of  state. But Identity languished while she joined a singles group, enrolled at  Pierce College and took a $120-a-week job with Prudential Insurance.  </P> <P> (Ryan said she already had a bachelor's degree in psychology from Akron  University in Ohio and enrolled at Pierce to build up her confidence. But Akron  has no record of her graduation.)  </P> <P> In her spare time, Ryan said, she fruitlessly pursued funding for Identity. "We  were spinning our wheels. Every direction we turned we were told there was no  money."  </P> <P> Los Angeles voters legalized bingo for charity in 1976. She saw that the game  could save the organization. To qualify for a license, Ryan got tax-exempt  status for Identity and paid the city a $50 fee.  </P> <P> The charity opened its doors to bingo players in February, 1982, and promptly  lost more than $2,000 that month. But there was reason for optimism: Bingo is  popular in the San Fernando Valley. About half the money wagered on bingo in  the city is spent in the Valley, though only 30 of the city's 75 bingo games  are here.  </P> <P> Each Valley player typically spends $45 to $50 a night, about $10 more than  others in Southern California.  </P> <P> "There's just a tremendous gambling instinct in the Valley," said Don Carrier,  publisher of the Bingo Bugler, a monthly newspaper based in Sun Valley.  </P> <P> By the end of 1982, Identity was making enough for Ryan to quit her clerical  job and draw a salary from the charity. It reported a profit for charity of  about $6,000 a month.  </P> <P> By the end of 1983, Identity had moved to a larger hall where as many as 800  people played 100 games a night, and the profit was as high as $86,700 a month.  </P> <P> Big prizes were one of the attractions. City figures show that 77% of  Identity's $29-million gross income over the eight years went for prizes.  </P> <P> The game grew into the city's most successful. Its income represented fully 9%  of the total gross of all games in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> It also attracted the eye of the city's chief bingo regulator.  </P> <P> Ryan was helped by John Defino, a supplier of game equipment. "I learned  everything I know about the game from him," she said. "He was my mentor."  </P> <P> Defino was not as highly regarded by city officials. In early 1984 they shut  down his bingo game at Mary Immaculate Church in Pacoima on the grounds Defino  broke the law by working there. State law prohibits suppliers or anyone else  with a financial interest in bingo from working at games.  </P> <P> When Defino turned up at Identity as a volunteer game caller, his presence  aroused the suspicions of Robert Burns, general manager of the city's Social  Service Department, which regulates bingo.  </P> <P> Burns revoked Identity's license in 1984, citing Defino's involvement as both  supplier and caller at Ryan's games and Ryan's use of bingo proceeds to pay  insurance premiums for five employees, also a state violation.  </P> <P> Ryan appealed in court, arguing that she had purchased supplies from Defino's  son and did not know he was related to her game caller. The license was  restored by a Superior Court judge who called Burns' revocation order  "excessively harsh, abusive and arbitrary." The judge also ruled that it is  legal to pay insurance premiums out of bingo proceeds.  </P> <P> "I took it in the shorts," Burns said of the case.  </P> <P> What followed has been six years of clashes between the regulator and the  queen. The fight has helped shape the way the game is played in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Burns urged the City Council to pass two regulations that Ryan said have  crippled her charity financially. The first, passed in 1988, restricts bingo  operators to 40 games a night. A year later, the council limited the number of  players to 350 per session.  </P> <P> Burns, in defending the restrictions, said big operations were hard to police  and unfair competition for little ones.  </P> <P> The competition has steadily driven up the prize pot, eroding the share for  charity. In 1980, Los Angeles bingo operators spent 71% of their gross receipts  on prizes, Burns says. By this year, the figure was 80%.  </P> <P> Burns lays the trend at Ryan's door.  </P> <P> "Edith simply ran the highest-powered game in town, and that put pressure on  all licensees to increase the size of their prizes," he said.  </P> <P> Ryan says Identity spent $65,000 in legal fees to fight the new regulations. It  had to scale back its charitable services when they took effect, she said.  </P> <P> Using bingo proceeds, Identity had been offering counseling and physical  therapy at the De Soto Avenue facility where the bingo hall is located. Its  files contain records of 138 clients served since 1985. It also gave money to  programs for the disabled, such as a wheelchair basketball team.  </P> <P> Tim Staats, director of the UCLA Prosthetics Education Program, said that after  1988 Identity stopped paying for artificial limbs for disabled people who could  not afford them. Nancy Berry, a counselor with the state Department of  Rehabilitation, referred clients to Identity until Ryan began turning them  down.  </P> <P> Identity's financial crunch and Ryan's lobbying against the new regulations  were overshadowed this summer by at least three investigations of Identity.  </P> <P> Four former Identity bingo workers who had been involved with the games since  their start told city officials that for years they had been illegally paid for  their work. Burns' current attempt to revoke Identity's license is based on  that charge. The hearing before an administrative judge recessed last week  until Nov. 30.  </P> <P> Two of the workers also said in affidavits that records from one of two tables  at which bingo cards were sold were routinely destroyed on Ryan's orders and  the income was not reported.  </P> <P> One of the volunteers, Cindy Houseman, said that an estimated $25,000 was  diverted during one three-day period in July.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police investigators are looking into the workers' claim.  </P> <P> In another investigation, Los Angeles Police Department internal affairs  detectives are seeking to determine if several officers who worked off duty as  security guards at Identity bingo games knew of any illegal handling of money.  Last week, the department revoked permits allowing officers to work at all  bingo games in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office, which monitors bingo operations, is also  investigating the allegations of financial improprieties.  </P> <P> Ryan has denied any wrongdoing and has sought to discredit the workers who have  turned against her by calling them thieves. She said the bad publicity has  caused a further drop in attendance at Identity's games.  </P> <P> Few local charity organizations sympathize with Identity. An official of a  Valley charity who asked not to be identified said "this whole thing gives  legitimate bingo a bad name."  </P> <P> Ryan said she is a victim of Burns, who she claimed is pursuing a vendetta  partly because of his embarrassing failed attack in 1984.  </P> <P> "Burns is an unmitigated pathological liar -- he sits up there like he's the  Gestapo," Ryan said. "Here's a city official who should have no ax to grind, no  personal motive, trying to destroy a legitimate charity."  </P> <P> Some people familiar with Ryan say her personality may be part of her problem.  </P> <P> "Edith is gravelly," Staats of UCLA said. "She is a no-nonsense person. I've  wondered if someone had a vendetta against her. Edith sometimes rubs people the  wrong way."  </P> <P> Burns, a 28-year Civil Service bureaucrat who earns about $71,000 annually,  called Ryan's charge that he is vindictive preposterous.  </P> <P> "What is true," he said, "is that after the department was unsuccessful in  revoking Identity's license I continued to remain suspicious of Identity in  view of the continued assortment of rumors and speculation that have circulated  within the bingo community."  </P> <P> Burns also said he is motivated by concerns over what he believes is the  relatively low level of charitable services Identity provides. He questions  whether a charity that takes in about $1 million a year should serve only a  handful of people.  </P> <P> The law sets no minimum percentage of revenue which a charity must use on  philanthropy. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that such legislation is  unconstitutional, said Deputy Atty. Gen. James Cordi, whose office is  investigating Identity.  </P> <P> Identity's 1988 federal tax form, the most recent available in full, shows that  29% of the organization's $1.3 million in expenses went for direct charitable  services. Included were physical therapy, social work, transportation and the  costs of running a since-closed Woodland Hills house for the disabled.  </P> <P> The rest of the money went for operational expenses such as salaries, including  Ryan's of $39,000, and the $60,000 annual rent for the bingo hall. Expenses  also included city bingo fees of about $42,000 or 1% of the gross bingo  receipts minus $5,000 a month.  </P> <P> Ryan acknowledged that Identity now serves only about 15 clients and has been  forced by high operating costs to close its four-bedroom house for the disabled  in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> To save the charity, Ryan said she has personally loaned Identity $200,000 in  the last three years. She said she also is using her own money to pay the legal  tab on the latest license battle with the city.  </P> <P> Ryan, who now makes $52,000 as Identity's executive director, said there was  still some gold left and she took out a second mortgage on her house.  </P> <P> In an interview, Ryan's mood alternated between distress and battle-hardened  determination.  </P> <P> At one point, she vowed to win. At another, she said she is burned out.  </P> <P> "When this is over, I will close Identity," she said. "But not until I prove  everything is right. I have gone through more abuse than anybody should expect.  . . . Where they should be putting me on a pedestal, they want to put me on a  stake."  </P></p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Scottish Widows ordered to review 20,000 life policies SCOTTISH WIDOWS, one of the UK's largest insurance companies, has been ordered by the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation to inform more than 20,000 policyholders that they may have been sold the wrong policy. The policies were sold by Scottish Widows' tied agents - financial advisers which sell the products of one company exclusively but which are not directly employed by it. A compliance check by Lautro, which started in April, discovered that some sales agents had gathered too little information on policyholders to be able to offer best advice, as required by industry regulators. Scottish Widows is checking policies sold by all its tied agency firms. Mr Robert Hogarth, Scottish Widows' compliance manager, resigned in July after the investigation began. Scottish Widows, which sold just under 129,000 policies last year, is one of the UK's top 10 performing life insurance and pensions houses. The activities of tied agents have been a particular concern for Lautro which has targeted that category of sales agent for special review. Up to 45 per cent of policies sold via 'direct' or 'tied' agents are terminated within the first two years of the contract, compared with only 22 to 32 per cent of policies sold through independent financial advisers, according to data from the Securities and Investments Board, the chief regulatory watchdog. Scottish Widows says its preliminary review of all 27,000 policies sold by tied agents since it first recruited them in February 1989 found only 6,200 were completely satisfactory. In another 3,240 cases, an unsuitable policy may have been sold. In the remaining 17,500 cases, there is not enough information for Scottish Widows and Lautro to decide whether best advice was given and a suitable product sold. Scottish Widows is writing to more than 20,000 policyholders, inviting those who may have an inappropriate policy to consult one of the company's own agents. Policyholders on whom not enough information is available will be asked to fill in a short questionnaire detailing their financial circumstances. The company has promised Lautro that its full review of the policies will be completed by November 30. Mr Newton Scott, general manager, marketing and sales at Scottish Widows, said the company had reduced the number of tied agency firms it used to 143 from 184 at the end of last year. 'Some firms were not capable of producing enough quality business. Some are not complying and are not meeting the sort of standards we wanted,' he said. Scottish Widows sells 90 per cent of its policies through IFAs but is trying to create a direct sales force which is scheduled to be in place at the beginning of next year. In cases where an unsuitable product is found to have been sold, Scottish Widows will try to replace the policy with a more suitable one. If it does not have a suitable policy available or if a life product was not the best form of investment for the client, the company is obliged by the Financial Services Act to restore them to the financial situation they would have been in had they not taken the contract.</p>

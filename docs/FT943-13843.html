			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Management: Desert island manager - Sir John Harvey-Jones Sir John Harvey-Jones, former chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries and now a leading management consultant, is undaunted by the prospect of life on a desert island. His years in the Royal Navy as a submariner and latterly as a solo yachtsman have taught him how to cope with being alone. What would you need to run your business life? I would need a computer with a modem to collect E-mail. I would sign on to the Internet and that would give me access to virtually any area of debate I wanted to get into. I came to computers fairly late in life. One of my great regrets is that I never learned to type properly; I am still a two finger man. I could do a lot of business by phone but I really prefer to meet face to face. All my work is about persuading people. For that you need direct contact to be able to read someone's body language. Would you miss the hub-bub of an office? I am quite good at being on my own. I an interested in nature, particularly birds. We have a Noah's Ark of animals at my home. From being at sea I get an almost sensual pleasure at changes in the seasons. But I am not introspective. I need to reach out to relate to others. Would you become a beach bum? I am pretty self disciplined. I would not just fall into apathy under a palm tree. For many years I have woken at between 5.30am and 6.00am. I would continue to do that, although I can sleep at anytime, for anytime. So I can lie down for 20 winks and be out for hours unless someone wakes me. How would you keep fit? My life has been dedicated to being unhealthy. The business of cleaning and tidying up would be enough to keep me in trim. The one characteristic which successful people have in common is that they are robust, physically and mentally. You could have one book and one film. The book would be Loom of Language by Frederick Bodmer about philology. The film would be a CD-Rom guide to the National Gallery in London. You can have one type of food. Vegetarian curry with rice. I am very nearly a vegetarian and always eat vegetarian curry when we are in India. One person could accompany you. Who? It would have to be my wife. We have been married for 47 years, but one cost of the kind of life I lead is that we have not spent as much time together as we would like. There are still so many ranges of experience we have not explored. What would be the frustration of being stranded? Not being able to contribute to the debate about business in Britain. It is old fashioned I know but I was brought up to believe that duty was very important, that you should contribute something to your country and that if you did not you were not much of a person.</p>

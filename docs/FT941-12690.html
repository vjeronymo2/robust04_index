			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Thai Farmers Bank strengthens to Bt8bn Thai Farmers Bank (TFB), Thailand's second largest bank and the first to report last year's full results, yesterday announced a 52 per cent rise in net profits to Bt7.94bn (Dollars 313.8m) in 1993 from Bt5.21bn in 1992. TFB's earnings surpassed the estimates of most stock market analysts, and the figures suggest that the country's unofficial cartel of 15 commercial banks has weathered a campaign by the central bank to reduce wide spreads between banks' lending and deposit rates. Since the start of last year, Thai banks have lost billions of dollars of lending business to the Eurobond market, where Thai companies can borrow at much lower rates than at home. Thai banks, however, have profited from a very low cost of funds caused by high liquidity, especially in the fourth quarter of last year, and higher lending to small customers as the Thai economy grows at about 8 per cent a year. TFB's loan book rose 21 per cent to Bt361.96bn last year from Bt299.85bn in 1992, and the company predicted outstanding loans would rise a further 23 per cent this year. Total assets rose 21 per cent last year to Bt441.60bn from Bt363.61bn in 1992. Pre-tax profit was up 53 per cent at Bt11.44bn in 1993, compared with Bt7.48bn the previous year, while earnings per share rose 37 per cent to Bt9.93 from Bt7.27. The Thai authorities want to expose Thai banks to more foreign competition by increasing the opportunities in Thailand for foreign banks with branches or offshore banking licences. But the process will be gradual enough to allow domestic banks to improve their efficiency. 'We are not overly worried quite frankly by foreign competition,' said Mr Chulakorn Singhakowin, president of Bank of Asia, recently. 'I'd like to see a foreign bank competing profitably in Ubon Ratchathani.'</p>

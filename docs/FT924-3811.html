			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Caution follows sterling euphoria a recent term of endearment among foreign exchange dealers - rose more than 7 pfennigs this week. From DM2.41 at Monday's open, it climbed to DM2.4875 at last night's close, prompting suggestions that sterling's fortunes had turned the corner. Currency analysts yesterday recommended caution. Sterling may not be about to fall below DM2.40, but many factors behind its recent surge are temporary. The main forces buoying sterling this week were: Turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism. The pound benefited from its more stable position away from the strains that have rocked other European currencies, in particular the French franc. Hopes for an economic recovery. Strong money supply data at the beginning of the week hinted at a recovery in retail sales. Repatriation of funds. Many fund managers who reduced their exposure to sterling over the summer were tempted to repatriate funds this week, particularly from France, where there was concern that the franc might be devalued. Sterling also benefited from flows out of the Far East, where political tensions unnerved investors. Longer-term prospects for sterling are more mixed. Its main drawback is the economy's continued weakness. The outlook in other European countries is even duller as Germany moves into recession. Mr Stephen Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said: 'One positive influence on sterling will be the fact that next year interest rates in the UK will probably hit bottom, but in Germany lending rates will be falling right through 1993.' By last night, many analysts, looking beyond recent boosts, were confident that the pound had established a firm floor at about DM2.40. A small fall in the Central Statistical Office's shorter leading index, which indicates turning points in the economy about four months in advance, suggests further falls in output before the end of the year. The latest cyclical indicators from the CSO point to more bad news before Christmas and in the new year, but a rise later next year.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Observer: Publish and be wary . . . No translator would presumably dare tone down the attack on Maastricht made by former Bundesbank board member Wilhelm Nolling in the text of his book just out in Germany. But it looks as though Macmillan will bowdlerise the title when it publishes the English version. In German the combative tome is called Unser Geld (Our Money), and subtitled 'The struggle for currency stability in Europe'. In it Nolling lambasts politicians for cobbling together a fundamentally flawed treaty, claiming that the injection of a single currency will infect Europe with instability. Best leave European monetary policy to the Bundesbank, he suggests, adding that Germany should keep the D-Mark. Nolling, a member of the Social Democrat party, made a name for himself as one of the most fiery members of the Bundesbank's council. After fiercely criticising Chancellor Kohl's policies on monetary unification with eastern Germany and over the Maastricht treaty, he left at the end of last year to pursue academic and publishing interests. So why is Macmillan wet-blanketing Nolling's expose under the yawn-inducing title 'Monetary policy in Europe after Maastricht'? 'We don't talk about money in quite the same way here,' sniffs editor Belinda Holdsworth. Her rivals at Heinemann have no such qualms. When the FT's David Marsh penned his Bundesbank tome, he had to tone down Heinemann's suggested title - from 'The Bank that rules the world', to 'The Bank that rules Europe'.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MORE TALKING THE BETTER  </P> <P> There are conflicting accounts of how a routine traffic stop south of Los  Angeles erupted into a shootout between sheriff's deputies and members of the  Nation of Islam that left one Muslim dead and another wounded. But one fact is  indisputable: In the past, violent incidents like this have been the precursors  of more serious confrontations. That must not be allowed to happen this time.  </P> <P> What's especially troubling about Tuesday's incident is the fact that it  followed by only two weeks a remarkably similar, but non-lethal, confrontation  between Black Muslims and officers of the Los Angeles Police Department. The  LAPD's handling of that confrontation's aftermath served as a model for what  the Sheriff's Department did on Wednesday. Like the LAPD, the Sheriff's  Department arranged meetings with leaders of the Nation of Islam and leaders of  the black community to defuse tensions. Ironically, the apparently productive  LAPD meeting with the Muslims took place the day before Tuesday's incident with  the sheriff's deputies.  </P> <P> Enlightened law-enforcement authorities un- derstand that many black Americans  are inspired by the powerful message of self-respect and self-sufficiency that  the Nation of Islam offers. But it's also true that the Nation of Islam is a  controversial organization, to say the least. Its best-known leader, Louis  Farrakhan, has given some virulently anti-Semitic speeches. And rank-and-file  Black Muslims tend to have a direct and assertive style some authorities find  threatening.  </P> <P> Such an attitude may have contributed to the recent incidents involving the  police. Cops are also trained to be assertive, taught to stand their ground in  order to maintain command of the often dangerous situations in which they find  themselves. That's why communication -- the simple act of talking with and  trying to understand each other -- is necessary. For both the Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Department and the Nation of Islam, the time for that process  is now. Both sides must start understanding each other better before the  problem gets even more out of hand.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the </F> Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, by Josko Dadic; place and  date not given: "If Bosnia-Herzegovina Falls, We Will Join  Croatia!"]    [Text] [Dadic] Let us begin with the most topical issue --  the situation in the valley of the Lasva, i.e. central Bosnia.  How does one intend to help the Croats in besieged enclaves in  central Bosnia or are they simply sentenced to death?    [Prlic] One thing is for sure -- we help those enclaves and  will keep helping them as much as we can. I cannot reveal  details on how we intend to help them survive, for everything  depends on the outcome of present Croat-Muslim negotiations, but  I can say that it is a combination of political and military  solutions.    [Dadic] Was the attempted breakthrough of the HVO [Croatian  Defense Council] to reach Novi Travnik via Gornji Vakuf, which  began when General Roso was appointed commander of the HVO,  interrupted due to a military failure or as a consequence of a  political decision?    [Prlic] This is a strictly military question and I do not  want to reveal any details. The fact is that the HVO managed to  keep their defense line and that HVO units hold some important  points in that area.    [Dadic] Is there a strong possibility that the HVO units  might blow up the explosives factory in Vitez?    [Prlic] Yes, that is a strong possibility.  <H5>  Muslim-Serb Offensive Is Possible! </H5>   [Dadic] What is your opinion about the proposal of the  Croatian opposition to request the Security Council to put the  valley of the Lasva under UN protection?    [Prlic] We officially filed that proposal already five  months ago, demanding that besieged Croatian enclaves be  declared safe zones under UN protection, so that this proposal  of the Croatian opposition does not say anything new.    [Dadic] Do you think that, after the possible fall of  besieged Croatian enclaves, the Muslims and the Serbs could join  in an attempt to gain access to the sea, regardless of whether  they will use military or political means?    [Prlic] Everything is possible in this war, and that as  well.    [Dadic] The Vance-Owen plan planned to give 24 percent of  the territory to the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina and after it  failed, the Owen-Stoltenberg plan talks about 17 percent. It  seems possible that another plan might give even less to the  Croats, since they presently militarily hold only 9 percent of  the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Prlic] I do not agree that the Croats presently hold only 9  percent of the territory. We control a far bigger territory,  but the problem lies in the fact that they are not tied into one  whole. And with regard to the comparison of the Vance-Owen and  Owen-Stoltenberg's peace plan, many are wrong here, for those  two plans significantly differ in their content. The Vance-Owen  plan did not give the Croats 24 percent of the territory but  provinces where the Croats constituted a majority, which greatly  differs from what is offered by the Owen-Stoltenberg plan.    [Dadic] The fact is that the Croats do not completely  control a single town.    [Prlic] The Croats did not have absolute majority in any  town. That was the case in Banja Luka, Zenica, Tuzla, and  Sarajevo, and those are facts we cannot deny. Indeed, the  Croats made up a large percentage in many towns, but there were  nowhere a majority, and that is a fact. We consider Mostar the  capital of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, and it is a  fact that there was approximately an equal percentage of the  Croats and of the Muslims. In Mostar, the Party of Democratic  Action was proposed forming the authorities according to the  principle of parity -- 50:50 -- but the Muslims did not agree to  that. The Croats never said that Mostar was an exclusively  Croat town. It does belong to the Croats, but also to other  nations which live there.    [Dadic] Does that mean that Herceg-Bosnian authorities agree  to divide power in Mostar and thereby give up liberating the  entire town?    [Prlic] It is normal that people who live in that town  participate in the authorities. You cannot expect the Croats to  hold 100 percent of the authorities while there are 50 percent  of the Muslims living in that town. The problem of Mostar will  have to be solved by its inhabitants, the local population.  Consequently, in Mostar, there will be no room for all the  newcomers and refugees who changed the demographic structure and  who were the main element of destabilization of situation and  later on caused military conflicts in this town.    [Dadic] Can this problem be solved peacefully at all,  since the Croats and the Muslims are still fighting each other  in Mostar.    [Prlic] That is a quite difficult process, but do we have  any alternative?    [Dadic] In his interview for GLOBUS, Mile Akmadzic, who is  presently negotiating for the Herceg-Bosnian side, did not give  a categorical answer to the question whether Mostar would remain  a part of Herceg-Bosna.    [Prlic] Mostar will remain in Herceg-Bosna, that is for  sure.  <H5>  What Does S. Praljak's Letter of Resignation Say? </H5>   [Dadic] Do you still think that the union of  Bosnia-Herzegovina republics is possible?    [Prlic] That is the only remaining possibility to preserve  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a country.    [Dadic] In the event of the final disintegration of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, will Herceg-Bosna join Croatia?    [Prlic] Herceg-Bosna will never be the first to leave  Bosnia-Herzegovina and secede unilaterally. If the union of  Bosnia-Herzegovina republics is possible, Herceg-Bosna will  remain a part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, if  Bosnia-Herzegovina should nevertheless disintegrate as a result  of secession of one of other two republics, then Herceg-Bosna  would have no alternative but to join Croatia.    [Dadic] How true are rumors that Mate Boban will no longer  be the president of Herceg-Bosna and that Mile Akmadzic will  take his position?    [Prlic] I do not know anything about that. Mate Boban is  the president of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna and Mile  Akmadzic is the minister for international cooperation, and that  is all I can tell you.    [Dadic] Why does Boban no longer participate in  negotiations?    [Prlic] Our foreign minister participated in talks with Mr.  Granic, and I think that is normal.    [Dadic] Why was Slobodan Praljak replaced?    [Prlic] Slobodan Praljak resigned from his position as the  head of the HVO, due to illness, and I personally read his  letter of resignation.    [Dadic] The rumor has it that he left because the Old Bridge  of Mostar was destroyed.    [Prlic] Praljak left before the bridge was destroyed.    [Dadic] Will General Roso manage to reorganize the HVO?    [Prlic] The process of reorganization is under way and it is  moving at an optimal rate. We have already had some results,  but also some difficulties in the process. However, the  direction of reorganization was defined and we are trying to  stick to it as much as we can.    [Dadic] Is it true that members of the HVO from Kiseljak,  who allegedly made a few fatal mistakes in defending Vares and  thereby caused the fall of that town, are to blame for that?    [Prlic] No, that is not true. Every time a town is  conquered or an area is lost, there are rumors that it was  either sold or betrayed or that someone else is to blame rather  than those who lived in that town and were supposed to defend  it. It was very difficult to defend and keep Vares, especially  since it was attacked by two Muslim corps. Vares had one  brigade of 1,500 soldiers and a frontline about 60 km long. The  involvement of the Tuzla corps was here crucial and totally  unexpected.    [Dadic] But, that happened after the atrocities committed by  Croatian units in Stupni Dol.    [Prlic] Yes, and we are making an investigation with regard  to Stupni Dol and we will reveal its results to the public. But  there are difficulties in carrying out that investigation, for  the HVO does not control that area and it is not possible to get  all relevant information necessary to get the whole picture.    [Dadic] When will you pull out the Vares HVO brigade  "Bobovac," whose men are still practically a buffer between the  Serbs and the Muslims on the area of several square kilometers  near Vares?    [Prlic] That brigade holds a part of the Vares municipality  and it is a matter of strategic, military, and other estimates  how the brigade will be used in the future.   <H5>    (Un)Controversial Departure for Banja Luka </H5>   [Dadic] Tell us about future county organization of  Herceg-Bosna?    [Prlic] The Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna will be  organized in four counties: Herzegovinian-Hum, Zavrsje-Ram,  Bosnia-Lasva, and the county of Bosanska Posavina.    [Dadic] However, politicians from Bosanska Posavina decided  to establish their own province and thus said "no" to the  planned county of Bosanska Posavina.    [Prlic] There is a large number of refugees in that area,  approximately 120,000, and it is possible that there are some  ideas which are not quite realistic. The county of Bosanska  Posavina has a high level of independence as it always did, but  there were no people who could perform important functions.  Regarding stories about autonomy, let me ask the advocates of  that idea -- autonomy from what? For, autonomy is usually  founded by a nation which constitutes a minority, which is not  the case here. Certain processes are going on in Posavina and  the government is prepared to consider all political options.    [Dadic] Your departure for Banja Luka, a couple of months  ago, was controversial. Not long after you returned, several  Croats were killed in the vicinity of that town, and a large  group of Croats were exiled. To what extent are such visits to  Chetnik centers justified, in your case, the visit to Banja Luka?    [Prlic] First of all, that information that some Croats were  killed is not true.    [Dadic] But the Banja Luka Bishop Komarica wrote that in his  letter.    [Prlic] I stay in contact with Bishop Komarica and he is  really doing his best to improve the position of the Croats  living in that area in a very difficult situation. I think that  there have been some results with regard to that. Most  importantly, the Croats are no longer mobilized into the Serbian  Army and I think that is an extremely important achievement. In  most parts, we managed to get free passage for humanitarian  convoys for the Croats and we are trying to organize a special  surgery and even a hospital in Banja Luka which would employ  Croats.    [Dadic] What do the Serbs get in return for granting  concessions for those Croats you mentioned from Herceg-Bosnian  authorities?    [Prlic] Nothing.    [Dadic] Nothing?    [Prlic] Nothing, this simply a matter of reciprocity, for a  large percentage of the Serbs live in Mostar and other areas of  the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna.  <H5>  No Conflicts With the Church </H5>   [Dadic] Will the "Serbian republic" and Herceg-Bosna  recognize each other?    [Prlic] Yes, if there is a union of three republics; in that  case, the mere formation of the union will imply the existence  of three republics in Bosnia-Herzegovina which will recognize  each other.    [Dadic] We have noticed a rift between the authorities and  the Catholic Church in Herceg-Bosna.    [Prlic] No, there is no such rift. I think that is  exaggerated. The Church is an institution and we know how  valuable it is. The Church will stay, and politics will change.  My view is clear, and I presented it to church officials on  several occasions -- I am the head of executive authorities in  the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, i.e. I implement a  certain politics and I do not want to be an instrument of the  Church or to suit their interest, nor will we use the Church for  realizing certain political interests.    [Dadic] Still, the guardian of the Franciscan monastery in  Siroki Brijeg, father Jozo Zorko, reproaches Herceg-Bosnian  politicians for avoiding the church, ignoring it, and  manipulating it today, almost like the communists did before.    [Prlic] I have already mentioned instrumentalization and I  think I was clear enough. Otherwise, one must find faults in  everything, even in politics, and I am more critical than many  others with regard to the operationalization of politics and  functioning of the authorities. However, if we want to retrieve  the legal system, then we have to support those authorities in  their attempt to do that. If not, if we criticize the present  authorities too much, that will lead to chaos and anarchy.    [Dadic] To what extent has the Government of Herceg-Bosna  managed to revitalize the legal system and succeed in fighting  black-marketing in Herzegovina?    [Prlic] Most of those rumors about this area were proved  unfounded. Today it is obvious that Herceg-Bosna simply served  as a cover for black-marketing in Croatia.    [Dadic] What are the main mistakes of the Herceg-Bosnian  authorities which caused the loss of a large part of  Herceg-Bosna?    [Prlic] There were mistakes, first of all in the operative  realization of some functions, both in the army and in other  segments. However, we must consider the fact that the ratio of  powers in the war between the Croats and the Muslims is several  times higher in favor of the Muslims. On the other hand, due to  information that there would be an agreement with the Muslims,  as well as due to various negotiations with the Muslim side,  many military operations were stopped.    Still, the main problem was that, outside the Croatian  republic of Herceg-Bosna, we had seven elite HVO brigades which,  if they withdrew to the area of Herceg-Bosna, would strengthen  the defense line and the situation would be quite different.  But we had no strength for making that political decision, due  to many factors which should be evaluated in the future.  <H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5> <H5>  "Soldiers Blocked the Government!" </H5>   While we were wrapping up the interview with Jadranko Prlic,  we suddenly heard heavy marching in the hall and soon also some  shouting in the office of Prlic's secretary. Prlic thanked us  for the interview and immediately went out to see what was going  on. He then went to the conference room with a couple of  soldiers and his associates. We wanted to leave the building,  but we were met by a large group of armed soldiers at the  entrance, who literally blocked the building of the  Herceg-Bosnian Government. A whole battalion came to protest,  for they had not received their salaries for three months, and  its representatives went to talk to the head of the  Herceg-Bosnian Government. They kindly asked us to go back into  the building. "Not even Tito-Mate Boban will leave here until  we get paid," said one of them. Only after an hour and a half,  after Prlic himself intervened, could we leave the building, but  no one else, members and personnel of the government, was  allowed to leave. Agreement was reached only one hour later.</p>

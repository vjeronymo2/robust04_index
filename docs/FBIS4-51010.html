			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung and Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] China has given tacit approval to the Government's  latest request for funds for airport-related projects, giving  another strong signal of an end to the two-year wrangle over how  to finance the Chek Lap Kok plan.    In a departure from previous strategy, Chinese officials  have  refrained from criticising the Government attempt to seek more  than $1 billion from legislators for airport and rail projects.  A senior mainland official admitted they had adopted pragmatism  and acknowledged the "difficulties" raised by the British side  over the urgent need for funds to keep the projects going.    "We hope to be more pragmatic and show the spirit of mutual  accommodation to strive for an early accord," he said.    This is despite early statements made by the Chinese that  the  Government should not seek funds while the diplomatic talks on  the overall financial arrangements were still underway. "Our  major concern now is to secure a full agreement as soon as  possible," said the official.    Just one day after the Airport Committee meeting, the  Government said on Saturday it would seek funds from the  Legislative Council to build an immersed tunnel across the  railway link. Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod was quoted  as saying yesterday the Government planned to seek another "huge  amount of funds" related to the airport project from lawmakers  before the end of the current Legco session.    At a meeting with two legislators from the United Democrats  and Meeting Point, he also reportedly said that the  administration might publicise details of its fourth financing  proposal which was handed to the Chinese side in February.    It is understood the next funding request will mainly cover  the construction of the superstructure of the passenger  terminal, estimated at more than $10 billion. The Provisional  Airport Authority has already completed the design of the  terminal and it is necessary for construction to go ahead.    The Government is hoping that talks at the Airport Committee  could "go parallel" with construction of the  multi-billion-dollar project in order to minimise any delay.    A deputy director of XINHUA (the New China News Agency),  Zhang Junsheng, yesterday pressed the British side for a quick  solution to the airport issue claiming problems were "not on the  Chinese side".    "We, on our part, hope very much that there could be a  concise solution to the new airport problem. The earlier we can  reach an overall solution on the financing package, the more  conducive it would be to the new airport construction."</p>

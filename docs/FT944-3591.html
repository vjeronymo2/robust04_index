			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / New Japanese party loses Japan's new opposition party faced its first electoral test on Sunday - and failed it spectacularly. The New Frontier party, formed by the merger of nine opposition groups, was crushed by the Liberal Democratic party in local elections in the eastern prefecture of Ibaraki, near Tokyo. Voters in the traditional stronghold of the LDP rejected the message of reform preached by the NFP despite the recent arrests on bribery charges of both the prefectural governor, and a former construction minister and national parliamentary representative from Ibaraki.</p>

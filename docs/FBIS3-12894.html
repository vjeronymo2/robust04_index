In an article today, the paper adds that UN committees have  emphasized that Iraq has fully met its obligations toward the  resolutions issued against it, and that this requires that the  UN Security Council meet its obligations toward the Iraqi people  and prove its credibility to the world through the immediate  implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687.    The paper indicates that having given up his role as the  president of a superpower, Clinton has handed the command to the  Zionist lobby controlling U.S. policy, thus turning himself into  a Zionist advocate at the expense of the U.S. interests and  other peoples struggling for advancement.    AL-QADISIYAH explains that U.S. world policy is dominated by  arrogant and haughty tendencies and by the logic of force,  paying no attention to other peoples' rights. Such a policy,  the paper says, must backfire against its makers, leading them  to the abyss.    Concluding its article, AL-QADISIYAH says that when Clinton  attempts to oppose the progress of a lively people such as the  Iraqi people, who are supported by all struggling peoples, or  when he threatens other nations with sanctions unless they give  up their own interests in favor of U.S. interests, he should  realize that the law of life and the logic of evolution say that  the future is made by creative, lively peoples who are enriched  by experiences and hardened by ordeals.</p>

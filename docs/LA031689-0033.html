			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE SCALES DOWN HOTEL'S SIZE BUT NOT AMENITIES  </P> <P> Plans for Glendale's proposed downtown hotel and convention center have been  scaled down in size, but not in amenities.  </P> <P> The latest design proposal unanimously approved Tuesday by the Glendale  Redevelopment Agency calls for a 350-room, 18-story hotel to be built on the  south side of Glenoaks Boulevard between Central Avenue and Brand Boulevard.  </P> <P> The developer, Red Lion Inns of Vancouver, Wash., proposed building a 403-room,  20-story tower in December.  </P> <P> While city officials had approved the preliminary design of the larger project,  they said they were concerned about a series of complex issues involving  traffic circulation and congestion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Limitation OKd  </P> <P> Red Lion had agreed to a 350-room limitation when it was awarded the  development rights two years ago.  </P> <P> Thomas W. Henry, vice president of design and development for the hotel chain,  said architects revised plans after meeting with city officials and  consultants.  </P> <P> The latest proposal calls for dramatic step-backs in the upper floors of the  tower on both the north and south facades, which will allow for larger rooms  and suites with corner windows, balconies and sweeping views.  </P> <P> New plans for traffic circulation will include a private street through the  hotel garage allowing access from Glenoaks Boulevard and Arden Avenue. Drop-off  points for the hotel lobby will be separated from the entrance to the  convention wing with its ballroom and banquet areas.  </P> <P> Frank Fuller of ELS Design Group of Berkeley, the city's consultant, said the  "design of the hotel has genuinely improved" with plans that offer more  "creativity and excitement," such as changes in the form of the building and  abundant landscaping that will include a large fountain. He said the changes  represent "a large improvement in quality . . . which will be readily perceived  by hotel users."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lush Setting  </P> <P> Barbara Knight, acting deputy redevelopment director, said one of the most  unusual aspects of the urban hotel will be its lush park-like setting. The  Verdugo Wash, which separates the hotel site from Glenoaks, will be covered  with concrete and landscaped as part of the park, city officials said. It is  the first such proposal in Glendale to cover and use a channel owned by the Los  Angeles County Flood Control District.  </P> <P> Perry Burr, a San Francisco landscape architect working with the developer,  said landscaping over the wash is a particularly "critical issue." He said  berms seven feet high and taller will be created to provide enough soil to  support large conifers and flowering trees.  </P> <P> "It's essentially planting on top of concrete," he said. The berms will also  serve to buffer noise from surrounding streets.  </P> <P> "The architecture of the building and the park environment around it will make  the project one of the more unique hotels in Southern California," Fuller said.  </P> <P> A final design review is scheduled in 60 days. Construction on the $36-million  project is expected to begin next fall, with completion projected for the  spring of 1991.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The legislating creativity of the Russian president  who has recently signed two packages of economic decrees is  explained by the fact that the Russian government lacks the  necessary powers and was acting quite slowly over the recent  months.    This statement was made by Deputy Economics Minister Sergey  Vasiliyev at a news conference in Moscow Wednesday. He  categorically dismissed "speculations of various kinds" about  "an alleged dual power in the management of the economy, that of  the government and the presidential staff."    Vasiliyev pointed out that the first package had been  prepared solely by government experts, while "only one  representative of the presidential team attended to the  development of the other one."    As another reason for Boris Yeltsin's interference into  economics, Vasiliyev indicated the fact that the State Duma  "could not bake laws like cakes" as there is a procedure for  their adoption.</p>

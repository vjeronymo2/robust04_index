			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 5 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of  State Christopher finally confirmed that the demand for the  repeal of the "National Security Law" [NSL] in South Korea is  not a personal opinion but an official stand of the United  States, the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) of South Korea  reported.    Answering a question put by the MBC on the evening of March  3, he made it clear that, although the repeal of the  controversial "National Security Law" of South Korea was a  sensitive matter, the U.S. Government would persuade South  Korea to repeal it.    He added that this demand of the United States to South  Korea  was motivated by its fear that the "National Security Law" might  be abused.    This final confirmation of the U.S. State secretary came  shortly after the South Korean puppet Foreign Ministry announced  on March 3 that the remarks of U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary  of State Hubbard urging the repeal of the "National Security  Law" in South Korea had "turned out" to be an "expression of  his personal hope", not the official position of the United  States.</p>

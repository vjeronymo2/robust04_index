			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the incident in which train operations  were stopped in Kwangju due to the sit-in demonstration by  students from the Federation of Students Councils in Kwangju and  South Cholla Province [Namchongnyon], train operations were  interrupted again at Yongdungpo Railway Station in Seoul today  for 40 minutes while the police dispersed violent demonstrations  of students and farmers.    On the other hand, the police decided to arrest some 90  university students today in addition to some 30 students it had  already arrested on 18 June.    Reporter Kim Song-chin reports:    [Begin Kim Song-chin recording] Students and farmers,  members  of the General Federation of National Farmers Associations, held  a rally in Yoido, Seoul this afternoon opposing the National  Assembly ratification of the Urguay Round accord. After the  rally, they attempted to march toward the National Assembly  Hall, but were stopped by riot police. Some 200 demonstrators,  students and farmers, stormed the Yongdungpo Railway Station  compound. As a result, train operations stopped there for a  while.    The students and farmers who stormed into the railway  station  compound blocked train operations, and some of them occupied the  tracks. Train operations on the Seoul-Pusan line and the Honam  line, as well as electric train operations, were interrupted for  some 40 minutes. The police arrested some 70 students and  farmers on the spot.    On the other hand, 32 students from Namchongnyon were  arrested for their involvement in the incident in which train  operations at Songchong Railway Station, near Kwangju, were  interrupted and policemen were kidnapped. It is likely that  about 91 students will be arrested for their involvement in  violent demonstrations. Thus, the total number of arrested for  the involvement in violent demonstrations will be around 120,  the largest number since the present civilian-let government  took office.    The students arrested today are those who were involved in  forcibly stopping train operations near Kwangju, including So  Il- sok, Choson University student; and those who used iron  clubs in the violent demonstrations, including Om Su-hwan, a  Hongik Universtity student.    The police said they will take strong countermeasures by  arresting all the student demonstrations leaders and taking a  stern judicial action against them. In accordance with this  step, the police have continued searching activities at  university campuses and strengthened check-up points at railway  stations and bus terminals.

At the same time, it issued a statement expressing  concerns about the recent developments. Reporter Kim Hui-chong  reports:    [Begin Kim Hui-chong recording] Through a joint press  statement of four ministers--the home minister, justice  minister, labor affairs minister, and transportation  minister--the government expressed deep concern about a possible  serious economic situation which may be created by the students'  violent demonstrations and the workers' strike in addition to  the North Korean nuclear issue. Accordingly, the government  clarified that it will take stern countermeasures against the  forces attempting to stage strikes.    At today's meeting, the government decided to ferret out  without fail those students who were involved in stopping the  train operations in the Kwangju area and in kidnapping policemen  during their violent demonstrations by mobilizing all available  police forces and to arrest not only those students who led the  demonstrations but also those who actively participated in them.    The government also decided that it will increase budgetary  support to reinforce police investigation activities and police  equipment. The government will strengthen investigation  activities to ferret out if the pro-North forces within the  country are closely linked to student activists. [end recording]</p>

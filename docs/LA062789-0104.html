			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL OVER '84 'GREENMAIL' OF DISNEY BEGINS  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County Superior Court jury heard conflicting accounts Monday of  why Walt Disney Co. directors bought out raider Saul P. Steinberg in 1984.  </P> <P> The differing versions came in opening arguments in a class-action lawsuit by  some Disney stockholders, spearheaded by stock market professionals, against  Steinberg, the company and directors.  </P> <P> The shareholders are seeking unspecified damages related to the plunge in  Disney's stock price after the Burbank-based film and theme-park company bought  Steinberg's 11% stake in the company at above-market prices, resulting in a  $59-million profit for Steinberg. While held under court order in a special  fund, the money has grown to about $100 million with interest.  </P> <P> The varying interpretations of the events of five years ago provided trails  leading in a number of different directions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Described as Farsighted  </P> <P> The stockholders contend that the 1984 Disney board was acting in its own  self-interest and was unfaithful to shareholders in paying Steinberg at the  expense of shareholders. Their attorney, J. Michael Hennigan, wanted to use the  expression "greenmail" to describe the above-market-value payment in his  opening statement since it was used in court papers, but Judge Abby Soven would  not permit it.  </P> <P> An attorney for the directors described the board as farsighted and wise in  warding off a hostile takeover and a breakup of the company.  </P> <P> And the interpretation from Steinberg's corner was of feisty and resourceful  directors virtually strong-arming the raider into selling his stock. That view  was offered by Arthur L. Liman, a New York attorney for Steinberg who became  nationally recognized in representing the Senate in the Iran-Contra hearings.  </P> <P> The attorneys all have the task of reconciling their versions of events to such  facts as the board's decision to seek the resignations of Disney's top officers  shortly after the buyout. Roy E. Disney, nephew of the company founder,  rejoined the board afterward and helped bring in the Michael D. Eisner  management team, which has been behind the company's soaring profits.  </P> <P> The parties did generally agree that Disney is a company with a unique place in  American culture. Therefore, they contend, its brush with nearly being  dismantled is seen as likely to be of more than routine public interest.  </P> <P> Hennigan told the jury that "one of the most feared raiders on Wall Street  extracted" his gains by threatening a takeover.  </P> <P> Steinberg was aided by a then-unprecedented agreement with investment banker  Drexel Burnham Lambert to avoid helping anyone take over Disney for two years,  the lawyer added. Drexel, which acted as financial adviser to Steinberg's  Reliance Insurance and related firms, is a defendant in the case, along with  Disney's investment banker, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eisner Team Not Criticized  </P> <P> Hennigan made it clear to the jurors, who said during their selection that they  had enjoyable visits to Disneyland, that he was not criticizing the Eisner  management at Disney.  </P> <P> He said that during the reign of Ronald W. Miller, former chief executive,  market professionals saw the company as undervalued. The lawyer added that this  is "a nice way of saying mismanaged."  </P> <P> Michael Diamond, attorney for the individual Disney defendants, told the jury  that the directors exercised their best judgment in the Steinberg affair. The  evidence will show they were correct and that this benefited the company and  stockholders who held on to their stock, he added.  </P> <P> While conceding that all was "not perfect" at the company in 1984, Diamond said  the board had a five-year plan to develop the firm and was able to "save the  company."  </P> <P> Liman portrayed the Disney directors as being far from the image of caving in  to Steinberg. Rather, he said, the board "played hardball" and blocked his  client by aggressive means. The culmination, he said, was the board's threat to  have the company mount an offer for its stock that would make it almost  inoperable if Steinberg resisted.  </P> <P> He said the emissary who carried the message to Steinberg was one of his  friends, Laurence A. Tisch, presently CBS president and chief executive. That,  said Liman, was when Steinberg gave up and met Disney's demands.  </P></p>

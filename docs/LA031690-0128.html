			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NRC SIGNS FULL-POWER LICENSE FOR SEABROOK  </P> <P> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Thursday signed a full-power license for  the Seabrook nuclear power plant, ending any chance that opponents will be able  to prevent it from operating before court appeals are completed.  </P> <P> "This is a major victory for New England consumers," said Edward Brown,  president of New Hampshire Yankee, which operates Seabrook.  </P> <P> "Our 17-year licensing saga is over."  </P> <P> But opponents said the legal battle to shut down the plant would continue.  </P> <P> "We have not yet begun to fight," said Scott Denman, director of the Safe  Energy Communication Council, an anti-Seabrook group that has been assisting in  the legal battle. "The lawsuit will go on, and the final outcome is yet to be  known."  </P> <P> Thomas Murley, director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, made  the license official two weeks after the commission voted to allow the New  Hampshire plant to operate commercially. The NRC placed a two-week hold on its  vote to allow time for filing court appeals.  </P> <P> Commission spokesman John Kopeck said Thursday that the license had been  signed.  </P> <P> The signing came a day after the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington refused to  block the issuance of the license.  </P></p>

He said Myanmar hotel and  tourism services should be developed according to Myanmar  culture and tradition. He suggested that local Myanmar products  should be used in hotel construction, Myanmar cuisine should be  promoted, and traditional Myanmar entertainment should be  offered. He said emphasis should also be placed on promoting  and expressing Indonesia's willingness to cooperate.    Lt. Gen. Kyaw Ba thanked the Indonesian minister for the  suggestions and invited him for further visits.</p>

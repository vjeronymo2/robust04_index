This Appendix neither creates additional obligations nor detracts from obligations otherwise contained in the standard. It is intended to provide explanatory information and educational material to employers and employees to foster understanding of, and compliance with, the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sections 1915.11 through 1915.16.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These standards are minimum safety standards for entering and working safely in vessel tanks and compartments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 1915.11(b)&blank;Definition of ``Hot work.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are several instances in which circumstances do not necessitate that grinding, drilling, abrasive blasting be regarded as hot work. Some examples are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Abrasive blasting of the hull for paint preparation does not necessitate pumping and cleaning the tanks of a vessel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Prior to hot work on any hollow structure, the void space should be tested and appropriate precautions taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 1915.11(b)&blank;Definition of ``Lower explosive limit.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The terms lower flammable limit (LFL) and lower explosive limit (LEL) are used interchangeably in fire science literature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 1915.11(b)&blank;Definition of ``Upper explosive limit.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The terms upper flammable limit (UFL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are used interchangeably in fire science literature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 1915.12(a)(4). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  After a tank has been properly washed and ventilated, the tank should contain 20.8 percent oxygen by volume. This is the same amount found in our normal atmosphere at sea level. However, it is possible that the oxygen content will be lower. When this is the case, the reasons for this deficiency should be determined and corrective action taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An oxygen content of 19.5 percent can support life and is adequate for entry. However, any oxygen level less than 20.8 percent and greater than 19.5 percent level should also alert the competent person to look for the causes of the oxygen deficiency and to correct them prior to entry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 1915.12(b)(4)&blank;Flammable atmospheres. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Atmospheres with a concentration of flammable vapors at or above 10 percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) are considered hazardous when located in confined spaces. However, atmospheres with flammable vapors below 10 percent of the LEL are not necessarily safe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such atmospheres are too lean to burn. Nevertheless, when a space contains or produces measurable flammable vapors below the 10 percent LEL, it might indicate that flammable vapors are being released or introduced into the space and could present a hazard in time. Therefore, the cause of the vapors should be investigated and, if possible, eliminated prior to entry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some situations that have produced measurable concentrations of flammable vapors that could exceed 10 percent of the LEL in time are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Pipelines that should have been blanked or disconnected have opened, allowing product into the space.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The vessel may have shifted, allowing product not previously cleaned and removed during washing to move into other areas of the vessel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Residues may be producing the atmosphere by releasing flammable vapor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 1915.12(b)(6)&blank;Flammable atmospheres that are toxic.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An atmosphere with a measurable concentration of a flammable substance below 10 percent of the LEL may be above the OSHA permissible exposure limit for that substance. In that case, refer to &sect;1915.12(c) (2), (3), and (4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 1915.13(b)(4), &sect;1915.15(c), and &sect;1915.15(e).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The frequency with which a tank is monitored to determine if atmospheric conditions are being maintained is a function of several factors that are discussed below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

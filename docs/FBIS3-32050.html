			<p>Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Teleprensa" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said today  Guatemala's aspirations at the next UN Human Rights Commission  meeting are not limited to being transferred from one category  to the other among the nations that are a matter of concern to  the international community on this issue [sentence as heard];  on the contrary, according to the Guatemalan president,  Guatemala seeks to be included among the nations that do fully  respect human rights.    The president's statements were made after he was asked to  give his opinion on the report presented yesterday to Congress  by Jorge Mario Garcia La Guardia, the human rights ombudsman.  De Leon Carpio answered reporters questions shortly after  swearing in Marithza Ruiz de Vielman, the new foreign minister  who replaces Arturo Fajardo Maldonado. Here is what President  de Leon Carpio said:    [Begin recording] [De Leon Carpio] I am very pleased with  this report, particularly regarding the right to life, which is  a fundamental right. I have been unable to read it all, but,  according to the comments I have read in the press and the  document that I have--although I have been unable to read it  all--there is a marked disagreement in the number of  extrajudicial deaths, in the number of missing individuals, in  the number of illegal arrests. Even though it has been  spotlighted that there are more violations--that is, more  accusations, 13,000 as opposed to 9,000 last year--half of the  year or seven months correspond to the current government. As  far as the numbers are concerned, I am satisfied.    I can say sincerely that I am satisfied that the most  credible institution--the institution that within the state is  in charge of the defense, protection, and fostering of human  rights--has issued a report in which although reality has been  highlighted, it demonstrates progress; it demonstrates effort in  these first seven months of my government.    The numbers, as I said, are very satisfying. True, there are  still serious problems with individual human rights; there are  multiple accusations of human rights abuse, of violations of  human economic, social, and cultural rights. Nevertheless, the  current government does not want to be satisfied with the fact  that out of those thousands of accusations, a lesser number of  violations were proven regarding the previous year.    The current government has the political willingness for the  nonviolation of human rights in Guatemala; this is considering  the qualitative side of human rights. At this phase and given  that the former human rights ombudsman is now the president of  the Republic, we cannot be satisfied that quantitatively we are  better off than last year. Now is the time to consider the  issue qualitatively. One cannot say human rights are being  violated more or less; this is why we must prepare the necessary  measures this year, after having consolidated the nation's  institutions, after having consolidated the democratic system,  which is still fragile. Nevertheless, we have made great  progress.    For example, one of these is the return of Communities of  Resistance People under commissions that will be made public to  you subsequently. Another example is the peace agreement that  will be signed this year, in keeping with the framework  agreement signed in Mexico. In this agreement both parties have  agreed to sign a peace agreement this year. This demonstrates  the political willingness that has to be made reality. We must  eliminate the main source, something I always mentioned as human  rights ombudsman; that is, the internal armed conflict which has  been ongoing for more than 30 years. Once this armed conflict  ends this year, fulfilling our commitment, the main cause, the  main source of human rights violations will disappear. This is  particularly true of the violations of the right to life,  integrity, physical integrity, dignity, liberty, security and so  on; therefore, there is progress.    Yesterday you witnessed the fulfillment of another  commitment: the departure of the military detachment from Tercer  Pueblo. They departed from the urban area, leaving it for those  who returned after being refugees for so many years in Mexico;  that is, we are progressing, fulfilling our commitments. This  does not mean we are not objective, that we do not accept the  reality that exists in Guatemala.    I reiterate: I am pleased with the report. We will analyze  the report, read it more carefully; nevertheless, in principle,  given the quantitative data, we are satisfied. This does not  mean we do not have to initiate many actions and efforts so that  Guatemala is not only analyzed if human rights are respected  more or less here. Qualitatively, the situation should reach a  level of absolute respect; this respect first should be of  individual human rights, followed by the respect of economic,  social, and cultural human rights. This is more difficult and  does not depend totally on the government's political  willingness, as their violations are the result of legal,  political, economic, and social structures that have prevented  the respect of these human rights.    Meanwhile, I want to say that now that the study and  analysis  of Guatemala by the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva is  drawing near, our goal is for Guatemala not to moved from one  point to the other on the agenda. Our goal is for Guatemala to  be considered as a nation where human rights are going to be  fully respected.    [Unidentified reporter] The report, it appears, has asked  for  or requested the dissolution of the Self-Defense Patrols. What  is your position?    [De Leon Carpio] This has a great advantage. In practice we  are already doing this. In those areas in which these are no  longer required--that is, the self defense committees or  patrols--they have been converted into peace and development  committees. Given their organization, once they do not have to  have weapons, it is convenient, if they wish, to continue  organizing, developing, and helping the community. This is part  of what is being done this year, and I have issued orders in  this regard. We will make public the number of patrols that  have already been turned into peace and development councils;  subsequently, this will continue to take place. In addition,  there is the advantage, or we have the advantage, of the  resumption of peace talks, where the Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity and my government will definitely broach  this issue. Given the commitment we have to sign peace this  year, at this time there will have to be a demobilization, a  disarmament of all the patrols that could still exist at that  time.    You will recall that in Huehuetenango a leader of the  Civilian Self-Defense Patrols handed me a rifle that meant, in  his words, that the moment the peace agreements are signed, he,  in a symbolic gesture, would hand me the rifle because it meant  there was no longer a need for them to be armed.    In the meantime, following recommendations not only by the  human rights ombudsman, but by the independent UN expert adviser  Dr. Monica Pinto, we have instructed that the full force of the  law be used in cases where patrolmen break the law or abuse  power through the patrols and that impunity not be encouraged or  made easy, which is often the case with these types of abuses  committed by certain patrolmen.    [Unidentified reporter] [question indistinct]    [De Leon Carpio] I appreciate the question because right  here  I have a note from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE]  requesting that the president of the Republic give Monday off  because many public employees are working at the polling tables.  It also allows many public employees who do not vote here, but  in other municipalities instead, to cast their ballot.  Regarding this, the presidency secretary general has sent the  TSE a reply note to that request and suggestion. Not only will  special permission be granted for Monday for those who work at  the polling tables, but for all public workers. This will  facilitate the comfortable move without problems, to their  respective municipalities on Monday, in addition to celebrating  the yes vote. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] that you have been in direct  contact with President Salinas. We want to know if there has  been an official communication; if the Guatemalan Government has  offered military help, in this case [words indistinct] in  Chiapas?    [De Leon Carpio] The relationship between President Salinas  de Gortari and myself has always been very direct. This  situation was strengthened even more at the meeting we held in  Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, at the Ibero-American presidential  summit. Given the situation the Guatemalan, sorry, the Mexican  people are suffering, I immediately contacted him to express my  solidarity, to express through him to the Mexican people, the  Guatemalan people and their government's grief. We know about  this because we have been suffering these consequences for more  than 30 years and we believe it is regrettable and unfair that  the Mexican people now must endure the consequences of an  insurgent force, of an armed conflict that only leaves behind  widows, orphans, destruction, death, desolation, hate, and  hostilities. We think it is unfair that the Mexican people  should endure this, as in the end it is the people who suffer  the greatest consequences. Therefore, we have been in contact;  we have indicated to him that we have full faith in his  capacity, we have faith in his government's ability.    We hope that shortly, through dialogue and measures taken by  the government, those who have mistakenly taken up arms will  reconsider their position and realize that road is obsolete  here, in Mexico, and in any part of the world. The road for  changes, the peaceful, silent revolution, is that of the  struggle, although no longer between brothers. Rather, now it  is the struggle against corruption, the struggle against  poverty, the struggle for economic and social development, and  the struggle for an overall peace with social justice for all.  We hope that this road can be reached. In this regard, there  is a close relationship. There is no offer on the part of the  Armed Forces or of the government to participate. We are very  respectful of nations' sovereignty; in this case, a neighboring,  friendly nation such as Mexico. What is certain is that we are  prepared on our side of the border, on the Guatemalan side, to  avoid any incursions by the subversive groups that have sprung  up in Mexico. [end recording]</p>

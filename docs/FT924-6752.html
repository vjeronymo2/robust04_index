			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok falls as deflation takes effect  -Thai equities have responded to a move against a market player Bangkok's SET index fell 6.4 per cent to an intraday low of 834.35 yesterday after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it had filed a case with the police against Mr Song Watcharasriroj, a well-known market player better known as Sia Song, and his associates for manipulating stock prices. The index recovered in the closing minutes to end down 23.45 at 868.04 after the finance ministry said it had set up a Bt5bn fund to shore up the market. But the move against Mr Song was the culmination of a process over the past two weeks in which Thailand's financial authorities have been deflating, qently, what they feared was an emerging and potentially dangerous stock market bubble. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index and market turnover had soared since a new coalition government was formed in September. Not all the activity, however, has been attributed to the return of political stability and the renewed confidence of investors. The authorities have been alarmed by what they see as wildly speculative buying of certain stocks and a sharp increase in loans extended by stockbrokers to their clients. Last week, amid mounting criticism of the apparently feeble attempts of the SET and the six-month-old SEC to regulate the market, the Bank of Thailand and the finance ministry stepped in. The Bank named 22 brokers with outstanding loans to clients of more than Bt1bn (Dollars 39.4m) and urged them to restrict credit. The brokers had little choice but to comply, and the market responded quickly to the new austerity. Trading volume - at times second only to Tokyo among Asian bourses - has fallen back, and the SET index has dropped from its November 5 peak of 963.03. SET officials say there was no hard evidence that stockbrokers had violated overall guidelines on credit extension, but they were concerned about very high activity in particular stocks. By September, brokers had outstanding loans of Bt62.66bn to their clients - three times as much as a year earlier  -with CMIC alone accounting for around Bt10bn. Speculators also have access to money from banks in the form of personal loans. 'There is excessive speculation in the market,' says Mr Seri Chintanaseri, SET president. 'This speculation would never have occurred if there was no expansion of credit.' Mr Asavin Chintakananda, Mr Seri's deputy, says: 'We are trying to allow some steam out of the bubble before it becomes a bubble. I think we have the matter well in hand.' The twin issues of market regulation and credit extension to speculators became particularly controversial when Mr Song took large stakes in Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC) and in Mutual Fund Co. The SEC ordered the suspension of BBC shares yesterday. Mr Song, who takes his business to several brokerages, including CMIC, was reported to have bought up to 30 per cent of BBC in collaboration with several associates. He made no offer for the rest of the company, although he ought to have done so if he did indeed control more than 25 per cent. The SET says that it has passed 11 cases of possible stock manipulation to the SEC for investigation since the Commission was established in May, but so far none has come to court and it is not clear which companies other than BBC are being investigated. The SEC, under fire because some of its members have potential conflicts of interest (one has been advising the chairman of BBC and another is head of a brokerage firm), has pleaded for more time. 'It's not that simple,' says Mr Ekamol Kiriwat, SEC secretary-general. 'How long did it take for (Michael) Milken to be in trouble?' The confusion at the SET and the SEC seems to have prompted the central bank and the finance ministry to adopt a two-track policy to steady the market. On the one hand they are seeking to curb the speculators, and on the other they are announcing as loudly as possible that the market is fundamentally strong and accurately reflects the dynamism of an economy growing at 7 or 8 per cent a year. So far, the tactic seems to be working.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Major intends to reduce Brussels legislative role The government disclosed yesterday that it wants to break the European Commission's monopoly on initiating legislation, as ministers stepped up their attacks on further European integration. In a speech to the European Policy Forum Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, the Foreign Office minister, said the present arrangements could be replaced by one which downgraded the commission's role. Looking to the 1996 intergovernmental conference, Mr Heathcoat-Amory suggested the Council of Ministers could annually agree a programme of European Union legislation after consulting the commission and the European parliament. This would tilt the balance of power away from Brussels and back towards governments. His comments came as other senior ministers confirmed that the government was to fight the June 9 European elections on an unequivocal platform of defending British sovereignty. But the opening days of the campaign - with Mr John Major putting defence of Britain's veto at the heart of his policy - caused some alarm in the pro-European wing of the party. The pro-Europeans warned that Mr Major risked making the mistake made by the then prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1989 when she waged a hostile campaign against Brussels. The tenor of that campaign persuaded many Conservative supporters not to vote. But ministers insisted that the present campaign was in tune with the mood of the electorate, apparently confirmed by private opinion polling. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor and one of the cabinet's firmest pro-Europeans, defended the tenor of the campaign as an attack on the ambitions of the Labour party's socialist allies in the EU to create a centralised superstate. But concerns voiced earlier in the week by Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, that the government was slipping into indiscriminate attacks on the EU were echoed by several Tory backbenchers. By contrast prominent Tory Euro-sceptics said they were 'delighted' by the approach adopted by Mr Major and expected him to stick to that position after the elections. Letters, Page 22</p>

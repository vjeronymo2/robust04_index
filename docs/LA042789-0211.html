			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. IMPORT PRICES CLIMB 1.7%  </P> <P> The prices Americans pay for imported goods rose 1.7% during the first three  months of 1989, down slightly from the pace in the previous quarter, the  government reported today.  </P> <P> The Labor Department said the first-quarter rise followed a 2% increase in the  final three months of last year and a 1.3% decline during the third quarter of  1988.  </P> <P> The January-March increase was primarily due to an 18.3% jump in prices for  imported fuels, led by a 27.8% surge in prices for imported crude oil in  response to a November agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting  Countries.  </P> <P> Excluding fuels, import prices rose a modest 0.5% during the first quarter  after climbing 2.4% in the previous quarter. The advance in prices for  non-energy imports was held down in part by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar  during the period, the Labor Department said.  </P></p>

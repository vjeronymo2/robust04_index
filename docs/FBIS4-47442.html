Since it is known  that many are physically and psychologically ill-suited for such  work, an effort was made to define screening criteria to be used  in selecting such personnel. The work, carried out in three  stages, involved a sample of 200 workers from drilling teams and  a control group of 200 land transportation workers. The  incidence of illness and duration of accompanying incapacity in  the study group were analyzed, but special attention also was  given to the frequency of occurrence of accidents, which are  quite common and result in inability to perform tasks for  protracted periods. These were more numerous than in the  control. Different afflictions played the most important roles  in the study and control groups and the days of work loss were  greater in the former than in the latter. Acute, chronic and  latent diseases were greater in the study group than in the  control group by a factor of 8. A psychophysiological study of  the personality was made with respect to 32 parameters,  including the implications of introversion and extroversion in  subjects of both groups, which are to be taken into account in  future screening. A wide range of physiological factors was  examined as applicable to professional selection for work in the  Far North. The results of the study have been used in  formulating rehabilitation programs. References: 17 Russian.</p>

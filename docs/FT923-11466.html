			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Carrington urges further peace talks LORD Carrington, the European Community's peace mediator on Yugoslavia, yesterday made clear he was prepared to go ahead with planned talks next week with representatives of the three warring factions in Bosnia, in spite of their failure to respect the latest ceasefire. His office said a letter had been sent to Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Serb leader, and Mr Mate Boban, the region's Croat leader, inviting them to London. Expressing his dismay at the repeated violation by all parties of the ceasefire agreement signed in London last Friday, Lord Carrington's letter said the parties could no longer blame each other. 'No one is blameless,' it said. In a television interview, Lord Carrington confirmed earlier statements that he would change his approach to the peace talks. If the warring parties wanted to come, he would try to focus their attention on working out constitutional arrangements, rather than first trying to negotiate a ceasefire agreement. Referring indirectly to the criticism expressed by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, of the lack of co-ordination between the EC and the UN peacekeeping and peacemaking operations in Bosnia, Lord Carrington said he had no objection to a widening of the EC peace conference. It is understood that Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary and current president of the European Council, gave Mr Boutros Ghali an assurance, during talks in New York on Wednesday night, that a UN representative would be welcome to take part in any of the EC-sponsored peace talks. However, in New York, a UN spokesman emphasised that opposed to the EC peace conference's plan, endorsed by the Security Council, to place under UN supervision heavy weapons held by the factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The Security Council last night scheduled further private consultations on the question. Meanwhile, Serb irregulars continued to battle with Bosnian Moslem and Croat forces in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and throughout the republic. The Serbs are trying to wrest from mainly Croat forces the control of the key towns of Derventa, Bosanski Brod and Brcko, northern Bosnia, to secure a corridor linking Serb-controlled territories. Moslem defenders of Gorazde, eastern Bosnia, again sent radio messages appealing to the outside world for help. Some 70,000 people have been trapped in the city, the last Moslem stronghold in Bosnia, for two months. In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he had written to all his EC partners asking them to reconsider their reluctance to share the growing refugee problem equally among all 12 member states. He hit out at his European partners for being too slow to recognise breakaway Yugoslav republics last year, but stressed that no western state planned to send combat troops to end the bloodshed in the region and that the only hope for peace lay in political pressure. A Saudi Arabian aircraft yesterday delivered the kingdom's first load of food and medical supplies to the beleaguered Moslems of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Reuter reports from Jeddah. A Saudi defence ministry C-130 transport hurriedly delivered 50 tonnes of supplies and Dollars 27m in cash to Sarajevo, leaving as mortar shells exploded near the airport. Saudi Arabia plans to contribute 35 planeloads of supplies to the airlift.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Sport: Around the world in 80 Tests - The problems of the weary West Indies team / Cricket The West Indies cricket team will leave the Caribbean for India in a few days, starting a global trek which will only halt, at least temporarily, in England at the end of the summer. By then the team will have had four tours, one of which will be at home, and will have played 15 test matches, and between 25 and 30 one-dayers, depending on how successful they are. Such a hectic schedule is unprecedented in modern cricket, and comes after a full English season for most of the leading players, which followed a home series against England. After India, the West Indies will go to New Zealand, hurry back home to meet Australia, and then travel to England for six tests in the summer. It is hardly surprising that the West Indies are without four stars for the tour of India. They risk playing the rest of the squad into the ground over the next year. There are many reasons for so much cricket. The West Indies are a drawing card. Names such as Brian Lara and Curtly Ambrose guarantee good crowds. And good crowds warm the hearts of cricket administrators, and fill the meagre coffers of some boards, not least that of the West Indies. The financial viability of home tours is uncertain because of the relatively small grounds and small crowds in the Caribbean. West Indian players apparently do not mind. Money for cricketers, particularly for good ones on consistently winning teams, is significant. 'A cricketer's earning life is relatively short, ending in the middle 30s if one is lucky,' says Alan Rae, who opened for the West Indies in the 1940s and early 1950s, and who is now a lawyer in Jamaica. 'So they have to secure a firm financial base to ensure a good standard of living to look after their progeny in their old age.' There are, however, obvious dangers to making so many runs while the sun shines. It is already telling on the West Indies who go to India, and perhaps to New Zealand, without several of their most experienced players. For the second time in nine months, Richie Richardson, the captain, has been forced to rest because of fatigue. Also missing will be Desmond Haynes, an opening batsman. Ambrose, who is having an operation for a shoulder injury, which could well be the result of too much cricket, and Winston Benjamin, another fast bowler, who is being disciplined following an off-the-field incident in Antigua during the final test of the England tour. India's bowlers may regard Brian Lara with more than passing concern, but batsmen such as Sachin Tendulkar, Vinod Kambli and Mohammad Azharuddin may see the inexperienced bowling support for Courtney Walsh as a chance to improve their averages. In spite of the West Indies' record and seeming invincibility (they have not lost a test series since they were beaten by New Zealand in 1980), it will be difficult for a weakened and tired team to defeat India, one of the better test teams, away. 'India will definitely have to consider themselves favourites,' says Michael Holding, the former West Indies pace bowler. 'Without Ambrose, the West Indies bowling attack cannot consistently destroy the Indian batting. I do not see any West Indies bowler who is going to give the Indian batsmen sleepless nights.' The combination which could defeat the West Indies in the next few months - too much cricket, lassitude, a weakened team and improving opposition - could also threaten the team's earning power. The West Indies are attractive only as long as they are winning. 'There is an obvious danger to the players' health from such a hectic schedule as the one the West Indies are undertaking,' says Rae. 'The players can also lose their edge from too much cricket.' Could he have withstood such rigours? 'Certainly not. I went through this at a slower pace and I could never have played county cricket for more than two or three years.'</p>

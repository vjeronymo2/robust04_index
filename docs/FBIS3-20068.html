			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>   [Text] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd today put a brave  face on what Labour described as "capitulation" by Britain in  the bitter battle over voting rights in the enlarged European  Union.    And Conservative back-bench dissidents claim that Britain  has  climbed down from her previous insistence that 23 votes should  be enough to block unwanted Brussels legislation -- even after  the enlargement of the Community to 16 in the New Year.    Now, they fear, their opponents have won the day, naming 27  votes as the blocking figure, with any concessions to Britain  still to be decided -- and still very vague.    But Mr Hurd insisted there was no question of his  resignation, declaring: "I have been operating under a very  flexible mandate given me by the Cabinet. I have no problems  about that. I have had full support from the Prime Minister and  my colleagues."    The matter will go to the Cabinet on Tuesday [29 March]. "I  have agreed to nothing," he told the BBC Radio 4 "The World This  Weekend" programme after the foreign ministers' meeting broke up  at Ioannina, in northern Greece.    But he claimed that other countries had made a "serious  move"  in Britain's direction.    And on enlargement of the EU he conceded that the four  incoming countries -- Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria --  were becoming "very anxious and distressed as the time passes  and there is no agreement. It would be a great own goal if that  British objective were denied." Mr Hurd: "What has happened is  that there has been serious work. Our position and our worries  and those of the Spaniards are more fully understood. People  have moved towards us.    ``We have said we are willing to consider a satisfactory  compromise. We are not there yet. What has happened is that  the Greeks, in the chair, put forward a paper which no one has  agreed to yet, but they have asked for comments by Tuesday night.    ``I, and indeed all the other ministers here, have to go  back  and discuss that with our colleagues at home. But I have agreed  to nothing.''    Mr Hurd said that everybody accepted that this was going to  be sorted out and gone into in depth at the 1996 conference.  "The whole relationship between the size of countries and their  votes cannot be brushed under the carpet."    When it was put to him that any concessions towards Britain  were very vague, Mr Hurd replied: "We have to decide how our  interests and those of the minority can be protected."    He said the problem would not be solved by delay. "It is  solved by how you protect that position. And that is what  everybody now has to reflect on."    Mr Hurd said that some people in the majority were worried  that the presidency paper went too far in Britain's direction.    "We have to consider ourselves very soberly whether it goes  far enough, whether there are comments we want to make."    He went on: "We shall have to make a judgment whether what  is  proposed adequately protects our interests. We will have to  judge the position of those whose entry into the European  Community we have worked for for many years.    ``They are becoming very anxious and distresed as time  passes  and there is no agreement. It would be a great own goal if that  British objective were denied.''    The Foreign Secretary: "I have been dealing with this for  weeks and trying to get a deal which is acceptable in our terms  and also allows other British objectives for enlargement to be  realised.    ``I don't know if I have got that. There has been serious  work and a serious movement in our direction. We will have to  decide whether this can be wrapped up by Easter or not.''    And asked whether he had considered resignation, Mr Hurd  replied: "One only needs to consider resignation if you are fed  up with the job, or if your colleagues or your party or country  as a whole goes off in a direction one feels oneself is  unacceptable. I am not in that position at all.    ``I have been operating under a very flexible mandate given  me by the Cabinet two weeks ago. I have no problems about that.  I have had the full support from the Prime Minister and my  colleagues.''    Later, David Blunkett, chairman of the Labour Party, told  the  Press Association: "Petulance followed by capitulation has  severely damaged Britain's standing and our bargaining position  for the future.    ``This sorry episode has done nothing to help Britain in  Europe and will in the end have severely damaged the Tory  Party.''</p>

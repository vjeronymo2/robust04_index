			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (19): You'll need to top up NI benefits - Retirement Planning INVESTORS FACE a bewildering array of different pension products, and before entering the maze it is worth going back to basics to familiarise yourself with the three main sources: occupational schemes, private individual plans and the state. Most people end up with a combination of at least two, and usually all three, elements, so it is important that you and your pensions adviser take each into consideration before planning ahead. The state scheme provides the 'old age' flat-rate pension and an earnings-related pension, both of which are based on an individual's National Insurance contribution record. NI is paid at 9 per cent by most employees. For the 1993-94 tax year, the lower and upper thresholds are Pounds 56 and Pounds 420 a week. The old-age pension is a maximum of Pounds 56.10 a week for the 1993-94 tax year, while the earnings-related pension (Serps) will be a maximum of between 20 and 25 per cent of middle-band earnings, depending on your NI record and when you retire. Middle-band earnings are those earnings that fall between the lower and upper NI thresholds. Employees who are not in a 'contracted out' company scheme or personal pension plan will automatically be in Serps. Clearly, even with a full NI record, the combination of state pensions is not going to keep you in clover. For this reason most people make extra provision, either through a company pension or through personal pensions and other similar plans. Company schemes and private individual plans approved by the Inland Revenue are extremely tax-efficient. Contributions are paid free of basic and higher-rate tax, the pension fund builds up tax-free, and a significant chunk of the accumulated fund can be taken as tax-free cash at retirement. The pension itself is taxed as income. A good company pension scheme will also provide widow's and dependants' pensions, death-in-service benefits of up to four times the member's salary, long-term disability pensions and, increasingly, membership of the group private medical scheme. Occupational schemes in the UK cover about 50 per cent of employees, representing over 11m people. Massive funds, in total estimated at Pounds 300bn, support these arrangements which are set up predominantly on a final-salary basis, although a growing number of schemes are moving to money-purchase. Under a final-salary, or 'defined benefit' scheme, the pension is linked to the value of the employee's salary at retirement. Employees usually contribute 5 to 6 per cent of salary, while most employers at least match this rate and often pay considerably more for older members. Typically, the pension builds up at the rate of 1/60th of final salary for each year of service, up to a Revenue maximum of 40/60ths, or two-thirds of final salary after 40 years' service. Where tax-free cash is taken, the pension is reduced. (Public sector schemes tend to build up on an '80ths' basis, but add the tax-free cash on top of the pension, which makes them roughly equivalent to the '60ths' schemes.) Certain high earners will find their contributions and final pension restricted by the 'earnings cap'. The cap, which represents the maximum salary that can be taken into consideration for pension purposes, was introduced in the 1989 Budget, and is worth Pounds 77,400 for the 1993-94 tax year. It applies to members of final-salary schemes set up after the 1989 Budget and members who joined any final-salary schemes after June 1, 1989. However, there are less tax-efficient 'unapproved' Revenue schemes available, which help build up pensions for earnings above the cap. Few employees achieve a full two-thirds pension at retirement, particularly if they have changed jobs several times. Fortunately, it is possible to top up a company pension by paying into an additional voluntary contribution (AVC) scheme, usually run by a life office on behalf of the employer. AVCs are individual money-purchase plans that can be used to provide extra pension either through the purchase of an annuity or, in some cases, by boosting the company pension itself. Free-standing AVCs (FSAVCs) are also available, mainly from the life offices. The maximum total contribution to the company scheme and (FS)AVC combined is 15 per cent of earnings. Group money-purchase, or 'defined contribution' schemes do not link the pension to the final salary. Instead, contributions are invested to provide a fund at retirement, which is used to purchase an annuity to provide an income for life. The value of the fund - and hence the annuity - is not guaranteed but will depend on the provider's investment performance, policy charges and the prevailing annuity rates at the time of purchase. There are two basic options under this type of group scheme - contracted-out money-purchase schemes (comps) and, by far the most popular with employers, group personal pensions. Comps are also available on a contracted-in basis, where the pension provided by the scheme sits on top of the Serps pension rather than replacing it. There are a few differences between comps and group personal pensions, but the pros and cons of each tend to be outweighed by more important factors, such as the employer's rate of contribution (sometimes nil, but generally about 3 per cent) and the investment performance of the chosen fund. Most group schemes - whether final-salary or money-purchase - are contracted out of Serps and receive a rebate of NI contributions. In return, final-salary schemes promise to provide a guaranteed minimum pension (gmp) to replace the Serps benefit foregone. Very few money-purchase schemes offer this guarantee. The self-employed and employees who do not have access to a suitable group scheme can take out a personal pension. These were introduced in 1987 and replaced the old-style self-employed retirement annuity. Although it is still possible to contribute to an existing retirement annuity, new contracts are not available. 'Appropriate' personal pensions allow employees to contract out of Serps and claim the NI rebate. This is calculated as a percentage of middle-band earnings. Almost 5m employees have taken out personal pensions and will be eligible for the rebate, which is worth up to Pounds 1,500 for the 1992-93 tax year for those earning over Pounds 21,000. The rebate is sent direct to your chosen provider, who invests it in the fund of your choice. However, a rebate-only plan will not provide a decent pension on its own, so you should also try to pay an extra contribution to top up the rebate plan. Like all money-purchase arrangements, on retirement the accumulated fund is used to provide an element of tax-free cash, and the remainder is used to purchase an annuity. Personal pensions are available from a range of financial institutions, but the market is dominated by the life offices. A handful of unit trust groups and friendly societies also run their own scheme, but most banks and building societies act as tied agents and offer the pension products of a life office. Finally, it is important to appreciate that investments in a pension scheme or AVC are locked away until retirement, and even with personal pensions you cannot take the benefits until at least age 50. For this reason, in some circumstances pensions advisers also recommend the use of other tax-efficient savings vehicles such as personal equity plans (Peps) and tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) which tie up your money for much shorter periods.  ------------------------------------------    PERSONAL PENSION: CONTRIBUTION LIMITS  ------------------------------------------ Age                      % Earnings Up to 35                 17.5 36-45                    20 46-50                    25 51-55                    30 56-60                    35 61-74                    40  ------------------------------------------</p>

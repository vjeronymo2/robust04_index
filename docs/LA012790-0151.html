			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BIOMEDICAL;  </P> <P> HOSPITAL READIES GROUP INSURANCE FOR SOUTH COUNTY  </P> <P> Saddleback Memorial Medical Center is gearing up to market a group-insurance  plan tailor-made for South Orange County's small-business community.  </P> <P> Judy Simmons, director of public relations for the 215-bed Laguna Hills  hospital, says she knows of no other instance in which a company has marketed a  group-insurance plan to such a small geographic area, adding: "We are focusing  on South Orange County from Irvine through San Clemente."  </P> <P> Through what it calls the Saddleback Health Network, the hospital is offering  an insurance-benefit package that includes its own facility, two urgent-care  centers and the services of 200 staff physicians who have agreed to provide  substantial discounts to plan members.  </P> <P> Simmons said Saddleback Hospital decided to promote insurance for small  businesses after surveying the Saddleback Valley and finding 15,000 employers,  85% of whom have fewer than 10 employees. The smaller businesses included  mom-and-pop restaurants, manufacturers, boutiques, dry cleaners and flower  shops.  </P> <P> "These small employers often have been excluded from insurance because of the  expense," Simmons said.  </P> <P> John Johnson, vice president of marketing and sales for United Insurance Co. of  America, the plan's underwriter, said test marketing has shown that small  employers in the area want a selection of insurance plans that allow employees  to share the cost to varying degrees. And some wanted an alternative plan for  employees who do not live near the Saddleback hospital.  </P> <P> Several plans, including a preferred-provider organization and more traditional  indemnity insurance, are in final design, Johnson said. He added that the plans  will be ready for a mass-mailing and telephone-marketing blitz scheduled to  begin in mid-February. Richard Jacobs, president of Voluntary Hospitals of  America West, said he may recommend a similar health-care plan to the  association's 15 other member hospitals in Los Angeles and Orange counties.  </P></p>

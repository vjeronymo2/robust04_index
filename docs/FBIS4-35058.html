			<p>BFN   <F P=106>   [News conference by Andres Pastrana, former Colombian </F> presidential candidate of the New Democratic Force party, with  unidentified domestic and foreign reporters; place not given;  broadcast in progress -- live]    [Editorial Report] Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol  Network in Spanish at 1519 GMT on 22 June broadcasts a news  conference by Andres Pastrana. Pastrana begins by saying, "the  president-elect is lying when he tried to implicate the campaign  of Andres Pastrana and Luis Fernando Ramirez in drug trafficking  activities." He then adds: "That is why I convened this news  conference; to set the record straight."    Pastrana comments on audio cassette recordings of  individuals  allegedly linking Pastrana's and President-elect Samper's  presidential campaigns to drug money. He then reads a  statement, which begins by noting that "on 15 June at the  Intercontinental Hotel in Cali, when leaving a banquet offered  by Valle del Cauca political leaders, a person delivered a tape  to me saying it was important." Pastrana then gives a  chronology of the events leading up to the disclosure of the  cassette recordings. Pastrana later reads a letter he sent to  Samper asking him to rebut charges drug money was being used for  his electoral campaign if there was nothing to hide, "a thing he  did not do."    Pastrana explains that he refused to use this recording for  electoral purposes. He states: "Knowing about this tape before  the elections, the cassette was not used for electoral  purposes." Pastrana plays a portion of the tape recording  featuring two unidentified speakers. The text of the recording  is as follows:    [First speaker] "Hello?"    [Second speaker] "Hello, how are you?"    [First speaker] "Okay, my brother.    [Second speaker] "What do you have?"    [First speaker] "The best of news."    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] I am awake."    [First speaker] "Yes?"    [Second speaker] "Yes."    [First speaker] "Okay."    [Second speaker] "Where are you?"    [First speaker] "I am at [words indistinct]."    [Second speaker] "Okay."    [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] the car?"    [Second speaker] "It will leave at approximately 1000, my  brother. Here they do not allow anyone to leave before 1000, you  understand?"    [First speaker] "Yes.    [Second speaker] "There are restrictions there, and they do  not allow you to leave. [Words indistinct]. The car will be  arriving there at a quarter to 12."    [First speaker] "[Words indistinct]."    [Second speaker] "I can anticipate that. By 1100 or 1200  sharp, the car will be in line. [Words indistinct]."    [First speaker] "Perfect."    [Second speaker] "Here we are, here we are..."    [First speaker, interrupting] "No, no, no. It does not  matter, it does not matter, it does not matter."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "Look, I met with the old man."    [Second speaker] "Good."    [First speaker] "I have the best news in the world."    [Second speaker] "Uh-huh."    [First speaker] "The best."    [Second speaker] "Yes."    [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] a hug."    [Second speaker] "Okay."    [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] is a son of a bitch."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "Huh?"    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "Yes, more or less."    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] he spoke?"    [First speaker] "Yes, more or less." [laughs]    [Second speaker] "Why have you not called Fats Garcia  again?"    [First speaker] "Oh no. That telephone has me by the balls,  man."    [Second speaker] "He says he called you."    [First speaker] [Words indistinct].    [Second speaker] "It is true you were collecting from [words  indistinct] because [words indistinct] from the..."    [First speaker, interrupting] "From the big stick?" [laughs]    [Second speaker] "Yes. I found that he was sort of, sort  of..."    [First speaker, interrupting] "No, no, no. Look, I have been  doing an artful [bellaco] job. But look, today he is going to  make a base and (?verify) it for me."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "More or less."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "Yes, more or less."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "More or less."    [Second speaker] "I will tell you how things went when you  get here."    [First speaker] "Huh?"    [Second speaker] "I will tell you how things went when you  get here."    [First speaker] [Passage indistinct].    [First speaker] "Yes, I conversed this morning..."    At this point, Pastrana interrupts the recording to say:  "Continue, continue a little more." The tape continues:    [Second speaker] "Try to call Alvaro."    Pastrana then interrupts the tape again to explain that his  campaign treasurer had turned down an offer, conveyed by  journalist Alberto Giraldo, from "some people in Cali who wished  to donate money for the campaign of Andres Pastrana." Pastrana  then continues playing the tape:    [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] it is all arranged.  [Words indistinct] I am going to tell you."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "Yes, of course. I spoke with him (?last  night). I am going to call El Gordo now."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    At this point, Pastrana interrupts the tape and states the  following:    "They also referred to Dr. Alvaro Pava. My interpretation of  this is that Journalist Giraldo said something about part of a  whole. Dr. Alvaro Pava [words indistinct] he did not manage  money and he was not the treasurer. Alvaro Pava [words  indistinct] established contact with different regions to decide  on plans for election day. Thus, I also want to make clear that  I personally believe he is referring here to something different  to that which was described as part of the whole. I do not know  what the whole refers to, but I want to make clear that the only  person in charge of handling my campaign funds was Dr. Hernan  Beltz."    Pastrana continues playing the tape:    [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] a call" [passage  indistinct].    [Second speaker] "I talked to Maza."    [First speaker] "Yes."    [Second speaker] "He [words indistinct] after what I told  him, but I hope he gives it to me in cash."    [First speaker]] [Words indistinct].    [Second speaker] "I hope he gives it to me in cash, to  deliver it tomorrow."    [First speaker] [Words indistinct].    [Second speaker] "Good, Okay."    At this point, Pastrana interrupts the tape again to say:  "Now, let us listen to the other conversation." The tape  recording continues with a discussion between two unidentified  inidividuals.    [First speaker] [Words indistinct].    [Second speaker] "What happened?" [passage indistinct].    [First speaker] "Did you already go?"    [Second speaker] "Yes."    [First speaker] "Really, did you already go?"    [Second speaker] "Yes."    [First speaker] [Words indistinct].    [Second speaker] "No, because [words indistinct] I forget  the  name. [30-second passage indistinct]    [First speaker] "Wait just a second; let me [words  indistinct] to confirm it. Wait just a second."    [Second speaker] "Hello."    [First speaker] "Hello."    [Second speaker] "How is it going?"    [First speaker] "Very good, very good."    [Second speaker] "The man urgently needs money."    [First speaker] "Who?"    [Second speaker] "The man."    [First speaker] "Eduardo?"    [Second speaker] "Yes."    [First speaker] "He already sent us an emissary."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "Yes, yes."    [Second speaker] "Is he the same one I know?"    [First speaker] "Yes, yes, yes."    [Second speaker] "There are a few little problems here."    [First speaker] "Ah."    [Second speaker] "Because they want everything, everything,  everything, everything, everything."    At this this point, Pastrana again interrupts the tape  recording to say: "This is the only part that is not included  in the EL TIEMPO transcripts, the man's name [words indistinct].  I do not know who they are talking about. This is one of the  few passages missing from the EL TIEMPO transcripts." Pastrana  continues playing the tape recording:    [First speaker] "Where is he now?"    [Second speaker] "I am not so sure."    [First speaker] [Words indistinct].    [Second speaker] "Eduardo?"    [First speaker] "Eduardo is mentioned" [ passage  indistinct].    [Second speaker] "Remain calm; I will personally explain  it."    [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] depends on how you see  things; you are going to [words indistinct]."    [Second speaker] "Yes, but this is also a silly thing."    [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] to talk, because [words  indistinct]."    [Second speaker] "This is one thing, and the other is  another  thing.    [First speaker] [Words indistinct].    [Second speaker] "There are five points that are basic  appointments. Right?    [First speaker] [Words indistinct].    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] there are five points  there. This is basic."    [First speaker] "Yes. [passage indistinct]."    [First speaker] "I already talked to his brother, and I will  talk to Eduardo tomorrow. [passage indistinct]."    [First speaker] "Yes, but not by telephone. [passage  indistinct]."    [Second speaker] "What did he tell Medina?"    [First speaker] "Well, I talked to Medina last week, and  this  week we will [word indistinct] what we talked."    [Second speaker] "But, didn't you [words indistinct]."    [First speaker] "Yes. If he is there tomorrow, we will send  him some money on Monday and the rest next week. [passage  indistinct]"    [First speaker] "It depends on how you see things [words  indistinct]."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "Then why is Medina saying that is what  those  from Santo Domingo want to give him?"    [Second speaker] "No, it was not that way."    [First speaker] "That is what he told us that day."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "All that they [words indistinct]."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "No, but you cannot fix our lives."    [Second speaker] "Oh, but..."    [First speaker, interrupting] "That is the problem. That is  the small..."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "The day you are the presidential candidate  and you have 47 percent of the opinion in your favor, not only  [words indistinct]. The change will be made?"    [Second speaker] "The change will be made the day after  Samper wins. As soon as Samper wins..."    [First speaker, interrupting] "As soon as Samper wins [words  indistinct]."    [Second speaker] "The change will be made the day after  Samper wins. All four of us [words indistinct] decided what  gift we will give him. [Words indistinct] The day after Samper  wins, however, [words indistinct]."    [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] have scared the guys.  [Words indistinct] in the coast was really tremendous."    [Second speaker] "You mean the thing with Maza?"    [First speaker] "Right."    [Second speaker] "Remember, however, that Maza did not get  the votes he was supposed to get. He was split in half when he  got [words indistinct] with one and the other prior to the  elections. [Words indistinct] he had more votes."    [First speaker] "How many votes?"    [Second speaker] "No, no, he had more votes. He had 100,000  votes that day and about 40,000 people left him [words  indistinct]. What I want to tell you is that what he got was  very, very important [words indistinct]. I believe we achieved  something that is being highly appreciated [words indistinct].  We will talk tomorrow then?"    [First speaker] "Yes, we will talk tomorrow."    [Second speaker] "When does [words indistinct]?"    [First speaker] "On Friday."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "No, no, no. We will talk here. [Words  indistinct] do not get panicky. Now, you will start calling  your brother and asking [words indistinct]."    [Second speaker] "No, no, no. [Words indistinct]."    [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] Do not tell anything to  Eduardo or anybody else, please."    [Second speaker] "I will not."    [First speaker] "Please, I beg you, to nobody."    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] we are not fools. We  know how to do things."    [First speaker] "At this moment, [words indistinct] you know  it is not true. That is what I am telling you [words indistinct]  but we are doing things correctly."    [Second speaker] "Eduardo sat down with the big ones in both  campaigns. They agreed, he told me yesterday. It is a promise  and it has to be kept. They are the guarantors of this  commitment. We will go to Europe to talk to him. We will  define things then and see how things will be done."    [First speaker] "Well, [words indistinct] see you tomorrow."    At this point, there is a pause in the recording with an  unidentified speaker making inaudible comments. The following  recording is then played:    [First speaker] "Hello, hello?"    [Second speaker] "Hello. Hi, Alberto, how are you?"    [First speaker] "Well, how are you?"    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "They have me all screwed up."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct].    [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] in the press."    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] it is Saturday."    [First speaker] "No, I mean the newspaper."    [Second speaker] "When?"    [First speaker] [Words indistinct].    [Second speaker] "What did he say?"    [First speaker] "I am a government spokesman [words  indistinct] in the sense of getting General Maza involved in  that thing. It is a very dirty trick, don't you think?"    [Second speaker] "Yes."    [First speaker] "Send for that newspaper [words  indistinct]."    [Second speaker] "Yes, I will send for it."    [First speaker] "Send for it right away."    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] I sensed something  [words indistinct]. You have to be calm about this."    [First speaker] "No, no, no. I am not..."    [Second speaker, interrupting] "It is nothing bad. In any  case, you are not going to make an issue of this, right?"    [First speaker] "No, no, no. I am already..."    [Second speaker, interrupting] "Do not let those sons of  bitches get to you. [words indistinct]."    [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] said I had given a lunch  [words indistinct] for the meeting with Maza. I want to tell  you, however, that I talked to the man. He is thrilled, at  ease, and very happy because the tour of Santa Marta was very  good, very positive, and it had good results because all the  people attended it.    ``Guillermo called this morning to say that the situation  with the press should be stopped because [words indistinct] they  are sons of a bitches. [Words indistinct] he told me: I am very  happy. We are going to win. There will be a big mobilization.    ``[Words indistinct] but here we go anyhow. Another issue  is [words indistinct] and [words indistinct] of the secretary  said that tomorrow we will go to [words indistinct].''    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] what have they got?"    [First speaker] "He spoke for both of them, for the two  trips, for No. 1 and for the one who will be No. 1 and [words  indistinct] and he gave him carte blanche to negotiate."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]    [First speaker] "(Fidel Velasquez) [not further  identified]."    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] I have told (Augusto  Lara) [not further identified] to [words indistinct] a friend of  the one who was listening, and all for nothing. It was the same  tiresome talk about him not persecuting anybody, that this  [words indistinct] pressure [words indistinct] gave others some  son-of-a-bitch reasons. Who is exerting pressure here?  [passage indistinct]    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] have been willing to  comply at any moment. We have tried to find ways to cooperate.  Either person has the opportunity to [words indistinct]".    [First speaker] "We will talk about this tomorrow."    [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]    [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] do what must be done. I  am not questioning you; do what you must."    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] more bars and more  fiestas [words indistinct] they met, talked, [words indistinct]  but this is a very serious commitment [words indistinct]."    [First speaker] "Manolo [words indistinct] to them. [laughs]  [words indistinct] Then, tomorrow I..."    [Second speaker, interrupting] "Let them look deep into  their  hearts and say whether or not we have been honorable people who  want peace, order, and justice and [words indistinct] the best."    [First speaker] "Tell me one simple thing: We are going to  have dinner with you tomorrow afternoon, right?"    [Second speaker] "Yes, yes, but do not bring too many people  in one of those peppy entourages of yours."    [First speaker] "Only he and I are going."    [Second speaker] "There you have it."    [First speaker] "Look, this is important because of [words  indistinct]."    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] one thing. It is bad  because of [words indistinct] it is bad to say [word  indistinct]. You have been there, and you have a voice. We are  here. I do not know [words indistinct] to tell lies. [Words  indistinct] that you are not a son of a bitch."    [First speaker] "Of course not! Of course not!"    [Second speaker] "Then you will come up with a story -- the  same story as always. You will always find that kind of people."    [First speaker] "Of course not!"    [Second speaker] "The president should begin [words  indistinct] we are doing nothing illegal, nothing outside the  law. These are decent people -- people who want to go legit, who  have helped such and such kind of people. [Words indistinct]  without finishing what he was going to do."    [First speaker] "I want you to deliver a message."    [Second speaker] "You spoke with Augusto also. That was a  disgrace. They used me. A couple of friends asked me to lend  [words indistinct]. What else could I do?"    [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] Gato."    [Second speaker] "Gato is dangerous [words indistinct]."    [First speaker] "You did not send me the money [words  indistinct]."    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] has it. [Words  indistinct] and I saw her looking so squalid that I spent half  of it [words indistinct]."    [First speaker] "Now, brother. Now."    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] creates unrest and  [words indistinct]."    [First speaker] [Words indistinct]    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] to make friends."    [First speaker] "And the six current cases?"    [Second speaker] "Mrs. Casco says she is going to send  them."    [First speaker] "No, because they have red." [sentence as  heard]    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] do not."    [First speaker] "Are you sure?"    [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] There is no need.  Fortunately there is no need. [Word indistinct] now we have to  send that to Alberto [words indistinct]."    [First speaker] "Do you have other things?"    [Second speaker] "We sent a copy to LA PRENSA."    [First speaker] "Okay." [laughs]    [Second speaker] "Do not worry about that or run any  publicity [words indistinct]."    [First speaker] "Look, something amazing just happened. I  spoke to LA REPUBLICA, and they said this is your home and that  we have known for many years that you are a friend of these  people. [Words indistinct] they were very good after all of the  lies throughout the campaign."    [Second speaker] "Why not publish all of the meetings with  the informers? The people from Norte del Valle donated $2  million."    [First speaker]) [Words indistinct]    [Second speaker] Let us start investigating to find out what  happened in order that they can cancel support."    [First speaker] "If that turns out to be true, then all hell  will break loose."    [Second speaker] "That is it for now."    [First speaker] "Ciao."    After playing the recording, Pastrana says: "At no time does  the recording refer to donations to my campaign." He then says  he received a call from the prosecutor general, asking him to  confirm the delivery of the tape to President Gaviria, and he  says he will confirm this delivery. Pastrana says "it cannot be  inferred that my campaign requested or received offers of drug  money from the tapes."    Pastrana says, "If it is proven that the Colombian  president-elect's campaign received funds from drug traffickers,  he will relinquish the mandate he received from the people;  otherwise his credentials will be distorted."    When questioned on whether he is asking Dr. Samper to  resign,  Pastrana asserts: "If it is confirmed that drug money was used  for his campaign, he should be ready to resign the presidency,  as I would be if I won the election and if my campaign had  received drug money." When asked how can he assure he did not  receive Cartel money, Pastrana says: "Do you think I would go to  the president of the Republic to tell him, here is a tape that  compromises me, please investigate me." He continues: "Three  days before the elections I made a clear proposal. After  learning about the tape, I said I was willing to resign if it  were proven that there was drug money in my campaign."    Pastrana explains he is not hesitant to surrender the  accounting books of his campaign, adding: "Those books are  always open. In my case, we have not only turned the books over  to the supervisory commission but also to the National Electoral  Council, which closes out electoral campaign books." When asked  if he would be willing to cooperate with the Samper  administration if it is confirmed that Samper did not receive  drug money, Pastrana says: "I personally do not hope to  participate in the Samper administration."    Pastrana asserts: "No one in the world can say my campaign  was funded by drug money." When asked about General Maza's  involvement in this affair, Pastrana responds: "This is  worrisome; there are statements in the recording that are very  worrisome. It is up to the public to assess these statements."    Responding to a question, Pastrana states: "More than  thinking about a deterioration of relations with the United  States, the country demands that this matter be clarified."  When questioned on whether he is ready to lead a campaign to  force the resignation of a corrupt president similar to  campaigns in Brazil and Venezuela, Pastrana says: "I would  rather wait for the results of the investigation."    Pastrana concludes his news conference at 1622 GMT by  stating  that he has received death threats from the drug cartels and by  answering questions on the upcoming soccer match between  Colombia and the United States.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Ivica Saric reporting for Croatian Radio from </F> Vitez]    [Excerpt] According to the HVO's [Croatian Defense Council]  operational zone in Vitez [largest Croat enclave in central  Bosnia], the town center came under an artillery attack again  last night. Two civilians were wounded.    According to the same source, the Muslim Army is deploying  fresh units on the northern approaches to Vitez. The command of  the Vitez operational zone links this with the lifting of the  blockade of Sarajevo and a large influx of infantry belonging to  the Muslim Army's First Corps [based in Sarajevo] to Croat areas  in central Bosnia.

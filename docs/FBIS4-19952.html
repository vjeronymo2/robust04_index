			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Delcroix Wants European </F> `Intervention Force'"]    [Excerpt] Brussels -- Federal Defense Minister Leo Delcroix  wants a "flexible and smooth operational system of cooperation  between European armies to resolve conflicts." He avoided the  term "intervention force." Delcroix proposed the idea yesterday  during a rush visit to his French counterpart Francois Leotard  in Paris. On 9 May, both ministers will defend the proposal at  a meeting of the Western European Union (WEU) in Luxembourg.    Yesterday, Delcroix thanked his French counterpart and the  French Army for the good cooperation during operation "Silver  Back" in Rwanda. "This cooperation was quickly set up on site  and led to the almost perfect running of the evacuation  operation in Rwanda. That was an 18 carat performance. These  initiatives will surely be rewarded in coming weeks."    Delcroix and Leotard also learned lessons from the events in  Rwanda. "An important question came up during our meeting: How  do we resolve similar problems in countries where we are not so  well equipped and where there are not so many Belgians? I put  forward the idea of a flexible, smooth operational system of  military cooperation. I would not call this an intervention  force since our country does not have the resources to keep a  lot of people abroad on a permanent basis."    "Nor do we want laborious UN procedures. In order to avoid  delays and bureaucratic confusion, we must have just a few  people come together to make decisions. My colleague, Mr.  Leotard, was delighted with the proposal."    As regards the withdrawal of the intervention force from  Kenya, he warned against being too hasty. "We must hasten  slowly. The intervention force cannot camp out for weeks, but  there is still a lot of equipment to be brought back. That  demands a lot of logistical work. In addition, we want to see  if everything is running smoothly in the surrounding area."  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] British Airways is making arrangements to cancel  flights to Johannesburg and Cape Town if violence spreads from  black townships to white residential areas. However, a  spokesman for the company emphasized that this is a private  decision, and not one taken by the British Government. The  spokesman was reacting to reports that the British and  Portuguese Governments are preparing for the evacuation of large  numbers of British and Portuguese passport holders from South  Africa if widespread violence breaks out. It is estimated that  up to 350,000 British passport holders could be involved in the  evacuation. NP [National Party] and ANC spokesmen said they  were concerned about reports on planned evacuation operations.  Mr. Carl Niehaus of the ANC said the ANC would consult the  countries concerned about these plans. He said these reports  cause unnecessary tension. NP spokesman Marthinus van Schalkwyk  said he doubts the practicality of such plans and added that  South Africans should not allow themselves, as he put it, to be  led by the nose.</p>

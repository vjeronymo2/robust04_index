			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] and the government continue to make progress in  the delicate dossier on national reconciliation. Yesterday, the  parties were able to agree on two of the five points left to be  discussed under national reconciliation. They deal with the  reinstatement of territorial administration and the return of  buildings owned by both sides. Today, the parties are  discussing another point -- social communications --  particularly the future of the opposition radio, the Voice of  Resistance of the Black Cockerel. Thus, only two points remain  to be discussed -- the role of UNITA deputies and UNITA's  participation in the country's government both at central and  local levels.    Asked to comment on the talks today, UNITA Information  Secretary Dr. Jorge Valentim said peace for Angola is something  that must be achieved at all cost.</p>

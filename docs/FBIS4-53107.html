			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh -- The Ministry of Economics and Finance  has introduced taxes aimed at curbing the spiraling land prices  here.    The proposed land tax is composed of 3 sub-taxes. These are,  a tax on undeveloped land bought for purposes of speculation, a  tax on land price increases and a tax on capital assets.    The objective of the first tax is to "eliminate the buying  and selling of land which is causing land prices to rise,  leading to problems for foreign investors", according to a  ministerial statement.    "In particular, the intention is to make owners of such  unused land pay taxes to the state, or encourage them to sell or  rent their land to businessmen looking for a base for their  industrial or commercial operations," the statement added.    The rate of this tax would rise progressively in proportion  to the time over which the land stays undeveloped. For example,  the state would tax two per cent on the cost price of the land  for the first year and thereby increase this by two per cent  each year, so that by the fifth year, owners of undeveloped land  would have to pay 10 per cent of the land's cost price.    The second tax, which is aimed at discouraging the rise in  land prices, that is owned privately and by commercial companies.    For land owned by private individuals, this land tax rate  would be the same as that levied for personal income. That is,  10 per cent to 30 per cent on the profit gained on the land at  the time of resale.    In the case of commercial companies, profits on land sales  would be taxed the same rate as for other profits, at 20 per  cent.    The tax on capital assets has been confined by the Ministry  to a yearly tax levied on the third house, or more, owned by a  private individual in a town.    The tax, with a rate of two to three per cent of the  estimated market price of the house, is designed not to penalise  farmers or those living in the countryside.    The system of land taxes is welcome news for investors,  especially the tax on undeveloped land bought for purposes of  speculation. The recent visit of the business delegation from  Malaysia highlighted the problem of escalating land prices and  the lack of industrial parks for setting up labour-intensive  industries.    Businessmen pointed out that the favourable conditions  created for investment and sustained by agencies like the  Cambodia Development Council would be crippled by the  unavailability of competitively priced land. This includes not  only the kingdom's capital but outlying urban centres like  Sihanoukville.    However, some observers say that the taxes are not  differentiated enough, especially the tax charged on land  speculation. Investors might need to hold on to land until  conditions are deemed more propitious for developing it, given  the security situation.    The solution would lie in the comprehensive nature of the  new  tax regime introduced by Sam Rangsi's Ministry. These include  the Salaries Tax, the Tax on Construction Licenses and the  Profits Tax on import-export companies. Their overall objective  is to "broaden the revenue base which is at present heavily  dependent on customs duties, particularly those levied on  reexports".    The Minister has already declared that the objective of the  tax reforms is to achieve a more balanced distribution between  direct and indirect taxation, and to avoid over-reliance on  customs revenue.    Most of the foreign companies in the kingdom indicate their  presence here as involving commercial and social obligations.  Their projections for rates of return are based on medium-term  and longterm investment strategies.    The reform of the customs' systems and its fiscal structure  has already managed to increase government revenue eightfold.  This has allowed the government to fund its public sector  deficit without having to demonetise the currency. It has also  allowed the control of the previous runaway inflation.    The new tax regime is aimed at further stabilising the  economic environment towards encouraging investment  possibilities.</p>

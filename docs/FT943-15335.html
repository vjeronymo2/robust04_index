			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / As They Say in Europe: The good old days of cheating are over A government that sets about exposing corruption reveals that it exists. The sterner the measures, the more corrupt the country appears. The opposite is also true. I recall a press conference on this matter given by the Home Affairs Minister of Malaysia many years ago. He argued that there was little corruption in that country because, in spite of setting up an anti-corruption agency, there had been few arrests. The local media patted the government on the back. And then definitions of corruption change. When I finished my education, many of my contemporaries were forced into banking and the City, consoling themselves with the expectation of hearing useful rumours, getting a good tip, or having access to some kind of inside knowledge that might enable them to compensate for the modesty of their official earnings. And so to France where there has been the arrest of another highly-placed personality - Pierre Suard, the boss of the engineering giant Alcatel Alsthom. Everybody is asking: is France another Italy? This scandal comes after the arrest of the boss of another industrial giant, Schneider, the successive waves of the Tapie affair and allegations about President Mitterrand. In fact France, maybe, is not more, or less, corrupt - it is the world that has changed. The good old days, when one could rob shareholders and cheat customers without one's integrity being called into question have, for better or worse, disappeared. Thus Les Echos, the leading business paper, wrote: 'Justice is crashing into the business world . . . Company bosses will from now on have to grow accustomed to this new rigour and to the collapse of a certain number of barriers behind which they thought themselves protected.' As the innocent industrialist emerges, rubbing his eyes, facing up to this new, harsh dawn, he may be comforted by the experience of Bernard Tapie, the millionaire leftwinger. The more the accusations pile up, the more popular he becomes. He secured one vote in eight in the recent Euro-elections and is seen as a kind of foul-mouthed Robin Hood. 'So,' wrote Le Quotidien, 'the boss of Alcatel need only present himself at the next elections. He will be a roaring success and Tapie will be President of the Republic. Thus it will have been willed by a justice which has sworn to be just.' Le Quotidien, having delivered itself of this epigram, expired, never to be quoted again. On the day Suard was arrested, in an unusual piece of serendipity, Le Monde brought out a survey of corruption. Its most interesting contribution was a theoretical review which decided two pre-conditions were essential - rent and regulation. Now 'rent' is a difficult word in English and here is meant economic rent. The example given is the case of a house whose real value is transformed as a result of the construction of an underground railway station nearby. Should the landlord benefit from the increased value of the residence, or the tenant or the municipality? Real corruption takes place when the site of the station is decided beforehand by potential beneficiaries. There are concrete examples of how this works in France today: Le Monde cites the notorious Loi Royer of 1973 which gives local business committees the power to decide whether a new supermarket can be opened in their district. 'As might be expected, the members of these committees have sold their votes.' The French economy was often dominated by the system of permits and licences: it provided support for the ancien regime and thus promoted the events of 1789. The aristos were in fact rent snatchers. Among the accusations against Pierre Suard is an allegation of a form of rent-snatching: an Alcatel subsidiary allegedly over-invoiced France Telecom. The public sector in France is there partly to ensure the existence of substantial and successful private sector enterprises. So there is a system of fruitful mutual dependence between monopoly buyer and monopoly supplier. In such circumstances it may not be all that odd if Pierre Suard enjoyed, as alleged, the services of France Telecom free of charge at his private residence. It is just, as Les Echos noted, that everything is much stricter these days. What was once normal becomes egregious and is now stamped on. And any attempt to compensate for the loss takes on more overtly criminal forms. So the question - is France another Italy? - is hardly relevant. The world of licences and permits shrinks and we are probably witnessing the collapse of the old order rather than the arrival of the new. In France many regret the zeal of a new breed of law enforcement officers. In the world of the electronic criminal, the tales of Tapie, Alcatel and Schneider have enormous sentimental appeal.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  pledged Monday [6 Jun] to root out corruption related to public  construction works by replacing the traditional designated  bidding system with an open bidding system.    "Public construction works must have trustworthiness and  transparency," said Hata, answering questions at the House of  Representatives Budget Committee. "Successive scandals were  regrettable."    "We are taking measures such as a full-fledged introduction  of the competitive bidding system. We will constantly carry out  the measures in order to get rid of bid-rigging and other unjust  practices," he said.    In April, prosecutors announced the end of 13 months of  investigations into a series of bribery scandals involving  politicians and major construction firms.    A total of 32 people -- including a Diet legislator, two  governors, two mayors and officials of eight major construction  companies and a large paper manufacturer -- were indicted as a  result of the investigation.</p>

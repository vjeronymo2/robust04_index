			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA reporters Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987 </F> 2639) and Chi Maohua (3069 5399 5363): "More Reasonable, More  Mature -- China's Economic Development As Seen From the Topics  of Discussion During the `Two Sessions'"]    [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (XINHUA) -- The republic has  achieved brilliant, unprecedented economic achievements after 15  stormy years. China's economic development has made a new step  forward from a new starting point. The whole world is closely  watching how we head toward the 21st century.    Displaying a high sense of responsibility, the 5,000 or so  deputies and members attending the "two sessions" -- the Second  Session of the Eighth People's Congress [NPC] and the Second  Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] -- have also been  seriously pondering on this issue.  <H6>  (1) </H6>   The calls for "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform,  opening up wider to the outside world, expediting reform, and  maintaining stability" and "properly handling the relations  between reform, development, and stability" have become the most  important topics discussed, analyzed, and studied by everybody  during and after meetings. They maintain that China's economic  development is undergoing a transitional period toward a stage  of more reasonable development.    Many deputies say that, although China has achieved world-  renowned economic successes and enjoyed the highest economic  growth in the world over the past 15 years, reform takes a  relatively long time and cannot be achieved overnight. They  also realize the simple but profound truth that haste makes  waste. This is the same warning served by the lessons the  nation learned the hard way from its economic development after  the republic was founded. Some deputies say: The 9 percent  economic growth set for this year is still quite high in the  world. The hindrance caused by basic industries has become more  noticeable owing to the high growth in the past two years.  Lowering the growth appropriately is sensible and totally in  line with economic law. This shows that the Chinese Government  has walked out from the odd cycle -- when control was imposed,  the economy became lifeless; and when control was removed, the  economy was in disorder -- and become even more mature in  applying economic law.    The 1.1 billion Chinese people have learned from personal  experiences that economic prosperity depends on reform and  development. But just as Comrade Xiaoping pointed out:  "Stability prevails over everything." The country needs  political unity and stability because China needs a harmonious  social environment with less controls for reform and  development. Without stability, nothing can be accomplished.  Some deputies say that in this crucial year for reform,  readjustment of interests has to be made in certain economic  sectors, and it will give rise to many new problems. To ensure  success, priority must be given to ensuring a stable social  environment. When we do our work, we must pay special attention  to discovering problems and dealing with them promptly so as to  make sure that reform and development can proceed smoothly.    China's economic development is also becoming healthier and  more mature as can be seen from the fact that stability is now  considered as a very important part of the requirement of  overall importance set for the whole party and the country.    The deputies and the CPPCC National Committee members also  note that, while stability is underscored, it does not mean that  we have to be overcautious and ignore the rare opportunity for  development. On the contrary, to achieve genuine social  stability, we must promote stability through development and  reform. This is because if the country lacks the strength, it  cannot improve the people's living standards, the economy will  be bleak, the market will wither, and there will not be genuine  social stability. The nation can have long-term peace and  stability only when it is economically prosperous.  <H6>  (2) </H6>   Market economy is an economy supported by a legal system.  Well- conceived laws and regulations are important indicators  of a country's economic maturity.    The deputies are pleased to talk about their legislative  achievements: Since the convening of the Third Plenary Session  of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the NPC and its standing  committee have enacted nearly 200 laws. The deputies and  members of the CPPCC National Committee are excited to know  that, to keep pace with economic development, the nation's  legislative departments will from now on give top priority to  providing economic development with legal protection.    Some CPPCC National Committee members point out that, since  the 14th national party congress, the guiding thought for  China's legislation has changed from serving primarily the  planned economy to accelerating the establishment of a market  economic system; and from primarily summing up the successes of  reform and opening up achieved in real life to setting the norms  governing future economic conduct. The Eighth NPC promised one  year ago that the construction of a legal structure framework  for the socialist market economy will be basically completed  within five years.    Now, one year later, people can already see the fruitful  results. During the six meetings it has held, the Eighth NPC  Standing Committee has deliberated on more than 40 draft laws,  of which two- thirds are about market economy; and drafted and  revised 21 other laws, of which 13 are about market economy.  This is to say that the number of market economy-related laws  examined and adopted by the standing committee of this term is  proportionally larger than those of all previous standing  committees.    The deputies and members maintain that the establishment and  improvement of the socialist market economic system must be  governed and protected by a sound legal system; and that  improvement of the law is also essential for economic prosperity  and development. They stress: China's reforms and legislation  must be closely coordinated and the policies governing reforms  and legislation must be integrated. Legislation must reflect  the spirit of reform; and our laws must guide, promote, and  safeguard the smooth progress of reform.    Without a doubt, China's legal system is still far from  being  able to meet the requirements of China's economic development.  Some deputies and members say that there is yet to be a legal  structure supporting the market economy, and certain badly  needed economic laws are still defective. Fortunately, people  have begun to confront the defects and insufficiencies and will  deal with them step by step. This year the NPC Standing  Committee will continue to give top priority to speeding up  legislation, especially economic legislation. Making laws that  serve reform, promote reform, set the norms for reform by  utilizing the successful experiences gained from reform,  readjusting the new relations between economic sectors, and  preventing mistakes from being unnecessarily made during reform  will continue to be the core of China's economic legislation.    Members of the CPPCC National Committee note that the high  speed and quick rhythm of China's economic legislation are  telling the people that China's economic development has started  to proceed in an orderly and healthy manner and has entered a  brand new area in which economic development has the support of  laws.  <H6>  (3) </H6>   During the two sessions this year, NPC deputies and CPPCC  National Committee members have commented emotionally on the  need to "study effective measures and pay attention to actual  results." They say that the whole party and society as a whole  must energetically advocate the need to study effective measures  and pay attention to actual results so that new progress can be  made in building a socialist market economic system and in  ensuring a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development.    General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and other  central leading comrades have emphasized at almost all group  discussions that people in the country must work with one heart  and one mind, do solid work with genuine efforts, fight in  unity, and make concerted efforts; and that we must strengthen  our conviction, seize the opportunity, and bring about a  sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development.    NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members coming  from various parts of the country say that people throughout the  country should have the common understanding that "empty talk  can hinder national development and a strong country can be  built by doing hard, solid work." Some deputies say: The  central authorities have now set the general policy, the key  requirement now is that, when we implement this policy, we must  resort to effective measures and pay attention to achieving  actual results. Leading cadres at all levels must guide the  masses to exert concerted efforts, take real and effective  measures to carry out various projects, make sure that actual  results are achieved, and work practically in rallying and  leading the vast number of people to push forward all economic  and other construction projects.    Many deputies and CPPCC National Committee members agree  that  being pragmatic is the distinctive characteristics of the two  sessions this year. They say this characteristics can be  observed from the length of the government work report, which is  the shortest one in recent years; from the phrases and terms  regularly used by deputies and members in their talks; and from  their pledges that, after the two meetings are over, they will  make practical efforts to carrying out their guidelines. This  shows that NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members are  improving in participating in administration and discussion of  state affairs, and that China is also improving in handling  economic and other affairs. Some deputies and members add that  China's maturing economic work can also be observed from this  year's government work report which states that the Chinese  Government will not evade problems but will confront them.    Some deputies say that, in the past several years, the hot  topics of discussion used to be policies, reforms, and  opportunities. Since the nation's economic reform was still at  the exploratory stage, those words were quite "insubstantial."  Now the framework of China's economic reform has basically  taken shape and many reform measures have been introduced. This  means that China's economic development is maturing, and that  NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members are also  maturing and have become more "pragmatic." In a word, the  Chinese people have become more pragmatic.    A pragmatic nation is a nation imbued with hopes. We believe  that China's economic development will proceed steadily and  become more mature, and China will head for the world and the  21st century with ample confidence!</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> As a counterpoint to Wednesday night's Oscar glitter, the Golden Raspberry  Awards Foundation presented its dubious honors for the worst film achievements  of the year. Sylvester Stallone was named worst actor for "Rambo III," his  third razz in five years. (He also "won" in 1985 for "Rhinestone" and in 1986  for "Rambo: First Blood Part II" and "Rocky IV.") Tom Cruise's "Cocktail" was  selected worst picture for 1988. Others getting Razzies included Liza Minnelli  for worst actress ("Arthur 2: On the Rocks" and "Rent-a-Cop"), Dan Aykroyd for  worst supporting actor ("Caddyshack II") and Kristy McNichol for worst  supporting actress ("Two-Moon Junction"). The Razzies are voted on by about 200  publicists. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

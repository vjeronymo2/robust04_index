			<p>BFN     [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] has confirmed its  advance. On the frontlines, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]  has shown that it is making progress. Today the RPA captured  Gako Camp in the Bugesera region. This occurred after prolonged  fighting, and the occupation of a large amount of territory.  The RPA controls Byumba Prefecture, Kibungo Prefecture,  three-quarters of Kigali Prefecture, and half of Ruhengeri  Prefecture. In short, the RPF controls more than half of the  country.    Fighting is now taking place in Bugesera region in southern  Rwanda, which is very close to the border with northern Burundi.    In Kigali itself the RPF controls the northern part of the  town [words indistinct] southern part of the town.    The liberation of the country is thus already a reality for  the people. However, each Rwandan is still expected to  contribute to that liberation by supporting the RPF combatants,  and all those acting to help rid the country of the current  dictatorship.</p>

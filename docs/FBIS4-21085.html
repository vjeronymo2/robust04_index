			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Arrieta: "Pretty Sight?"] </F>   [Text] No one in Huallaga could doubt that the capture of  Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, alias "Vaticano," has considerably  reduced the drug trafficking activity in the zone. Both  travelers and local residents comment on it. However, it would  be unrealistic to think that, just because the "chief of all  churches"--firms--(hence the name, "Vaticano") is behind bars,  they will stop operating.    Similarly, the fact that "La Catedral" (Campanilla) is now  virtually closed, owing to the suspension of flights at its  famous airport, and that the chief and his brothers have been  captured, does not mean that the activity has disappeared. It  has simply been transferred.    And in what direction has this "strategic withdrawal" been  aimed? SI confirmed this week that the drug traffic's new church  in the jungle is located in Bellavista. A small settlement  situated midway between Tarapoto and Juanjui, Bellevista is now  the site on which the chiefs of the leading firms are operating.  And, as Campanilla was during its best times, it is impregnable.    As evidence of this, on Friday, 25 February, a military  counternarcotics operation intended to capture the number one  man after "Vaticano's" downfall, namely, Waldo Vargas Arias,  alias "El Ministro," failed.    The latter, just as "Vaticano" did previously, shows up only  sporadically in Bellavista. He does not need to be there  full-time to supervise the work, for which he has his aides,  such as "El Baron" (who was captured in Friday's operation), the  son of "Mosca Loca" [Crazy Fly], and other major firm chiefs  located there. And they are operating, which is why SI was in  the locality this week. People still recall the years when  "Vaticano" operated in Campanilla with the protection and  complicity of the Armed Forces, and without anyone making a  comment. The following is an exclusive account of how the  country's leading drug trafficking firms are operating in  Bellavista, with the names of those assisting them:  <H5>  All Routes </H5>   What most attracts the attention of the traveler arriving in  (or passing through) Bellavista is the intense movement on its  streets. In the square, in the market, in every bar or shop, or  on the endless rugged paths to houses, there are people (mostly  men) conversing, purchasing, and making deals. That is why this  small settlement appears to be housing more inhabitants than it  really has: The visitors, who can spend hours in the locality,  double the Bellavista population's numbers.    The odd part of it is that, despite so many people and so  much movement, there are no crowds, nor anything of the sort.  The reason is that they all fit and are distributed comfortably  on Bellavista's four levels.    A hill to the right of the town (coming from the direction  of  Tarapoto) is what expands its premises with four "levels." And  each of them also serves as a link in the chain established for  moving drugs in Bellavista.    The heart (at least the urban one) of the town is situated  on  the first level: main square, church, market, and truck stop.    It is ostensibly a peaceful jungle town: young people  sitting  in comfortable rockers at the doors of houses and bars,  listening to music while holding small glasses of beer.    Suddenly, something in the atmosphere indicates a warning:  there are suspicious looks and a slow movement of hands toward  the bags under the rockers holding small machine guns. The  settlers know than when the henchmen think that they have  detected an "infiltrated" person (from the DEA [Drug Enforcement  Administration] or the police), they either chase them shooting,  or "stand in the way."    At one particular point, a red Toyota crosses the street. It  is "El Baron's" car. No one moves; the chief is passing by.    Two blocks from the main square, in a direction opposite the  hill, lies the river. The dock used for travel on the  swift-running Huallaga is located there, waiting for the trucks  loaded with drugs. They must carry them to La Union, where there  is a clandestine airport. The flights leave from there, bound  for Colombia. A boat carries the shipment to the other side of  the river, where another truck is waiting to take it to its  destination.    Most of the drugs leaving Bellavista come from Collpa, Dos  de  Mayo, Eslabon, Tabalosos, Sacachimonte, Pachiza, Sacachini,  Shanan, Huicungo, Saposoa, Tres Unidos, Piscuyacu, and  Campanilla itself.    They arrive on countless routes. That is why the drivers of  the double-cab trucks carrying passengers, which are the ones  also transporting drugs, are known as "route men." One of them  revealed to SI that the rate for transporting one kg of drugs  delivered in Bellavista averages $20. The transportation is  achieved with no problems, because all the police inspectors  have been properly "taken care of." The informant adds: "The  Morales post and the one in Tabalosos are just a minor example  of the police corruption. Of course, if you don't pay, you could  have problems."  <H5>  "Official Permit" </H5>   When the "route men" arrive in Bellavista, they contact the  "passers," who are youths assigned to contact the firm chiefs,  and who seek the best price for their potential clients.    They receive a commission from both the client and the  purchaser. As one "passer" remarks: "In five minutes we can  easily make 200 new soles. As a rule, each of us makes about  five passes a day."    On the dock, two youths who arrived on a motorcycle  approached the team from SI. One of them asked why photos were  being taken. After we identified ourselves, displaying our  reporters' ID cards, the stranger repeated: "You have taken  photos of my chief's car, haven't you?" That was the signal  letting us know that SI's activity had been watched at all  times. After conversing with each other, the strangers hesitated  slightly, remarking that it would be a good idea to cross the  river and observe a massacre of 30 persons committed by the DEA  a few weeks ago in one of its operations. And, finally, they  gave their verdict: "All right, keep taking photos, but we don't  want you to take them of persons, much less houses." They  climbed onto their motorcycles and took off. Upon boarding, one  of them disclosed the grip of a revolver in his belt.    Although it may seem untrue, this "official permit" proved  more effective than the one granted by the military base chief,  an Army captain known as "Peter."    The Bellavista military base is located on the second level,  and is reached by the main road of the settlement itself, after  rounding a curve. From there one may observe and inspect the  town's main streets. Permission was requested from Captain  "Peter" to take panoramic photos of the town, which he granted.  However, when we returned to the first level, a civilian  approached to indicate that he had a message from the captain.  "I have notified the `patas' (narcos) to make `room' for the  reporters, and to get out of town." This person claimed that the  officer had said that no one should give us any kind of  information on the drug traffic, "because, otherwise, everything  would be ruined."    On the second level is the old airport, currently the only  one that should be operating officially in Bellavista. Up  higher, on the fourth level, a new official landing strip is  being built by 30 members of an Army engineering company with  headquarters in Juanjui. An expanse of 800 meters has been  planned for the new runway, which will be under the control of  the Peruvian Air Force [FAP]. However, according to some  accounts, small planes are landing on the 280 meters already  equipped for operations, to take on drugs. And this runway is  only a five-minute journey from the military base headed by  Captain "Peter."  <H5>  On the Third Level </H5>   According to information collected by SI, the entire  population of Bellavista knows that the chiefs of the "firms"  hold constant talks with the officers at the military base.    Where? In broad daylight, in restaurants located on the  third  level (the one after the level where the base is located).  There, amid barbecues, cured meat, and tacacho (typical jungle  dishes), as well as abundant liquor, all paid for by the  "narcos," these talks are taking place.    Less than 500 meters from the base, on the third level, are  the houses in which the firms are installed. One settler  commented indignantly that the base officers "even have the  nerve to drive by in cars and on motorcycles owned by the zone's  "traqueteros" [handlers] and drug traffickers."    The resident went on to say: "All of us here know that drugs  are obvious to, and patiently accepted by everyone. The `narcos'  weigh the drugs in the middle of public thoroughfares, and both  policemen and the military go by here without intervening. They  even exchange friendly greetings."    This informant also remarked that the military charge an  average of $15,000 per flight.    The flights are currently leaving the Biabo zone, a 20  minute  trip from the center of Bellavista. There is a clandestine  airport, called La Union, there. According to a report received  in the zone, on 18 February a flight took off loaded with  approximately 500 kg of drugs. The shipment had originally  departed from Madera.    Just as in Campanilla, where the "pato" [duck] system  (military helicopters carrying drugs) had operated, there is  also an air assistance system run by the military for the drug  traffic in Bellavista. So much so that there is now a word for  indicating the fact that an Army helicopter is carrying drugs in  Bellavista: "rastreo" [tracking]    The "tracking" operations are generally conducted in the  vicinity of the Biabo valley, especially in Barranca and La  Union; as well as in Palmapampa.    "Traqueteros" (those loading the drugs) from the locality  claimed that, to load a helicopter, there must be shipments from  10 "route men's" trucks to transport approximately 700 kg of  washed paste.    The flights are usually made between 2100 and 2200. For  concealment, the Army forces are using a code for classified  military operations: "Oscar May Charlie." Used only for  countersubversive and, occasionally, counternarcotics  operations, it relieves the pilots of their obligation to submit  their flight plan to the FAP. It is now being used in routine  operations. Cases are known wherein helicopters take off from  Tarapoto on a flight that would require 20 minutes at the most,  and reach their destinations five or six hours later. What is  the helicopter doing during all that time?    When the conditions so permit, there may be up to three  flights per month by Army helicopters carrying drugs. The source  noted: "If business is down, the `milicos' [soldiers] make only  one flight."    A concrete example of this incredible coexistence occurred  during the early days of February. At the time, an Army  helicopter was loaded with drugs on the outskirts of the town,  to carry them to Chachapoyas, where they were picked up by a  small plane and, finally, taken to Colombia. Between 11 and 12  February, another small plane took off from La Union. Nearly  3,000 kg of drugs departed from there, heading for Colombia.  <H5>  The Largest </H5>   According to information that has been collected, the most  prominent firm chiefs currently operating in Bellavista are the  following:    Cero Cinco [Zero Five] (the only one known to be a Peruvian)    Pelo Blanco [White Hair] (an older person with thick gray  hair, of heavy build, Peruvian)    Trompa de Buque [Boat Horn] (he is Luis Hernan Pineda  Menjura)    El Baron [The Baron] (Fernando Saldana Chavez, Peruvian,  aide  to "El Ministro")    They are considered the "capos," and have their drug  marketing center on the third level of Bellavista. Their firms  are regarded as reliable suppliers of the Colombian cartels.    There are also some small firms, disparagingly known as  "Pichihuichi." There are only four. The Colombian "capos" do not  give them, as they do to "the large ones," drugs on consignment  "against payment," to be made after marketing. It was Demetrio  Chavez, "Vaticano," who began the "against payment" system years  ago in Campanilla.    In Bellavista, one kg of washed paste is currently priced at  380 new soles, in cash, and at 480 new soles "against payment."    Also on the third level are the "hideouts," or laboratories  in which the drugs are processed. There are at least 10 on the  third level, and 15 on the fourth. The largest obtain an average  of 50 kg of washed paste per day; and the small ones, 15 kg. At  least three persons work in the "hideouts": the one in charge of  the water, the sifter, and the one engaged in drying the drugs.  The process can last four hours, depending on the quantity.    Each chief has several henchmen working to ensure his  safety.  They are his eyes and ears. When they see a stranger, they  approach, ask him for documents, and interrogate him: something  that not even the police do in Bellavista. Then they follow him,  so as to report to their chiefs.    For example, they guard "El Baron's" house, with two stories  and made of cement. Several youths tour the vicinity, while  others do not move from the main door. Each one holds a knapsack  in which he is obviously carrying weapons.    What do the municipal authorities say about what is  happening  in Bellavista? The only official with whom we spoke, who refused  to identify himself, merely remarked: "You know, I know,  everyone here knows about it. After all, a single person can't  do anything."    Finally, the hotel, which was the last surprise: it was none  other than the "Cardenas" Hotel. The founder: Guillermo Cardenas  Davila, the notorious "Mosca Loca." Its manager: Luis Molque  Cardenas Guzman, son of "Mosca Loca," known as "Mosquito." The  clients? The chiefs of Bellavista, the new drug fortress in  Huallaga.  <H5>  [Box, p 35] </H5> <H5>  `Narco'-Economy </H5>   It is well-known that much of Lower Huallaga's population is  living, in one way or another, on money from the drug traffic.  There is no authority nor institution that "narco"-terrorism has  not penetrated.    To give an example, the "narco"-trafficker, Waldo Vargas  Arias, alias "El Ministro," has, as a personal rule, been  donating $100 per month to each of the teachers in Yarina, in  Yurimaguas. It is by way of a "subsidy" allowing them to receive  a "decent" salary, and thereby enabling them to subsist.    Moreover, it was public knowledge that the deputy mayor of  Bellavista, Francisco Longa Morales, received money from the  "narcos" in the zone for permitting them to "work." This Mr.  Longa, who had two motorcycle shops in Tarapoto itself, has now  disappeared, and the police are on his trail.    Similarly, a local authority who preferred not to be  identified claimed that most of the local news reporters have  been receiving money in exchange for their silence.    The flights continue to take off regularly, and no one  reports anything. The local residents comment that the news  reports discuss anything other than what they all know is  happening. An official who remained anonymous adds: "Don't  forget that when there is a flight everyone here can eat."  <H5>  [Box, p 36] </H5> <H5>  Peter the Great </H5>   "Peter the Great" is the name given to the chief of the  Bellavista military base who, leading 30 men, conducted an  operation last week on the so-called "first level" of this  jungle locality, in which, incidentally, neither the DEA nor the  police participated.    In one of the houses raided they captured the Colombians,  Edgardo Castaneda Diza, William Garzon Calderon, Ali Gonzales  Cuellar, and John Landazuri Landana; as well as the Peruvians,  Fernando Saldana Chavez, alias "El Baron," Jose Pena Saldana,  Goner Garcia Guerra, and Teodoro Camacho.    They confiscated from this group 1,800 kg of washed PBC,  1,800 kg of raw PBC, 10 bags of ammoniac gum resin, six bags of  charcoal, two 9 mm pistols, a mini-Uzi, a revolver, a pineapple  type grenade, three motorcycles, an electric generating set, and  a radio set.    However, local sources noted that, incidentally, 10 minutes  before that operation, the drug trafficker, Waldo Vargas Arias,  alias "El Ministro" was seen leaving the same house.    The same sources claim that "El Ministro " headed for the  port, where he took a "lata" (glider] bound for Huimbayoc,  Yurimaguas, where it is currently located.  <H5>  [Box, p 37] </H5> <H5>  The Heads </H5>   The following list, giving the names and aliases of the  heads  of the organizations engaged in TID [Illegal Drug Trafficking]  on the national and international level, has been prepared with  information obtained as of 10 February 1994.     -  Alvarado Linares, Willer, alias "Champa."    -  Cavero Caruzo,  Jesus, fathers and brothers.    -  Cachiche Rivera, Adolfo.    -  Cachiche  Rivera, Abelardo.    -  Cachiche Rivera, Segundo.    -  Cachiche Rivera,  Nicolas.    -  Chavez Montoya, Jorge, alias "Polaco."    -  Cardenas Guzman,  Luis Molqui, or Rivas Guzman, Alberto, alias "Mosquito" or  "Ingeniero."    -  Cardenas Guzman, Jorge Roberto, alias "Chino  Jorge."    -  Leguia Manzur, or Leguia Aparicio, Julio Abraham, alias  "Salomon" or "Nino."    -  Pariona Munoz, Julian, alias "Cholo  Claudio" or "Lobito."    -  Pineda Menjura, Luis Hernan, alias "Trompa  de Buque."    -  Arevalo Pinedo, Miguel, alias "Miguel Pena" or "Chato  Pena."(*)    -  Rios Lastra, Antonio, alias "Tio Rios."    -  Vargas Arias,  Waldo, alias "El Ministro" or "Moises."    -  Roy Araujo, Lang, alias  "Picuro."    -  Zevallos Cuenca, Pedro, Willian, and Gover, alias  "Payaso" and "Play Boy 2."    -  Garrido Bazan...(brothers).    -  Cardenas  Rengifo, Hector.       * He was captured on Friday, 25 February, in Bellavista. His  real name is Jose Miguel Pena Saldana.  <H5>  [Box, p 38] </H5> <H5>  "We Can't Specify Anything" </H5>   Marcelo Raymundo Perez, the current deputy mayor of  Bellavista, claims to have no specific information on anything  happening in his locality. He maintains that all the information  he has is inaccurate or unconfirmed.    [Arrieta] The residents claim that small planes loaded with  drugs are constantly taking off. What is your office doing about  that?    [Perez] We have certain reports about it, and we have made  them available to the pertinent authorities. They are not only  about the drug traffic, but crime, also. Both are evils  afflicting the entire population.    [Arrieta] But the flights continue to take off. Also, are  there clandestine airports near this zone, or not?    [Perez] There has been talk lately about night flights  leaving these airports, but I want to make it clear that it is  our responsibility to put the information in the hands of the  prosecutor's office and the police, so that both may conduct  investigations. For example, last year we reported the creation  of a clandestine runway in Sedega.    [Arrieta] How many cases like that have you reported to the  authorities?    [Perez] I could not tell you; there are many similar cases.    [Arrieta] Have the people submitted any complaints about  them.    [Perez] There have been complaints, and some charges, and  even reports of people being murdered; but we don't know of any  details concerning them.    [Arrieta] Are there firms in Bellavista?    [Perez] I don't know exactly. It is presumed, but we can't  claim it; because people come and go, and we don't know whether  or not the firms really exist. Bellavista is a strategic zone of  Central Huallaga, and people move to both Biabo valley and Sisa  valley. All this prevents our obtaining sufficient information.    [Arrieta] But are the firms operating here or not?    [Perez] They may be operating but, as I told you, we can't  specify anything.    [Arrieta] You were saying that the flights take off at  night.    [Perez] That is claimed, but we can't specify the exact site  from which they take off. We know that there are some flights,  because we hear them at night; but we don't have accurate  information.    [Arrieta] What do you need to find out about these  situations  with a minimum of accuracy?    [Perez] Well, the fact is that we don't have sufficient  personnel to cover all these irregularities.</p>

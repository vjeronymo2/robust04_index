			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE GALLERIES: PAINTINGS LONG ON TEXTURE, SHORT ON VARIETY;  </P> <P> ART: ALVARO BLANCARTE'S COMPOSITIONS ARE TIRED AND FORMULAIC, AND HIS PALETTE  TOO UNIFORM TO INSPIRE MUCH THOUGHT.  </P> <P> The paintings of Alvaro Blancarte have a lulling effect -- less from their  placid beauty than from their numbing uniformity. The Tecate-based painter's  current show at the Iturralde Gallery (7592 Fay Ave., through Sept. 2) is  titled "En Mi Ventana" (Through My Window), and consists of heavily textured  works on canvas, paper and board.  </P> <P> Blancarte bases all of his work around a central motif of slightly undulating  vertical lines, which often interrupt their course to bulge outward into  knob-like protrusions. Occasionally, horizontals cross the verticals to form  irregular grids. The format varies to include shadowy geometric shapes, as well  as other, more concrete protrusions and a sporadic scribble.  </P> <P> The artist's palette and composition don't vary enough to keep this viewer's  gaze alert. From edge to edge of each canvas, Blancarte spreads the same  mottled hues, all at the same middle range of intensity, neither pale enough to  utter of ethereality nor sharp enough to cry of passion. Instead, they speak in  unison in a cloying monotone. Dusty blue, soft mauve, lavender and the colors  of sand, smoke and soot prevail, as do the many muddy tones in between. In  isolation, or even smaller doses, Blancarte's colors could exude a delicate  beauty, but here, applied with such evenhandedness, they are as moving as  wallpaper.  </P> <P> If Blancarte's use of color seems less than fresh, his compositions, too, feel  tired and formulaic. He sets the grid or grill of lines dead center in each  image and surrounds it every time with layers of blocky brushwork and  splattered color.  </P> <P> There are passages of great movement and animation to be found, such as the  frantic, tight grid work central to "Las Siete Colas del Perro 13" (The Seven  Tails of the Dog 13). The lines, scratched with urgency into a thick crust of  gray and mauve, fray at the edges -- a rare example here of tension and release  amplifying each other. But further, beyond the stray lines of the grid, those  same blocky brush strokes splattered with paint wrap the image in a neat  package of predictability.  </P> <P> Blancarte exercises his imagination most in creating his textures. Mixing sand  and marble dust into his paint, he then sculpts the ribs and rivulets of his  abstract images. "En el Fin del Tiempo" (At the End of Time) makes the most of  the organic quality of the textures. Here, Blancarte's telltale lines have  eroded, as if gnawed by wind and water to reveal a pocked and crusty underlying  skin. In other works, too, irregular fissures and barnacle-like forms echo the  composition of Earth's own surface.  </P> <P> Among the most involving of Blancarte's images here, however, is one of the  most shallow in texture. "Mi Ventana Negra" (My Black Window) pairs two  canvases with dark, nearly impenetrable surfaces. An irregular grid has been  scratched into the scarred, charred-looking paint, mostly black with highlights  of white and glimpses of red and pale yellow. The two canvases are mounted, a  few inches apart, on a common support. The space between them, painted bright  blue, throws a decorative stripe into the otherwise cryptic work, breaking what  is for Blancarte an all-too-rare mood of mystery and intensity.  </P></p>

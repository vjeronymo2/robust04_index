			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon review, the Director finds that the Division III of the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure for service of an original notice and petition provision is the State counterpart provision to rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Director notes that Division III of the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure, unlike 30 CFR 846.17(c), does not appear to normally allow service to be performed on the individual to be assessed an individual civil penalty by certified mail. Proposed State alternatives to procedural rules contained in the Federal regulations are evaluated ``from the point of view of their similarity to the Secretary's rules in affording rights and remedies to persons'' (46 FR 53376, October 28, 1981). The Director finds that the State proposal affords additional procedural rights and remedies to persons by not allowing service by certified mail. Accordingly, the Director finds that Division III of the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure is not inconsistent with the Federal program and is approving it. The Director also finds that the IAC 27&hyph;40.75(4) incorporation of Division III of the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure does not render its program less effective than the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 846.17(c) and is approving it as well. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

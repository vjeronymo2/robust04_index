			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF helped to 8% rise by cost cutting THOMSON-CSF, the French state controlled defence electronics group, yesterday announced an 8 per cent rise in last year's net profits and forecast another earnings increase this year. The group reported net profits of FFr2.34bn (Dollars 417m) in 1991, up from FFr2.17bn in the previous year, on turnover down by 5 per cent to FFr35bn. Thomson-CSF attributed the profits improvement to a fall in restructuring charges and the gains of previous year's efforts at cutting costs. Mr Alain Gomez, the chairman, said profits should rise in 1992, assuming a constant company structure, but he warned that the Dollars 300m acquisition of the missiles operations of LTV of the US would create slight dilution of earnings. Thomson-CSF's bid was approved by a US bankruptcy court 10 days ago, and the group is now waiting to see if it can win the final go-ahead from the US committee on foreign investment, expected to make a decision in three months. Thomson-CSF warned that sales should fall again by between 3 per cent and 5 per cent this year, because of the continuing reduction in defence spending by its government customers, and the winding down of a large missile contract for Saudi Arabia. However, the group said it would continue to restructure and look for opportunities to buy market share. Despite the defence spending slowdown, Thomson-CSF has managed to keep its order book steady.</p>

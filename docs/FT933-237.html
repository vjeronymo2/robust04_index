			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Pachinko fever survives recession PACHINKO, a cross between pinball and gambling which is one of Japan's most popular games, appears to be surviving the recession better than most industries. The pachinko industry scored an astonishing Y17,000bn (Pounds 106bn) in sales last year, up 7.8 per cent on 1991, according to yesterday's Mainichi Daily News, in a study of the little-researched industry. That is more than the turnover of Toyota and Nissan combined. Pachinko parlours, with their garish facades, are standard features of many Japanese shopping streets. Players sit in rows, facing upright pin boards on which they flip metal balls about for hours on end, accompanied by rock music. All kinds of folk do it, from stressed salarymen to university professors. Nearly 30m people, a quarter of the population, confess to being addicts. The sales figures mean that the average pachinko fan gambled Y566,666 last year. That might look a lot, but the figures are skewed by a few big betters, who place up to Y30,000 a time on so-called 'fever' machines, set to pay out high winnings for big stakes. But in spite of their recession-proof sales performance, Japan's 17,000 pachinko operators say net earnings are being squeezed. Average gross profit margins have nearly halved to 16 per cent since 1980. This is because parlours have jacked up their payouts - fever machines are an example - to defend their markets from a growing number of new operators seeking a share of those high rewards. One operator maintains that only one in three parlours is actually profitable these days. Competition is also forcing pachinko parlours to take a somewhat creative view of the gambling laws, which forbid them from paying winnings in cash. Instead, successful pachinko wizards are legally supposed to take winnings in kind. Anything from chewing gum to a computer will do. In a bid to outdo their rivals, some parlours have started paying the biggest winners in gold ingots, according to the Mainichi Daily News study. Others have taken to paying out in tokens, which can be turned into cash at exchange desks, sometimes run by local yakuza gangsters.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULINARY SOS: GRILLED CHICKEN WITH THE HOT, SPICY TASTE OF JAMAICA  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: Do you happen to have a recipe for Jerk Chicken that you'd find in  Jamaican restaurants? Love to have it.  </P> <P>  -- CLAIRE  </P> <P> DEAR CLAIRE: Super idea for Thanksgiving turkey too. Meanwhile, here is the  recipe for Jamaican Jerk Chicken taken from the Summer 1989 issue of a new  quarterly ($10.95 for four issues) called "The Whole Chile Pepper," which one  can subscribe to by writing to Whole Chile Pepper, Out West Publishing, P.O.  Box 4278, Albuquerque, N. M. 87196.  </P> <P> The key to the recipe is the chile paste used to brush on the chicken. The  recipe calls for brands of chile salsa, such as 1/4 cup of Inner Beauty or  other Caribbean hot sauce. You can also buy 10 Scotch Bonnet chiles (Harbanero  chiles said to be the hottest in the world) and puree them with 1/4 cup yellow  mustard for the proper effect. Harbanero chiles can sometimes be found in fresh  form in Mexican and Caribbean markets. If not available, use any hot chile.  </P> <P> According to the chile article, jerk meat dishes were originally created by  maroons (escaped slaves) in Jamaica, as a method of preserving pork by rubbing  it with a chile paste then open pit smoking the meat. Pork evolved into  chicken, which is also rubbed with the same chile mixture but slow-grilled so  that it develops a rather dried out crusty top, similar to smoked meat.  </P> <P> JAMAICAN JERK CHICKEN  </P> <P> 1/4 cup Caribbean hot sauce  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons dried rosemary  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons chopped parsley  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons dried basil  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons dried thyme  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons mustard seeds  </P> <P> 4 tablespoons chopped green onions  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> Juice of 2 limes  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons orange juice  </P> <P> Vinegar  </P> <P> 6 chicken thighs with legs attached  </P> <P> Combine hot sauce, rosemary, parsley, basil, thyme, mustard seeds, green  onions, salt, pepper, lime and orange juices and 2 tablespoons vinegar in  blender container and blend until paste is formed, being sure ingredients are  well blended. Paste should be consistency of thick tomato sauce. If too thick,  thin with more vinegar.  </P> <P> Cover and let stand in refrigerator 2 hours, or overnight (but not more than 2  weeks).  </P> <P> Rub chicken with paste and grill over very low coals, uncovered, 1 hour. If  covered, place coals to 1 side of grill and chicken on other and cook about 1/2  hour. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P>  Note: For turkey, use whole turkey or turkey parts. Brush paste as directed.  Roast at 350 degrees according to time table for turkey. Turkey can be covered  until almost done, then remove cover to allow skin and paste to crisp.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: I'm looking for a recipe for Pumpkin squares made with cream cheese  frosting.

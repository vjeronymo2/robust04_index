			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Leading Article: A new Ken Mr Kenneth Clarke has seen the future and it is wearing a hair-shirt. Not content with Monday's display of monetary austerity, the chancellor of the exchequer is telling his party to expect the same prudence with regard to taxes. He is asking the government to gamble that making the voters feel safe is a surer re-election strategy than trying to make them feel good. On the face of it, Mr Clarke's approach makes good economic and political sense. Sterling's humiliating departure from the European exchange rate mechanism left the public, as well as the financial markets, distrustful of the government's macro-economic credentials. A single pre-emptive interest rate increase, like Monday's half-point rise, will not convince them that the Conservatives are once again the party of sound money. Resisting pre-election tax cuts, on the other hand, might look impressively frugal, particularly if the Conservatives continue to lag so far behind in the polls. Yet Mr Clarke's hair-shirt has a number of holes. The first is practical: he may not convince the rest of his party that austerity makes sense. Resisting tax cuts in this November's Budget will not be too difficult, since many in the party had already accepted that an early giveaway was unlikely. In 1995 and 1996, however, the pressure for some pre-election crowd pleasers could be considerable. In fact, no credible chancellor can definitively rule out tax changes - whether increases or cuts - for the coming two or three years. The target of Mr Clarke's sombre warnings would seem to be, not supporters of lower taxes, per se, but those who would wish him to lower them in the run-up to the next election, even if the government's public spending targets had not been met. Mr Clarke may be correct that trying to revive a voter feel-good factor with tax cuts could backfire on the government if the fiscal deficit were to remain high. In truth, however, the public sector borrowing requirement is likely to fall dramatically over the period, thanks to the combined effect of lower inflation and economic recovery. Indeed, the figure for 1993-94 is likely to be about Pounds 30bn-Pounds 31bn, considerably less than the Pounds 36bn predicted at the time of the last Budget. Keeping to last year's nominal spending targets has proved simpler than many supposed, since very low inflation enables a greater volume of spending at no additional cost. It is possible that Mr Clarke is simply playing a chancellor's traditional role, by lowering pre-budgetary expectations. Certainly, if ministers really believed that tax cuts were ruled out, they would have every incentive to think of ways to spend the extra cash granted them by lower inflation. Mr Clarke should be careful not to encourage quiet pre-election profligacy of this kind.</p>

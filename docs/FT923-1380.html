			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: WIC raises Pounds 50m via reduction of brewing portfolio THE WHITBREAD Investment Company, an investment trust 49.9 per cent owned by Whitbread, the brewer, yesterday raised about Pounds 50m through the placing of shares it controlled in several brewing and pub groups. It was forced to reduce the number of public houses under its control to comply with the government's beer orders which come into effect on November 1. These were introduced after the 1989 Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the industry. Mr Robin Farrington, WIC's chairman, said that two thirds of the Pounds 50m raised was immediately reinvested in large international drinks companies to spread its portfolio. Under the terms of the beer orders companies have to reduce their stake in brewing and pub groups to below 15 per cent. However, because Whitbread holds a 49.9 per cent stake in WIC which in turn holds a 29.9 per cent stake in Whitbread, the combined maximum shareholding of both companies in any one brewer and pub group is set at 21.2 per cent. WIC sold 6.9 per cent of Boddington, the pubs, hotels and healthcare group, and 18.9 per cent of Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Burton-based brewer. Whitbread, which distributes Marston's beers and has a long-term supply agreement with Boddington, took advantage of WIC's move to take its shareholding in both companies to 8.8 per cent. WIC is left with 12.3 per cent in the two companies bringing Whitbread and WIC's combined shareholding to 21.1 per cent. WIC also sold 3.3 per cent of JA Devenish, the West Country-based pub operator, which was bought by Whitbread. WIC had to bring its Devenish shareholding down to 11 per cent because both WIC and Whitbread have a stake in Boddington which owns 19.5 per cent of Devenish.</p>

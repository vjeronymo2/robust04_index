			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Ministers fight for EC treaty A RENEWED government offensive to promote the merits of the Maastricht treaty began yesterday as ministers came under fierce attack from the opposition over this week's backtracking on the legal consequences of Labour's amendment on the social chapter. Even though Monday's embarrassing U-turn seems to have saved the government from the worst danger of defeat by an alliance of opposition parties and Tory Euro-sceptics, ministers still made opportunities to drive home the consequences for the UK of failing to ratify the treaty. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the Foreign Office minister, said the treaty established inter-government co-operation as a framework for community development, and was critical to economic recovery. 'Nobody should under-estimate the body blow it would be for Britain if we were to take up a semi-detached position as far as Europe is concerned,' he warned. The message will be taken up today in a speech by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. Looking at the prospects for the community over the coming decade, he will emphasise that Maastricht is part of a longer-term game in which it is vital to ensure that the UK remains an influential player. He will set out a European vision of a wider, de-centralised, outward-looking, free-trade community - a vision ministers believe can unite the Tory party. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats returned to the attack over Mr John Major's refusal to publish the advice from Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, which says that acceptance of Labour's social chapter amendment would not affect the government's ability to ratify the treaty. In a letter to the prime minister, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, insisted that the reasoning behind the opinion was 'a vital piece of information which should not be withheld from parliament'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused ministers of showing 'a disgraceful contempt for parliament'. Talking of 'the fumbling indecision of the government and growing evidence of the lack of integrity of cabinet ministers,' Mr Ashdown said he could not see why anyone should trust the government on this issue until it produced its evidence. The government has already conceded that in future the attorney-general or his deputy should be available at Westminster whenever MPs debate the bill, but the opposition says that is not enough. When discussion resumes on Monday, Labour will call for a new debate on its amendment in the light of the revised legal advice. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's external trade commissioner, yesterday echoed ministerial warnings about the economic consequences of rejecting the treaty. He also raised the prospect of the UK being in the slow lane of a two-speed Europe, saying that it would lead to a grouping of nations within the EC 'determined to go ahead further and faster without us, but with a huge influence over our economic future and potentially even our security'.</p>

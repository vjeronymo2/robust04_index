			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Malaysia looks to younger politicians MALAYSIA'S body politic has undergone a fundamental change following elections within the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), the party which has dominated the country since independence from Britain in 1957. A new, younger and more politically aggressive team within Umno led by Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister, looks set to gain greater influence over the running of the country. Mr Anwar, 46, was declared Umno deputy president at a party convention yesterday. Three of Mr Anwar's supporters, all in their 40s, were also elected to leading positions, pushing aside older leaders including Mr Ahmad Badawi, the foreign minister and Mr Sanusi Junid, the agriculture minister. Umno, a party composed entirely of Malays who make up about half of Malaysia's 18m population, controls almost all senior positions in government. It is also believed to be an immensely wealthy organisation, with close connections with many of Malaysia's leading business conglomerates. In the past the Umno deputy president has automatically become deputy prime minister. Mr Anwar has now established himself as the successor to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, 68, who has been prime minister since 1981. Mr Anwar has risen rapidly in politics. A former leader of Malaysia's Islamic youth league, he was imprisoned for a time in the 70s, suspected of anti-government activities. The finance minister had been involved in an often bitter battle for the post of Umno deputy president with Mr Ghafar Babar, a veteran politician who served as Dr Mahathir's right hand man for many years. In the past Dr Mahathir has supported Mr Anwar but analysts say the prime minister could now feel threatened by the considerable power base the finance minister has built up within the party. Following the Umno elections, a cabinet reshuffle is now likely. Dr Mahathir might also choose to call an early general election to unite the party and prevent a possible rift developing between its older and younger members.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (5): Plenty of opportunities - Transport IF the devil was to redesign a transport system for hell, he could do no worse than model it on Bangkok, Thailand's capital. Cross-town journeys which would take no more than 30 minutes elsewhere often take several hours through the congested streets of this teeming Asian city. The average speed of vehicles in Bangkok has been estimated at 5kph. There are many times when it seems slower. Traffic flows with equal difficulty in Taipei, Taiwan's capital, and in Seoul, capital of Korea, where the air pollution caused by car exhausts regularly hangs in a pall over the city. There is a desperate need to modernise transport systems in many Asian countries - and not just in large sprawling cities where massive traffic jams are customary and smog fills the air for many months each year. The free flow of goods and people is essential for industry and commerce to flourish and also if governments are to persuade populations and investment to move from over-crowded cities to under-developed areas. The lack of adequate road and rail links will constrain further economic growth in these countries unless development plans for rapid transit systems, high-speed rail links and new motorways proceed. It is not surprising, therefore, that increased investment in transport has been given a priority in national development plans. The excitement for international engineers, wishing to share in some of the hundreds of billions of dollars of contracts on offer, is that they will be dealing with governments which can afford to pay them in currencies which are worth having. Some of the world's fastest-growing economies are to be found in Asia which, unlike Africa or parts of eastern Europe and South America, combine need for new construction with financial strength and, in the main, political stability. It makes the region one of the world's most attractive construction markets. Construction of roads, particularly new motorways, provides a key element of transport plans. Thousands of kilometres of new expressways are planned in countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia. In some cases these are needed to provide extra capacity on already overcrowded trade routes. In other cases, such as in South Korea, road development is being used to open up undeveloped areas of the country and to encourage investment away from congested metropolitan centres. Most of the roads will be built by domestic construction companies which are well skilled in the mechanics of pouring concrete and tarmacadam. A few opportunities for international contractors may arise in countries such as Taiwan which may require specialist skills such as tunneling and bridge-building. The high cost of road and railway building has meant that Asian governments, despite the strength of some national economies, are already looking at ways of softening the impact of big public spending programmes on local inflation and interest rates. One alternative is to encourage the private sector to invest in transport projects under build-own-operate arrangements. The government gets a road or railway it would not otherwise be able to afford. Investors get their return from collecting tolls or fares. In many cases the route reverts to state ownership after an agreed number of years. Much of the North-South Highway that runs the length of Malaysia has been financed in this way by the private sector. Taylor Woodrow of the UK advised on large parts of the project. Trafalgar House, the UK construction, property, shipping and hotels group, has submitted proposals to build one of 17 private toll roads identified by the Indonesian government. Taiwan, which has a large highway development programme, is also investigating the possibility of financing part of this from the private sector. Most roads, however, are likely to be financed by the public sector given the problems over securing government guarantees on debt repayments. Governments may also want to retain some measure of control over pricing on sensitive routes. Construction of railways, both light rail and metros to ease congestion in big cities, and high-speed rail links to connect big centres and export ports, also figures highly in the development plans of Asian countries. The Seoul Metro is being expanded while construction of a Dollars 18bn rapid transit system is under way. Bangkok has longstanding plans to ease its congestion problems through a privately-financed light rail system. Hopewell, the privately-owned Hong Kong development group, is the favourite to finance and build the project. Many other Asian cities have plans to build metros and light rail projects. Even if only a quarter of these are built it will provide a large amount of work for railway engineering groups. Much of the electrical and mechanical works, the signalling, locomotives, and automatic ticketing systems, will need to be imported, providing work for international companies from Europe, Japan and the US. Plans for high-speed rail links are well advanced in South Korea and Taiwan. These projects, costing many billions of dollars, will also provide opportunities for overseas companies which again will be expected to supply the core systems. The basic track laying will be done locally. Companies winning contracts will be expected to work in joint venture with domestic groups. Transfer of technology is almost as important to Asian countries as the actual building of these projects. As with roads, the bulk of the finance for these schemes will come from the public sector but there may be some opportunity for private investment. In some cases, concessions to operate rapid transit systems may be sold off once the project has been developed. The opportunities, as with so much construction in Asia, are vast.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Weili [0491 5898 7787]: ``Ministry of </F> Electronics Industry Organizes Expert Forum for Electronics  Industry Development Planning'']    [Text] From 19 to 20 October 1993, the General Planning  Department and the Technology and Quality Monitoring Department  of the Ministry of Electronics Industry (MEI) held a joint  expert forum in Beijing for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (FYP) and  for 2010 planning. The forum was attended by experts and  supervisors from more than 40 units in the ministerial system.  MEI Deputy Minister Zhang Jinqiang [1728 0093 1730] gave an  important speech at the forum. Also present were Director Wu  Xiaolong [0702 1420 7893] and Deputy Directors Xu Shuncheng  [1776 7311 2052] and Wang Jianzhang [3769 1696 4545] of the  General Planning Department, Director Li Houbin [2621 0624 7001]  of the Technology and Quality Monitoring Department, Director Li  Dasheng [6786 1129 0581] of the Basic Product and Major Projects  Department, and Deputy Director Chen Zhengqing [7115 2973 3237]  of the Computer and Information Promotion Department.    Zhang Jinqiang analyzed in his speech recent achievements  and  existing problems of China's electronics industry. He emphasized  conceptual planning for the Ninth FYP and 2010. He pointed out  that plans for the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth FYPs were all  formulated under a planned economics system and carried a heavy  planned-economy flavor. While planning for the Ninth FYP, we are  faced with a very different setting. First, as the socialist  market economy matures, the market is playing an increasingly  stronger role in the allocation of resources. Second, when China  joins GATT, the domestic market and the foreign market will  merge to form a greater market. With these premises, we must be  innovative conceptually and practically in our planning for the  Ninth FYP. We must on the one hand learn from the previous FYPs  and on the other hand seize the opportunity of the new reform  situation in China and adjustment of the international  electronics industrial structure. We should formulate a plan for  the greater industry and the greater market. The plan should be  authoritative and of a guiding nature. He stressed the following  five major points:    (1) Strengthen macroscopic control and practice  industry-wide  management. The plan should be beyond departments and ownership.  It should be an industry-wide plan for state-owned,  collectively-owned, private, and foreign businesses.    (2) Implement the new ``16-word'' development strategy.    (3) Make fundamental changes in ideology, both in job  function and in development approach.    (4) Lead the development with systems engineering and  network  engineering. Here he described in detail 20 major projects in  the ministry.    (5) Pay attention to key products, key enterprises, and key  regions.    Li Houbing described the main functions of the Technology  and  Quality Monitoring Department and progress in technical  planning. He also analyzed the relationship between industrial  planning and technology planning and the importance of  technology to the advance of the electronics industry. Wu  Xiaolong expressed three opinions. First, the main point of  planning is no longer how to divide the money and materials.  With limited financial resources, the state resources must  reside on major engineering projects. Second, we must properly  handle the relationship between domestic and foreign issues and  make full use of the ``two resources, two markets.'' Joining  GATT will place Chinese products on equal footing in competing  with foreign products. We must therefore aim high and pay  attention to economic efficiency. Third, we should avoid  repetition.    The attending experts listened to the presentations of  Zhang,  Li and Wu and conducted wide-ranging discussions on  communications, television broadcasting, computers and software,  microelectronics, basic products and military applications. They  made the following recommendations for the Ninth FYP and 2010:  <H5>  I. Methods for Speeding Up Development </H5>   (1) New Understanding of the ``16-Word'' Strategy    We must first adhere to ``market orientation'' and organize  our production and macroscopic control according to the market  supply and demand. We must change the old practice of paying  attention only to production and ignoring management, and  centering all activities on the plan and not the market. In the  meantime, we must use efficient industrial management to promote  consumption and direct the market. Second, we should combine the  strategy of ``using the foreign market to stimulate the domestic  market'' and the development model of ``using offense as a  defense.'' We need to carry forward the development of some  basic industries in China by exporting. For example, we can  proceed to produce HDTV receivers that meet U.S. standards for  the U.S. market and by so doing develop domestic HDTV receivers  and related industries in China.    (2) Strengthening Industrial Management and Information  Guidance    We should avoid duplication, improve industrial management,  and include all enterprises, including village and city  enterprises and ``tri-investment'' enterprises into the  management system. To enhance management, MEI should implement  several constraint and control measures. Examples are the right  to formulate product and technical standards, and to certify  equipment. They recommended a reform of the State Radio  Regulatory Committee so that it may transcend other departments  and become more efficient.    (3) Establishing China's Own Industry    The strength of the industry is in its products. There can  be  development only when the products meet the needs of the  customers. We should make the development of the ``Golden Card''  a major business in China. If MEI itself is buying the ``Golden  Card'' from foreign countries, then the banks can also buy it  and there would be no need for MEI to develop it. China was  practicing importing during the Sixth and Seventh FYPs and  cooperation during the Eighth FYP; now it is time to establish  our own industry and stop relying on others.    (4) People as the Key to Development    Much more attention should be given to people and stability  of the ranks. In recent years people in enterprise units are  flowing toward joint-venture and independently owned businesses,  offices of foreign businesses in China, and toward the eastern  coastal areas. This human flow has left many business units with  technical staffs trained in the 1950s and 1960s. There is now an  alarming discontinuity in human resources, which is extremely  detrimental to the development of the electronics industry. The  forum recommends that MEI perfect its reward system, formulate  corresponding policies, and stabilize ranks. This has a direct  impact on the realization of goals set for the Ninth FYP and  2010.    (5) Reconciling Research and Production    Speed up the reform of the old scientific research system,  establish national high-tech venture capital foundations, let  the state share the risks and benefits with the enterprises and  the research institutes. Pay attention to basic research and  technology reserves, provide protection via investment policy.  <H5>  II. Development Trends for Ninth FYP and 2010 </H5>   (1) Communications and Television    The trends in communications and television are digital  technology, multi-media, software, and system networking. In the  short term, analog mobile communications products will still be  the lead product in the Chinese market, and we must quickly  master the technology for mass production. For digital mobile  communications products we need to excel in research and follow  this technology. Fiber-optic communications will be centered on  the development of synchronous fiber-optic technology. The main  task in microwave communications is to improve the volume,  quality, and reliability. Satellite communications will again be  based on digitized transmission. Developments in television will  include a CATV system based on fiber-optic transmission. Digital  TV will be gradually commercialized and China needs to conduct  research and technology tracking for [digital] HDTV.    (2) Computers and Software    The unification of computers and communication characterizes  an information society. Parallel processing is an important way  to improve computing and will be the trend for future mid-size  and main-frame computers. Software and information services are  capturing a greater share in the computer industry. The triad of  software, systems integration, and services is the main trend in  software development. Multi-media will become practical.  Magnetic recording will move toward greater volume and density  and magneto-optical disks will find broad application in  computers. Computer security will receive increasing attention.  Software operating systems will be based on Unix and Windows.  Software development should move toward public-domain  applications and development tools should move from single to  integrated. Development methods will go from the traditional  methods toward object-oriented approaches.    The Ninth FYP should emphasize notebook computers. China has  already made some progress in workstations and the efforts  should continue. The software industry should stress application  software, especially high-level software packages. The  technology for software tools and systems software should be  tracked.    (3) Microelectronics    The future development trends in microelectronics are  integrable, programmable FPGA [field-programmable gate array]  technology, MOSYS systems, hybrid ICs, and quantum devices.  Development emphasis for the Ninth FYP should be placed on the  following items: When introducing new technology for the  low-grade or medium-grade products already on the market, the  emphasis should be on the novelty and not on the high tech.  Practice secondary integration using existing foreign technology  and products. Strive for breakthroughs in the design of ICs. Pay  attention to packaging and broaden the applications of  microelectronics in the automobile industry.    (4) Basic Products    Production of components will continue to move toward  miniaturization, thin-film usage, and large-scale integration.  Mass-production technology will receive great attention.  Emphasis in the Ninth FYP should be as follows: In component  production, chip-type components are yielding the mid-grade  market in favor of low-grade, high-consumption components and  high-grade products with high added value. The development of  sensors and transducers should stress silicon-on-sapphire [SOS]  transducers with high stability in a high humidity environment,  low-voltage pressure-sensitive resistors, and thin-film Hall  devices. The emphasis in electronic components should be hybrid  ICs, electronic power meters, electronic cards, and heat  sensors. Electronic functional materials should stress sensing  materials, precision electronics ceramics, high-density and  low-noise magnetic recording materials, fiber-optic materials,  high-energy-density rare earth permanent magnetic materials, and  new types of acousto-optic materials. For relays and connectors,  China should first develop relays and connectors used in  communications and television, solid-state relays and chip  connectors, ICs, and multi-layer printed circuit boards. Second,  China should mass-produce black-and-white and color TFTs  [thin-film transistor LCDs] and monochrome and black-and-white  STN [supertwist-nematic LCDs] used in opto-electronics. Third,  in the area of electronic equipment and special facilities,  China should emphasize communications equipment and equipment  for precision manufacturing.    (5) Military Electronics    Modern war has placed a higher demand on electronics  technology. Experts at the forum made forecasts for the needs in  China's command systems, navigation guidance systems,  friend-or-foe identification systems, information systems,  aerospace systems, and traffic control systems, and identified  the key technologies for each system.</p>

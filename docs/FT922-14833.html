			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Japanese post record trade surplus JAPAN'S current account surplus rose to a monthly record of Dollars 10.8bn (Pounds 6.2bn) in February, as exports surged while imports fell sharply. The huge increase in the broadest measure of Japan's external balances, 77 per cent higher than a year ago, looks certain to aggravate an already high level of friction with Japan's trade partners. The rising surplus reflects in part the slowdown in Japan's economy, which reduces demand for imported goods. Weak domestic demand also encourages manufacturers to reduce stocks by selling them overseas. The Japanese government will come under increasing international pressure to stimulate the economy and restore growth in order to reduce its external surpluses. A package of emergency economic measures announced on Tuesday, and a 0.75 point cut in the official discount rate to 3.75 per cent announced on Wednesday, have been widely dismissed as inadequate to revive the economy. The Tokyo stock exchange yesterday interrupted its recent slide, with the the Nikkei average closing 273.68 higher at 18,559.71. The February trade balance, which excludes invisible trade items such as tourism and insurance, rose by 74 per cent to Y12.3bn, just short of the record set in December. Exports rose by 12.5 per cent, led by strong sales of cars and ships. Imports fell by 12.7 per cent. The dollar value of the surplus was also boosted by the higher value of the yen compared to a year ago and by lower commodity prices, especially for crude oil. February saw a continuing heavy flow of long-term capital into Japan, with a net capital surplus of Dollars 1.7bn, compared to Dollars 3.5bn in January. Foreigners were net purchasers of Japanese equities worth Dollars 2.4bn, although they turned net sellers of Japanese bonds, worth Dollars 1.2bn. Japanese continued to be net sellers of foreign equities, worth Dollars 893m in February. Net Japanese purchases of foreign bonds fell from Dollars 7.4bn in January to Dollars 1.4bn in February.</p>

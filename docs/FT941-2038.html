			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Clarke stands by Budget increases Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has reaffirmed that the economic recovery will not be threatened by the tax increases announced in the Budget, which are due to come in over the next two weeks. In an article in House magazine, a weekly journal distributed in the Palace of Westminster, Mr Clarke says he was right to introduce increases in taxation and cuts in public spending in last November's unified Budget. He says that he accepted at the time that there would be 'recriminations and upset as April approached' and that people are still 'a bit shell-shocked' after the experience of the past few years. But he remains convinced that he was right to make the reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement the cornerstone of his proposals. He says: 'If I had not taken decisive action, confidence would have taken a serious knock. 'The main topic of economic debate now would not be the outlook for economic recovery but how much more I would need to raise taxes in the next Budget. That would create unwelcome uncertainty for people planning their family finances. And the markets would have judged that this government had lost the ability to take tough decisions.' Mr Clarke acknowledged that some areas of the economy faced an uncertain future. But he says that low inflation has been the most promising of all economic indicators in recent months.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Observer: Sic transit gloria Hard to believe that but a month ago, Rolls-Royce reigned supreme on the streets of Tokyo when the newly-wed Crown Prince chose to parade his bride in a glorious open-topped model. No such treatment for Britain's prime minister yesterday, however. John Major was able to kiss goodbye to any pipe-dreams involving a Japanese-inspired renaissance of his country's motor trade when, touching down for the G7 summit, he was promptly shovelled into a splendid, er, Mercedes Benz. Why, exclaimed anguished UK expats, the Japanese government could at least have produced a Nissan, Toyota or Honda, all of which are now made in the UK as well as Japan. As does much these days, it apparently all boils down to security. The German tank seemingly possessed the requisite heavy armour plating.  Fortunately, Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, kept the flag flying by arriving in the British ambassodor's Rolls-Royce.</p>

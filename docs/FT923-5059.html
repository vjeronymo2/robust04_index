			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Yeltsin set for China visit RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin will visit China in mid-December and India in January in a clear sign that Russia is beginning to pay much more attention to its Asian neighbours after initially concentrating on the west following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Mr Yeltsin's first presidential visits outside Europe and America take him later this month to Japan, where he faces tough negotiating on Japanese demands for a return of the Kurile islands. He then travels on to South Korea, which has worked hard to build up an economic presense in Russia. After a cooling under President Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, Sino-Russian relations are also getting warmer, with Russia actively negotiating fresh arms sales to China.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATION;  </P> <P> CHILD'S REFERENCE LIBRARY IS A WISE INVESTMENT  </P> <P> One of the best investments you can make to help your child excel in school is  to build a current and thorough reference library at home.  </P> <P> But spending hundreds of dollars on a set of encyclopedias is not necessary. In  fact, many librarians advise spending the money on a set of more versatile  books instead.  </P> <P> A thorough and accurate dictionary is the most important reference book your  child can possibly have while in school, and two publishers are favored by  teachers and librarians.  </P> <P> "Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary" offers almost 160,000 words with  200,000 definitions. A new feature in this edition is that the entries are  dated -- that is, your student can find the age of a word and when it was first  used.  </P> <P> Webster's costs $17.95 in hardcover.  </P> <P> Also popular with teachers and students is the "American Heritage Second  College Edition Dictionary," which also costs $17.95 in hardcover. It contains  100,000 definitions, but its special feature is the 3,000 photographs and  illustrations.  </P> <P> A paperback American Heritage dictionary costs just $4.95, but is leaner, with  60,000 definitions and 400 photographs.  </P> <P> Next to a good dictionary, a thesaurus is most important because it helps  writers avoid tiresome overuse of certain words by suggesting appropriate  synonyms.  </P> <P> According to many teachers and librarians, the name Roget is itself a synonym  for "thesaurus," because "Roget's International Thesaurus" is the most  definitive. This single volume contains 256,000 words and phrases and their  synonyms, in alphabetical order. That's about 100,000 words and phrases more  than other thesauruses have.  </P> <P> In hardcover, the fourth edition of Roget's costs $15.95; the paperback is  $10.95.  </P> <P> If your student is in junior or senior high school, he or she is probably  studying a foreign language. A dictionary for that language is indispensable.  </P> <P> The Cassell's series of language dictionaries is favored by many teachers.  Cassell's Spanish-English, French-English and German-English dictionaries each  sell for $21.95 in hardback.  </P> <P> They all include words most used in modern speech and literature, as well as  idioms and newly accepted words. They also contain pronunciation guides and  verb conjugation tables.  </P> <P> Smaller editions are $10.95 each, and will fit easily into your child's  backpack.  </P> <P> The hottest new one-volume desk encyclopedia is the "Random House  Encyclopedia." Its 2,912 pages include 13,500 illustrations and a 132-page  full-color atlas.  </P> <P> The encyclopedia is divided into sections such as "The Universe," "Life on  Earth," "History and Culture," and "Man and Science." Each of these contains  dozens of subtopics.  </P> <P> Random House prices its encyclopedia at $129.95, but at least one local  bookstore chain is now selling it for about $65.  </P> <P> The "1991 World Almanac and Book of Facts" has just hit the bookstores. This  annual favorite comes in paperback and costs $6.95.  </P> <P> The almanac is not only useful for finding statistics for reports and speeches,  but is also intriguing because of its variety of topics. Headings include  "All-Time Top 50 Movie Grosses," "Tips for Fuel-Efficient Driving," and "Major  Decisions of the Supreme Court."  </P> <P> All maps and flags of the world are new to this edition, and there are about 1  million up-to-date facts in all.  </P> <P> Recently I wrote about the declining fitness of area teen-agers and suggested  that you help your child exercise more. Now you can buy a book that tells how  to do just that.  </P> <P> "Teenage Fitness," by Bonnie Prudden, sells for about $10 in paperback and  outlines a complete exercise program for your teen-ager.  </P> <P> The book includes tests to spot the student's physical strengths and  weaknesses, and offers dozens of exercises that do not require special clothing  or equipment. It also advises students on how to make the most of his or her  gym facilities at school.  </P> <P> A handbook of etiquette may at first seem out of place in a student's reference  library. But good manners and social poise are skills as necessary for success  in life as reading and writing.  </P> <P> Emily Post's "Etiquette," fourteenth edition, is probably the best up-to-date  guide to modern manners for teens and adults. Post will help your child master  the basic rules of social interaction, including table manners, making good  conversation, writing business letters and other common courtesies.  </P> <P> It is a valuable and timeless book, available in hardcover for $25.95.  </P></p>

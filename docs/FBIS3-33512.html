Top-ranking  members of the Excutive, Legislative, and Judicial Branches have  decided that a pact of silence is the best solution. Despite  this, jurists and legislators believe that the president's  behavior during the Carnival parade at dawn on 13 February at  the Sambodromo [Carnival parade ground in Rio de Janeiro] could  be tried under the Impeachment Law (Law 1079) if there is  political willingness to do so.    A clear example of this cautiousness is how Deputy Nelson  Jobim (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande  do Sul], the rapporteur of the constitutional revision, reacted.  On 14 February, when the newspapers published the pictures of  Itamar Franco and the model, Jobim avoided commenting: "I have  nothing to say about Carnival, I have to mind the constitutional  revision." In private meetings, Jobim, Deputy Sigmaringa Seixas  (PSDB-DF) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Federal District]  and Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive Renewal  Party-Para] said that this is no time to apply the law to the  letter. The group is supported by the STF [Federal Supreme  Court] members, and cabinet members such as Industry and  Commerce Minister Elcio Alvares.    Jobim, Sigmarigna, Passarinho and Alvares are certain that  if  a destabilizing atmosphere is created, Franco will be unable to  avoid impeachment for having violated Clause 7 of Article 9 of  the law. This clause establishes that "behavior in a manner  incompatible with the dignity, distinction, and decency of the  post" constitutes a crime against probity in administration."  Passarinho declined to comment on the issue by stating: "I  will not comment on this, not because I am restricted from doing  so but because my comments would be harmful to the country."    Minister Elcio Alvares, who played an active role in the CPI  [Congressional Investigating Committee], which impeached former  President Fernando Collor, has also declined to pass any legal  judgment on the issue. He said: "During the CPI, I was a  senator of the nation, but today I am a member of President  Franco's cabinet." Although he admits that the incident, which  he personally witnessed at the Sambodromo, was not "irrelevant",  he warned: "We need to minimize the incident in order to have  some tranquility at the economic level. There is a good saying  for all this: `Blame it on Carnival.'" Asked whether the  institution of the presidency of the Republic, may just get  carried away by the rhythms of Carnival, Alvares said: "Please  spare me, because I do not want to be disloyal to President  Franco."    In a note to the press, the Brazilian Shoes Exporters  Association [Associacao Brasileira dos Exportadores de Calcados]  (Abaex) has demanded President Itamar Franco tender his  resignation within 48 hours, "for lack of decorum." Otherwise  "for the sake of the dignity of the fatherland", Abaex will  submit an impeachment request to the STF. According to Abaex,  Itamar Franco's gesture "debases the nation by ridiculing it  before international public opinion."</p>

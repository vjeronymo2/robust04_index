			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POINDEXTER SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR ROLE IN IRAN-CONTRA SCANDAL  </P> <P> Once again, we see that individuals accused and convicted of "white-collar  crimes" are treated differently from those individuals charged with other  criminal offenses. If you look at the consequences of the conduct of Poindexter  and the other "convicts" of the Iran-Contra affair, you see the following:  People were killed as a result of their participation in the military conduct  on behalf of the Contras; people were killed by those who were acting on behalf  of the Contras; Poindexter and others actually conspired to violate the Boland  Amendment which prohibited aid to the Contras; and Poindexter covered up all of  these atrocities and lied to Congress.  </P> <P> Did you notice his sigh of relief when he was sentenced to only six months in  custody? Of course, he was allowed to remain free on bail pending his appeals.  The bottom line is there is a different -- preferential if you will --  treatment for white-collar criminals that is inherent in our criminal justice  system.  </P> <P> A two-time offender of petty theft who lived in Compton would not be walking  the streets. Where is the equal protection under the law?  </P> <P> KELVIN D. FILER  </P> <P> Compton  </P></p>

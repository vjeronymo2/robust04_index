			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- Syrian Ambassador to  Korea Yasir Farah and his wife on April 28 met with Yi In-mo, a  former war correspondent of the Korean People's Army, who is  known as an incarnation of faith and will.    The ambassador said the Syrian people were struck with  admiration at Yi In-mo who did not abandon his creed as a  communist while being kept behind bars for a long time, not  yielding to the barbarous suppression by the enemy.    Recalling that the great leader President Kim Il-song called  on Yi In-mo in his sickbed last year, so busy as he was, and  showed deep solicitude for him, the ambassador said he was  deeply moved by the president's loving care for his  revolutionary soldiers.    Yi In-mo said that the great leader President Kim Il-song  and  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il are pursuing benevolent  politics and independent politics and that they are the life and  soul of the Korean people.    The guests presented souvenirs to Yi In-mo.</p>

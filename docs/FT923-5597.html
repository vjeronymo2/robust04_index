			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / International Company News: Ford-Werke sees decline continuing FORD-WERKE, the US vehicle maker's German subsidiary, yesterday forecast a continuing decline in the German car market. It expected no fundamental improvement in the export trade, which in the first half of this year accounted for 64 per cent of its DM12.9bn (Dollars 9.2bn) sales. Ford-Werke reported pre-tax profits of DM525m in the first half, compared with DM517m, from sales up almost 8 per cent. The company claimed its 'product offensive' had paid off. Volume output rose 11,000 vehicles to 539,000. The Escort performed especially well, and accounted for about one-third of all sales. Scorpio production rose 26 per cent, the company said. Deliveries in Germany fell by 64,000 units in the period and reduced market share to 9.6 per cent from 10.5 per cent while exports rose 75,000.</p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: MBOs The buy-out of BP's nutrition interests for Dollars 550m is the latest evidence that the UK management buy-out market is in good nick. Last year the MBO market was quiet as buy-out specialists found they could not compete with the valuations vendors could achieve by floating subsidiaries on the stock market. But this year MBO business has perked up. Though most deals have been much smaller than BP's, Prudential is working on a Pounds 700m buy-out of National Car Parks. Dairy Crest also looks a likely candidate following the postponement of its flotation. The fall in equity markets, and more specifically the closing of the new issue pipeline in May, clearly helped MBOs. Buy-outs have found it easier to compete on price with flotations and sometimes have been a vendor's only option. But the recent recovery in equity markets does not mean the MBO business will go back to square one. For a start, after buying several disappointing new issues in the spring, investors will be more choosy when action picks up next month. Moreover, two developments suggest that buy-out specialists will start bidding higher prices. First, several large new buy-out funds have just closed, which should increase the competition to win deals. Second, banks - which are also flush with cash - may be prepared to finance buy-outs with somewhat greater levels of gearing than have been the norm since leveraged deals such as Magnet went sour in the early 1990s.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Complaint to EC on Dan-Air rescue FOUR British airlines have complained to the European Commission's competition authorities about British Airways' plans to rescue Dan-Air, the troubled Gatwick-based UK carrier, Andrew Hill in Brussels writes. Brussels announced yesterday that the deal - in which BA would take over Dan-Air for a nominal Pounds 1 and assume its liabilities - did not fall under EC merger control rules because Dan-Air's turnover in the community was less than Ecu250m (Pounds 204m). The UK airlines - Virgin, British Midland, Air UK, and Britannia - have lodged their complaint under separate EC treaty rules aimed at preventing distortion of competition or abuse of a company's dominant position. The EC decision means that UK competition authorities might investigate the deal.</p>

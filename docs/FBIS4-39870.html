			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["General Ivanov: Russia Believes that International </F> Forces' Participation in the Settlement of Armenian-Azeri  Conflict Will Be Not Effective"--TURAN headline]    [Text] Baku, June 11 (TURAN) -- Gennadiy Ivanov, the Pavel  Grachev's advisor for military and political problems told  journalists that Russia is ready to send to the conflict zone as  many troops as it will be necessary. He noted that 1800  military soldiers for this purpose will not be enough.    According to Ivanov, Azerbaijan Defense Minister will leave  for Moscow in a few days with relevant authorities to sign the  Moscow Protocol from May 17. The protocol provides the  deployment of Russian military forces into the conflict zone.    Answering the question of NATO's possible participation in  the peacemaking process Ivanov said that Russia follows  directions of an Agreement for Joint Security (AJS) of CIS  countries and has enough forces to separate the warring parties  in Karabakh. According to Ivanov the possibility of Ukraine's  participation in peacemaking process is limited "because Kiev  had not signed the AJS and military facilities of other CIS  members".    Ivanov noted that two weeks ago, addressing in Brussels,  Pavel Grachev noted that AJS remains priorial [as received] for  Russia as a nonbloc document which permits to act not  contradicting to NATO's interests. "Republics of former USSR  have to join and our interests should be common. The occupation  of the territory of one member of CIS by another member Ivanov  called "misunderstanding".

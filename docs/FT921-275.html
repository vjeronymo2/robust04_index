			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour candidates want focus kept on NHS LABOUR parliamentary candidates want the party leadership to keep the future of the National Health Service at the top of its election agenda in spite of last week's row over the controversial election broadcast. There was a strong feeling that the row over the Jennifer Bennett case had distracted from Labour's pledge of an extra Pounds 1bn NHS spending and its warning about a 'two-tier' health system, but all the candidates questioned believed that the future of the NHS must retain a high profile. Mild disappointment that Labour had not moved further ahead in the opinion polls was tempered with broad satisfaction at the campaign so far. Candidates and officials appeared generally satisfied by the performance of Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, in his ITV interview with Brian Walden yesterday. Mr Kinnock faces what could be a tougher test tonight, when he is questioned by David Dimbleby for BBC1's Panorama. To round off a hard week of TV interviews, the Labour leader is interrogated by Sir Robin Day on ITV on Thursday. Experienced Labour candidates yesterday remarked on the slow start to the Conservative campaign. 'It may be that their activists are less enthusiastic because Mrs Thatcher has gone,' ventured Mr Alan Meale, who as candidate for Mansfield defends Labour's smallest majority, just 56 votes. Ms Clare Short, candidate for the safe seat of Birmingham Ladywood, expressed concern about the lack of a Tory presence. After campaigning in the nearby constituency of Birmingham Yardley, where the Liberal Democrats are challenging hard, she said Labour would appreciate more of a fight. Ms Short admitted that the Bennett case had probably helped the Liberal Democrats as both main parties suffered a backlash to the bickering. However, she added that regional polling suggested Labour was doing 'slightly better' than the national polls suggested. A recent convert to proportional representation, she said she would like to see more emphasis in London on Labour's programme of constitutional reforms. 'We have got a very radical agenda, people don't realise what a strong package it is.' In London, officials brushed aside the weekend polls, arguing that it may take a little longer for the impact of the health issue to show through. They said they expected Mr Neil Kinnock's ratings to improve as the election campaign continued. As Labour launched its package of measures for women yesterday, candidates reported that the number of female volunteers working in the constituencies had increased markedly over 1987. Mr Robert Sheldon, seeking re-election as MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, said unemployment and the closing of factories were the main issues being raised in his constituency. There had been no reference to the controversial broadcast.</p>

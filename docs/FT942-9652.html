			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House in talks over Ritz Trafalgar House is believed to be in discussions which could result in Mandarin Oriental, the Hong Kong-based hotel group, managing the Ritz in London. Trafalgar House had been hoping to sell the Ritz, but took it off the market last year when it did not receive what it considered adequate offers. Trafalgar House and Mandarin Oriental have the same chairman, Mr Simon Keswick. Jardine Matheson, which controls Mandarin Oriental, is also Trafalgar's largest shareholder. Trafalgar House is thought to have concluded that in the absence of a buyer for the Ritz, the hotel would benefit from Mandarin Oriental's management and from being part of a larger international hotel marketing network. Both companies declined to comment.</p>

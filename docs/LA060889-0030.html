			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASY STEPS IN COOKING FOR JUST ONE  </P> <P> Make cooking for one easier with these tips for equipping the kitchen, shopping  for groceries and storing food.  </P> <P> Think Small  </P> <P>  -- Purchase scaled-down equipment: a compact microwave oven, toaster oven,  one-quart crockery cooker and small broiler pan.  </P> <P>  -- Buy a selection of small pans, microwave cookware and mixing bowls. Small  amounts of food cook best in small containers. Pack up and put away the  too-large cookware inherited from Mom or left over from family-size cooking  days.  </P> <P> Search Out Food for Singles  </P> <P>  -- Check new products in the supermarket: single-serving items, new frozen  foods, products that have extended storage times, loose-pack frozen fruits and  vegetables.  </P> <P>  -- Buy already-cooked meats and seafoods in small quantities at the deli  section. Use as purchased or in salads, omelets or sandwiches.  </P> <P>  -- Fresh produce available at supermarket salad bars gives you the option of  purchasing a few mushrooms or cherry tomatoes, for instance, rather than a  large package.  </P> <P>  -- Meat markets offer meat sliced for stir-fries and cubed for kebabs. Some  even have meat-and-vegetable kebabs or stuffed meat rolls assembled and ready  to cook.  </P> <P> Store Foods Right  </P> <P>  -- Buy only the quantity of food you can use in a reasonable time. If you know  you won't be using all of an item soon, wrap and freeze it when it's fresh from  the store rather than waiting until it's been in the refrigerator several days.  </P> <P>  -- Because it takes one person longer to use up food items, always be careful  to store food properly. To retain flavor and freshness, store these foods in  the refrigerator rather than in cabinets: cooking oil, nuts, ground coffee,  whole grain products, syrup, jam, peanut butter and Worcestershire sauce.  </P> <P>  -- Use moisture- and vapor-proof materials when wrapping food to freeze.  Freeze foods in single-serving amounts. Place chicken pieces, for example, on a  baking sheet in a single layer. Once they are frozen, transfer them to a  freezer container or plastic bag and seal. The pieces will not stick together  and you can remove just the amount you need.  </P></p>

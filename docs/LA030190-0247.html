			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> UNION TO TIGERS: QUIT PRACTICING  </P> <P> The Major League Baseball Players Assn. told Detroit Tigers working out  together in Lakeland, Fla., to disband because the group practices were sending  the wrong message to owners during negotiations.  </P> <P> "It gives the owners the false impression that we can't wait to get started,"  pitcher Frank Tanana said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Fewer than a dozen players had been working out at Henley Field, about a mile  from the Tigers' spring training site at Joker Marchant Stadium, because of the  owners' lockout.  </P> <P> "Personally, I'm disappointed it was perceived that the workouts meant we  weren't unified," Tanana said. "We just saw it as an opportunity to stay in  shape. But if that was what the owners were thinking, then we'll take that out  of their minds."  </P> <P> The Tigers have canceled all their home exhibition games through March 12, and  the American and National leagues have advised teams that no games will be  played until 10 days after players report to camps.  </P></p>

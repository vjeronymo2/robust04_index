			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITAIN TO INCREASE AIR CONTROLLER STAFF  </P> <P> Britain will more than double its recruitment of trainee air traffic  controllers in the next two years to maintain safety in its increasingly  crowded skies, the Civil Aviation Authority said Saturday.  </P> <P> A spokesman said last year's intake of 80 trainees would rise to 140 this year  and 180 in 1990. The drive aims to provide 600 new controllers by 1996 to  replace those retiring and to operate the new control systems needed to cope  with a forecast growth in air traffic by the end of the century.  </P> <P> The increase in near-collisions in recent years has raised public concern about  air safety.  </P></p>

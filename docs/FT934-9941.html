			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (3): Spoiled for choice - New accounting systems IN the world of finance, company accounting and asset management accounting systems are still the first and sometimes the only reason for investing in a computer system. Those on their second, or even third generation of accounting systems are suddenly facing a new set of problems, and have to choose from a confusing range of products, writes Joia Shillingford. Martin Cook, head of treasury administration and accounting at the Nationwide Building Society, says: 'The main problem is an obvious one: there are so many products to choose from; yet none covers all requirements. Trying to find a system which will consolidate all positions and risks globally is a big problem and systems which even approximate to this are very complex.' There are plenty of basic accounting systems, but few software houses have the backing to develop software which provides the level of management information companies now require. And because of the investment required, it is hard for new companies to break into the market - 'typically, new products only arrive on the scene after they have been developed by a user's IT department or through close co-operation between a software house and a user,' says Mr Cook. Another problem is that accounting and asset management systems quickly go out of date as more instruments become available for offsetting risk, credit and cashflows globally. As a result, most people have a core accounting system used in conjunction with a set of manual processes or add-on software, sometimes developed in-house. In Nationwide's treasury department, Ibis software running on an IBM AS/400 mid-range system provides basic accounting, reporting and settlement. A system called Mica provides derivative pricing and risk management, while a US product, Sandera, provides scenario modeling for the balance sheet. There are electronic links between these systems, but most information is delivered through Comshare's executive information system, Commander. This provides senior managers with a graphical user interface through which financial information is presented clearly. Commander gives managers the ability to 'drill down' through additional screens to find out more about a particular set of figures.</p>

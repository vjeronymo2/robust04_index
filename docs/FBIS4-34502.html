			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Attorney General's Office [PGR] has undertaken a  direct and decisive struggle against drug consumption. The PGR,  which is headed by Humberto Benitez Trevino, has begun a  campaign in Mexico City to prevent crime. The sale,  distribution, and consumption of drugs are the first of a number  of federal crimes about which citizens will receive information.  For this purpose, the PGR has distributed posters in  discotheques and restaurants in Mexico City, especially in the  Zona Rosa, which is usually crowded with young people. The  posters have been placed mainly in rest rooms and have the  objective of making known to youths the dangers that the  consumption and sale of drugs represent.    In the next few days, this crime prevention campaign will be  extended to the entire country and will deal with various  crimes, such as the illegal possession of firearms and the theft  of archaeological artifacts. The colorful posters have the  objective of preventing rather than just lamenting crimes. The  struggle against drug addiction must begin from childhood and  continue with greater intensity during adolescence.</p>

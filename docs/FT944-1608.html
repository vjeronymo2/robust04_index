			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (11): Honest broker strikes gold - Profile: Wood &amp; Co Prague, Budapest and Warsaw teem with young westerners seeking fame and fortune on the new business frontier. They have taken up the latest career advice: Go east, young man, writes Nicholas Denton. Only a few have struck gold. One of them is Richard Wood. He came to Prague with no particular plan and no Czech connections. Aged 34, he is now managing director and main shareholder of the Czech Republic's top independent brokerage house, Wood &amp; Co. His is no rags-to-riches story. Mr Wood was a vice-president at Salomon Brothers in London, specialising in sales of fixed income derivative products. He brought to the Czech Republic his last, bumper bonus, a relationship with Salomon and City contacts. Not to mention a taste for green braces and salmon-pink shirts. It has been, nonetheless, an adventure. What more dramatic time to make the break than New Year's Eve as 1989 turned to 1990 with eastern Europe's revolutions playing on the television screens. 'It was like getting on the Mayflower and going to America except it was only an hour and a half away,' says Mr Wood. When Czech voucher privatisation began, Mr Wood toyed with the idea of setting up an investment fund. Everybody was doing that, but nobody was getting set up to broker between the funds. That's what Mr Wood did. Wood &amp; Co's key advantage is that it is independent. Other domestic brokers are owned by banks which also control fund management companies. 'Richard has been very smart. He has established a niche business as honest broker between the investment funds,' says Mr Nigel Williams, managing director of Creditanstalt Investment Company, and another City boy who has made it in the Czech Republic. Wood &amp; Co has also brought to the Czech Republic a western focus on the client and reputation. 'Our Czech salespeople here actively develop relationships with Czech fund managers,' says Mr Wood. There are always rumours that brokers trade on the back of their clients but most believe Mr Wood's passionate assertion that reputation is the firm's most important asset. It is particularly powerful in eastern Europe, where capitalism is often synonymous with the quick buck. Honesty in a crooked market can be expensive. Wood &amp; Co struck a deal to buy shares for a client. The seller saw the price was going up, reneged on his deal and sold to someone else for 10 per cent more. Wood &amp; Co had to fork up the difference. The company sued but could not convince the court that a person's word should be a bond. The broker estimates his company has lost Dollars 1m this year from settlement failures. 'At times we've almost wiped ourselves out to deliver securities,' he says. Nevertheless, Wood is now a port of call for western funds investing in the Czech Republic. The company estimates it handles about 40 per cent of brokered equity trading, more than any competitor. In recent weeks it has set up operations in Warsaw. This pan-Slav strategy has distinct practical advantages: Czech and Polish are similar. Analysts can visit companies in the other country and more or less communicate. Wood &amp; Co's local experience and growing regional network give it a powerful competitive edge, but eastern Europe's stock markets are maturing. At the moment, emerging market funds, hedge funds and private investors are the most active players. Over time, a wider circle of institutional investors, including risk-averse pension funds, will include the region's shares in their portfolio. Wood &amp; Co will need an alliance with an international investment bank to reach that market. 'Together with a western institution we could do more,' Mr Wood admits. There have been approaches and he appears open to them. A tie-up would close a chapter in Richard Wood's east European adventure. It could also leave him seriously rich.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Alleged illegality at German exchange INVESTIGATIONS into trading irregularities uncovered last month on the Deutsche Terminborse, the German futures and options exchange, have unearthed evidence of potential widespread improprieties involving up to 15 people. 'It is possible that a circle of traders is involved,' said an official at the DTB. He added that employees of more than one DTB member firm may be implicated, as well as of some non-member firms, including foreign institutions. Some of the individuals involved in trades may have acted unknowingly. It has also emerged that two of the three traders suspended by the exchange last month were employees of Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank (Hypo-bank), based in Munich. The two dealers traded a wide range of contracts on the DTB's screen-based trading system, from Hypo-bank's Frankfurt office. The case is being pursued by the prosecutor's office, but no arrests have yet been made. According to Mr Josef Wertschulter, a member of the Hypo-bank board, losses to Hypobank are estimated at DM500,000 (Pounds 203,252) to DM1m, a relatively small sum the bank expects to cover after the seizure of assets of the individuals involved. 'We have got a hot trail to follow,' said Mr Wertschulter. The irregularities were uncovered several months ago by the DTB's own surveillance. They trading irregularities may have been detected because traders were making highly favourable prices, out of line with the rest of the market, to certain accounts.</p>

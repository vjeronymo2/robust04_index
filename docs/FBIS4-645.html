			<p>BFN     [Text] The President's Office has dismissed as total  fabrication a story which appeared in the Kenyan DAILY NATION of  last Saturday [9 April], under the title: Ugandan Leaders in  Crisis Meeting. The paper said that senior Ugandan officials  had been in a meeting to discuss the possibility of sending  troops to Rwanda to halt the anarchy in that country.    In a statement issued in Kampala today, the Office of the  President made it crystal clear that this is a total  fabrication. Uganda, like the other neighboring countries in the  region, the statement said, is ready to assist in any way  possible in the restoration of peace and stability in the  region. However, the statement adds, we stand by our  strongly-held view that any involvement in Rwanda by elements  other than Rwandan, must be arrived at through either a regional  or an OAU decision. This, the statement goes on, is underlined  by the recent regional summit which took place in Dar es Salaam  on 6 April 1994, when the regional leaders discussed the crisis  in Rwanda and Burundi.    Uganda, which has always taken a neutral stance in the  crisis  in Rwanda, the statement declares, will continue to do so.  Should we be called upon to assist, it adds, we shall act only  in concert with the regional countries or with the OAU. There  has therefore been no meeting to discuss the possibility of  sending Ugandan troops to Rwanda. The Office of the President  appealed to all journalists reporting on the events in Rwanda to  desist from the temptation to thrive on the miseries of their  African brothers and sisters by using the tragic event in that  country to make money through fabricated stories.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: FROM 'CHEERS' TO TEARS  </P> <P> Shelley Long -- who departed TV's "Cheers" in 1987 -- will return to the small  screen as the star of a four-hour mini-series for ABC and New World TV, "When  Rabbit Howls," about a woman beset with multiple personalities. Based on the  autobiography of Truddi Chase, the mini-series will chronicle her illness and  therapy following a childhood of being terrorized by a stepfather.  </P> <P> Two-time Emmy-winner Lamont Johnson will direct and co-produce with E. Jack  Neuman, who scripts.  </P> <P> Planned for airing during next May's sweeps, the heavily dramatic role marks a  departure for Long, who's had mixed success with a string of comedy features.  </P> <P> ("Troop Beverly Hills," her last, grossed less than $15 million.)  </P> <P> "The thing to remember," said a rep for director Johnson, "is that years and  years ago, when we thought of Sally Field, it was as 'The Flying Nun.' We  didn't take her seriously, until she did 'Sybil.' " Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

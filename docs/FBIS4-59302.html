			<p>BFN     [Text] The sum of $2 billion in foreign exchange and 703.17  trillion rials in domestic currency has been earmarked for the  provision of basic goods and necessities. Announcing this today  in a joint seminar held in Tehran by the heads of provincial  trade associations and the directors of provincial commercial  centers, Commerce Minister ol-Eshaq added: $800 million of this  amount have been earmarked for subsidies for basic goods and  $700 million for maintaining price equilibrium; in addition,  $500 million have been earmarked for such necessities as paper,  ironware, and tires. All of this will be calculated on the  basis of foreign exchange at the rate of 1,750 rials.    He added: This year, the sum of 3.17 trillion rials in  domestic currency has also been earmarked for subsidies for  basic goods and the sum of 700 billion rials for subsidizing  agricultural organizations. This amount represents a 70 percent  growth over the previous year and, on this basis, we will see no  price rises in these areas this year.    Mr. ol-Eshaq also referred to a proposal for regulating the  market, which was recently approved by the organization for the  protection of producers and consumers and by the economic  council, and said: With the implementation of this proposal,  from 1 Khordad [month beginning 22 May 1994], all goods will be  priced, and this will create a framework for issues relating to  foreign exchange rates, preventing price upheavals, and  clarifying the trend of goods prices.</p>

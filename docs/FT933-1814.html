During Waite's time in captivity there was growing speculation about his relationship with Oliver North, the man at the centre of the American 'arms for hostages' deals, and talk of a rift between Waite and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Waite describes the experience of being held hostage and talks about subsequent resulting difficulties (9.30 BBC1). A new season of BBC2's 'ScreenPlay' begins with Love Lies Bleeding, set in Belfast. A republican prisoner, Conn, held in the Maze, is let out on parole for 24 hours and attempts to establish who killed his girlfriend many years ago (9.00). Tempting music on Radio 3. The BBC Orchestras at 7.30 begins with a live performance by the BBC Philharmonic of Sibelius's tone poem 'The Swan Of Tuonela'. Then at 9.45 in the Bath International Festival a positive feast of real music by Bach, Handel and Telemann.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Warrants issued on Argentine bank debt JP MORGAN, the New York-based banking group, has launched Dollars 100m of call warrants on Argentine bank debt. The deal marks the first time warrants have been issued on the sovereign bank debt of an emerging market borrower. The warrants give investors the option of buying debt within the next year. Argentina is restructuring its debt, and is expected to convert its bank loans into bonds, by the end of this year or early 1993. Each warrant can be exercised into Dollars 250,000 of Argentine General Restructuring Agreement (GRA) debt without interest. The exercise price is 41.5 per cent of the par value. Argentina is undergoing a Brady-style debt restructuring, whereby its debt will be converted from loans into bonds. Provided the restructuring goes ahead, investors will be able to exercise their warrants on the bonds. Bankers familiar with the Latin American markets said the warrants were likely to appeal to institutions and high net worth individuals, and would probably attract Latin American flight capital. 'The warrants give a high leverage, which appeals to a lot of Argentine speculators,' said one UK banker. The warrant issue has coincided with a general strengthening of Argentine assets recently, and may have contributed to a rise in the price of Argentina's debt, from 41 1/2 per cent of face value to 43 5/8 per cent, since Wednesday.</p>

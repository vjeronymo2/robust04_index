			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / BT may abolish peak-rate charge Businesses are set to gain from sweeping price reductions to be announced soon by British Telecommunications, Andrew Adonis writes. The reductions are likely to focus on the weekday peak rate for calls made between 9am and 1pm. This band may be abolished outright which would cost BT more than Pounds 300m in a full year and mainly benefit business users. By the summer BT is pledged to reduce prices by the overall equivalent of 7.5 per cent after allowing for inflation, under an agreement with Oftel, the telecommunications regulator. Recent price cuts have mainly benefited residential customers and the next round of cuts, which will mainly benefiting businesses, will fulfil most of the agreements with Oftel for the year to July. Mercury, BT's main competitor, is likely to follow suit in any price reductions. It usually announces cuts to coincide with those made by BT. If the peak-rate band is abolished, only two charge bands will remain for weekdays - a 'standard' band for calls made between 8am and 6pm and an 'off-peak' band for calls made at other times.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Canada-US beer war gets green tinge - Environmental issues creeping into an old dispute A TIT-FOR-TAT row over US exports of beer to Canada has underlined the extent to which environmental issues are finding their way into international trade disputes. Washington last Friday imposed a 50 per cent ad valorem tax (proportionate to price) on beer from Ontario in retaliation for what it said was a discriminatory 'environmental tax' levied by the Canadian province on all alcoholic drinks in non-refillable containers. The tax, as it applies to aluminium cans, was doubled last April to 10 cents per can, boosting the retail price of American beer sold in Ontario's Liquor Control Board stores from USDollars 19.83 to USDollars 24.35 per case, according to the US trade repres-entative. The US is also upset over a handling fee imposed on imported beer, which unlike domestic brands, is distributed through liquor outlets owned by the provincial government. In response to the US action against Ontario, Canada has slapped new customs duties on Heileman and Stroh, the two US companies which first brought the complaints. Other brewers are not affected by this tariff. The US Aluminum Association and Can Manufacturers Institute claim that it was 'no coincidence' that the environmental tax was announced five days after the US and Canada reached a tentative agreement to resolve other issues in the long-running beer war. The US groups have no doubt that the tax was purely a protectionist weapon wielded against American beer. Why else, they say, would Ontario tax only non-refillable alcohol containers, leaving softdrink cans untouched by the levy? About 85 per cent of Canada's beer is sold in refillable bottles; most American beer is shipped in aluminium cans. 'This was the ultimate roadblock, erected to ensure that there was no way to resolve this dispute,' says Mr Barry Meyer, vice-president of the Aluminum Association. Ontario counters that the 'green tax' also applies to wine and spirits bottles (which are also classified as non-refillable). According to an official in the provincial ministry of consumer and commercial relations, softdrinks are exempt because they are not distributed through government-run outlets, and because softdrink manufacturers already participate in a 'blue box' recycling programme. 'Softdrinks are a more difficult sector to deal with in a similar way,' said the official. Ontario insists that US brewers are welcome to ship their product without paying the tax if they use 'environmentally friendly' bottles. At least one New York brewer, Genesee, is planning to do just that. Much of the argument hinges on which is the most environmentally virtuous: cans or bottles. The Canadians opt for the latter because they can be re-used an average of 15-18 times. Ontario maintains that refillable containers are environmentally more desirable than recyclable ones, such as aluminium cans. But the Americans find bottles too expensive to ship, and favour cans as 'the most recycled packaging material in the world'. They note that 88 per cent of Ontario's aluminum beer cans are already recycled - one of the highest rates in the world. The Aluminum Association adds that recycling cans and washing, transporting and refilling bottles consume about the same amount of energy at high recycling rates. But recycling saves 95 per cent of the energy required to make aluminium from virgin materials. Then there is the bottle caps controversy. The Americans say that because glass is bulkier than aluminum and few caps are recycled, refillable bottles actually produce more solid waste than cans. If all cans were replaced by bottles in Ontario, thousands more tonnes of solid waste would have to be land-filled. With the North American Free Trade Agreement near completion, the US is hoping to contain the damage by limiting the beer sanctions to Ontario. The two leading Canadian brewers, Molson and John Labatt, have built up large stockpiles in the US in anticipation of the new duty, and hope to keep on shipping across the border from plants in Montreal and Vancouver. But US trade officials warn that they will monitor beer imports from other Canadian provinces. If imports surge beyond historical trade levels, the 50 per cent duty will be extended to the offending province. The Canadians have most to lose in the long run. Their beer holds about 1 per cent of the US market, equal to about 10 per cent of Canadian beer output. Molson is the second biggest supplier of imported beers in the US. US brewers have a 3 per cent share of the Canadian market, but that is less than 1 per cent of their sales. Since 1988, two panels of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) have ruled that Canada's provinces discriminate against imported beer. But Ms Marilyn Churley, Ontario's minister of consumer and commercial relations, is accusing the US of acting like 'an international trade outlaw' by turning down a Canadian proposal to bring the dispute to another Gatt panel for binding arbitration. The Canadians say the Gatt council refused a US request to retaliate against Canada; they do not mention that it was Canada which blocked the council's action. After winning two panel decisions, the US obviously has had enough of Gatt. Under US trade laws, the trade representative was required to impose some sort of sanctions last Friday. A Gatt with the authority to sanctify environmentally related duties and distinguish which environmental rules are truly trade barriers may have been better equipped to make a ruling which both sides would have respected.  ------------------------------------------------------------ LEADING BEER IMPORTS IN ONTARIO  ------------------------------------------------------------  1.

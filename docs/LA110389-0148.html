			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 IRVINE FIRMS FAILED TO DISCLOSE RECALLS, U.S. SAYS;  </P> <P> SAFETY: SHILEY AND COOPER VISION ARE AMONG 6 SOUTHLAND FIRMS THAT DID NOT  NOTIFY AUTHORITIES ABOUT POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS DEFECTS IN MEDICAL DEVICES. THEY  JUST REMOVED THEM FROM THE MARKET QUIETLY.  </P> <P> Manufacturers of medical devices ranging from pacemakers to pediatric cribs are  failing to notify federal officials of potentially dangerous defects and  deciding for themselves whether to recall the faulty equipment, according to  two new congressional studies.  </P> <P> In nearly half of the highest-risk equipment recalls of the last five years,  the Food and Drug Administration was not aware that manufacturers had begun  removing them from the market until after the process had begun, the General  Accounting Office found.  </P> <P> Although manufacturers are not required to report recalls to the FDA, a 1984  law requires them to notify the agency when devices may have contributed to a  death or serious injury or when a malfunction could prove extremely hazardous.  </P> <P> The GAO, a research arm of Congress, found in its analysis of 1,635 medical  device recalls in 1983-88 that manufacturers had provided the required  notifications in just 16 of 31 high-risk recalls since the law took effect.  </P> <P> In 17 cases -- involving replacement heart valves, dialysis units, anesthesia  machines and other devices -- the products were pulled from the market after  their shortcomings were linked with patient deaths.  </P> <P> Six of the companies involved in the most serious recalls are in Southern  California, including two Irvine companies: Shiley Inc., a manufacturer of  artificial heart valves and respiratory and cardiopulmonary products, and  Cooper Vision Inc., which makes tubing used in the administration of  anesthesia.  </P> <P> Shiley, which has had several recalls of its valves because of manufacturing  defects, in at least one instance in 1983 did not notify the agency of a recall  until it was already in progress, the FDA said.  </P> <P> Similarly, Cooper Vision did not give the FDA prior notice of a 1984 recall of  defective aspiration tubing, the agency said.  </P> <P> Copies of the GAO's companion reports, one of which contains an overview of the  issue while the other looks at specific recalls in detail, were obtained by The  Times in advance of their scheduled release today.  </P> <P> "FDA became aware of the great majority of device problems associated with a  recall in some other way than through (reports from the manufacturers)," the  GAO said.  </P> <P> "This suggests that the reports have not served as an effective 'early warning'  of device problems serious enough to warrant a recall," the oversight agency  concluded.  </P> <P> The FDA learned of the majority of recalls through inspections of company  records and notification by users or competitors, the GAO reported.  </P> <P> The GAO also found that the FDA has failed to establish performance standards,  as required under a 1976 law, for devices involved in nearly three-quarters of  the recalls.  </P> <P> That law established three categories of medical devices based on their  potential safety risks. Manufacturers are required to submit premarketing  documentation to prove the safety and effectiveness of devices deemed high  risk.  </P> <P> The FDA is supposed to establish performance standards for medium-risk devices,  while less stringent safety requirements apply to the least risky devices.  Ironically, moderate-risk devices were responsible for a majority of the  recall-related defects that the FDA said posed the greatest danger.  </P> <P> The medical equipment industry generates sales of nearly $14 billion a year and  produces more than 1,700 products, including virtually every device used by  health-care professionals to diagnose and treat illnesses and injuries,  excluding medications.  </P> <P> Although the FDA had not yet seen the GAO reports, spokesmen said Thursday that  the agency feels that the information it is receiving from medical device  producers is sufficient to safeguard consumers.  </P> <P> "We think manufacturers are complying with the reporting requirements, and  we're looking at the incidents that happen with the products and coming to our  own conclusions about when something needs to be done," said Walter Gundaker,  acting deputy director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.  </P> <P> The center is receiving 15,000 reports annually about malfunctioning medical  devices, FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said. In about 15% of the cases, the products  are ultimately determined to have caused serious injury or death.  </P> <P> Gundaker said no performance standards have been adopted for 800 devices deemed  of medium risk when they entered the market because the formulation process is  lengthy and "we don't have the people to put on that project."  </P> <P> He said the only performance standard being developed is for apnea monitors,  respiratory devices intended to prevent crib deaths. A number of infant deaths,  possibly caused by failures of the machines, have attracted widespread  attention.  </P> <P> The GAO studies, which were based on FDA computer records and interviews with  agency officials and staff, are expected to provide new ammunition for  congressional critics who are seeking to strengthen the medical devices law and  FDA oversight.  </P> <P> The reviews were requested by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of  the subcommittee on health and the environment of the House Energy and Commerce  Committee. Waxman's panel has scheduled a hearing Monday on the FDA's  regulation of medical devices.  </P> <P> The reports "show that manufacturers who profit from the sale of these products  often act without FDA oversight in deciding whether to keep their products on  the market when problems begin to surface," Waxman said.  </P> <P> "When FDA doesn't even know about deaths and injuries from products that the  manufacturers recall, how can the FDA even pretend to know about the safety of  the thousands of other medical devices that remain on the market?"  </P> <P> He said the agency is hamstrung by budget cuts and its desire to accommodate  the industry.  </P> <P> Waxman and Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, have introduced legislation to toughen the 1976 medical devices law.  A similar measure passed the House in 1987 but died in the Senate in the face  of industry opposition.  </P> <P> The bill would require hospitals and other health-care providers to begin  informing the FDA of deaths or serious injuries that may have been caused by  medical device malfunctions. The measure would also streamline the process  under which the FDA can initiate recalls.  </P> <P> The FDA already has the authority to seek court-ordered recalls of medical  devices. But the agency must show that, in addition to being dangerous, the  devices failed to meet "the state of the art as it existed at the time of  design and manufacture." The FDA has never initiated such a recall, agency  officials said.  </P> <P> "There's no need to force a company to recall a product because the company has  liability problems and wants to get the product off the market as well once a  problem has been discovered," FDA spokesman Grigg said. He said the public is  best served by persuading the company to undertake a voluntary recall.  </P> <P> Eddie Allen, general counsel for the Health Industry Manufacturers Assn., which  represents the device makers, said the FDA's reporting requirements are  ambiguous.  </P> <P> "There is a certain amount of discretion that is given to a company," he said.  "The problem with the (medical device reporting) regulation is that  well-intentioned companies interpret the same facts and the same regulatory  requirements differently than the FDA does."  </P> <P> Overall, the GAO reports found that cardiovascular and anesthesiology devices  accounted for more than a quarter of all medical device recalls. Suntanning  booths, beds and lamps were recalled 33 times, more than any other single  product category. Problems with design and production were the cause of nearly  three fourths of all recalls.  </P> <P> In addition to Shiley and Cooper Vision, the Southern California companies and  the products they recalled are: Pacesetter Systems Inc. of Sylmar, cardiac  pulse generators; Primary Medical Products of Los Angeles, vaporizers;  Intermedics Intraocular Inc. of Pasadena, intraocular lenses, and Bear Medical  Systems Inc. of Riverside, ventilators.  </P> <P> Under the FDA classification system, 1,203 of the recalls, or 74%, involved  devices considered medium risks. Another 278, or 17%, were considered least  serious risks. A total of 153, or 9%, were in the high-risk category.  </P> <P> But the GAO said, "Our analysis showed that all classes of devices -- including  some devices that are considered relatively innocuous -- can be associated with  problems potentially leading to serious health consequences or death."  </P></p>

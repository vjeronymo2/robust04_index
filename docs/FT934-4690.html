			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: MAS interim profit falls 96% Malaysia Airlines (MAS), the state-controlled national airline, continues to battle financial problems, with results for the six months to September 30 revealing a 96 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. MAS made pre-tax profits in the period of MDollars 6.4m (Dollars 2.5m), compared with MDollars 153m in the same period last year, although turnover rose 4 per cent to MDollars 2.02bn. Analysts point out that MAS would be in the red but for a change in accounting policy which cut aircraft depreciation charges, thereby adding MDollars 31m to operating profits. The analysts say MAS is paying the price for an ambitious fleet expansion programme launched three years ago just as the worldwide airline industry was heading into recession. In the course of its present five year plan to 1996-97 MAS has orders for 72 aircraft costing a total of MDollars 10.6bn. MAS, partially privatised in the mid-1980s but still more than 60 per cent controlled by various state bodies, now has excess capacity on many of its routes. In the past MAS has benefited from cash generated by aircraft sales. Such sales have then been incorporated into pre-tax profits. But in the six-month period MAS was unable to sell any aircraft, adding both to its financial difficulties and its excess capacity problems. While MAS has managed to defer delivery on some aircraft the financial position of the carrier is likely to come under increasing pressure in the short term with 10 new aircraft due for delivery over the next six months. The Malaysian government has also announced plans for a second carrier which could take business away from MAS on domestic and regional routes. "MAS expanded into a recession in the world aviation business,' said one industry observer. 'It got carried away in the general euphoria about economic growth in the south-east Asia region. 'But it's clear airlines in this part of the world are not immune from the problems of the world economy. MAS looks set for a couple of very tough years.' Despite the generally gloomy assessment of MAS' prospects, the carrier's shares have been trading at all-time highs on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange in recent weeks. Analysts say there have been rumours that Bank Negara, the Malaysia central bank, will sell some or all of its 40 per cent shareholding in MAS. But so far there has been nothing to substantiate the reports. State-run Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) said it earned a profit of Rs312m (Dollars 9.9m) in the year to last June, showing a decline of more than 70 per cent over the previous year, Reuter reports from Islamabad. Revenue of about Rs22bn was 7.45 per cent up on 1991-92, when the profit was put at Rs1.1bn. PIA's operating income declined to Rs623m from Rs1.58bn in 1991-92, it said. Directors blamed the decrease mainly on global recession, introduction of an open-sky policy by the Pakistani government allowing freer access by foreign airlines and new domestic privately owned airlines.</p>

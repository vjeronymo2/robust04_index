			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Sport: The return of the painted warrior - Cricket THE LAST time the Australians visited, in 1989, they began their annihilation of England's Test teams with a crushing victory at Headingley. When their batsmen there had reached 525 for six, I found Allan Border, cheered no doubt by the score, happy to sit and chat about cricket. Four years later the international game has changed. Or perhaps one should say continued down its course. Strong, pragmatic defences have been erected and press conferences are the preferred quarters for the press, which I can understand. But players with the most spectacular public images, such as the old painted warrior Merv Hughes and the new leg-spinner Shane Warne, are stars as well as cricketers, with agents who have negotiated exclusive interview rights for them with particular papers. The nearest I have got to Hughes so far this season is watching him play and, for a change, watching him jog round the Oval last week in a pair of shorts when bad light stopped play. He was not in the Australian team playing Surrey and this was a chance for him to get fit. Or at least look fit; he has started to lose the extra fat he acquired in taverns back home. Fitness has become an article of faith in Australia, as it has with a vengeance in England, but at the same time Hughes's image is that of a large and lumbering terrorist with the ball, a man of beer and power. I doubt if his real power lies in his fitness or in his speed. Though I am sure his agent would not like me saying so, I reckon it lies in his steadiness. He and Craig McDermott make a good, steady, pair to open the Australian bowling, neither of them on the West Indian level of speed or danger. Hughes is an example of a player whose public persona has overtaken his play, though he is experienced enough not just to survive but to profit from that. At 31 he is nearing the end of his bowling career and is used to pressure, including pressure from his aggressive image, and if he falters he can always fall back on fierce antics to go with his zinc-cream war-paint. England's best response, of course, would be to make him look ordinary, as Graham Hick did with his mammoth 187 against the Australians at Worcester last month. For those less blessed with the ability to hit fast bowlers for six, polite indifference is a good weapon. The English team, imprisoned in their own sad image, without a true fast bowler to their name, without a victorious series since 1990, have every reason to remember that images are only images and neither side has a top class bowling attack. Much will depend on determination. In a way, Graham Gooch is a good man to captain England now, while Australia are flushed with confidence, because he is largely impervious to psycho-suggestion and image propaganda. He does not look happy or comfortable as captain, but nor is he unduly impressed by accounts of young Australian wizards, such as the spinning Warne, or of Border's invincibility, especially as he knows Border from the latter's Essex summer in 1986. Mark Waugh is another old Essex Australian. Best of all, Gooch watched Hughes do a spell in the Essex second eleven, his first step on the way up to being the hairy warrior straight from the outback. Warne is more of a problem because he is more of a mystery, the Australian equivalent of England's Phil Tufnell: a difficult, match-winning spinner, very hit and miss. Warne is everything young and Australian in English eyes  -a blond surfer-turned-cricketer adored by sunburnt girls. In other words, at only 23 with little Test experience, he must be vulnerable as well as threatening. The Australians are counting on their transfusion of new blood mixing well with their strong body of experience: Border and vice-captain Mark Taylor, who is nothing if not enduring, the prolific David Boon, the Waugh twins and Ian Healy, the neat wicket-keeper. Hughes, in his new role as the grand old man of Antipodean bowling, gave great help and comfort to Brendon Julian, the left-arm fast-medium bowler, not yet 23, in the Texaco game at Lords. Julian offers lethally swinging yorkers and wides in an assortment unpredictable to everyone, including himself. At Lords he bowled Alec Stewart an over which included three wides and three balls struck disdainfully for four. After swigging down tea and Hughes's advice and changing ends, Julian bowled his second spell: eight overs, three for 23, including the wickets of Stewart and Hick. He was made man of the match. Border looks more tired than Gooch of providing constant encouragement for his team and makes no secret of the fact that he no longer enjoys Test cricket because it is too fraught. It certainly is. I doubt if there is much difference in ability between the two sides, though the selection of Mike Gatting, a veteran might-have-been, is a step to nowhere in particular and must have cheered Australian hearts. English hearts need an enterprising attempt to get going again, especially as there is nothing to lose. Why not a faster bowler to open the attack, such as Surrey's Martin Bicknell (24) and a young, fine, left-handed batsman, such as Graham Thorpe (nearly 24), who can also break up partnerships with his occasional bowling and is a dynamic fielder? Every team has its own focal point and I think the best one for this uncertain and undistinguished English team is the one that indicates team morale most clearly and has weakened most sadly since the good 1991 series against the West Indies: fielding. The Australian fielding on this tour has been noticeably good. The pivotal point of fielding is wicket-keeping, which can transform a game by plucking a wicket out of nowhere. A brilliant keeper, like Alan Knott, England's magical 'Mr Punch' of the 1970s, generates optimism. There is none of the slip / keeper confusion often caused by Stewart doing his best, but not the best available, behind the stumps. Spinners toss the ball up, hungry for snicks and stumpings. Bowlers such as Andrew Caddick who strive to find an edge go from strength to strength. Fielders such as Chris Lewis risk their sizzling throws for run-outs and the fielding side recovers the spirit so vital to a winning performance. It would be quite a feat to further weaken England's middle order, which is a grim decline from the days when a batsman such as Basil D'Oliveira coming in at number six could swing a match. I do not believe a proper wicket-keeper would do England's unreliable five, six or seven positions any harm. Last time Australia were in England, Jack Russell was second in the English batting averages and has worked hard on his batting since then. He is cheerful. He would be an asset.</p>

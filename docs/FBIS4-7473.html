			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe by </F> Liliya Popova "especially for BULGARSKA ARMIYA"; place and date  not given: "Bulgaria Can Count on Our Full Support"]    [Text] German Federal Defense Minister Volker Ruehe will  pay a visit to Bulgaria from 28 to 30 March at the invitation of  Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov. The two ministers will  discuss issues concerning mutual security, European defense, and  the two countries' roles in the all-European integration process.    Prior to his departure for Bulgaria, Minister Ruehe answered  some questions especially for the readers of BULGARSKA ARMIYA.    [Popova] Mr. Ruehe, for the first time in more than 50 years  a German defense minister is to visit Bulgaria. How do you  assess this fact and what does this new reality indicate?    [Ruehe] I would first like to point out that I am very glad  to be able to visit Bulgaria. As you know, Defense Minister  Valentin Aleksandrov was in Germany last fall. The new features  in our countries' military-political relations that are  reflected in the bilateral agreement on cooperation in defense  policy create prerequisites for a new responsibility that our  states have to bear in relation to European stability.    [Popova] During your Bulgarian counterpart's visit to  Germany last fall you reached agreement on closer cooperation  between your two ministries, especially in staff education.  What projects have been implemented and which ones will be put  into effect in the future?    [Ruehe] This year our two armies carried out a lively  exchange of officers, through which your officers visited  various Bundeswehr educational institutions. Many Bulgarian  officers are in Germany at the moment attending various courses;  some are attending Bundeswehr language schools and others are  undergoing practical training in internal administration. We  plan a further 30 such arrangements this year alone, including  an exchange of lecturers between our staff colleges.    [Popova] Last year you issued an assurance that Bulgaria can  count on German support in its efforts to join NATO. The  serious situation in the Balkans at the moment requires a new  security policy. Will you also assist Bulgaria in this respect?    [Ruehe] NATO's decision to open itself up to partners from  throughout Europe should be regarded as one of the alliance's  priority tasks. It gives countries like Bulgaria a good picture  of future prospects. The Partnership For Peace program that  Bulgaria joined last February enables us to cooperate with our  partners from the east, deepen our relations with them, and at  the same time to react flexibly to the needs of individual  states. In this way the future members can be systematically  prepared for joining these structures late.    The Partnership For Peace is the first important step on the  road to integration. It should under no circumstances be  interpreted or understood as some kind of second league  position. Accordingly, Bulgaria can rely on our full support in  the future.    [Popova] What do you think about Bulgarian policy on the  Balkan crisis?    [Ruehe] I believe that Bulgaria will stick with its previous  policy and do everything necessary to promote the peace process  in the Balkans. Precisely in connection with the embargo  imposed on the Danube, we attach great importance to Bulgaria  because of geographical position. According to my information,  Bulgaria is a model in this respect, despite the great economic  losses it is suffering. Sarajevo, the talks between Croatia and  Bosnia, and the recent events in Tuzla have demonstrated that  only firm determination and intensive political and diplomatic  efforts can provide a chance for the peace process. It has also  become clear that a peaceful solution in the Balkans needs  Russia to become involved and exert its influence. Bulgaria has  an important part to play here as well.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Arts: New Park Lane series - Music This is the week when the Park Lane Group, each January, presents a pair of Purcell Room concerts by 'Young Artists' every week-night. As usual the musical fare is all 20th-century, most of it recent, and two composers are specially featured, Nicholas Maw and the Scot Edward McGuire(the latter born, according to the programme-book, variously in 1948, 1958 and 1984). On Monday Maw was represented by the second of his six inventive Personae for piano, delivered with gleaming clarity by Thomas Ades. Ades boasts a masterly control of touch and colour. In Gyorgy Kurtag's three In Memoriam pieces and their prefatory 'Chorale', he balanced the notes of chords with phenomenal subtlety, as well as flawless sympathy with Kurtag's individual manner. His command of more flamboyant, rhetorical music by the early Messiaen (another elegiac piece, for Paul Dukas) and by Paul Ruders seemed effortless  -though the grip of Ruders' Sonata No. 2 slackens after its strong, promising first movement. Ades is also a composer, and his new Still Sorrowing - a lament which is also a homage to Romantic sentiments - proved to make the most ingenious use of a 'prepared' piano that I have heard in a long time. While a recurrent plaint tintinnabulates at the top the piano's range and deep chords resonate at the bottom, some muffling device allows intricate figures and rhythms at mid-keyboard to rattle hollowly; a haunting sound-scape and too strikingly musical to seem tricksy. In the second recital, the Chione Oboe Trio were crisp and well-tuned in pieces by McGuire, James Macmillan and John Lunn - all efficiently designed for the medium, which has its limits but none so fetchingly as Joseph Landers' recent Echo Dancers. More potent stuff was heard from a splendid cellist, Paul Watkins, keenly and forcefully partnered by the pianist Elizabeth Upchurch. They did sweeping justice to Elliott Carter's 1948 Sonata, a work that cannot fail to thrill when performed with such intelligence and fervour. And Philip Cashian's new Dancing with Venus (a PLG commission) is a winner; inspired by an Angela Carter short story, the cello enacts a series of little dances or poses, sexy or ironic or mocking, and they add up to something considerably more than a string of vignettes. Cellists with the advanced technique that Cashian requires should fall upon the piece without delay.</p>

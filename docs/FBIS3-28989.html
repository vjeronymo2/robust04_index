Answering today a question of KCNA on the present situation  surrounding the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula, the  spokesman said there is no change in our stand of resolving the  nuclear issue through dialogue.    He noted that if the United States really want to resolve  the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it should no longer seek  to isolate and stifle the DPRK with a double-dealing tactics as  now but clearly indicate its correct stand toward the talks  first of all.    Recalling that on January 31 we published a statement  clarifying our principled stand toward the great difficulties  laid in the solution of the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula by the unjustifiable act of the United States, he said:    The United States openly defended the secretariat of the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which was demanding  that we accept an unjust inspection tantamount to a  comprehensive inspection, contrary to the points of agreement  between the the DPRK and the U.S. and U.S. political figures  went off into an undisguised war hysterics against us.    All this was clear manifestation of the policy of stifling  the DPRK.    When the United States and the IAEA secretariat were  resorting to base intrigues to stifle our Republic, openly  reversing the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreement like this, we  could no longer pin hope on the DPRK-U.S. talks and,  accordingly, made a resolute decision to walk our own way, not  bound to any promise.    This decision of ours was immediately conveyed to the U.S.  side through a relevant channel.    In this regard the U.S. side made clear that the inspection  by the IAEA should be one purely for the continuity of  safeguards and officially notified our side that there was no  change in its stand to continue DPRK-U.S. talks and it was  willing to discuss the nuclear issue and the improvement of the  relations between the DPRK and the U.S. as a whole at the third  round of talks.    Synchronizing with this, the secretariat of the IAEA  suggested that it would seek an inspection only for the  continuity of safeguards, renouncing its absurd former claim for  a comprehensive inspection.    It is a fortunate thing, if the United States and the  secretariat of the IAEA mean what they say.    However, the clamor for pressure on the DPRK continuously  raised by the U.S. hardline conservatives makes us deeply doubt  whether this stand of the United States is true, or not.    The U.S. Senate reportedly passed a "resolution on  sanctions"  against the DPRK some time ago and then the U.S. ambassador in  the United Nations called a consultative meeting of the  permanent members of the UN Security Council and discussed the  feasibility of the "sanctions".    The United States and the South Korean authorities are even  showing an undisguised movement to stage the "Team Spirit" joint  military exercises. It obviously contradicts the stand for  continued talks for the United States to resort to such row of  pressure before the end of the negotiations for defining the  scope of inspection for the continuity of safeguards between the  DPRK and the IAEA Secretariat.    If the United States thinks it can get something by  frightening us with strength, regarding pressure as an almighty  solution, it is a mistake.    The heavier the pressure on us, the firmer our  determination.    We will watch the future action of the United States with  concern.</p>

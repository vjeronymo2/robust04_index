He rejected such concerns. Environmental protection was not a  beauty contest, he said, or a football match of everyone against  everyone else; so there would be winners on both sides, once the  chapter on environmental issues in the membership negotiations  was concluded. This is what Brinkhorst and Environment Minister  Maria Rauch-Kallat stressed, who added that she assessed the  environment package of December as ``gratifyingly favorable.''    Brinkhorst spoke about the changed significance of the  environment, which manifested itself in the European  Commission's Whitebook of December. According to this study,  environmental protection was no longer considered an obstacle  but was viewed as a condition of lasting economic development,  as progress in the area of competition, and as a job creating  instrument. Environmental protection in the European Union was  a dynamic process, which in recent years had made considerable  progress and in which the European Union needed Austria as a  partner, said Brinkhorst.    The director general, who is also responsible for nuclear  safety, said that a country's decision for or against nuclear  energy was not influenced by the European Union, whereas nuclear  safety was a common affair. Environment Minister Rauch-Kallat  cited this EU task to justify the fact that any contribution  made by Austria, which rejects nuclear power in its government  policy, will flow into Euratom's nuclear research.</p>

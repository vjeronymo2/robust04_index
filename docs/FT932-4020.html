			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Consumers 'sceptical of decisions by ombudsmen' HALF the consumers questioned for a report on ombudsmen thought the decisions they took were unfair, the National Consumer Council said yesterday. A third of those asked questioned the independence of the Office of Building Societies Ombudsmen Scheme and the Insurance Ombudsmen Bureau, the council said. The council also reported 'widespread dissatisfaction' with the time taken to settle disputes. The average time taken for disputes to be settled was 52 weeks in the case of the insurance ombudsman and 91 weeks for the building societies ombudsman. However, Dr Julian Farrand, the insurance ombudsman, and Mr Stephen Edell, one of two building societies ombudsmen, protested at the strength of the council's comments. Lady Wilcox, who chairs the consumer council, said: 'Our report shows clearly that ombudsmen provide a cheap and accessible way to resolve disputes. However, the extent of dissatisfaction revealed in our survey does show considerable room for improvement.' The report, based on a sample of just under 1,000 consumers who had used the ombudsmen schemes, found that 43 per cent of those using the building society Ombudsman's scheme found it took an 'unreasonably long time to make a decision'. Consumers' views about fairness depended largely on whether they had won their case.

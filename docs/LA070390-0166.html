			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> 7-ELEVEN FILES RESTRUCTURE PLAN  </P> <P> Southland Corp., owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, has revealed  details of a proposed restructuring it hopes will enable the company to avoid  bankruptcy court.  </P> <P> In a filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company  proposed swapping one share of common stock for 10 shares of new stock issued  to current bondholders through the restructuring.  </P> <P> "We feel that would be a key point to the bondholders, who would like to see  some liquidity in the shares they receive," Southland spokeswoman Cecilia  Norwood said.  </P> <P> Southland has been staggering under debt accumulated in a $4.9-billion  leveraged buyout and increased competition in the convenience store business.  </P> <P> The company already has missed $69 million in interest payments and could be  forced into bankruptcy on July 15.  </P></p>

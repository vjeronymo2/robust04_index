			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Sanpaolo Holding builds insurer links SANPAOLO Holding, the holding company for the recently-floated Italian bank, has confirmed it is to take a further 14 per cent stake in Milano Assicurazioni, one of the main operating subsidiaries of the Fondiaria insurance concern, writes Haig Simonian. In February, Milano Assicurzioni announced a rights issue of up to L463bn (Dollars 373.68m) amid strong speculation that Sanpaolo would use the deal to raise its 6 per cent holding. The latest purchase of shares, which will cost Sanpaolo L195bn, is coming directly from Fondiaria. Sanpaolo is spending a further L22.5bn to buy 1.5 per cent of La Fondiaria Assicurazioni, another of the Fondiaria group's main subsidiaries. The deals will reinforce the growing links between the bank and Fondiaria. Under an agreement earlier this year, Milano Assicurazioni is to develop life and non-life insurance products to be sold by Sanpaolo branches.</p>

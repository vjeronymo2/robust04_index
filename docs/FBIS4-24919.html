			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by staff reporter Bao Shishao (7637 0013 4801): </F> "Clinton's Trip to Western Europe"]    [Text] Washington, 31 May (RENMIN RIBAO)--U.S. President  Bill Clinton left for Europe 1 June. This is his second trip to  Europe this year following his first visit to Eastern Europe and  former Soviet Union regions earlier this year, suggesting once  again that the United States is focusing on Europe in its  diplomatic strategy.    During the eight-day visit, apart from taking part in  ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landing  by the U.S. and its allied forces during World War II, Clinton  will visit Italy, Britain, and France, and meet with the leaders  of these countries to exchange views on problems of mutual  concern. Since assuming office at the White House, Clinton has  repeatedly stressed the importance of the Asia-Pacific region to  the United States. Some people believe the fact that Clinton  attended the APEC forum held in Seattle last November shows the  United States. has shifted its strategic priority to the east.  However, Clinton emphasized once again that Europe is important  to the U.S. global interest and that Western European countries  remain U.S. allies. His current visit to Europe is exactly  designed to improve U.S. relations with European countries.    Since last year, the United States has gotten into a dispute  with Italy over Somalia, the "special relationship" between the  United States and Britain has greatly weakened, and the United  States, on the one hand, and Britain and France, on the other,  have been divided over ways to settle the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Clinton will have extensive exchange of  views with leaders of these countries on matters of mutual  concern to reach an understanding. However, according to a U.S.  government official, Clinton does not expect too much of the  current trip to Europe.    The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now at a crucial  moment. Since the beginning of this year, both the United States  and Russia have actively helped solved the crisis in their  interest, making Western European countries feel they are left  out in the cold. Though the foreign ministers from the United  States, Russia, and five European countries held a meeting on  the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina in Geneva not long ago, the  three parties, namely the United States, Russia, and European  countries failed to iron out their differences. Recently France  proposed to withdraw part of its troops from Bosnia-Herzegovina  and this clearly served as a warning to the United States. In  France's view, since they have sent more troops to  Bosnia-Herzegovina than other countries, they should have more  say on the issue. France ardently hopes the United States will  send ground forces to Bosnia-Herzegovina to shoulder part of the  task of keeping peace and, at the same time, apply pressure on  the Muslims so that they will return to the negotiating table.  But the United States continues to bring great pressure to bear  upon the Serbs, and the U.S. Senate even decided to unilaterally  lift the embargo on weapons shipments to Bosnia-Herzegovina and  opposed reducing sanctions against Yugoslavia. The media here  believe the problem concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina is clearly  high on the agenda of this meetings with European leaders.    The U.S.-European relationship has undergone a change since  the Cold War ended. Europe is increasingly at odds with the  United States, but the latter, as a superpower, is still trying  in every possible way to control Europe's affairs, though it is  not as strong as before. Clinton's current trip to Europe is  undoubtedly planned to attain this strategic objective though  whether his effort will prove successful or not is another  matter.</p>

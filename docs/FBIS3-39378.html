			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["f.gui." interview with Transportation Minister Raffaele </F> Costa; place and date not given: "The Bridge Between Bossi and  Fini"--first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction]    [Text] Rome -- From [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS,  Secretary] Occhetto to [League Secretary] Bossi it is a chorus  of "liberal democrats." But for the first time the traditional  Liberals will not be contesting the 27 March elections. The  hundreds of symbols registered do not include the PLI's [Italian  Liberal Party] tricolor.    [IL GIORNALE] Can a Liberal really feel ashamed to call  himself a Liberal, Minister?    [Costa] The absence of the party's traditional symbol must  not be viewed as a renunciation. The PRI [Italian Republican  Party] and the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] are absent from  this contest, and so is even the PDS in the single-candidate  constituencies. However, there is a high degree of liberalism  among the political forces. The real issue is to move on from  plans to deeds. I have my doubts about whether this will  happen. That is why the Liberals are fielding their own  candidates. Most of us support, and will vote together with,  the moderate forces.    [IL GIORNALE] Zanone and Patuelli have opted for [Pact for  Italy leader] Segni. What if they prove to have been right?    [Costa] Right and wrong are never so clear-cut. However, I  believe that the choice that I recommended and made is a more  consistent one -- and not only with regard to my own conscience.  I am sure that after 27 March we will have a larger  liberal-democratic parliamentary group than the present one.    [IL GIORNALE] Are you running with the aim of governing or  of  going into opposition?    [Costa] With a great desire to reverse the situation.    [IL GIORNALE] To whose detriment?    [Costa] I certainly do not intend to wield a big stick, to  use a metaphor that someone else used recently. My aim is to  reshuffle the pack, that is, to revise legislation, to  streamline it, to dissolve all the unnecessary government  agencies. Major reform is needed after half a century of  stop-gap measures and bargains. This must end. Whether we win  or whether the left wins, the important thing is to regenerate  this country in earnest.    [IL GIORNALE] [National Alliance leader] Fini and Bossi are  not talking, but you are allied to both of them. Is the  agreement a mere sham?    [Costa] I believe in the role of the transitional factor.  Bossi represents a major novelty, despite certain errors which I  have consistently challenged. Fini symbolizes an evolution in a  definitely democratic direction. The fact is that it is the  Italian people who have a messianic attitude, an excessively  messianic attitude, with regard to these forces, which are  perceived as new. I am not burying my head in the sand. Italy  is tired and is grabbing hold wherever it can. This is why I  repeat that after 27 March the first thing to do is to open a  new chapter.    [IL GIORNALE] Will Paolo Berlusconi's house arrest earn or  lose the moderate alignment votes?    [Costa] We are experiencing a troubled climate, as a result  of some serious events, and it is leading to a very low level of  political debate. I am willing to admit that Paolo Berlusconi's  arrest is politically equivalent to implicating [PDS Deputy  Secretary] Massimo D'Alema in the party funding affair. I wish  the parties could discuss pensions, foreign policy, inflation,  and relations with the EC. Instead we find ourselves contending  with a completely tainted campaign atmosphere. The citizens are  tired of attempts to poison the political and judicial climate,  scandals for their own sake, gossip, and misinformation.    [IL GIORNALE] Which is worse: RAI [Italian Broadcasting  Corporation] or Fininvest?    [Costa] Since I am an ally of Forza Italia, my opinion is  obviously suspect. But I will not for that reason refrain from  pointing out that when Fininvest makes a mistake, it does so  with its own money. RAI is factious even though it uses my  money. The public propaganda on behalf of the PDS is  intolerable. I am very disappointed in Locatelli, RAI's  managing director: If it were up to me, I would never again  assign him to a post that demands at least some impartiality. I  had a friend, Paolo Garimberti, an excellent journalist, who is  now head of Channel 2 news. I have not changed my mind about  his professionalism, but I would add that his news programs do  not convince me at all.    [IL GIORNALE] Segni has already raised the suggestion of a  "government of experts to guarantee institutions." Would you be  a member of it?    [Costa] Segni shows a lack of respect toward his voters.  Perhaps he is realizing that they are turning their backs on  him. His Pact threatens to prove a sham. I am not convinced by  labels: I want clear programs and definite options -- either  this or that.    [IL GIORNALE] You flirted with the Republicans' La Malfa  until the last moment. Are you not afraid that you went too far?    [Costa] La Malfa enjoyed sufficient stature to engage in a  meaningful dialogue. But now the PRI has a great future behind  it.</p>

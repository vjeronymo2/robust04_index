			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD HEALTH MAGAZINE;  </P> <P> NUTRITION;  </P> <P> HOLD THE MAYO?;  </P> <P> YES, AND GO EASY ON THE MUSTARD AND KETCHUP, TOO.  </P> <P> Sandwich ingredients -- beef, ham, cheese, and bread -- have all come under  nutritional scrutiny. But what about mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup and other  condiments? The two danger points here are sodium and, in one important case,  fat. You can buy low-sodium mustard and Worcestershire sauce and "lite"  versions of mayonnaise and even ketchup. Less familiar condiments such as  chutney, horseradish and salsas are flavorful alternatives with few nutritional  drawbacks, except that a few brands may contain large amounts of salt.  </P> <P> Mayonnaise. "Hold the mayo" is definitely the way to go. The only high-fat  condiment, mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil, egg yolk and vinegar; the regular  version is almost 100% fat. However, since it is made with liquid vegetable oil  (usually soybean), mayonnaise is not particularly high in saturated fat.  Despite its egg content, it contains only a small amount of cholesterol --  about 5 milligrams per tablespoon. Thus "cholesterol-free" mayonnaise (now  available) would not be a significant improvement.  </P> <P> Alternatives: Mayonnaise-like products labeled "salad dressing" -- as well as  "light," "diet," or "imitation" mayonnaise, in which water and starch or  another thickener replace some of the oil -- may contain half to two-thirds the  calories of real mayonnaise and less than half the fat. There's even a  tofu-based product with only 1 gram of fat per serving.  </P> <P> If your palate demands real mayonnaise, use a teaspoonful rather than a  tablespoonful on a sandwich, or blend it with plain low-fat yogurt. Flavor the  yogurt with a little mustard, lemon juice and pepper for dressing in chicken or  tuna salad. Tartar sauce and the "secret sauce" used on fast-food hamburgers  are both mayonnaise-based. Substitute a light mayonnaise or plain low-fat  yogurt with a little chopped pickle mixed in. And though it's not usually  suggested as a low-fat substitute, even sour cream is a better choice than  mayonnaise when you're making a dip. A tablespoon of sour cream has about 25  calories and 2.5 grams of fat -- a quarter the calories and fat in mayonnaise.  And plain low-fat or nonfat yogurt is even better.  </P> <P> Note: Homemade mayonnaise is not nutritionally superior to the store-bought  kind. A standard recipe calls for 2 egg yolks and 1 cup of oil. And since it is  made with raw eggs and without preservatives, homemade mayonnaise could be a  source of salmonella.  </P> <P> Ketchup. Although it consists mainly of tomatoes, the average ketchup is 20%  sweetener and contains up to 180 milligrams of sodium per tablespoon. Even  "lite" ketchup has a fairly high sodium level, although a dietetic brand  labeled "low-sodium" contains practically no sodium. Other substitutes for the  ketchup lover with a sodium problem include tomato paste or puree, or  low-sodium or homemade spaghetti sauce (for use in recipes). Some brands of  bottled Mexican salsa ranchera and taco sauce contain slightly less sodium than  regular ketchup, as do Worcestershire sauce and pickle relish. Most chili  sauces, steak sauces, barbecue sauces and cocktail sauces have even more sodium  than ketchup. Perhaps the best option is to make your own Mexican-style salsa  cruda (raw sauce) -- a combination of chopped tomatoes, chilies, onions, lemon  or lime juice, and spices -- to satisfy your craving for a tomato topping.  </P> <P> Mustard. Mustard's natural pungency tends to limit the amount one uses, but  even a tablespoonful of prepared mustard packs a major sodium wallop. If you  need to watch your sodium intake, buy a no-salt-added mustard. "Cut the  mustard" with plain low-fat yogurt, or mix your own from dry mustard powder  (you'll find basic directions on the package). Vary the strength, texture, and  flavor by using water, vinegar or milk as the liquid; add whole mustard seeds  or herbs if you wish.  </P> <P> Chutney. Usually served with Indian food (but equally good with cheese, plain  meats and poultry), chutneys are sweet-and-spicy fruit- or vegetable-based  relishes. All contain negligible fat; however, Major Grey's, perhaps the most  popular type of chutney, is made from brine-pickled mangoes and is therefore  very high in sodium. Look for chutneys made from apples, tomatoes, cranberries  and other fruits at health-food stores or specialty markets. If you can't find  a salt-free chutney, choose one that has salt at the bottom -- not the top --  of the ingredients list. Or substitute apple, cranberry, or other fruit sauces,  which are low in sodium and virtually fat-free.  </P> <P> Horseradish. Though its pungency complements meat, poultry and vegetables,  prepared horseradish is used far less frequently than mustard or ketchup.  Although it is usually made with salt, its sodium content is fairly low.  Combine it with low-sodium mustard for an eye-opening sandwich spread, blend it  with plain low-fat yogurt to make a less biting sauce or dressing, or stir it  into applesauce for a traditional Austrian accompaniment to beef. Powdered  horseradish (found on the spice shelf) can be mixed with water or other  condiments for a sauce.  </P> <P> Reprinted from The UC Berkeley Wellness Letter  </P> <P> </P></p>

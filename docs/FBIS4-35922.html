			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In a commentary today, AL-THAWRAH discusses Yitzhaq  Rabin's recent statements in which he underlined Israel's  rejection of full withdrawal from the Golan Heights. The paper  says: Although what Rabin has said was not anything new, it was,  however, clear confirmation of Israel's aggressiveness,  arrogance, lack of interest in peace, and lack of commitment to  peace and the resolutions of international legitimacy.    AL-THAWRAH notes that Israel's aggressions, ugly massacres,  and violations of international charters in the occupied Arab  territories and against Lebanon and its steadfast south exceed,  in quantity and results, all it has done against the Arabs in  the past four and half decades.    The paper says: Israel simply wants peace in exchange for  peace. It also wants to suppress the Arabs, usurp their rights  and lands, and confiscate their freedom and free will in the  name of peace and the logic of violence and occupation.    The paper stresses: The kind of peace that we understand and  seek to achieve must be comprehensive and just, under which  there will be no signs of aggression and injustice, and under  which rights and lands are returned in full to their rightful  Arab owners. Otherwise, there will be no peace.    Concluding its editorial, the paper says: Since it sees and  feels the Israeli threat to peace, the United States, as the  proponent of the land-for-peace initiative and the peace process  sponsor, should abandon its role as a spectator and exert  greater effort. It should stress the credibility of its  political role to entrench the role of the world community, its  principles, and laws, and champion, even for one time, the  causes of right and justice in this region.</p>

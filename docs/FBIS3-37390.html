The press points  out that the Tuesday signing of a joint Russian-British  statement on the de-targeting of strategic nuclear missiles from  each other became the chief result of the Moscow talks between  President Boris Yeltsin and British Prime Minister John Major,  who had arrived in Russia for his first official visit here.    Newspapers practically with one accord note the friendly  partnership atmosphere of the talks, although, as NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA points out in particular, "There were complex issues  under discussion, such as the situation in Bosnia."    Commenting on the Russian-British talks, TRUD points out  that  "Russia and Britain are not adversaries any longer". KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA (Red Star), describing the talks as a "dialogue of  partners", writes: "it is important that our mutually respectful  dialogue between equal partners is carried on. And not only  with the United States but also with European countries that are  friendly to Russia, with Britain rightfully among them".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, recalling the words of President Yeltsin  that Russia and Britain have now developed the best-ever  relations in their entire history, emphasises that "this  conclusion has been backed up by a package of joint documents".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the signing of a bilateral  Russo-Tatar  treaty in the Kremlin on Tuesday as a result of talks between  Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Mintimer Shaimiyev:    "The presidents of Russia and Tatarstan summed up the  results  of the three-year negotiating process between Moscow and Kazan.  From now on, the Republic of Tatarstan is a state united with  the Russian Federation on the basis of two constitutions and the  treaty on the delimitation of the areas of jurisdiction and  mutual delegating of powers between the state power bodies of  the Russian Federation and Tatarstan.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with Shaimiyev, who  recalled in particular that he had stated way back in January  this year that Tatarstan "will sign a treaty with Russia before  the beginning of March".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the signing of the Russia-Tatarstan  treaty:    "An ossified centre is being replaced by a federal  authority,  the power of which is in the emancipation of the subjects of the  federation". At the same time the newspaper points out that,  for a variety of reasons, primarily socio-economic ones, Russia  and Tatarstan" are just destined to be partners".    The newspaper ROSSIYA, under the rubric "a political  portrait", carries an article about Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the  fifth state Duma in Russian history.    ROSSIYA runs excerpts from a speech made by Moscow Mayor  Yuriy Luzhkov at the congress dealing with "the reality and  economic development prospects".    The newspaper notes "a critical tenor of the speech made by  the mayor who, perhaps, for the first time unambiguously stated  his disagreement with the way economic reforms are being carried  out in Russia...Luzhkov in point of fact read out his own reform  programme which differs from the government one".    At the same time ROSSIYA states that the mayor strongly  criticised the privatisation policy being pursued under the  guidance of russian state property committee chief Anatoliy  Chubays, pointing out that "this privatisation is ruining the  economy".</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Ford sees European profit in 1994 Ford of Europe expects to return to profit in 1994 after three years of heavy losses. Mr Jacques Nasser, Ford of Europe chairman, said the US carmaker's European operations (excluding Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury car subsidiary) had remained in loss in 1993, but had achieved 'a substantial improvement' from 1992. Ford had hoped to return to break-even in Europe this year (excluding Jaguar), but had been hit by the prolonged fall in new car demand. Its plants have operated at only around 70 per cent of capacity. Mr Nasser said that west European new car sales were expected to rise by only 1-2 per cent next year, following a decline of about 15 per cent this year. In the first nine months of 1993 Ford of Europe, excluding Jaguar, incurred a net loss of Dollars 264m (Pounds 177m). Last year's record annual loss totalled Dollars 1.3bn, including Dollars 395m at Jaguar. Ford, which is in fourth place in the west European new car market behind Volkswagen, of Germany, General Motors, of the US, and PSA Peugeot Citroen, of France, had increased productivity this year by more than 10 per cent in most areas, said Mr Nasser. It was aiming for a similar improvement in 1994. Mr Nasser said that productivity at its two UK car assembly plants at Dagenham and Halewood had improved by 42-44 per cent since 1990. This year's radical restructuring had reduced the Ford of Europe workforce by more than 10,000 to about 83,000. The total was 115,000 in 1990. Production of cars and light commercial vehicles (excluding Jaguar) had declined by 14 per cent this year to 1.45m, according to provisional figures. Output in Germany (including the plant in Genk, Belgium) had dropped 11.7 per cent to 829,000. UK production had declined 5.3 per cent to 390,000, while the Spanish total had plunged 31.9 per cent to 212,000. Output of the Mondeo this year had reached 347,000, compared with 221,000 for the Sierra in 1992. But the output of Ford's other models had declined sharply: Escort/Orion is down 28 per cent at 427,000; the Fiesta down 24 per cent at 433,000; and the Granada/Scorpio had plunged by 34 per cent to only 38,000.</p>

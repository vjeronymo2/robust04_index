			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUCTION A GOOD GIG FOR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT;  </P> <P> DRUGS: VENTURA COUNTY DEPARTMENT IS $102,693.50 RICHER AFTER VINTAGE GUITARS  SEIZED FROM A DEALER GO UP FOR BID.  </P> <P> The Japanese collector shouted "Eight thousand!" to the auctioneer and Brent  Haesler knew it was time to quit bidding.  </P> <P> Haesler, an amateur guitarist from Palos Verdes, was prepared to spend up to  $4,000 for a classic six-string but instead settled for a well-worn 1950  acoustic that was easily within budget at $300.  </P> <P> "I've never seen this many collectible guitars in one location," said Haesler,  36, whose modest collection includes a 1957 Gibson Les Paul.  </P> <P> More than 150 dealers, collectors and musicians from Washington to Japan  converged on an Upland auction yard Thursday night to bid on 87 vintage guitars  seized last year from a Thousand Oaks drug dealer.  </P> <P> When the bidding concluded, United Auctions had taken in $112,850, and the  anti-drug unit of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department was $102,693.50  richer, after deducting a 9% auctioneer's fee.  </P> <P> The collection, which had sat in the storage room for more than a year, was  officially appraised at $126,000 earlier this week by Mac Yasuda, a renowned  Japanese guitar collector who bid the $8,000 for a prized 1962 Fender  Stratocaster, the top price of the night.  </P> <P> Yasuda dropped $23,000 on 10 guitars, mostly inexpensive acoustic models that  he said are better suited for twanging than displaying in the guitar museum he  plans to open in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> "If this auction was in Texas, I definitely would have been outbid on them,"  Yasuda said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies seized the guitars, along with $76,155 in cash and a 1988  Camaro car, during a September, 1989, raid on the Potrero Road residence of  William H. Budnik. They reportedly confiscated five pounds of hydroponically  grown marijuana, hashish, cocaine and psilocybin mushrooms and then claimed the  guitars, money and car as drug-sale profits.  </P> <P> Budnik argued that he paid legitimate money for the guitars, whose value he  estimated at about $100,000. He dropped the claim after pleading guilty to  possession of marijuana for sale and serving several months of a one-year  sentence in the Ventura County Jail.  </P> <P> The auction was held under an outdoor canopy with a jazz band accompanying  registered bidders who wanted to test the guitars' sound quality. Haesler said  some die-hard musicians put down the $500 required to bid with no intention of  buying, merely for the chance to play some treasured instruments from noon to  the start of bidding at 7 p.m.  </P> <P> Albert Sullivan, 57, of Thousand Oaks, satisfied a longtime desire when he  walked away with a 1949 Gibson jazz guitar. Sullivan, who works in the  electronics industry, said he has put off guitar studies for years because he  lacked a finely crafted instrument.  </P> <P> "I have an affinity for Gibsons since I had one in college that I sold when  money got tight," Sullivan said. "This scratches a longtime itch."  </P> <P> Yasuda's $8,000 Stratocaster was valued at $10,000. Several of the most  expensive guitars sold below their appraised values, while many guitars worth  $200 to $300 netted twice the price.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of happy buyers who walked away with bargains," said Bob Mohs,  the auction company's general manager. "There may be some purchases that people  will be disappointed about once they come out from under the ether," he added.  </P> <P> Mohs said he has auctioned off private guitar collections in the past but none  as large or with the no-minimum bid and unrestricted ceiling stipulated by the  county. The bidders also were among the most shrewd horse-traders Mohs said he  had ever encountered.  </P> <P> "The people who came here knew exactly the value of each guitar, when it was  made and who painted it," Mohs said. "Some even knew who owned a guitar before  the collector who had it seized from him."  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department officials suspected that Budnik might turn up to reclaim  some of his most coveted pieces. Auction officials recorded no sales to him,  but said his bidding might have been done by a friend.  </P> <P> Judy Thompson, the Sheriff Department's property custodian, said the former  owner could only have gone away heartbroken.  </P> <P> "He's lost a lot," Thompson said. "There are a lot of guitars here he could  never replace."  </P> <P> Said Doug Moran of United Auctions: "It would be tough for him to show up. Sort  of like going to your girlfriend's wedding or being the bellhop on her  honeymoon."  </P></p>

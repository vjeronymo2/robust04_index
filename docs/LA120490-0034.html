			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUCHESNE SCORES TWICE TO LEAD KINGS OVER SOVIETS  </P> <P> It wasn't exactly the miracle on ice.  </P> <P> Nor the Miracle on Manchester.  </P> <P> Once upon a time, a hockey victory over the Soviet Union, any victory, was a  moment to savor.  </P> <P> But that was back when the cold war on ice mirrored the Cold War in the halls  of government.  </P> <P> In the era of glasnost the warming of relations has meant a cooling in the  heated rivalry.  </P> <P> So the Kings' 5-1 exhibition victory over Khimik Voskresensk Monday night at  the Forum didn't have the drama it might have had a few years ago.  </P> <P> Or the crowd.  </P> <P> It was announced as 10,762, although it appeared smaller, for the start of  Super Series 1990-91, a two-month, 21-game series involving the top three teams  in the Soviet National League against all the NHL clubs.  </P> <P> Steve Duchesne had two of the Kings' goals. The others were scored by Luc  Robitaille, Jay Miller and Mikael Lindholm.  </P> <P> Andrei Kvartalnov scored for Khimik.  </P> <P> "Anytime you have a game like this during the season," Coach Tom Webster said,  "you are concerned about injuries or anything that might transpire when you  don't take the game seriously. But I thought tonight was entertaining. It  helped that we brought some players up and played some of the younger guys."  </P> <P> Biggest cheers of the night came in a shootout between the second and third  periods. The Soviets won the best-of-five battle of penalty shots, 3-1.  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky scored the Kings' only goal. Robitaille, Tony Granato, Miller and  Bob Kudelski were all turned away by Soviet goalie Alexei Chervyakov.  </P> <P> Valeri Zelepukin, Dmitri Kvartalnov and Leonid Trukhno scored off the Kings'  Daniel Berthiaume.  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> In previous games against the Soviets, the Kings lost to the Central Red Army,  5-2, five seasons ago; to Dynamo Riga, 5-2, two seasons ago, and to Khimik,  6-3, last season. . . . Khimik split its six games on the NHL tour last season.  </P> <P> Neither King defenseman Marty McSorley, who has a bruise in the rib area, nor  center John McIntyre, who has contusion in the left shoulder, is expected back  before Saturday. . . . The Kings called up center Mikael Lindholm and right  wing Kyosti Karjalainen from their Phoenix Roadrunners farm club for the game.  </P></p>

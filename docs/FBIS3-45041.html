Mr Lu, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau  Affairs Office said yesterday that China wanted to issue the SAR  passports before the 1997 change-over.    "To achieve this, we need the co-operation of the British  side in supplying information, and we are prepared to discuss  this with them," said Mr Lu, shortly after expressing pessimism  about Sino- British co-operation following the breakdown of  talks on Hong Kong's political reforms.    Although Article 154 of the Basic Law restricts the issuing  of the SAR passports to after the change-over, Mr Lu said the  Chinese Government hoped the documents could be handed over to  people before July 1, 1997. He said SAR residents could still  use documents such as the Certificate of Identity for travelling  after 1997, although that did not reflect their nationality.  "It would not be appropriate if one could not hold a document  indicating one's nationality in the SAR under the Chinese  Government," he said.    The subject has been discussed by the social and security  panel of the Preliminary Working Committee and Mr Lu said one  way to prevent contravening the Basic Law would be for the  passports to be officially chopped for use only after July 1,  1997.    He refused to go into details of the design, but said the  passport would have a bauhinia on the cover.    The senior official also gave another assurance that Hong  Kong people with a second passport would be able to retain the  right of abode in the territory.</p>

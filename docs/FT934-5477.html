			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / NHS executive pay rises alarm ministers Health ministers were said to be 'extremely unhappy' yesterday about recent pay rises for senior National Health Service managers. This follows reports that the average salary increase for hospital trust chief executives in the past 12 months was about 9 per cent.

According to Incomes Data Services, an independent group of researchers, average pay for NHS trust managers ranged from Pounds 46,567 for those running ambulance trusts to Pounds 73,727 for those in charge of general acute units. The chief executive at Guy's and Lewisham in London received a 33 per cent rise in 1992-93, the biggest increase. Yesterday Mr Tom Sackville, a junior health minister, backed the pay rises, saying that few people could do the jobs involved. 'This is a very difficult job and we need top-line managers,' he said. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said: 'It is an insult to patients and staff that this pay should have risen more than for those who are doing the hard job, day in, day out, nursing or caring for patients.'</p>

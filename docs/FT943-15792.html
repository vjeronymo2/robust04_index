			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Bespak blames problems in US for 38% fall Continuing difficulties in the US healthcare market were behind a 38 per cent fall in profits at Bespak, the medical equipment manufacturer. Mr Peter Chambre, who took over as chief executive in May, described the year as 'very poor'. While his objective was to return the company to growth, the markets were not going to get a lot easier. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 7.1m for the year ended April 29. Sales increased from Pounds 61.8m to Pounds 64.9m. However, the latest figure included a Pounds 3m contribution from Medix, the breathing equipment manufacturer acquired in May last year, and a Pounds 3m currency gain. The shares, which were over 500p this time last year, closed down 15p at 290p yesterday. Operating profits in the US-based Tenax Corporation, the maker of plastic medical components acquired in 1992, were down 75 per cent in spite of a cost reduction programme and the loss of 50 jobs. US sales were down 14 per cent to Dollars 45m, while sales to US Surgical, the company's biggest US customer, fell 44 per cent on continued de-stocking and increased competition. Sales in the UK rose by 18 per cent, but operating income declined 2 per cent and margins fell from 17.3 per cent to 14.4 per cent. This reflected a change in the sales mix at Bespak UK, which makes pharmaceutical and personal care dispensing equipment. Sales of pumps and valves to the personal care market rose by 21 per cent to Pounds 10m. However, the group was unable to meet overall demand for pumps, and had to buy some in, hitting profitability. Medix had not proved nearly as profitable as expected, and had had to take a new nebuliser off the UK market because of technical problems. Mr Chambre said the group was looking for growth from dispensers for respiratory drugs in the form of dry powder, and from valves developed for non-CFC propellants - areas which mainly accounted for Pounds 2.5m spent on product development during the year. He believed that sales were starting to improve in both the UK and the US. While the pharmaceutical trading environment had changed for ever, Bespak was in a strong position to benefit from any upturn. Earnings per share fell from 31.9p to 19p. An unchanged final dividend of 6p is proposed, taking the total for the year to 10.2p (10p).</p>

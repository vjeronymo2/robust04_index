			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "`We Were  Allies'"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Pavel Sergeyevich, has the dispute  on how to conduct your troops' withdrawal from Germany now been  settled?    [Grachev] We have been waiting for a political decision by  the Federal Government for a long time -- for me, this was the  most important item on the agenda of our visit to Bonn.  Chancellor Kohl himself said that our troops should withdraw in  a festive and friendly atmosphere. This will happen, on 31  August in Berlin. This decision is only just. It is a gesture  of goodwill, which will hopefully be a symbol for future  German-Russian relations.    [DER SPIEGEL] The devil is in the nuts and bolts, and Berlin  is quite big. Are you dreaming of a military tattoo at the  Brandenburg Gate?    [Grachev] We will have to discuss all the details with the  Berlin mayor and the Brandenburg minister-president now. We are  thinking of a wreath-laying ceremony at the Treptow Park  memorial. A special meeting in the Reichstag would be desirable  -- although we will not insist on it -- and so would a public  ceremony in Berlin's city.    [DER SPIEGEL] Many Germans will not like this idea very  much: They remember the Russians not only as liberators, but  also as occupiers.    [Grachev] Of course, I can understand this. There are also  many people in our country who remember the Germans as fascists  -- people who wanted to overrun and destroy Russia. But the  Germans also experienced the horrors of air raids, the  destruction of their cities -- both by our troops and those of  the allies. It is quite obvious that we are also considered as  occupiers. But most people will know who is really to blame for  all that.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are you disappointed with your former allies  -- the Americans, English, and French -- because they were  opposed to a joint farewell ceremony with the Russians in the  first place?    [Grachev] It is not true that we were dreaming of a joint  farewell ceremony. I would not talk of a misunderstanding or  even a provocation either. The agreement on our withdrawal by 31  August was signed much earlier.    But, as to the allies' event in Berlin in September: We were  allies in 1945 when we met at the Elbe River. It would,  therefore, only be logical for the other three allies to invite  Russian military representatives and politicians to participate  in their ceremony. We would react positively to such a decision.    [DER SPIEGEL] You threatened that the withdrawal of your  troops from the Baltic states might be delayed because there are  not enough apartments available for your soldiers returning to  Russia. The Germans do not have to fear anything of that sort,  do they?    [Grachev] Housing for the returning troops continues to be  the biggest problem for us. But I am very grateful to the  Germans. They have kept their financial promises: 7.8 billion  German marks [DM] and another DM550 million for the construction  of officers' apartments. But in my talks with State Secretary  Schoenbohm of the Defense Ministry I presented claims against  several construction companies, including four German ones:  They are up to nine months in arrears with housing construction  in Russia. Of course, this also goes for South Korean and  Indian construction companies.    [DER SPIEGEL] What made you change your plans and make a  surprise visit to the Western Group of Russian Forces at  Wuensdorf during your visit to Bonn?    [Grachev] Time is running out. Detailed discussions must be  held with Supreme Commander Burlakov and all the other parties  concerned on the last phase of the troop withdrawal. I have to  present a detailed schedule to President Yeltsin on 16 May, who  will then pass it to Chancellor Kohl to endorse. If our  proposals are accepted, there will be no more obstacles to a  complete withdrawal of the last Russian troops.</p>

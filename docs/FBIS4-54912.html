			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Proposed Program of the Liberal </F> Bloc; No Thanks Are Due for Compensation"]    [Text] The first program reconciliation within the liberal  bloc is scheduled to take place on 26 April. Delegates of the  four parties will discuss and reconcile disputed issues  regarding education, the economy, agricultural policy, and  public safety on that day, according to a statement by Agrarian  Alliance spokeswoman Klara Spilak at yesterday's news conference.    The following are the members of the permanent conference  committee: Balint Nagy represents the Agrarian Alliance, Tamas  Fellegi represents Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats], Csaba  Csikos represents the Entrepreneurs' Party, and SZDSZ [Alliance  of Free Democrats] is represented by Tamas Bauer and Balint  Magyar. The SZDSZ will be in charge of presenting public safety  issues, Fidesz will deal with educational issues, the  Entrepreneurs' Party will present economic policy issues, and  the Agrarian Alliance will be in charge of agricultural policy  issues, of course. The leaders of the four parties intend to  publicize accomplishments in each field before the elections.    Agrarian Alliance political campaign chief Gyorgy Fabri  declared that the election struggle has not assumed a coarse  tone of voice, but he objected to the fact that there was no  opportunity to conduct real public debate, and he blamed  primarily the public service media for that. Thereafter Fabri  said that some positive changes have recently taken place in the  TV-HIRADO and in various news programs. Regarding the dispute  over the list of recipients of compensation, the campaign chief  said that the release and use of these data was an unfortunate  election trick, because the Agricultural Alliance believes that  no thanks are due for compensation.    Erzsebet Schmuck, cochairman of the Green Alternative,  distanced herself and her party from the Hungarian Green Party,  and reaffirmed their professional and political cooperation with  the Agrarian Alliance, a member of the liberal bloc.</p>

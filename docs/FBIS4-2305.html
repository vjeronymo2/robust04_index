			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ng Kang-Chung] </F>   [Text] A long-time friend of outspoken United Democrat  legislator Lau Chin-shek was attacked and beaten on his way to  Mr Lau's Wong Tai Sin office yesterday.    Tse Kwong-wang, 45, suffered head and eye injuries after he  was punched by two men, both in their mid-20s, on a footbridge  in Fung Tak Estate at about 1.45 pm.    Mr Tse said he did not know the attackers and had no idea  why  he was beaten. Robbery appears not to have been the motive  because the men made no effort to take anything from him.    Police could not say whether the attack was politically  motivated, but it was the second incident over the past two  months involving Mr Lau. Two months ago ink was thrown over the  door of the office.    Mr Tse, who is the United Democrats' Kowloon Central Branch  head, mainly serves the Hunghom area, but has been helping Mr  Lau in the afternoons for the past three months.    Mr Tse and Mr Lau, both labour activists at the Christian  Industrial Committee, have known each other for 20 years.    Mr Tse was recommended by Mr Lau to join the United  Democrats  several years ago and has recently taken part in protests  against increases in rates and bus fares.    "I am really puzzled. I do not think it is related to my  community work," said Mr Tse, a part-time taxi driver.    "I keep quite a low profile and concentrate on improving  people's livelihoods. I cannot think of any recent disputes at  all.    "The men did not say a word. They suddenly approached me and  punched me. Then they went away, without saying anything."    He said he would not be frightened off and would continue  working for Mr Lau and the party.    Mr Lau last night said he was sorry bout the attack.    "I hope it is not something to do with his political  background. People should voice their views peacefully," he said.</p>

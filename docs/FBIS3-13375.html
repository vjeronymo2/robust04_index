			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Lebanese Forces' Central Media Apparatus; </F> date not given--read by announcer]    [Text] Instead of opening this statement by providing the  public with a political interpretation of the goings on in the  Lebanese arena, we will only recount the events without comment,  since these events have political implications that the citizens  can understand and draw their own conclusions as to the events'  meanings and import.    In this context, we note that the authorities have been  carrying out a storming and arrest campaign over the past 24  hours. The campaign encompassed the areas of al-Arz, Sadd  al-Bawshariyah, Mayruba, 'Amshit, Jubayl, Jadayil, al-Buwar,  Sinn al-Fil, al-'Uqaybah, Juniyah, Zuq Mikha'il, and others.  The authorities took the liberty of violating the sanctity of  homes in a manner deemed impermissible by law, tradition, the  Constitution, and human rights.    The Lebanese Forces would like to note a few things.    1. The following persons have been arrested: Sharbil Zena  Rahmi, Kamil Khalil, Faris Matta, Zuhayr 'Ubayd, Tony Hanna  Basil, George Nakhlah Khalifah, As'ad 'Ubayd, Joseph Anis Rizq;  60-year-old Joseph Faddul, chief of the Bsharrah region in the  Phalangist Salvation Committee, and his sons Tony and Fawzi;  Sharbil Bulus, Edgar al-Ris, John al-Risa, Isiah 'Utayyiq, Tony  Jabbur, 'General Jabbur, Tony Jum'ah, Joseph Jum'ah, Jack  Jum'ah, Sahwqi al-Dakkash, Elie al-Ra'i, Rafiq Tawq, and Louis  'Abd-al-Satir. They all belong to the Lebanese Forces or the  Phalangist Salvation Committee.    2. Among the stormed homes were the homes of Walid Sulayman,  Tony Abu-Yunus, Sharbil Abi-'Aql, Wisam Bulus, Romeo 'Awwad,  John Habib, and Tarabayh Rahmi.    3. Despite what is happening, the Lebanese Forces have  repeated their call to officials to respect the laws and  Constitution and international traditions. They reiterate their  confidence that the rule of law and justice must eventually  prevail no matter how difficult things might be and regardless  of how citizens are targeted, how much partisan activity is  restricted, and how democracy and the people's rights are  violated.</p>

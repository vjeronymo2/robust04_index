			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "The Morning Paper" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] President Carlos Roberto Reina traveled to the  Swan Islands yesterday to investigate certain strange rumors  that troops planning to overthrow Fidel Castro were on the  island and to confirm that only authorized aircraft, boats, and  other vessels are allowed to transit Honduran airspace and  waters.    [Begin recording] [Reina] One reason for my visit to the  Swan Islands was to investigate complaints that there might be  some sort of strange activity going on there related in some way  to the Caribbean situation. I have gone all over the islands  and seen what I just told you. Let this serve as evidence to  deny any suspicions, rumors, or comments that differ from the  truth.    [Unidentified reporter] What strange activities were  reportedly going on there?    [Reina] We were advised by a nearby country that some sort  of  armed action against a Caribbean country was being prepared  there.    [Reporter] What country?    [Reina] When you speak of the Caribbean, the political  problem has always been Cuba, the Republic of Cuba, which I hope  will reenter the inter-American system when the island can meet  the system's requirements. These complaints had been kept  secret, but they could surface later and tarnish Honduras'  image. We do not want our country to be hurt in any way. On  the contrary, we want Honduran prestige to afford us all  possible international assistance and worldwide acceptance,  because democracy is reaffirmed every day in Honduras.

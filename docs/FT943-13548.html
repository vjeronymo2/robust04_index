			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / One-off factors help US banks advance Chase Manhattan and Nations-Bank, two of the US's biggest commercial banks, comfortably beat market forecasts with post-tax earnings gains of 32 per cent and 43 per cent respectively in the second quarter. Both benefited from one-off factors, though the results also demonstrated stronger than expected underlying earnings growth against rising US interest rates and turbulent financial markets. At Chase, post-tax profits of Dollars 307m (Pounds 201m), or Dollars 1.46 a share, were up from Dollars 233m, or Dollars 1.20 a share, while NationsBank's net earnings rose to Dollars 437m, or Dollars 1.58, from Dollars 306m, or Dollars 1.20. Chase reported a Dollars 55m gain on the sale of its Arizona bank, higher mortgage banking fees due to an acquisition and an unspecified boost to trading income from an exchange of its Brazilian loans for bonds. However, its earnings growth was driven mainly by lower credit costs, higher fee income and an increase in net interest income, despite tighter margins. Fee income jumped by Dollars 98m to Dollars 480m, with contributions from consumer and investment banking and the trust business. Trading income fell Dollars 36m to Dollars 151m. The provision for bad loans dropped to Dollars 150m, from Dollars 225m a year before. Chase said it had put much of its commercial property problems behind it: just 18 months after announcing plans to sell off Dollars 2bn of properties, only Dollars 45m remains. NationsBank's earnings were boosted in part by takeovers. Non-interest income of Dollars 629m was 31 per cent higher than a year before, and would have risen by only 7 per cent had it not been for acquisitions. Average loans during the period jumped 23 per cent to Dollars 92.6bn, with half of the growth coming from increased loan demand and the rest from takeovers. The bank's net interest margin remained largely un-changed at 4.15 per cent. The earnings advances boosted return on equity at Chase to 16.1 per cent, from 15 per cent a year before, and at NationsBank to 17 per cent, from 14.7 per cent. First-half net income rose to Dollars 671m from Dollars 386m at Chase, and to Dollars 854m from Dollars 587m at NationsBank.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (7): Far right stirs up trouble - Instability too close for comfort HUNGARIANS have watched ethnic war in the old Yugoslav republics, race riots in eastern Germany, fascist pamphleting in Romania and political instability in Poland - and thanked their lucky stars that their own country was different. On the surface the country remains an island of stability. But Hungary's extreme right has risen from its slumber, bringing anti-semitism and territorial ambition, long traditions buried under taboo, back into public discourse. It took little to summon up echoes from the darker side of Hungary's past: one ranting essay damning communists for being Jews and Jews for being communists in the party newspaper of the ruling conservatives, the Hungarian Democratic Forum. But the far right manifesto - turned out to be more than a laughable throwback to the rhetoric of Hungary's fascist era. The author was Mr Istvan Csurka, populist writer, vice-president and bad conscience of the Forum. Support among frustrated ruling party activists for Mr Csurka's call for a purge of the enemies of the nation is so strong as to make him well-nigh unassailable, government officials admit. Tellingly, the Forum's ethical committee has investigated, not Mr Csurka, but the colleague who dared to write that the manifesto was the basis of a complete Nazi ideology. Mr Csurka remains in place. As for Mr Jozsef Antall, the moderate prime minister and president of the Forum, when pressed to take a stand on the article, he could muster little more than the adjectives 'mistaken and damaging'. Little wonder. Mr Antall, whose government has managed to push through vital legislation needed to transform Hungary's economy and institutions, has too many battles on other fronts to invite another. The prime minister faces open disaffection among the Forum's liberals, few though they are, and from his fractious coalition partners, the more loyal of which last month declared itself the opposition within. Voters are turning against the Forum in the opinion polls and by-elections. After 45 years of communism, Hungary needs time to build up a middle class and broader civil society large and confident enough to provide a secure base for democratic government. The liberal professional class came out on to the streets in a peaceful protest against Mr Csurka and his friends, and western opinion, in which the government has often sought consolation, has also shown dismay at the government's appeasement of the far right. Even some of the prime minister's closest aides, who liked to boast that Hungary had a natural conservatism that would keep them in power for decades, now privately resign themselves to defeat at the next elections in 1994. The perceived state of the economy is another reason for Hungarian democracy's 'feelbad factor'. Output from the large state enterprises has declined by a fifth over the past three years, and rising unemployment has made people cut back on consumption. For others - and the government's supporters number heavily among them  - the sharper frustration is that former communists are not sharing the economic suffering, but turning adeptly into capitalists and prospering. 'They have forgotten Marx and only remember Das Capital,' the prime minister likes to jibe. To understand the gall, go to the provinces, says a prime ministerial aide, and see 'the smiling, self-satisfied faces' of those communists who have made the transition. A lot of Hungarians want to wipe away that smile. They voted in the government to do that; it has failed them, and they are angry. Mr Csurka articulated that feeling - and much more. The government could push for satisfying purges but only by jeopardising the stability Mr Antall needs, and undermining vital economic recovery in the process. The unpalatable truth is that Hungary's communists were by the final decade communist only in name and careerists in practice. They have acquired by default a wealth of experience, and the economy can ill do without them. The prime minister's circle puts the dilemma as a choice between efficiency and justice, and by and large it is justice that has fallen by the wayside. The trouble is that the government is not looking very efficient either. Nor is it likely to, with the recession postponing recovery to 1993 and beyond. 'Next year is already too close to the elections,' admits one adviser close to the prime minister. 'Even if there is GDP growth, it will be too slow and easy to dispute.' One prime-ministerial aide says that the 'national versus cosmopolitan' issue will inevitably be one of the main factors in the political fight over the next 18 months. In itself, that would not be enough to save the Forum government. It would probably need what one official close to the government described as the 'Falklands factor', recalling how Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former UK Prime Minister, swept to electoral victory on a wave of patriotic fervour after the Falklands war. The prime minister is anything but the sabre-rattling type, but there are others in his party who would not be so squeamish about playing the nationalist card to save their political careers. With every far right outburst and regional crisis, Mr Antall's dilemma tightens. The fates of his party, his government and his country, which Mr Antall often seemed to consider one and the same, are increasingly out of line; and the time is coming closer when the prime minister will have to choose.</p>

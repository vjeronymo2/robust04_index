			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUSTRALIAN GROUP BUYS 24.4% STAKE IN BARRIS FROM SUGARMAN  </P> <P> An Australian joint venture that operates one of that country's top commercial  television networks has purchased a 24.4% interest in Beverly Hills-based  Barris Industries Inc. for $34.5 million.  </P> <P> Westfield Capital Corp. and Northern Star Holdings Ltd. acquired the stake  previously held by financier Burt Sugarman's Giant Group Ltd. As part of the  sale, Sugarman will resign as chairman of Barris, along with Giant's three  other members of the Barris board.  </P> <P> Sugarman's exit leaves Barris in the hands of Peter Guber and Jon Peters, the  prolific Hollywood movie producing team whose latest effort, "Rain Man," just  won four Oscars, including one for Best Picture.  </P> <P> Guber and Peters -- who merged their Guber-Peters Co. with Barris in December,  1987 -- will function as "joint managing directors" of the new company, said  Frank Lowy, chairman of Westfield and Northern Star. "Guber and Peters are  taking over operating control of Barris," Lowy said. "They will have five-year  contracts, full operational responsibility and full creative and financial  control." Lowy will become chairman of the new company, which will be renamed  sometime in the future.  </P> <P> "This new partnership makes Barris a global entertainment company concentrating  totally on entertainment, movies, TV, video and music," Guber said Friday.  </P> <P> As part of the purchase agreement, the Australian joint venture will have the  right to name half of the members of Barris' board. In addition, the Australian  rights to all television, movie and recording properties developed by Barris  will be available to Northern Star's Network Ten Australia.  </P></p>

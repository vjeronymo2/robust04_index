			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Anglo Irish Bank seeks IPounds 57.8m to boost base The Irish stock market was taken by surprise yesterday with a IPounds 57.8m (Pounds 55m) cash call from Anglo Irish Bank Corporation, the Dublin-based banking group. The rights issue of 121.7m shares on a 1-for-1 basis at 50p has been underwritten by AIB Capital Markets and Paribas Capital Markets. The shares closed down 6p at 56p. The company intends to maintain the present level of dividend on the enlarged share capital 'in the absence of unforeseen circumstances'. Mr Sean Fitzpatrick, chief executive, said the reason for the issue was 'strategic rather than transactional, to move the bank up to a different league'. He added: 'No acquisitions are intended or targeted at this particular moment.' The increased market capitalisation would put it in the top 15 stocks traded on the Irish stock exchange, he said, 'which will be good for liquidity'. As institutions focused more on the larger, more liquid stocks 'there is a danger if we are not up there that our shares could practically stop trading in a few years' time'. The money raised will be used as leverage to raise a similar amount in second-tier capital over the next two years. Two thirds will be applied to new lending in the Irish market, the remainder in the UK. Mr Fitzpatrick said that the bank had no plans to diversify either geographically, or out of the niche middle-market and professional sectors, but would build market share through organic growth and the purchase of loan books.</p>

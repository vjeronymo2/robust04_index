			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Ohbayashi cuts annual earnings forecast OHBAYASHI, a leading Japanese contracting group, estimates parent pre-tax profits of about Y53bn (Dollars 394m) for the year to March, down from its November forecast of Y62bn, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Ohbayashi posted parent pre-tax profits of Y60.31bn in 1990-91. The estimate has been cut because of a drop in the company's non-operating profits. Ohbayashi suffered large stock losses in 1991-92 owing to the floundering Tokyo stock market, it said. Ohbayashi's estimate for 1991-92 parent operating profit remains unchanged from its November forecast of Y68bn.</p>

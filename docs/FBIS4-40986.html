			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of the Russian Government Viktor  Chernomyrdin, who arrived in Washington on a visit on Tuesday,  held a meeting in his official residence with representatives of  influential Jewish organizations. The leaders of the  organizations stated their support for the process of Russian  reforms and stressed that they would do everything possible to  assist them. At the same time they voiced concern at rising  crime in Russia and acts of anti-Semitism.    Viktor Chernomyrdin stated that the country's leadership  intends to firmly strive for the observance of human rights and  to combat crime and manifestations of chauvinism. At the same  time he noted that political stability can be based only on  economic stability and economic and trade cooperation between  Russia and the Unites States could play an immense role here.    At the meeting a wide range of issues was discussed, in  particular the need for the abolition of the Jackson-Vanick  amendment as one of the barriers which are holding back the  development of bilateral trade.</p>

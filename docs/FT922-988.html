			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Israel Under Labour: Arabs see chance for new era in peace-making WITH A few predictable exceptions, Arabs have reacted positively to the Labour Party's election win. The Palestinians have urged Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the party leader, to move quickly towards autonomy negotiations. Among the most favourable reactions were those of Egypt and Jordan, which hailed the victory as an opportunity for a new era in peacemaking. In Cairo, Dr Osama al-Baz, a senior foreign policy official, said Egypt hoped the result would 'give a strong push to peace efforts and the reaping of a golden opportunity to achieve an historic reconciliation between Israel and the Arabs'. In Amman, Dr Kamal Abu Jaber, Jordan's foreign minister, saw it as 'the end of an era and the beginning of a new page in Israeli politics'. Positive reactions in Arab capitals to the defeat of Mr Yitzhak Shamir reflect a general belief that Middle East peace negotiations were doomed as long the Likud government was in power. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the chief Palestinian spokeswoman, expressed a common view when she told reporters in Amman that 'the peace process has been rescued from Likud attempts at sabotaging it'. She hoped that as soon as the new government was formed it would 'proceed with the steps that it announced earlier'. This was a reference to Mr Rabin's promise to freeze 'political settlements' in the West Bank and Gaza Strip - those deemed not vital to Israel's security - and move quickly to begin negotiations on Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories under the Camp David formula of 1978. US-sponsored bilateral peace talks are due to resume in Rome next month between Israel and her Arab neighbours - including Syria, Lebanon and a Palestinian-Jordanian team. The talks, launched amid much fanfare in Madrid last October, have made little progress. The presence in Rome of new Israeli negotiators seems certain to promote a more constructive atmosphere. But Palestinian delegates to the talks warned that while the Labour party would be more flexible on autonomy, it was likely to adopt a hard line on the final status of the territories. The Palestinians want their own independent state, possibly in confederation with Jordan. Syria reacted cautiously to the change in Israel, although it applauded Mr Shamir's defeat. Mr Farouk al-Shara, foreign minister, said Damascus reserved judgment. Syria is seeking the return of the Golan Heights seized in the 1967 war, and annexed by the nationalist government of Mr Menachem Begin in 1981. Mr Rabin has spoken of 'creative solutions' to resolve the Golan issue, but has not gone into details, beyond raising the possibility of Israel continuing to utilise the heights while recognising Syrian sovereignty. The Palestine Liberation Organisation welcomed the Labour victory. Mr Nabil Shaath, a senior adviser to Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, said he hoped Mr Rabin would 'stop settlements immediately and will proceed to bring about quick action to install a Palestinian interim self-government by November 1'. But in Jerusalem, Dr Mehdi Abdul Hadi, a prominent academic, said the Palestinians would now have to think more seriously about the implications and practicalities of autonomy. 'We have to be prepared. They will want us to meet them half-way.' Palestinians in the territories have been engaged in planning for interim self-rule. Under such a formula Israel would retain responsibility for security, but would pull back from population centres allowing the 1.75m Arabs of the territories to administer themselves. Sour reactions to the Labour victory came from Iran and its proxy Hizbollah militia in Lebanon. Tehran Radio said there was 'no fundamental difference' between Labour and Likud. 'The victory of the Labour party. . . . in no way signifies a decrease in the Zionist regime's expansionist expectations,' it said. In Beirut, a Hizbollah leader said the guerrilla warfare against Israel's south Lebanon security zone would continue. The Lebanese government, on the other hand, said it hoped Mr Rabin would facilitate Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon under the terms of Security Council Resolution 425 passed during an Israeli incursion in 1978. Mr Rabin, as defence minister in a national unity government in 1985, helped set up Israel's 15km-wide security zone in southern Lebanon.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- KEY FACTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Israel population:                                 4,895,700 (including East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Jews:                                              4,010,300 Other (mainly Arab):                                 885,400  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Israel Bureau of Statistics, April 91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Occupied territories:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Settlers (Jewish): West Bank: (in approx 150 settlements)            90-100,000 Gaza Strip: (in approx 15 settlements)              c. 3,000 Golan Heights: (in approx 30 settlements)             12,000 East Jerusalem: (in 12 neighbourhoods)               120,000  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: US State Department 20.3.91 report  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Palestinians:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- West Bank:                                        900,000-1m Gaza Strip:                                  670,000-750,000  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Israel's Civil Administration  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

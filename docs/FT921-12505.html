			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Irregularities in Gulf troop charters suspected AN investigation is under way into suspected irregularities in the shipping of British troops and equipment to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf campaign, it was disclosed last night. The Ministry of Defence said documents were seized last month from premises in London and the south-east by MoD police officers. The documents related to the chartering of ships for Operation Granby - the British contribution to forces in the Gulf. The UK relied on vessels chartered on the commercial market to move its armoured division with equipment, ammunition and spares. Almost all the ships were non-British flag vessels. The MoD said inquiries were continuing, but would not comment on the scale of the alleged irregularities.</p>

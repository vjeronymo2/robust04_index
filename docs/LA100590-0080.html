			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD AND HOTELIERS DISCUSS PARTY SAFETY;  </P> <P> CROWD CONTROL: AUTHORITIES ADVISED MANAGERS TO NIP TROUBLE BEFORE IT ESCALATES  BY CALLING IN POLICE.  </P> <P> In an attempt to prevent mass gatherings in Inglewood from growing out of  control, city officials this week convened a group of hotel and club managers,  including the administrators from an Inglewood hotel where two party-goers died  this summer.  </P> <P> It was the two recent deaths at the Days Inn Park Plaza Hotel, which occurred  within a week, that prompted Mayor Edward Vincent to convene the managers  Monday and tell them: "We want to eliminate people getting hurt and people  getting killed."  </P> <P> A week after a man attending a Sweet 16 birthday party was shot in the Days Inn  parking lot Aug. 25, another birthday party with more than 300 guests erupted  in fistfights, gunfire and a fatal traffic accident.  </P> <P> Police and fire officials recommended that managers screen those who book the  parties and vigorously adhere to occupancy limits in order to reduce the  likelihood of violence.  </P> <P> "There's no way to guarantee that nothing bad will happen," said Deputy Chief  James Butts. But he told the managers that they could reduce the escalation of  trouble by calling police immediately if fighting starts, if a guest has a  firearm or if party-goers refuse to leave when ordered.  </P> <P> Butts also said managers should have a secure place from which to phone the  police. When fighting broke out at the Days Inn party, an employee reported  that guests seeking safety overran the hotel's front office.  </P> <P> The managers said their main dilemma is predicting the dynamics of a party  ahead of time, especially when young people sometimes send an adult to book the  gathering.  </P> <P> Kay Hong, manager of the Days Inn Park Plaza, suggested that the police could  run background checks on organizers as a precaution, but Butts said police  databases are not available for such uses.  </P> <P> Mark Sinaguglia, who runs the Mayflower Ballroom in Inglewood, said one of his  techniques for avoiding trouble is carefully screening party organizers. He  said he requires a driver's license and asks the organizers questions about  their employment and any past parties they have had.  </P> <P> Even if an organizer passes those tests, the party may still not be a sure  thing. He said he sometimes turns party organizers down for nothing other than  "a gut feeling."  </P></p>

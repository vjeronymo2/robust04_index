			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report on a lecture by Dirk Viljoen of the Afrikaner </F> Freedom Foundation by Nols Nieman; place and date not given:  "Problems Legion in That Afrikaner Refuge"]    [Text] A growing number of Afrikaners regard the  Northern Cape region as their homeland and are quietly moving  there, says Professor Carel Boshoff, chairman of the Afrikaner  Freedom Foundation (Avstig). He himself has just moved there.  But how viable is that region as an ethnic state? Dirk Viljoen,  a municipal and regional planner from Pretoria, recently  delivered a lecture on the viability of the region as a  homeland.    An ethnic Afrikaner state can only succeed, according to  Avstig's definition, in a region like the Northern Cape where  the number of other peoples and groups is low, said Viljoen.  Problems, however, are going to be legion. "Success will depend  on whether enough Afrikaners will support it. I do not believe  that this is currently the case. That will probably happen only  long after a black government has come to power." Because whites  only constitute 15.6 percent of the region's population while  coloreds and blacks make up 58.5 and 25.7 percent, respectively,  it will be some decades before Afrikaners become a majority or a  significant element in the region.    Cooperation with other peoples and groups is therefore  necessary at the outset. This must be based on principles that  have to be given thought in advance and that must never give  rise to doubts among the Afrikaners and the other groups. "It  must be clearly set forth that, after a period of time,  Afrikaners are to reach an agreement with the other groups in  regard to a geographic partitioning. Development must have  partition between Afrikaners and coloreds as an important goal  in the medium and long term. Absolute clarity must also exist  from the outset in regard to autonomous activity."    One of the greatest problems is the Northern Cape's very  limited economic base. With the exception of Kimberley,  Uppington, and De Aar, the economy is still in a primary phase  where agriculture and mining predominate. Another problem is the  very small populace of about 700,000 people. Rural population  growth is low and only moderate urban growth is occurring. The  "penetration" of blacks into the eastern subregion as a result  of its proximity to Transkei, Qwaqwa, and Lesotho also threatens  the ethnic state because these factors will exist in the future  as well. The level of education is also very low. It will take a  very long time to train the work force, of which 70 percent have  completed the eighth form or less or have never attended school  at all.    The Northern Cape gets little rainfall and water is scarce.  Its geographic situation and its climate will always restrict  development. Some of these disadvantages can be overcome by  proper development policy and strategies. The two most important  river systems--the Orange and Olifants Rivers--flow only through  the western subregion and the northern parts of the central and  eastern subregions. The region has an extensive primary road  network but the other road networks are only poorly developed.  The northwestern part's major highway connections to the more  developed eastern areas are limited.    The system of major railway lines also has serious  shortcomings. The rail line from Cape Town to the north and the  one from Kimberley to Postmasburg, Sishen, and Hotazel are not  interconnected and they are not operated as such. Few scheduled  airline flights land in the region--even Kimberley does not have  very regular service. A good deep sea port is lacking as well.  The established urban concentrations are relatively small and do  not constitute a strong base for development. It will cost a lot  of money to develop the inadequate major infrastructure. The  private sector can contribute, but the greatest responsibility  will rest with the central and regional authorities.    Viljoen said that more favorable geographical and physical  conditions for development, such as exist in other parts of  South Africa, would have resulted in more trained workers and  entrepreneurs. In the Northern Cape, such migration will occur  primarily due to other factors. "One such factor is, of course,  the desire of Afrikaners to experience their freedom in an  ethnic state. The question, of course, is at what pace will  Afrikaners seek refuge in the region after the election of a  majority government." It will probably take longer than a decade  for Afrikaners to establish themselves in the Northern Cape.  This will greatly affect the pace of development and it is for  that reason that the region will have to be systematically  marketed among Afrikaners.    Success will depend greatly on the management of development  efforts. A future regional government will not be able to  accomplish that alone. The private sector, SABRA [South African  Bureau of Racial Affairs], and other organizations with the same  goals will have to actively participate. Organizations that  represent ethnic state Afrikaners will have to become  involved--politically and in other ways--in the regional  government.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 21 (AFP) -- The European Commission  believes that Greece's economic blockade of Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] violates European  laws on free trade with a third state, a spokesman for the  Commission said here Monday [21 February].    "Greece's decisions clearly violate the trade laws" of the  European Community, he said, adding that the EC Commission is  waiting for Greece to justify its action as called for by the  law.    According to EC law, any country that imposes such sanctions  must prove that it was forced to undertake such a move because  its security was threatened.    In the northwestern Greek town of Ioannina on Monday, Greek  Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias issued a message to his EC  partners saying that "it is not Greece that has hurt the EC's  solidarity but rather those who have supported (FYROM's)  intransigence."    Greece, which holds the rotating presidency of the EC, said  it had been forced to impose the punitive blockade last week  after the United States "erroneously" recognised FYROM before  the latter had responded positively to Greece's demands for  Skopje to work towards stability in the region.    Most of Athens' EC partners have also recognized FYROM.    Greece accuses FYROM of usurping a name which Athens says is  solely part of Greek heritage and of harbouring expansionist  ambitions over the Greek province of the same name.    "We are not asking anything from anyone, the only thing we  want is respect for our borders, respect for the rights of the  Greek minority (in FYROM) and respect for our history,"  Papoulias said.    Along the Greek-FYROM border Monday, convoys of trucks could  be seen waiting for Greek border guards to check their  merchandise before being allowed to proceed.    The Greek blockade covers oil and other essential supplies.</p>

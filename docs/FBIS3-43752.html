De  Klerk on Friday [14 January] welcomed Japan's proposal to send  election monitors to observe South Africa's first multiracial  parliamentary elections set for late April, Japanese officials  said.    De Klerk told Japan's Parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister  Syozo Azuma that he was encouraged with Japan's intention to  contribute to the development of Southern Africa.    Azuma, who met with the president in Pretoria, conveyed  Tokyo's decision to help South Africa conduct the April election  successfully, the officials said. Azuma is currently in South  Africa on a 23-day, nine-nation tour of Africa and South Asia  that began January 5.    Japan and Pretoria will later discuss details of the  proposal  such as the scale of the monitoring mission, the officials said.    On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  proposed to the Security Council the dispatch of some 1,800  people for monitoring the South African elections.</p>

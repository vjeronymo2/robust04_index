			<p>BFN     [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China will  work for a good implementation of the Uruguay-round trade  accords, the head of the Chinese delegation told the GATT  ministerial meeting here today.    Gu Yongjiang, also Chinese vice-minister of foreign trade  and  economic cooperation, was speaking to some 170 delegations  meeting in the Moroccan city to sign the Uruguay-round trade  accords, which were reached last December under the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    The Uruguay round of talks "has not only made substantial  achievements on market access, but also succeeded in  strengthening and enlarging the multilateral principles guiding  world trade," said Gu.    He said that "the Chinese government supports the creation  of  the World Trade Organization (WTO)," which will replace GATT on  January 1, 1995, an event marking "the start of a new phase for  the global multilateral trade system."    "A large number of developing countries, by taking free  trade  measures for the expansion of global trade, have made an  important contribution" to the success of the Uruguay round of  talks, Gu said.    However, their "interests have not been given appropriate  consideration," he said.    "We share the concerns of the developing countries on a  number of important issues such as trade and environment as well  as the social aspects of trade," he said.    "The Chinese government hopes that developing countries will  have more fair opportunities in the new trade system and that  their interests, especially those of the least developed  countries, will be embodied effectively in this system," he  noted.    China will also seek to "create necessary conditions to  resume as soon as possible its status of a GATT contracting  member and to become a founding member of the WTO," said Gu.    He stressed that "China's complete integration into the  world  trade system will strengthen the universality of the WTO" and  "will provide much more access for foreign products and services  to the large market of China."</p>

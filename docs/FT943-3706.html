			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Ministers urged to maintain union A list of motions submitted for debate at next month's Conservative party conference in Bournemouth shows that activists are dissatisfied with a range of government policies, including the peace initiative in Northern Ireland, the party's internal organisation and the treatment of local councils. The motions - only a handful of which have been selected for debate - reveal that grassroots activists who are traditionally loyal to Mr John Major's leadership have become angry as the party's popularity has slumped. On Northern Ireland, nearly all 50 motions submitted warn ministers not to surrender sovereignty over Ulster and to maintain the union. All the motions were submitted before the IRA ceasefire at the end of last month. But one calls for the Anglo-Irish agreement to be scrapped and suggests that the prospect of negotiations with Sinn Fein will dismay some delegates. There is also concern about policy on local government following the Tories' disastrous performance in the council elections in May. Many local associations call for an end to the capping of council expenditure and for the government to reverse its decision to set up unitary local authorities. On Europe, nearly all the motions endorse the scepticism towards the European Union which the prime minister expressed during the Euro-election campaign. In many cases the government is urged to hold a referendum on Britain's future in Europe amid signs that - as one association puts it - 'too much is being done too fast on European integration'. Party managers remain confident of a good conference next month. They argue that delegates will rally round government policies on fighting crime and controlling public spending. As usual, the leadership has selected a series of uncontroversial motions to anchor the main debates. However, one minister warned yesterday that there was much discontent among the party rank-and-file over the way Tory MPs had conducted themselves over the past 12 months. 'There is a lot of pressure, not on the government but on the party as a whole, to be more cohesive and not to argue in public.' Observer, Page 21</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> SLOPE SHIFT BLAMED FOR CRACKS IN HOMES  </P> <P> Diane Venstrom first noticed the cracks inside her Mission Viejo house about 18  months ago. Then, the concrete patio began slowly breaking away from the  foundation of the home. And finally, Venstrom learned that at least three  neighbors had similar cracks in their houses.  </P> <P> This week, Venstrom and her neighbors received more troublesome news when  Converse Consultants, an Irvine-based geological firm, told the City Council  that a water-saturated slope along Campo Moro road is sliding toward houses on  Ayamonte.  </P> <P> After receiving the geological report, the council approved $600,000 to ensure  that the homes are not threatened with collapse, Mayor Christian W. Keena said.  </P> <P> "We're not sure who is responsible for the problem," Keena added, "but we want  to take the right measures before a disaster happens."  </P> <P> Venstrom said that she and her neighbors contacted their homeowners association  when they noticed the cracks inside their houses and in the retaining wall that  runs along Campo Moro. The association patched the cracks in the road, planted  additional shrubs on the slope and reduced watering, she said.  </P> <P> The city-commissioned geological study revealed that excessive watering of the  slope had caused cracks in the roadbed extending at least six feet deep in some  places.  </P> <P> Keena said the city plans to install several layers of non-expansive soil in  its planned reconstruction of Campo Moro, and noted that the problem was  becoming too common in Mission Viejo. Several weeks ago, a slope at the Mission  Viejo Mall collapsed, triggering a mudslide near Interstate 5. Keena said the  city would also spend almost $400,000 to repair road erosion along Alicia  Parkway.  </P> <P> "Sometimes you have to wonder if there's a problem with the design of our  streets," the mayor said. "My biggest concern is that we're not sitting on a  major problem here. . . . You have to make a special effort when you put houses  on hillsides."  </P> <P> Venstrom said her house is "very livable" and that she is not panicking. But  she said she hopes that the city moves quickly to correct the problem.  </P> <P> "This is my home. I don't have money to move or fix it," she said. "I hope they  do something because it's the only thing I have." DAVAN MAHARAJ  </P></p>

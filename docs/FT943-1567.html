			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Balladur's big balancing act: The French premier is aiming for fiscal discipline without choking off incipient economic recovery For someone usually so cautious, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has just taken a gamble. This week, less than eight months before the presidential election he hopes to win next May, he unveiled a deficit-slashing budget for 1995. He and his budget minister, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, described their plans to forgo income tax cuts, to freeze overall public spending and to prune another FFr25bn (Pounds 3bn) off the deficit, as 'courageous'. It is either that, or foolhardy, to place before a country recovering from recession and still suffering from record unemployment a pre-election budget which merely chips away at the heavy welfare charges that so deter job creation in France. Mr Balladur is trying to pull off a delicate, multiple balancing act. He is aiming for fiscal rigour without choking off France's incipient economic recovery. He wants to bolster his government's pro-European and anti-inflationary credentials while putting enough people back to work to win what is likely to be a fiercely contested presidential election. Whether courageous or foolhardy, the Balladur government has promptly set about selling its new budget to the French and foreigners. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, flew to New York yesterday to try to convince Wall Street investors that France is still a good bet. Foreigners shed more than FFr100bn of their investments in French government paper in the first half of this year. As well as being deterred by the general fall in bond prices, they were bothered by the prospect of a protracted campaign for next May's election and by an aura of corruption gathering round some of its leading companies. Pressure is also coming from Europe. Early next month, Mr Alphandery will be grilled by fellow European Union finance ministers on France's plans to reduce its budget deficit in order to conform with the Maastricht treaty convergence targets. By that time, the budget debate in the French National Assembly will be also under way. For French politicians, EU partners and foreign investors alike, the central question is the same: can the Balladur government meet the demands of Maastricht and of the markets for fiscal discipline, while also curing France's chronic unemployment problem? The government believes this is possible, largely thanks to the upswing in the economy. Shaking off months of caution, Mr Alphandery predicted this week that the economy would grow by at least 3.1 per cent in real terms next year, after 2 per cent this year. Such growth would be kick-started by extra spending on public works and housing as well as government incentives for car purchases, and led by internal demand, Mr Alphandery predicted. Increased purchasing power would sustain the rise in household consumption, while rising order books encouraged companies to make new cap-ital investments. Internal demand would therefore probably rise faster in France next year (3.2 per cent) than elsewhere in Europe (an average of 2.7 per cent). The economy minister said the recovery looked like being 'healthy and durable', unconstrained by worries over inflation or trade imbalances. The rate of price rises, now running at 1.7 per cent a year, would stay below 2 per cent next year, while this year's expected FFr80bn trade surplus would only slip to FFr60bn, he claimed. However these predictions turn out for next year, the upturn has already had an effect on the job market, with an extra 117,000 finding employment in the first half of this year. The last time such a surge took place was in the expansionary years of 1987-89. No one in the French government expects a repetition of that expansion, unfettered as it was by Maastricht treaty fiscal disciplines. But the Balladur administration says it is determined not to 'waste' the new upturn in the way its Socialist predecessors failed to use the late 1980s boom to rein in France's public deficit and reform its labour market. Even Socialists now privately admit that if they had done more in this regard, they would not have left the country in such a mess in 1993. Luckily, the Socialists left something behind to help Mr Balladur's conservatives clean up the mess: the expensive nationalisation programme of the early 1980s, in which they bought holdings of well over 50 per cent in a number of big companies. Receipts from privatisation - FFr94bn in the past 18 months - have been crucial to Mr Balladur's redressing of public finances so far, and the government is planning a further FFr55bn in asset sales next year. Doubts centre on the magnitude and use of these receipts. Most of the easy, big sales have been made. Renault is next on the block, but its privatisation will only be partial and unlikely to bring more than FFr12bn into state coffers. Assurances Generales de France is due to follow, but there is short-term weakness in the insurance sector. Groupe Bull - possibly third in line for sale - faces longer-term difficulties in the computer sector. At any event, the government made no bones this week about its intention to use FFr20bn of the FFr55bn in capital receipts to help plug the gap in its budget next year. As a result Mr Sarkozy's reduction in the budget deficit from FFr301bn this year to FFr275bn next looks for the most part like an honest cut. It needs to be. For the Maastricht timetable clock is ticking louder than ever for France. Mr Balladur is not exactly passionate about eventual monetary union, but he likes to see himself and be seen as a man who likes to take a long-term view. Right at the start of his government in April 1993 - before he could begin to hope the opinion polls would lift him to his current position of 'presidentiable' - he laid out a five-year programme for France to scrape in under the Maastricht wire by 1997. Now that he has a reasonable hope of being in the Elysee at that time, he at least wants France to be in a position of strength to bargain with Germany on the terms of any currency union. He also thinks he knows with whom, and over what, he might be bargaining. Germany's Christian Democrats, favourites to win next month's election, have come out in favour of a 'hard core' with France within the European Union. Paris is haunted by fears of falling behind in the long Maastricht march. As Mr Sarkozy said this week, 'all our partners are committed to a policy of deficit reduction . . . and to think that France alone could dispense with such an effort would be a grave error'. The government is particularly impressed with the current signs that Germany is finally getting a grip on its deficits. Maastricht requires that the total of all public sector deficits - on the budgets of regional governments and quasi-state bodies as well central government - should equal 3 per cent of gross domestic product or less. On this week's plans, France's central budget deficit should fall from 4.1 per cent of GDP this year to 3.6 per cent next, but its overall public sector deficit will next year be no lower than 4.6 per cent of GDP. Most EU countries have a problem here. But France has two particular difficulties in closing the spending gap outside its central budget. The first is that, in contrast to other EU countries except Belgium, it is still in the process of devolving more power and money to its regions. Paris is thus ill-placed to lay the heavy hand of Maastricht on its regions - though an indirect start was made this week with the government's decision to reduce the subsidy it pays companies on their local tax bills. The second, and far more important, difficulty is the expansion of off-budget welfare deficits. The French state is now increasingly assuming responsibility for these deficits, for two reasons. First, the deficits are now beyond the means of employers and unions whose payroll contributions have traditionally funded much of the French welfare system; the government took over FFr100bn worth of the welfare debt accumulated in 1991-93, and may have to do the same with this year's estimated deficit of nearly FFr60bn. Second, virtually everyone agrees in France that levying welfare charges on the workforce simply discourages employment, and that welfare costs should be progressively shifted more to the central budget and the general taxpayer. But views vary on the desirable pace of this shift. Those who think it particularly important that the deficit be reduced or contained are keen that it take place rapidly; those who see the former as less important would be content with a slower shift. This is where France's European policy and its impending presidential election come in. The European Parliament elections in June showed that France remains divided over Maastricht. To the alarm of the centre-right coalition government, 14 per cent of the vote went to the list led by Mr Philippe de Villiers, an anti-Maastricht conservative. That fact could further fuel the undeclared but now overt rivalry between Mr Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR gaullist party, for the presidency. Mr Chirac is not anti-Maastricht, but equivocal about it. In his quest to squash Mr Balladur's presidential pretentions, he may well cast about for the de Villiers vote. That would mean adopting a less rigorous approach to the Maastricht convergence criteria. The question is how he is to start marking out his policy differences on the issue with fellow-gaullist Mr Balladur, and when. He could start to do so in next month's budget debate. Mr Bernard de Froment, the RPR deputy who advises Mr Chirac on budgetary matters, rejects 'fetishism on balancing the budget' and the idea that 'employment levels can be fixed by the play of the market alone'. Many in the Chirac camp incline to the 'don't-just-stand-there-intervene' school of economics. However, for the moment, Mr Chirac is producing silence, not ideas. His muteness is in sharp contrast to Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, president of the government's other coalition party, the centrist UDF. The ex-president has thrust his oar into the debate with a series of detailed articles in Le Figaro, showing how welfare charges of up to 40 per cent levied even on the minimum wage of FFr6,010 a month negate any incentive by employers to hire low-skilled workers. He urged the government to make deep cuts in these welfare charges, to be offset by a temporary hike in value added tax. It is hard to read the plan as Mr Giscard d'Estaing's launch-pad to regain the Elysee next year. The Figaro articles are more like something penned by a young finance minister, as Mr Giscard d'Estaing was back in the early 1960s, than the vague generalities beloved of senior French politicians like the 68-year-old UDF leader now is. But the ex-president's intervention will give yet a further twist to the budget debate that will set the shape of the coming presidential contest. Mr Giscard d'Estaing is basically in the same camp as Mr Balladur, but he leads a different party, the UDF, and wants the prime minister to be more radical in allying job creation to budget rigour. Mr Chirac, by contrast, is of the same RPR party as Mr Balladur but sees a more fundamental contradiction in the prime minister's 'budget rigour plus jobs' approach. It is small wonder, therefore, that, despite the impression Mr Balladur was seeking to give this week of courageous constancy, the international markets believe French economic policy will take a political buffeting in the next eight months.</p>

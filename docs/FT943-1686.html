			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Third minister accused of corruption: Gaullist denies consultancy payments were for fictitious services as French allegations grow France's sports and youth minister, Mrs Michele Alliot-Marie, was yesterday reported to be under investigation for receiving payment from pharmaceutical companies while a member of the health ministry's drug approval committee in the 1980s. Le Parisien newspaper cited judicial sources claiming that pharmaceutical companies had paid money to a consultancy called Mediconseil which in turn paid Mrs Alliot-Marie for 'fictitious services'. The minister responded that she had been paid by Mediconseil for genuine work under a contract declared to the tax authorities, that she had ended this work on becoming a Euro-MP in 1989, and that she knew of no judicial investigation. Mrs Alliot-Marie is none the less the third French minister to attract allegations of corruption. The trade and industry minister, Mr Gerard Longuet, is awaiting the justice ministry's decision on whether to pursue allegations it received this week from a judge suggesting that he may have allowed a contractor to subsidise the building of his Riviera villa, and that he used money from other corporate sources to settle his construction bill. Mr Longuet said yesterday that he had no intention of resigning his powerful government post, even if he was put under formal judicial investigation, as is now the fate of Mr Alain Carignon. The latter asked in July to be 'suspended' from his job of communications minister in order to contest a case in Grenoble of which he is mayor. A judge is seeking to establish whether there is any link between a decision by Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French utility company, to bail out a pro-Carignon newspaper and the company's subsequent winning of the contract to manage Grenoble's water supply. Mr Longuet said he had asked for a formal 'judicial estimate' on the cost of his St Tropez villa. He said the affair had not put into question any of his roles as president of the Lorraine region, head of the Republican party, or as trade and industry minister, and he had no intention of resigning. As in the case of Mr Longuet, the allegations surrounding Mrs Alliot-Marie arise out of a separate investigation. A Nanterre judge had been investigating suspicions that a fellow RPR Gaullist of Mrs Alliot-Marie had been receiving payments from pharmaceutical drug companies when he sat on the same drug approval committee. The report on Mr Longuet came from a judge trying to trace a commission paid by a St Gobain subsidiary to a Republican party official in Nantes, in pursuit of a water pipe contract in the western French city. Yesterday Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who on taking office last year suggested that he would encourage ministers under a cloud to resign, held his first meeting with the three men he has appointed to look into ethical links between business and politics in France, and current legal practice in corruption investigations. The meeting was described as a first discussion of the precise remit of the commission, on which an eminent businessman, trade unionist and lawyer are to sit.</p>

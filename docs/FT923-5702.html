			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Bruiser Owen steps into the ring THE appointment of Lord Owen to replace the urbane Lord Carrington to head the European Community's Yugoslavia peace effort brings a more confrontational personality to the Yugoslav peace talks. Once leader of the former British Social Democratic party, his political reputation is as a bruiser and loner rather than a healer and mediator. The latest in a series of international jobs for former politicians, Lord Owen's appointment is surprising not only because of his political characteristics, but because of his outspoken views on policy towards the former Yugoslavia. Less than a month ago, in an open letter to Mr John Major, the British premier, he urged the United Nations to use the threat of force and airstrikes to stop the movement of armed forces within the former Yugoslav republic. That idea was slapped down by Mr Major, but Lord Owen's urging of closer co-operation between the UN and the European Community looks quite close to what has been emerging from the peace conference. This is not the first sign Mr Major has shown of the regard he has for the charismatic but abrasive former Labour foreign secretary who left office in 1979 but stood down as an MP only at the last election. Lord Owen received his life peerage in June with the prime minister's backing, since he lacked a party to put his name forward. That support had already been matched by Lord Owen's personal endorsement of the prime minister at the election. His career has fascinated Westminster, the British house of parliament, since his glamorous appointment in 1977 as the youngest UK foreign secretary since Sir Anthony Eden. He is now 54. As foreign secretary, his time was marked by strenuous efforts rather than dramatic successes, and his style was not to the taste of the foreign office mandarins. Rhodesia dominated his term of office: his relentless search for a solution earned him the nickname 'the flying doctor', but it fell to Lord Carrington, his Tory successor, to find the way through to Zimbabwean independence. After leaving the Labour party, he remained a dominant political figure for most of the 1980s as one of the 'gang of four' politicians setting up the new centrist Social Democratic Party. The SDP's failure to make a political breakthrough and Lord Owen's subsequent preference for the political wilderness rather than merger with the Liberal party were the milestones on his path from party politician to potential diplomat. Scarcely had he announced his intention to stand down as an MP when his name was being canvassed for a range of posts in international or public service, such as the governorship of Hong Kong. Former British foreign secretaries are a select class.</p>

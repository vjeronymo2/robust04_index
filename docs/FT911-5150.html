			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Southern Water in Pounds 55m loan facility Southern Water has arranged a Pounds 55m loan facility with the European Investment Bank, the second and final tranche of a Pounds 95m funding programme agreed in September last year. The 15-year facility will be used to finance Southern's capital expenditure programme, which currently absorbs around Pounds 3m a week. Many of the projects being funded are required under UK and European Community legislation. The interest rate will not be fixed until the funds are drawn down by Southern. The company pays a fixed 11 per cent interest on the initial Pounds 40m loan arranged last year. In common with many other UK water companies, Southern has opted to finance capital expenditure through the EIB rather than borrow from the capital markets in it's own name.</p>

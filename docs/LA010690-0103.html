			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES LASH ACLU OVER JAILS;  </P> <P> OVERCROWDING: RIGHTS GROUP ACCUSED OF 'PERVERSE' LEGAL CAMPAIGN IN EFFORT TO  SOLVE SITUATION IN L.A. COUNTY LOCKUPS.  </P> <P> Launching their strongest broadside in a continuing war of words with the ACLU  over jail overcrowding, Los Angeles County Superior Court judges have charged  the civil liberties organization with engaging in a "perverse and  insupportable" legal campaign that borders on "harassment."  </P> <P> The strong language is contained in a 17-page report sent this week to federal  Judge William P. Gray, who has presided over a decade-long series of lawsuits  filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California concerning  County Jail overcrowding.  </P> <P> In one of the suits, initially filed 15 months ago, the ACLU has taken the  101-judge group first to federal court and then to state appeals courts to  demand that the judges stop granting so many delays in criminal cases. The  delays, the ACLU says, have a direct impact on the horrific state of  overcrowding in the county's jails.  </P> <P> Last month, the state Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from the ACLU of  a state appellate court ruling refusing to order the Superior Court judges to  change their policies for granting continuances.  </P> <P> But the ACLU, in its own report to Gray, indicated that it will continue to  pursue the case through the state Superior Court system and, if need be later,  in federal court again.  </P> <P> The ACLU has contended that Superior Court judges are failing to follow a 1985  state law that requires them to hold formal hearings on requests for  continuances and to issue formal findings that trial delays are warranted only  when there is "good cause."  </P> <P> In an interview Friday, Superior Court Presiding Judge Richard P. Byrne said  the prime concern of his judges in granting delays is whether good reasons  exist.  </P> <P> "Writing it down is not as important as good cause itself," he said.  </P> <P> In their 17-page report, the Superior Court judges called "the ACLU's  continuing campaign against the Los Angeles Superior Court . . . perverse and  insupportable."  </P> <P> "The lack of any factual or legal support for the threat to 'reinstate' the  federal action suggests that any further litigation by the ACLU would be mere  harassment," continued the report, written on behalf of the judges by attorney  Richard Schauer.  </P> <P> Byrne said Friday that the report's language was blunt because, "you do arrive  at a point where you feel the issue has really been decided, and that's where  we are now."  </P> <P> Byrne suggested that the ACLU fight jail overcrowding by lobbying for more  judges and courtrooms, rather than by criticizing those already on the bench.  </P> <P> But ACLU attorney John Hagar countered in an interview Friday that stricter  adherence to the state law in granting continuances would result in "an  efficient court system which helps people accused of crimes and also the  victims of crimes."  </P> <P> Hagar added that the judges' tough language is "a note of desperation on their  part."  </P> <P> "They want to resolve this difficult public question through innuendoes and  threats. People shouldn't threaten the ACLU.  </P> <P> "We don't need 100 judges mad against us. . . . But I do believe we are right,"  he said.  </P> <P> Recent studies show that Superior Court judges are disposing of more cases than  ever, according to the judges' report. During the fiscal year that ended in  June, 1989, the court's criminal dispositions rose 15% above the previous  fiscal year.  </P> <P> However, criminal complaints also climbed 13.1% during the same period. Jail  overcrowding continues at an alarming rate.  </P> <P> During holiday periods, the population in the county's 10 jail facilities has  surged as much as 800 prisoners over the longstanding limit of 22,388 imposed  by Judge Gray. The state-rated capacity for the county's jails is only 13,464.  </P> <P> Since May, 1988, more than 100,000 convicted misdemeanor inmates have been  released anywhere from 15 to 37 days early in order to ease the overcrowding.  </P> <P> But efforts to build new jail space near downtown Los Angeles have met  neighborhood resistance. In addition, a new 2,800-prisoner, high-tech jail  complex near Castaic, which was due to open last spring, remains unopen because  the toilets will not flush and the security doors will not shut properly.  </P></p>

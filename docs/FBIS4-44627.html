This array, shown  schematically in Figure 1 below, integrates three directional  couplers on a LiNbO[.sub]3[/] substrate. The directional  couplers employ a step _D__b_ modulation method; directional  coupler gap is 5 m, waveguide width is 7 m, and  interaction length L is 7mm. The input and output waveguides  require butt splicing with a 1.3-m single-mode fiber;  spacing  P between the input and output waveguides should exceed 125  m, with 150 m chosen as the design value. Circular arc  radius R is greater than or equal to 40mm, circular arc  waveguide length L[.sub]R[/] is 4mm, bend-angle straight  waveguide length L[.sub]S[/] is 3mm, device overall length is  less than 3 cm, and bend angle _th_ is 0.5 degree. Ti film  thickness is 600 angstroms, and diffusion conditions are  1050 C for 7 hours.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-18A>      Figure 1. Practical Structure for 1x4 Optical Switch Array. </FIG>     Device fabrication process is as follows: z-cut  LiNbO[.sub]3[/] crystal surface sputtering of Ti film,  etching of Ti lines, diffusion in high-temperature wet argon and  wet oxygen gases to form the waveguides, waveguide surface  deposition of SiO[.sub]2[/] film, end-face collimation and  polishing, clear testing, evaporation of Al film, electrode  alignment, ultrasonic pressure welding of electrode leads,  fiber-optic waveguide butt splicing in a V-groove, and  performance testing. Measured performance parameters are:  device insertion loss = -7 dB to -9 dB, crosstalk = approx. -20  dB, switch response time is less than 1.4 ns, switch drive  voltage = 15-20 V. The TDM analysis for the entire switching  array is shown in Figure 2 below (in which SW refers to  directional coupler). There are no tables.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-18B>      Figure 2.

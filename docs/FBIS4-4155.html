			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Nineteen Chinese  universities and institutes were awarded 25 scientific research  grants today, which were provided under the Ford China Research  and Development Fund.    About 40 percent of the projects are categorized as  fundamental or basic research, and all of them will be supported  for a period of up to three years.    The research areas to be funded include new and improved  materials, manufacturing technology, advanced automotive  components, computer science and engineering and automotive  technology.    The 1.6 million U.S. dollar fund was set up last October by  the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the  Ford Company of the United States.    A technical advisory committee with representatives from  both  the Chinese and U.S. sides made the final selection from more  than 90 grant proposals received since the program was created.    "The establishment of the fund opens a new chapter in  China's  cooperation with foreign corporations in fundamental research,"  said Song Jian, State Councillor and minister of the State  Science and Technology Commission, at the presentation ceremony  held at the Great Hall of the People today. "China appreciates  Ford's decision to sponsor this form of cooperation."    He described the cooperation between Ford and NSFC as a very  meaningful one.    Ford has contributed 800,000 U.S. dollars for the project,  and the NSFC provided an in-kind contribution of equivalent  value.    James Paulsen, president of Ford China Operations, called  the  project an excellent example of cooperation between U.S. and  Chinese interests, and China, Ford and the worldwide scientific  community would all benefit from these projects.</p>

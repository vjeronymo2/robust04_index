			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Pharmacia offer will generate SKr9.4bn The Swedish government said yesterday its offer of a 47.4 per cent voting stake in Pharmacia, one of the world's top 20 pharmaceutical groups, had been heavily oversubscribed and would raise a total of SKr9.4bn (Dollars 1.2bn). It expected to meet its target of selling a maximum of 82.2m shares after giving underwriters the chance to allocate an additional 10.2m shares to institutions. Institutions will pay SKr120 per share, and the Swedish public SKr110 per share. The institutional price is SKr1 lower than Pharmacia's closing price on Thursday but SKr5 lower than the average price during the subscription period. A total of 47.5m shares will be allocated to Swedish retail investors, and 34.7m to institutions. Non-Swedish institutions will take 70 per cent of the institutional tranche, increasing foreign ownership in the group to 11.5 per cent from 2 per cent. Mr Per Westerberg, Swedish industry minister, said the privatisation had been a success in spite of bond and equity market turbulence during the subscription period. He added that the institutional offer had been 2.5 times oversubscribed and the public offer 1.8 times. The state retains 10.1 per cent of Pharmacia's votes, making it the second largest shareholder after Volvo, the vehicle group, with 28 per cent. Volvo wants to sell its stake but has agreed not to do so before 1996. Pharmacia was the biggest single sale in a privatisation programme which has raised SKr23bn since it was unveiled by the centre-right government in 1991. The government has promised more privatisations if it wins the September general election, including Nordbanken, Telia, the telecommunications group, and Vattenfall, the power group. The Social Democrats, who are favoured to win the election, have ruled out sales of Telia or Vattenfall.</p>

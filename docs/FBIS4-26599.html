			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Feng Xiuju (7458 4423 5468)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 23 Jun (XINHUA) -- During his meeting with  a delegation of the Association for Hong Kong's Former  High-Ranking Public Functionaries in Beijing this afternoon,  Vice Premier Qian Qichen said it is extremely important to have  a stable contingent of public functionaries during Hong Kong's  transition period. The delegation was led by Chen Naiqiang,  Hong Kong's former secretary for lands and works.    Qian Qichen said: Public functionaries are essential in  administrative operation. It is necessary to depend on public  functionaries to ensure smooth take-over of sovereignty, stable  transition, and the management of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region after 1997.    He continued: The Sino-British Joint Statement and the Basic  Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have specific  regulations concerning the continuing service of public  functionaries. The purpose of these regulations is to maintain  the stability of the rank-and-file of public functionaries.    Qian Qichen said: "The delegation's visit to Beijing is of  great significance. We support your setting up the Association  for Hong Kong's Former High-Ranking Public Functionaries."    He said: After Hong Kong returns to the motherland, those  public functionaries who would like to stay and serve the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region and its residents are indeed  patriotic people who love Hong Kong.    Qian Qichen expressed the hope that the contingent of public  functionaries in Hong Kong will honestly perform their duties  and serve the Hong Kong residents in the last few years of the  transition period.    Qian Qichen emphatically said: As a financial, economic, and  information center, Hong Kong is an economic-type city. It  should focus on its administration and ensure high efficiency in  its administrative management.    Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office,  was present during the meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Jian (6392 0256): "Chen Ziying Says All </F> Hong Kong Residents' Legitimate Rights and Interests Should Be  Protected"]    [Text] Beijing, 19 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chen Ziying,  deputy director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office, said here today: All Hong Kong residents' legitimate  rights and interests should be protected.    Chen Ziying made the above remarks when meeting with a  delegation of British overseas Chinese community leaders led by  Chiu Tien, chairman of the London Chinese Community Neighborhood  Association.    Their ancestors came from Hong Kong's New Territories, and  Chiu Tien and his party are very much concerned about Hong  Kong's smooth transition.    Responding to the guests' worries, Chen Ziying said: Hong  Kong's stability and prosperity is the most important concern  during the transition period. After 1997, we will handle things  in strict accordance with the Hong Kong Basic Law. He stressed:  The principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong  people ruling Hong Kong" will never be changed.    Chiu Tien and his party visited China at the invitation of  the National People's Congress Overseas Chinese Affairs  Committee. Some other noted figures in the overseas Chinese  community in Britain also came, including Chen Chin-yu, Shan  Sheng, Wen Liang-sheng, Huang Jung-fu, and Teng Han-sheng.  Tomorrow, they will go to Sichuan to get an understanding of  the investment environment there.</p>

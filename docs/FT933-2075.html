			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Technology: Prints charming - Paper, long the Cinderella of the high-tech office, is to go to the ball after all The 'paperless office' promised by computers has become a joke. Yet Xerox, best known as a manufacturer of copiers that add to the deluge of documents, aims to have the last laugh. Rather than eliminating paper, Xerox has developed technology that incorporates computer instructions into paper documents in an almost invisible format. Known as Glyph, it promises to bridge the gap between computerised office systems and paper documents and could change the way paper documents are treated. Usable Glyph technology became available in a limited form last year in a product called PaperWorks. The United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) is using it to keep in contact with far-flung staff around the world. Working in remote and often primitive locations presents Unicef staff with a communications problem. Power-supply difficulties make it not worth their while having portable computers, which are anyway expensive, and there is often an inconvenient time-difference with headquarters in New York. With PaperWorks software installed on an IBM or compatible PC at headquarters, Unicef staff who come across a fax machine can send a special Glyph-encoded form to the fax-card in the PC. By marking up the form with a pen or pencil, they can indicate what they want done from a number of possible options. Once the computer receives the form, it carries out the instructions. These may be to retrieve any messages addressed to the caller or look up and transmit data to the caller, or to route documents to other PCs. If the field-workers do not have a Glyph form with them already, they can obtain one by faxing a blank sheet of paper to the PC. Unicef says that the system works well and plans to extend its use. After filing a series of patents protecting the Glyph technology, Xerox has lifted a veil of secrecy and says it will soon announce licensing deals with software firms, office equipment manufacturers and large corporations which are struggling to manage paper document mountains. 'The question is not whether we will do away with paper but how to find the best way to integrate it into the office,' says Paul Ricci, president of Xerox Advanced Office Document Services. Ricci explains: 'There is a serious productivity issue in the office and paper is largely disjoined from the electronic world. Xerox, with its focus on documents, has been seeking ways to bridge the two worlds.' Glyph technology was developed over a four-year period by the Xerox Palo Alto Research Centre (Parc). This is the institution that pioneered most of current desktop technology such as PC graphical user interfaces, laser printers, Ethernet networking and object-oriented software. Glyph uses tiny diagonal marks on paper arranged in lines within a rectangle, rather like a miniature barcode. In documents produced for use by the scanners in conventional fax machines, which work at lower resolutions, they can clearly be seen but are unobtrusive. In documents that can be scanned at higher resolutions, the diagonal marks look like a uniform grey field which can be incorporated within a logo or other image, so that readers will not find them ugly or distracting. Yet even these 'hidden' marks can be read by specially equipped fax machines, scanners and computers and then translated into computer instructions. Glyph technology could revolutionise paper use, says Paul Saffo, research fellow at the California-based technology think-tank Institute for the Future. 'The problem with paper is that once you print a document, its information is like a fly trapped in amber. With Glyph technology, it becomes a two-way trip. It can also help with problems in managing huge amounts of information, since you can embed hypertext connections that link the paper document with related information in large databases.' A printout of a spreadsheet to be used in a presentation could have formulae embedded in it. If the client then wanted to see how the figures looked on different growth and inflation assumptions, the page could be scanned in to a PC and the data manipulated on the spot. However, Saffo cautions, the large number of potential applications for Glyph, and its versatility, may make it difficult to market. 'With foundational technology such as Glyph, it's difficult for us to imagine all the ways it can be used, because it can be applied in so many ways.' Xerox will shortly introduce a software development kit that will allow business applications to access Glyph technology. But to fully realise Xerox's vision of 'smart paper', computer and office equipment manufacturers will have to add Glyph-recognition capabilities. This will require improvements in fax scanner technology and it may take two years before such products are available. Ricci says that Xerox is offering attractive licensing deals to help establish Glyph as an industry standard, which will help keep down the price of Glyph-compatible equipment. In the meantime, Xerox will integrate Glyph technology into its products. Software giant Microsoft is interested in using Glyph as a key part of its 'Microsoft at Work' concept that was announced in early June. Microsoft At Work will consist of software and hardware that will link office equipment such as fax machines and copiers to computer networks. Xerox is developing a multi-function device combining fax, photocopier and scanner, and integrating Glyph technology and the Microsoft at Work architecture. The device is to be introduced in 1994. Xerox envisages a wide range of applications for Glyph and is talking to several big companies. Ricci declined to go into detail, but mentioned that one key application being discussed is using Glyph technology in credit cards to help improve security and cut down on fraud. Xerox is also developing sophisticated optical recognition technologies that use artificial intelligence to understand printed words and distinguish image areas. With these technologies, Xerox's goal is to rescue paper from its derided role as voluminous by-product of the digital world and give it a starring role instead.</p>

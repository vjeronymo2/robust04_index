			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A traveller's tax allowance My daughter is spending a year travelling and plans to return on April 9, 1994. Her only income is from renting out her flat, and a small amount of dividend income and building society interest. Does she qualify for her personal allowance to set against her income in 1993/4? Would it make any difference if she returned before April 5, 1994? Every Commonwealth citizen is entitled to a personal allowance, regardless of whether they are resident in the UK, by virtue of section 278(2) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, as amended. You may like to ask your tax office for the pamphlets IR20 (Residents and non-residents: liability to tax in the UK) and IR87 (Rooms to let: income from letting property). Even if your daughter is not a Commonwealth citizen, she may still be entitled to a personal allowance for 1993-94 on some other grounds. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

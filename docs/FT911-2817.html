			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / How To Spend It: Fine art for the hard-pressed AS THE recession deepens and times get harder the art world gets friendlier and friendlier. This week another exceptionally user-friendly art gallery - The Art Collection - opened in London, aiming to tap into that huge market that has hundreds rather than thousands of pounds to spend. But whereas most user-friendly galleries sell the work of living contemporary artists, The Art Collection has spotted a niche for those who want nice quality decorative art of all periods. As Piers Watson, one of the founder/directors, put it: 'We want to be the Waterstone's of the art world. We will stay open until 7.30 three nights a week and hope that people will drop in on a fairly regular basis to check on what we have.' He and his partner, Nicholas Hely-Hutchinson, both refugees from the City who at last have been able to turn to their first loves, pictures, have started up under a Business Expansion Scheme and firmly believe that there is a market for the sort of pictures they have to sell. 'Nothing in the gallery will be over Pounds 1,250 and we aim to make sure that at least two-thirds will be less than Pounds 400. All will be nicely framed. We are not marketing it as investment art - we aim to sell an eclectic selection of nice pictures that are good value. We won't be specialising exclusively in any particular medium or period but hope to have a complete range from Old Master drawings to Victorian watercolours. Eventually we will also have a small collection of contemporary work as well.' The partners have found it a good time to be buying - 'Though we think the selection is possibly less large than in boom times, we are finding that in our price range we can buy things that we wouldn't have been able to afford a year ago. We are getting better value for our money.' The gallery is at 3 - 5 Elystan Street, London SW3 3NT and is open from 9.30 am six days a week, closing at 6 pm on Mondays and Fridays, at 1.30 pm on Saturdays and at 7.30 on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.</p>

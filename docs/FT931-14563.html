			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Virgin to press Heathrow case today THE GOVERNMENT will today respond sympathetically to Virgin Atlantic's demands for slots at Heathrow airport but will underline its determination not to become embroiled in the airline's battle with British Airways. Mr Richard Branson, Virgin chairman, will meet Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, tonight to press his case for access to Heathrow after his victory earlier this month in a libel battle with BA. Mr Branson is expected to call for a review of the way slots - take-off and landing rights - are allocated and for the creation of a regulatory body for airlines. Virgin renewed its warning yesterday that it was ready for action against BA in US courts unless its rival came up with an act of 'good faith' to demonstrate that it had changed its attitude to competition. Lawyers for Virgin are examining different types of possible legal action unless BA makes a 'concession'. These include anti-trust action in the US, action under European Community competition laws, or even prosecution in the UK of BA staff alleged to have hacked into Virgin's computers. Mr MacGregor is expected to tell Mr Branson that he cannot interfere with EC rules by which BA slots at Heathrow are protected as long as an airline is using them. But the transport secretary is expected to point out that large-scale investment over the next few years, including the construction of a new Pounds 300m traffic-control centre, will pave the way for new slots to be created at the London airport. Virgin would be a front-runner in competition for such slots. Ministers are deeply conscious of the political dangers of the government becoming embroiled in the Virgin-BA row. But they are aware also that Mr Branson's hopes of expanding his fleet depends on access to Heathrow. Virgin's aim is to increase its fleet from eight to between 16 and 18 aircraft, operating to the world's 12 largest cities, by 1995. Virgin acknowledged yesterday that the gesture it sought from BA to drop the threat of legal action did not necessarily involve the surrender of Heathrow slots. It said it wanted a 'change of attitude'. The results of an internal investigation of BA activities at the heart of Mr Branson's recent libel action will be discussed at a BA directors' meeting on Friday, the airline said yesterday. It said the results were not expected to put 'further pressure' on Sir John King, chairman, or Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive.</p>

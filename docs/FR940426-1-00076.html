			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 209 of the Act generally preempts States from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing new motor vehicle emissions standards, leaving such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation to EPA under section 202 of the Act. Section 209  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does, however, provide an exception for California to adopt new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motor vehicle emissions standards where the Administrator grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a preemption waiver based on a finding that California's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards will be, ``in the aggregate, at least as protective of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health and welfare as applicable Federal standards.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, under section 177 of the Act, any State which has SIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions approved under part D of title I may adopt and enforce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new motor vehicle emission standards for any model year if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Such standards are identical to the California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for which a waiver has been granted for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model year, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) California and such State adopt such standards at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two years before commencement of such model year (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by regulations of the Administrator).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has granted a waiver for California's ``Low Emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vehicle'' program ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  58 FR 4166 (Jan. 13, 1993)(announcing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of Waiver of Federal Preemption; California Low-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emission Vehicle Standards (Jan. 8, 1993)). This program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally calls for five categories of vehicles meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> progressively more stringent emissions standards: California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier I vehicles; Transitional Low Emission Vehicles (TLEV); Low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emission Vehicles (LEV); Ultra-Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV). California has also established an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall non-methane organic gas (NMOG) standard that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer must meet for its fleet of new vehicles in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular model year by selling any combination of vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified by California as meeting standards for one of the five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories. In addition, under California's program, at least 2%  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of each manufacturers' new vehicle fleet sold in California must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be ZEV's by 1998, and 10% by 2003. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In EPA's waiver decision regarding California's LEV program, the EPA Administrator stated, ``Based on EPA's review of this record, I find reasonable and so adopt California's finding that there is adequate leadtime to permit the development of technology necessary to meet those standards giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within the required time frame.'' Waiver of Federal Preemption; California Low-Emission Vehicle Standards at 69 (Jan. 8, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At its second meeting on July 16, 1991, the OTC adopted a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in which the State and District  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Columbia representatives agreed that, in view of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant contribution of motor vehicles to the Northeast ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problem, they all support California's Motor Vehicle Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program, and call on their jurisdictions to cooperatively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate the feasibility, air quality benefits, and associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs of this Program in the OTR. At its third meeting on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 29, 1991, the OTC States agreed to a further MOU  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing that each OTC state would take steps to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California's Low Emission Vehicle program as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New York and Massachusetts are the only States that have fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted the California LEV program in legislation and regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without contingencies, and both States are set to implement their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The automobile manufacturers' have challenged the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legality of both programs and both lawsuits are ongoing. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States have adopted or are adopting the program contingent on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regional program adoption, and the remaining States are at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various stages of the legislative or regulatory process to adopt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In August 1993, Maine, Maryland, and Massachusetts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioned the OTC to adopt a recommendation calling for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of the California LEV program throughout the OTR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the fall of 1993, the OTC held a number of public forums  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in various locations in the Northeast, and held a public hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Hartford, Connecticut on December 16&hyph;17, 1993. Finally, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its winter meeting on February 1, 1994 in Washington, D.C., the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OTC voted by a 9 to 4 majority to recommend that EPA mandate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California LEV program throughout the OTR. (The OTC refers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the program they recommend as ``OTC LEV.'') New Hampshire,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Virginia, Delaware, and New Jersey voted against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation. The OTC's recommendation contains the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The OTC LEV program would be applicable to all 1999 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent model year passenger cars and light duty trucks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the OTR;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Subject to certain very limited exceptions, all vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sold, imported, delivered, purchased, leased, rented,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquired, received, or registered in the OTR that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the OTC LEV program must be certified pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a California Air Resources Board (CARB) Executive Order;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The OTC LEV program would allow the sale of the five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories of California vehicles: California Tier I, TLEV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LEV, ULEV, and ZEV;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Manufacturers could choose any combination of California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified vehicles to meet average NMOG fleet emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards in the OTR as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

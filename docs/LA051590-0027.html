			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> GLORIOUS WILTERN FINALE FOR ALVIN AILEY COMPANY  </P> <P> The final Alvin Ailey program of the season at the Wiltern Theatre Sunday  afternoon was one of those occasions when just about everything seemed glorious  -- the dancing, the choreography, even the die-hard fervor of the audience.  </P> <P> Donald McKayle's "Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder" was performed with an urgency  that belied its 31 years. Its simple strength derives from stark movements set  to the compelling rhythmic pulse of folk songs arranged by Robert de Cormier  and Milton Okun.  </P> <P> Five men on a chain gang twist their bodies at the same pained angle, tense  their necks and clasp their hands behind their back. The same clasping gesture  performed by a jigging boy (Aubrey Lynch II) who goes courting becomes the  hallmark of eager shyness. His life as a free man is a counterpoint to the  unison moves of the prisoners.  </P> <P> As the boy grown to manhood, Desmond Richardson was a driven figure in the duet  with his wife (Elizabeth Roxas), who comforts him when -- obsessed by inner  demons -- his gaze curdles and his arms flail. But free black men are not long  for this world, and death comes in a gunshot.  </P> <P> The company also imbued the signature reach-and-grasp movements and the  whiplash turns in excerpts from Ailey's "Blues Suite" with a suave and frisky  good humor. The 1958 piece, to traditional songs, is about how people survive  through a complex network of social interactions, a favorite Ailey theme.  </P> <P> Marilyn Banks as the proud and bitter woman and Gary DeLoatch as the swaggering  guy who knows how to prey on weakness offered superb timing and emotional  presence in the down-and-dirty "Backwater Blues" section.  </P> <P> The only major disappointment in a program that also included Ailey's  "Revelations" (previously reviewed) was Renee Robinson in Ailey's "Cry."  Robinson has the moves down, especially the cut-loose flamboyance of the final  section, but she doesn't convey the suffering and surviving that are also  integral to the role. CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

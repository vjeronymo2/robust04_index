The  first three months of the year are often sluggish after the holiday season.  </P> <P> Economists were expecting a modest gain in productivity, which gauges the  output per hour of all workers.  </P> <P> The figure is considered of long-term importance for the nation to reduce its  trade deficit, because American firms must produce more at lower costs to boost  efficiency and lower prices.  </P> <P> "It is negative for the trade deficit because productivity weakness means we  lose out in competitive terms internationally," said Michael Englund, economist  at MMS International Inc.  </P> <P> Manufacturing productivity, frequently stronger than overall results, rose a  brisk 4.1%, exceeding its 3.1% fourth-quarter gain.  </P> <P> PRODUCTIVITY  </P> <P> Non-farm business productivity, percent change from previous quarter,  seasonally adjusted annual rate.  </P> <P> First quarter 1990: -1.0%  </P></p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Germans ensure even the bad times are good THE state may be going broke, industry may be flat on its back, but the west German citizen is still doing very nicely, thank you (see charts above). The average family has financial reserves worth some DM110,000 (Pounds 44,700) and has no debt troubles, according to a Bundesbank study of post-war household wealth in Germany, published today in its October monthly report. Including houses, other property and consumer durables, net personal assets in the region totalled well over DM8,000bn at the end of last year. This national nest-egg has grown more than 50 per cent faster than disposable incomes in the past 20 years, and in the meantime real per capita growth in economic output has exceeded the European Community average by a third. The implied message in this brief history of good times past - published as the national debate on the future of Germany's economic and social system comes to a head - is that the population can tolerate belt-tightening by government and industry without too much grief. More explicit is a warning to east Germans that getting rich requires hard work. Wealth creation in the former GDR has advanced relatively quickly, the report says. But 'further progress along this road cannot be expected from west German transfers . . . it will depend far more on increased production and incomes.' Three years after unification, and thanks largely to hand-outs from Bonn totalling around DM180bn this year alone, almost two-thirds of households in the east already have at least one car, compared with 73 per cent in the west; the place is saturated with television sets, and 90 per cent of homes have a washing machine, the report says. Since unification, and despite the shopping extravaganza which followed, private financial reserves in the former communist command economy have grown a third to an average DM30,000 per household. Disposable incomes have increased a real 17 per cent, although they are still only 55 per cent of western levels. As the growth in their private capital base demonstrates, despite their relative poverty, easterners share that great German virtue - thrift - with westerners. They save around 13 per cent of their disposable income, compared with 14 per cent in the west, and they keep almost 80 per cent of their funds in banks and building societies. Westerners, on the other hand, spread their piles more widely. Around 30 per cent of their funds are locked up in pensions and life insurance schemes. A further quarter is invested in securities, but since caution is the watchword, most of that is in bonds or similar instruments. Only a token DM128bn - or 4 per cent of total private capital assets - is at the mercy of the the stock market. According to Bundesbank estimates, annual dividends and interest earnings of DM173bn, account for 8.5 per cent of total west German private incomes. Bricks and mortar have gained popularity only slowly. The rate of home ownership in west Germany has increased from 38 per cent to around 50 per cent in the past 30 years, but still lags behind other EC countries and the US. Although home loans account for three-quarters of total private debt of DM1,215bn in the west, high land and construction prices discourage would- be buyers, the report says.</p>

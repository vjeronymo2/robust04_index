			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAPANESE WOMEN'S PAPER SOFT ON FEMINISM  </P> <P> With a shocking-pink picture of Tokyo's skyline gracing its front page, Japan's  first newspaper designed for women -- Lady Kong -- hit the newsstands today  with lots of fluff but little feminism.  </P> <P> As with virtually all enterprises here, men run the daily tabloid, leading some  critics to complain that the publication is not likely to challenge the  subservient role of women in Japanese society.  </P> <P> "Everything, even sanitary napkins, has been planned and produced by men," said  Harueko Kato, a communications professor at Tokyo Women's Christian University.  "And news coverage is not an exception."  </P> <P> The tabloid's name refers to King Kong's girlfriend. The name apparently is  meant to show that women are strong, too.  </P> <P> Kato believes that the most important aspect of the new daily newspaper will be  "how the opinions of the female employees are reflected in the decision-making  and news writing."  </P> <P> That will depend to a large extent on Masahiro Oshima, the 41-year-old man who  is the tabloid's editorial director.  </P> <P> Twenty-seven of the 47 editors and reporters on his staff are women, but they  are in charge of only the entertainment and city guide sections.  </P> <P> The company specifically recruited male writers to work in the news department,  Oshima explained, "to give news stories a serious tone."  </P> <P> Despite the radical image the tabloid is cultivating with its odd name and its  advertisements suggesting greater independence for women, there appears to be  little emphasis on feminism and social issues.  </P> <P> The leading headline on the splashy front page was a call for Tokyo's commuter  trains to extend operations a few hours each night to 2 a.m. for the benefit of  people who stay out late drinking and dancing.  </P> <P> The rest of the 80-cent newspaper, which describes itself in English as a  "newsy tabloid for Tokyoites," reads like a typical fashion magazine with a few  pages of news slapped onto the front.  </P> <P> The first edition included a series of interviews with female business  executives, as well as a soft-porn story titled "Honest Legs," gossip items and  entertainment news.  </P> <P> Oshima says he had wanted to carry more features on social issues but that a  six-month marketing research program led him to reduce stories on politics,  business, women's issues and the environment.  </P> <P> "Japanese women are not ready for such a progressive paper. . . . I was quite  disappointed to discover that," he said in a recent interview.  </P></p>

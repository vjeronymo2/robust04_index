			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 4 (AFP) -- Shanghai dissident Bao Ge  defied the authorities on Saturday, fifth anniversary of the  Tiananmen Square massacre, asking for official permission to set  up a human rights organization, one of his friends said. The  activist wrote to the ministry of civil affairs to formally  register the group, which already has 167 members in several  provinces, the friend, a lawyer, said by telephone. His  application, he said, was filed Saturday -- the fifth  anniversary of the crushing of the pro-democracy movement in  1989.    It was the second such protest to mark the crackdown, which  according to official count claimed 300 lives. Human rights  organisations and independent observers say the true toll was  several thousand, and estimate that several hundred  demonstrators remain behind bars. In Beijing, a dissident  teacher, Ding Zilin, and her husband began a 48-hour hunger  strike on Thursday to protest at weeks-long police harassment.  The couple's 17-year-old son was killed in 1989.    Bao, 31, has been under round-the-clock police surveillance  since early May. At least five other dissidents have been  detained by the Shanghai authorities, and they, like Bao, have  had their phones cut off.    Police have thrown a security net around Beijing, especially  in Tiananmen Square and the university district, which was a  hotbed of unrest in 1989, in order to forestall any show of  discontent on the anniversary.    Prominent dissidents in the capital who have not been  rounded  up have been told to leave the city until the anniversary is  over.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MAINE ISLAND NAMED FOR BUSH  </P> <P> President Bush has a place in history. Now he's on the map. A small island near  his vacation home has been named in his honor.  </P> <P> President Bush Island, four uninhabited acres of ledge, rocks and woods, is  located along a route often traveled by Bush when he is boating and fishing  during his vacations in Maine.  </P> <P> The island, formerly Green Island, was named for Bush by a couple who have  known Bush and his family for years.  </P> <P> "My father and his grandfather were good friends," Elizabeth Milligan said  Tuesday from her winter home in Florida. "Our families have known each other  for a long time, and we just thought it would be nice to have something in  Kennebunkport named after the President."  </P></p>

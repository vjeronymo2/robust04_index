Paparella: "INA Is Building in Vladivostok"] </F>   [Text] Zagreb--At a ceremony held on Monday [31 January] in  the offices of the INA enterprise, Franjo Greguric, general  director of the company, signed a $130-million agreement with  Nikolaj M. Shubenichev, general director of the Far Eastern  Petroleum Company of Vladivostok, on the construction of berths  for tankers at Kamchatka and facilities at the oil pipeline  terminal for loading oil into the tankers.    The "turnkey" agreement calls for the construction of an  ecologically acceptable terminal with a total annual loading  capacity of 4.2 million metric tons of oil derivatives with an  accompanying reservoir area of 300,000 cubic meters over a  period of 30 months. INA is responsible for the organization and  the oversight of the work, and Montmontaza of Zagreb, tasked  with carrying out projects in which over 500 workers will  participate, is the most important of numerous Croatian  subcontractors. The signing of the contract was a great success  because of strong international competition. INA won the  contract on the basis of the good quality of the projects it has  carried out in Russia to date.</p>

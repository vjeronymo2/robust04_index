			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Fujita hit by weak Tokyo property sector Fujita Corporation, a second-tier Japanese construction company, yesterday reported pre-tax profits down 44 per cent to Y18.77bn (Dollars 179m) for the year ended March. The company said the downturn reflected the poor state of the domestic property market. Fujita is particularly exposed to the badly-hit Tokyo property market. Fujita warned it would cut its dividend in the current year to Y7.5 per share from Y10. Group turnover fell 14.4 per cent to Y727bn, while post-tax profits tumbled 39 per cent to Y8.6bn. Earnings per share declined to Y17.46 from Y28.54. The group said it expected construction orders to remain slow during the current year.</p>

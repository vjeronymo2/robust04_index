			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 5 (ATA) -- Albanian Foreign Minister  Alfred Serreqi said in an interview with RILINDJA newspaper  right after his talks with the Greek Foreign Minister Carolos  Papoulias in Zurich, that "the meeting was held in order to  overcome the grave situation in the Greek-Albanian relations  whose climax was the April 10 tragic event." Mr. Serreqi said  that "the Albanian party in the meeting asked further  explanations about the incident.    "Not even indirectly did the Greek party accept to take the  responsibility that its citizens or nationals had carried out  the terrorist act against the Albanian recruiters' centre. It  also did not accept that possible investigation into the case be  carried out by an international commission, although it offered  a bilateral cooperation about the event," Mr. Serreqi said.    Asked about the coming development of the relations between  Albania and Greece, Mr. Serreqi said that "we requested from  Greece to observe our sovereignty, not to interfere in  Albania's home affairs." Greece admitted that in the future it  will try to stop religious and other propaganda which is now  going on about North Epirus. "I may say that this was the  greatest success of the meeting," Mr. Serreqi underlined.    "As regards relations between Albania and Greece, Greece  reaffirmed that it considers normal relations with Albania as  very significant. For this reason efforts were made to create a  normal climate in the relations between the two countries. That  is, the dialogue remains open," Mr. Serreqi explained.    Asked about the state of the Albanian economic emigration to  Greece, Serreqi said that: "We showed interest in determining a  legal status for the Albanian economic emigrants in Greece. The  official Athens is for the approval of this status but on  several conditions. One must realise that this was the first  meeting after the incident and as such, it was very difficult."    Concerning the fact that Greece is now presiding the  European  Union, the Albanian foreign minister said that "Greece is the  only Balkan country in the European Union, and it will preside  it until the end of July." "This fact," Mr. Serreqi said,  "would facilitate the relations between Albania and Greece and  even broader in the Balkans, but, heretofore, it did not happen  so."</p>

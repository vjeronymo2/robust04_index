			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Ford pays up to Dollars 6bn in rebates FORD Motor of the US paid out Dollars 5bn to Dollars 6bn in consumer and dealer rebates last year, up from Dollars 4bn in 1990, said Mr Allan Gilmour, head of Ford's worldwide auto operation, AP-DJ reports. In 1991, Ford paid out 16 per cent of its revenues in marketing costs, including rebates, as well as advertising and promotional costs, said Mr Gilmour, an executive vice-president at Ford. Before the heavy incentives in recent years, Ford's marketing costs usually ran at about 5 per cent to 6 per cent of revenues, he said. The situation is even worse in Britain, where Ford paid out 20 per cent of its revenues in marketing costs last year.</p>

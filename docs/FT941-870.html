			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Resort Hotels' listing under threat Resort Hotels, the troubled hotel group, has four days to conclude a restructuring involving new management and a debt for equity swap, or a takeover by an existing hotel group, if it is to keep its listing, writes Simon Davies. Resort's told shareholders in a letter this weekend that the Stock Exchange had warned it would be delisted if restructuring proposals were not submitted by March 31. It was also revealed this weekend that the Serious Fraud Office was investigating matters relating to past management of the hotels group. The letter follows Resort's long-delayed results for the year to April 1993, showing pre-tax losses of Pounds 71m. Mr David Tonkinson, chairman, said Resort's bankers and stockholders were supportive pending talks 'with other parties'. The letter gives details on Resort's share suspension in July 1993, and the resignation this month of Mr Robert Feld, former managing director. Mr Tonkinson said in July it had become apparent that Resort had exceeded its banking facilities, contrary to information provided by Mr Feld. Mr Feld is accused of misleading the directors and banks, although he denies these accusations.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN MARINO;  </P> <P> MANSION EXPANSION DENIED  </P> <P> A physician who has been seeking permission for 2 1/2 years to expand his  10-room house on Orlando Road was again turned down by the city this week.  </P> <P> Architect Robert Wood, representing Dr. and Mrs. Kamal Batniji, asked the City  Council on Wednesday to overturn the Planning Commission's latest denial of the  request.  </P> <P> Since Batniji first filed his expansion plans in May, 1988, the matter has come  before the commission eight times, most recently in September, Wood said.  </P> <P> Although Wood presented letters from residents in support of the expansion, the  City Council said it would violate the city code because Batniji's house would  extend too close to his rear neighbor's lot.  </P> <P> Batniji said he has retained the law firm of Hahn &amp; Hahn to explore legal  action against the city.  </P></p>

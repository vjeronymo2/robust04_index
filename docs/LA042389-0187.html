			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN GRADUATION IN HOLLYWOOD BOWL  </P> <P> My sympathy goes out to the Cal State Northridge graduates being shuffled about  in such a cavalier manner.  </P> <P> I believe that the arrogant selection of Hollywood Bowl and the stipulation  that students be allowed to bring only three guests is a brazen stomping of the  sensibilities of graduating students who have been supposedly exposed to four  years of higher learning. Above all else, college is supposed to send young men  and women out into the world with heightened sensitivity, a sense of fairness,  a pride in being accepted into a community appreciative of and hopeful for  their enlightened contribution to society.  </P> <P> What sort of message do they receive from an administration that so treats this  vitally important achievement in their lives and in the lives of supportive  parents, grandparents, friends and other family members? Three guests only,  indeed! Right on, students! Don't let yourself be stomped on!  </P> <P> AL SHEPPARD  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

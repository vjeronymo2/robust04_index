			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: PWA shares plunge on Canadian airline strife SHARES of PWA Corporation, holding company of Canadian Airlines International, lost a quarter of their value in early trading yesterday amid signs that the fight for survival between Canada's two main airlines is nearing a climax. PWA's share price plunged as low as CDollars 1.20 from CDollars 1.63 on the Toronto stock exchange following reports that the embattled company may have little choice but to file for protection from its creditors. Air Canada, PWA's arch-rival, this week rejected terms for a merger between the two airlines. Although a merged carrier would have a virtual monopoly on domestic routes, it would have an unmanageable debt load of close to CDollars 8bn (USDollars 6.4bn). Air Canada's investment advisers, RBC Dominion Securities and Bunting Warburg, advised it against the deal. Air Canada said yesterday that 'we would still be interested in a merger, but on different terms'. The spokesman said, however, that discussions had not been resumed. As part of its desperate rescue search, PWA renewed talks this week for an alliance with American Airlines of Dallas. Such a deal would include American becoming a big minority shareholder in Canadian Airlines, possibly in partnership with a group of PWA employees. Airline sources said that another option open to PWA was to raise cash and shrink its business by selling its valuable international routes, notably those across the Pacific, to Air Canada. Mr Rhys Eaton, PWA's chairman, said he hoped to resolve the company's future by mid-month. Meanwhile, the board of Continental Airlines, the bankrupt US carrier, meets today to choose between the bids from two groups of prospective buyers, one led by Air Canada. Continental is expected to announce its decision in New York on Monday. The Canadian airline industry's troubles have taken a heavy toll on PWA and Air Canada shareholders. PWA shares traded at a peak of CDollars 29.50 in 1987, shortly before the company over-extended itself by buying the charter airline Wardair. Air Canada shares changed hands yesterday at CDollars 2.90, a fraction of the CDollars 12 price at which they were issued to the public when it was privatised in mid-1989.</p>

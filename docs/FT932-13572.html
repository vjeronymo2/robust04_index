			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average retreats further after fall in NTT EQUITY prices settled lower as the weakness of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's largest telecommunications company, erased early gains triggered by institutional investors and arbitrageurs amid choppy trading, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei average retreated 55.42 to 19,773.01 for its fourth consecutive decline, after moving between an intraday low of 19,672.02 and a high of 20,008.13. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 10.78 to 1,532.56, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 5.74 at 1,207.41. Volume was estimated at 400m shares, compared with Tuesday's 460m. Declines outpaced advances by 699 to 330, with 148 issues unchanged. Investors took profits quickly after NTT dipped below the Y1m level. NTT, which represents about 10 per cent of the first section in terms of market value, finally settled Y60,000 lower at Y937,000 for a sixth consecutive loss. The strength of the yen also gave investors an additional reason to sell equities or to remain on the sidelines. The yen advanced beyond Y110 to the dollar at one point during Tokyo trading. Mr Hiroshi Nakagawa, head of research at Morgan Stanley Japan, estimated that the Nikkei average would trade between a narrow range of 18,000 to 20,000 for the next three months. Any rally beyond this level is likely to result in profit-taking because investors regarded the overall stock market as expensive, he added. Electric power and gas suppliers came under pressure. Tokyo Electric Power settled Y120 lower at Y3,840 while Tokyo Gas lost Y18 to Y542. Brokerages lost ground, Nomura retreating Y40 to Y2,000, Yamaichi Y22 to Y830 and Nikko Securities Y11 to Y999. Consumer electronic issues were weak: TDK fell Y50 to Y3,800 and Pioneer Electronic Y50 to Y2,410. But high-technology shares moved higher, NEC appreciating Y9 to Y937, Hitachi Y9 to Y829 and Mitsubishi Electric Y3 to Y558. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 223.25 to end at 21,533.79 in volume of 33.9m shares. Roundup THERE WAS a positive mood in some of the Pacific Rim markets yesterday. HONG KONG closed higher on comments by a senior Chinese official about Sino-British talks, but activity remained thin. The Hang Seng index finished 129.85, or 1.9 per cent, up at 6,768.39. Turnover was HKDollars 4.3bn. Mr Lu Ping, China's senior official on Hong Kong affairs, said success in discussions over the colony's political reforms would be positive for shares. KUALA LUMPUR rose to a new high on index-linked buying and speculative activity. The composite index added 19.17 at 691.70. Increased demand for laggard blue chip issues from institutional investors boosted activity. SEOUL ended at a 20-month peak on a surge by financial issues. The composite index climbed 11.92 to 733.58 in volume of 56.6m shares. Popularity in electronics issues contributed to a rise in confidence. MANILA fell in spite of strong buying at the start of the session. The composite index lost 22.05 to 1,532.76 in turnover of 426.16m pesos. Rumours of foreign selling in the oil sector due to the lack of positive developments in oil drilling projects depressed other shares. TAIWAN was weak in financials but managed to reverse early losses to end slightly higher. The weighted index put on a net 34.20 at 4,482.63 in thin turnover of TDollars 31.44bn. Some analysts noted that the failure by the provincial assembly to pass dividend plans by the major provincial commercial banks had hit sentiment in the sector. AUSTRALIA eased on profit-taking after declines on Wall Street, the All Ordinaries index slipping 9.7 to 1,693.9 in turnover of ADollars 340.5m. SINGAPORE was firmer after falling back on Tuesday, but many investors preferred to concentrate on the Malaysian market. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 6.99 ahead at 1,770.06 in turnover of SDollars 451m. BANGKOK moved ahead on hopes that the authorities might take less severe action than expected against violators of the new securities law. The SET index gained 5.20 at 889.42 in turnover of Bt3.84bn. NEW ZEALAND continued to be driven by strong performances in the forestry sector and the NZSE-40 index rose 7.04 to 1,604.93, its highest close since February. Turnover amounted to NZDollars 42.6m. KARACHI was supported by buying from state financial institutions. The KSE index moved forward 12.38 to 1,088.30. BOMBAY fell to a 14-month low as the BSE index lost a further 10.51 to 2,194.40.</p>

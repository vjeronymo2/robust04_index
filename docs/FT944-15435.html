			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa extends gains Johannesburg extended gains in slow trade as the market derived support from stronger world markets and improved gold price prospects. However, dealers said that low trading volumes indicated a lack of real interest and that the medium term direction remained cloudy. Currencies continued to play their part, with a firmer financial rand undermining some price rises early in the day. The overall index collected 28 at 5,655, industrials rose 49 to 6,404 and golds picked up 12 to 2,300. De Beers added 10 cents at R101.60, Anglos rose R1 to R238.25 and Minorco hardened 25 cents to R107. Iscor put on 5 cents at R4.78 and Hiveld climbed a strong R1.50 to R32. SAB firmed R1 to R85.75 and Remgro picked up 75 cents to R27. Sappi registered a fresh high for the year as it appreciated R3 to R66 on continued positive reaction to its acquisition of a 70 per cent stake in SD Warren.</p>

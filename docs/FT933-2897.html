			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Oliver Group cuts loss to Pounds 2.24m OLIVER Group, the footwear retailer, made progress in cutting its losses in the first half of 1993 with a fall from Pounds 4.87m to Pounds 2.24m pre-tax. Turnover fell 11.5 per cent to Pounds 33.2m (Pounds 37.5m) the result of branch closures. During the period 34 were closed with a further 16 poor performing branches earmarked for the second half. The pre-tax figure was helped by cost cutting and a lower interest charge of Pounds 557,000 (Pounds 1.26m). The company has announced the intended closure of Brick Studio, the remaining non-footwear activity. Completion is scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year. Losses per share came out at 8.86p (19.28p).</p>

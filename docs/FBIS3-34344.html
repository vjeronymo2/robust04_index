			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First Friday prayers sermon by President Akbar </F> Hashemi-Rafsanjani in Tehran on 4 February -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. We will have two short sermons today, with an eye on  the time and current needs. The first sermon will include  mostly issues relating to the revolution and its anniversary and  some current issues. [passage omitted]    In my view one of the most effective factors in this  important event should be sought in the people's awareness and  vigilance. We have clearly felt, and feel, with all our being,  that the strongest factor which made us victorious in the  revolution and has foiled -- and still foils -- plots and acts  of mischief and also safeguarded us and made us triumphant in  the war, and gives us the opportunity to plan and carry out  important infrastructural work, is that same awareness of the  people and their vigilance and presence on the scene.    The reason why the people have become like that and why that  awareness came about and why this phenomenon occurred in Iran,  and why other places are not yet ripe for this divine  phenomenon, cannot be overlooked easily. They raise fresh  questions which lead to other questions when answered. [passage  omitted]    The most fundamental thing that has happened during the last  20 years of struggle and the Islamic struggles of the previous  decades is that the awareness of the people has increased.  [passage omitted]    Competent leadership is the next thing. Very well, people  are aware and vigilant and ready for self-sacrifice. If the  masses are vigilant but have no leader to lead them they will  face problems. We have seen such problems in many areas. But  such appropriate grounds, people's awareness, make the  leadership a great deal easier. We have many interesting  examples of that. We did not have any political parties or  party training before the revolution, we had no party network to  bring people together and discipline them. We had masses of the  self-initiating people. If you look at the moves made during  the last year of the revolution you see that all of them were  guided and well calculated.    If the people wanted to go on strike, they had leadership.  If the headquarters in charge of the strikes issued an order  that this sector should go on strike and the other sector should  not, the people accepted that, even though it was difficult for  them not to go on strike. When we said that the oil workers  should go on strike, because at that time oil revenue was the  main source of income for the Pahlavi regime and the world and  the supporters of the regime would also have been greatly  damaged by the loss of four or five million barrels of Iranian  oil, the workers went on strike. Later, we discovered that there  were difficulties in our domestic consumption, the people were  faced with difficulties in their domestic use, then a delegation  which went to the oil producing regions on behalf of the imam --  and I was a member of that delegation -- we witnessed an amazing  degree of obedience among all these diverse but aware and  vigilant groups. [passage omitted]    The other issue that I wish to refer to now -- and it is an  issue of great importance in the science of sociology and the  movement of masses and history --is the trust which existed  between the masses of the people and the leaders of the masses.  This trust is very effective. If such a degree of trust  existed in Afghanistan today, there would not be these wars  there. If there was a person who was accepted by the people and  who instructed the people not to fight and told them what to do,  the people would have accepted it.    If such a degree of trust is created in any society between  the leaders and the masses of the people and if this trust can  be consolidated and can continue, this will provide the basis  for movement, it will provide the means for eliminating  difficulties and fighting against disruptions.    At the beginning of the Islamic revolutionary movement the  enemies of Islam became aware of this secret. We see that from  the first days of the revolution, the first weeks of the  revolution, there were many efforts to create a rift between the  leadership and the people, between the officials and the people.  All the propaganda means of news imperialism and their domestic  agents were used to weaken the trust of the people in their  leaders and officials and to eliminate the love and affection  which existed between the leadership and officials and the  people.    This was one of the things they never succeeded in  achieving.  They carried out repeated attacks on that fortress, they exerted  a great deal of pressure on that rampart, they subjected that  popular trench to repeated bombardments, but they never produced  any results. The bombs boomeranged back to themselves and  targeted themselves.    Of course they have also used other means, they created  internal unrest -- which they described as street clashes --  they staged a coup d'etat, they imposed the war with Iraq  against us, they staged economic sanctions against us and did  whatever they could; but what is still continuing is their  molestation and satanic moves which started since the outset of  the revolution. These things were ad hoc. Street unrest,  revolts and insecurity did not last long and we saw that it was  the people who repelled such plots. [passage omitted]    You see that they have pursued a continuous chain of action,  which is still going on, to create a rift between the officials  and the people. They have a number of ad hoc means to which  they resort such as war, revolt, and other such things.    We feel that the revolution is victorious in all arenas and  it enjoys better support than it did 15 years ago and it is  developing further. If it used to be easy for the enemy to  create a shock, now it is no longer so. A better way of saying  that is that the revolution has reached certain maturity.  [passage omitted]    Today I see the foundations of the revolution to be so  strong, its roots so deep in the heart of this community, the  branches of the holy tree of the revolution so tall throughout  the space of our country and other environments, and I see the  people so much more aware, sincere and more in the arena, in  line and in one with the revolution, that I think that those  dangers that our enemies traditionally plot have passed by the  revolution and our 15-year-old revolution has traversed a  100-year course.    Those sentiments, those sympathies, that strange scene that  we saw at the immaculate tomb of his eminence the imam  [Khomeyni] on 1 February, and the sentiments that came from the  people after that -- and still does -- are all proof to our  claim.    Now the march on 22 Bahman this year [11 February] will show  those who had plotted to pale the hue of the revolution this  year that their arrows have hit granite, those tricks have  become old hat for our nation, the people have been vaccinated  against those germs and will no longer be influenced. It is  truly a wonderful event in the world. [passage omitted]    This incident to which your attention has now been drawn --  the assassination attempt -- to my mind this is a very minor  issue which can always happen. A few people can always give  rise to a small incident. However, these things are no longer  of any importance to the revolution. You should feel quite  reassured about that. The revolution has now become quite  separated from individuals. I said that the revolution has  reached the stage of maturity; it is no longer a child which  needs suckling. It provides its own sustenance. A lofty figure  like the imam of the ummah departed from among these people. At  that time we shuddered to think about what would happen when the  imam would no longer be among us. Then we witnessed this calm  movement of an ocean of people, and this Islamic revolution  continues forever on its path. Through divine guidance, this  ship correctly continues its voyage toward its destination in  this tumultuous ocean.    How effective can individuals be any longer in this  revolution that others should put themselves in trouble, should  put themselves in danger so that a certain individial may or may  not be there; and that a person like me who is one of the most  minor soldiers of this revolution!    I say that world arrogance, America and others should really  know that in Iran they should give up the hope that by the  physical or psychological elimination of individuals they can  overcome the revolution.    May God protect you, your revolution and the leader of the  revolution. We are very weak soldiers. There are many people  like me who can be in the service of the people. Nothing  important will take place through this route of assassination  attempts.    Those who planned this act of mischief had something else  in mind, something more than me. As I said, I am only an  individual. Their aim was to weaken the revolution, to weaken  the presence of the people upon the stage. If one day they can  achieve that goal, they believe that they have achieved  something major. Therefore, this is what they had in mind. They  thought that in the presence of foreign reporters and the guests  of the Ten Days of Dawn, in the first official meeting of the  celebrations, a minor action which would have given rise to a  great deal of publicity would have achieved those goals. This  would have disrupted the very first meeting and would have  created insecurity, and this would be the first defeat of the  regime during the Ten Days of Dawn. This would have taken the  luster away from the subsequent meetings, people would have felt  insecure and would not have attended them. This would have been  a sign to the world that the revolution had lost its luster. Of  course, if they had achieved greater success and had been able  to get rid of someone this would have provided them with greater  success.    However, this is the sign of their stupidity. They should  have looked a little to the past and to the events around them.  Did not a bomb explode right here in the Friday prayers a few  years ago, and did it not scatter parts of some people's bodies  around the trees? Was the meeting disrupted? Did the Friday  imam that day take one step back? Were the subsequent Friday  prayers deserted? This should have been an example.    This was just the sound of a few shots, of a bomb. Have we  forgotten that during the Friday prayers, in marches Iraqi  bombers flew overhead and the roaring of the aircraft drowned  the sound of the loudspeakers; but these people with their  clenched fists and with the shouts of God is Great remained  steadfast. How foolish it is to imagine that with such actions  they can weaken the morale of the people. It is a futile hope  that the morale of the people could be weakened.    The new strategy of world arrogance which I also referred to  in a previous sermon, and the new official policy of colonialism  regarding us is to weaken the morale of the people. Everything  can be summed up in this one sentence. Such actions, and the  efforts to minimize the achievements of the revolution or to  exaggerate the difficulties of the revolution are their constant  policies. Those policies may occasionally be intensified or  occasionally be abated, but our people are vigilant. Our people  understand. Our people see the countries around them. They see  their neighboring countries. They see other revolutions. They  see their own lives and they compare them.    First of all, the people see that what they staged the  revolution for is getting stronger. Those who sacrifice their  children are not after a more luxurious living. One sells all  that one possesses and spends it on one's sick child. Here,  they offer their young men, one or two or three, to be martyred  in the fronts. It is clear that these people are after somethig  different. You cannot deal with these people through material  means.    Second, do not the people notice material issues? Even if  for a hundred times they say that there are difficulties in  Iran, there is such and such, when the people see that during  the Ten Days of Dawn a factory, for instance a petrochemical  plant, started production and it was officially announced that  1,000, I mean, that 700 factories have severed their links with  foreign countries and are now providing their raw material from  inside and by the hands of their own workers; when people see  these tangible things, when they see that during the Ten Days of  Dawn thousands of projects in villages and cities and everywhere  have starting production, let someone moan or say something.  Even in these issues the people will not be deceived and will  not be misled. The people are not so illiterate and uninformed.  If the people were uninformed they would have been misled and  would have left the stage as the result of the propaganda during  the satanic shah's period.    In any case, thanks be to God, they have missed their  target.  Regarding myself, I said that it was not important. The  sentiments which I witness toward myself are really too much for  me, I feel ashamed for so much kindness, for so many messages,  for so many expressions of support. I ask all the dear ones, my  brothers, and the nation to regard all this expression of  kindness as sufficient. If there is a hearing ear, this much is  sufficient to make them understand the situation inside our  society. They should not waste their time on these messages and  such like. I express my sincere thanks. It is not that I do  not attach importance to these, but I believe that the issue is  not worthy for you to spend your time and efforts on it. I am  grateful. Let all the messages and expressions of support be  for these 10 Days of Dawn and for the programs and ceremonies of  the 10 Days of Dawn. [passage omitted]</p>

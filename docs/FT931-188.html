			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / People: White reinstates his old job Alliance &amp; Leicester has reinstated its post of managing director for building societies operations as part of its transition towards providing more banking services. The society, the third biggest by asset size, has appointed Kevin Southwood, an executive director of Northern Rock Building Society, to the post made vacant two years ago when Peter White moved up to become chief executive. White has spent his time since then mending weaknesses such as the society's exposure to commercial property lending. He has also overseen changes at Girobank, which was acquired by Alliance &amp; Leicester in 1989. Fred Crawley, the society's chairman, says the change to the management reflected the eventual plan to integrate Girobank into the mainstream building society business and spread access to services such as telephone banking. He says Southwood (left), whose society's results were among the best for 1992, would 'bring a lot of energy and innovative thinking' which would help the society in its move towards becoming more like a personal bank. Southwood, 42, becomes managing director designate on April 5. He joined Northern Rock in 1975 and became head of policy planning and general manager before being appointed executive director in 1990.</p>

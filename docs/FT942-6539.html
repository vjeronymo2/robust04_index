			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Media Futures: When Postman Pat goes electronic - Bill Cockburn talks to Andrew Adonis about the Royal Mail's future Even a year ago, an interview with a postal service chief executive on the subject of 'media futures' might have seemed laughable. However, Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the UK's Royal Mail, holds forth about the role of his business in the interactive age with all the verve, and much of the plausibility, of today's telecommunications barons. Cockburn concedes that 'no letter is safe in the age of the technological postman.' But tomorrow's entrepreneurial post office will, he argues, be offering both the postmen and the technology. His vision combines the potential of the existing postal service to thrive on the back of technological innovation in other sectors, plus the ability of the postal service to innovate on its own account. Cockburn is sceptical about the pace of the supposed interactive revolution. In the short and medium term, with interactive systems and cultural adaptation in their infancy, home shopping and the like could significantly boost the conventional mail business - through catalogues, extra billing, and so on. But even when full interactivity dawns, Cockburn sees a vital role for post as valet to the new networks. Home shopping, for instance, is potentially a huge source of new business for those with an efficient home-to-home delivery capacity. 'We need to be positioned to take that on.' He sees a similar evolutionary process in utility billing mail. Ultimately, all accounts may be settled on the screen. Before that, however, Cockburn sees a lucrative market in the outsourcing of billing to single operators capable of printing and delivering bills and handling the payments - whether cash, paper or electronic. 'Who better than us to do it - we already have the delivery and much of the payments capacity, and are fast developing electronic mail.' Part of Royal Mail's case for privatisation is the need to break free of government investment restrictions to develop new technology. Cockburn also wants the freedom to contract joint ventures, at home and abroad, to pool his assets with those of new technological operators. 'We have a lot to offer a partner,' says Cockburn, who proceeds to rattle off the plums on his balance sheet. 'We have our own telecoms network, the fourth largest in the country, 16 trains, 70 chartered air services a day, 30,000 vehicles, the biggest residential database in the UK, and 2,000 buildings. Think of the opportunities that gives you.' Not to mention an army of Postman Pats.</p>

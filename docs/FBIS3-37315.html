The diplomat regretted that the agreements reached by  bilateral negotiation on various levels were being "implemented  worse than was expected." In particular, he said the treaties  signed during Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit  to Vilnius had not been enforced yet.    The agreements on trade and economic agreements are not  fulfilled either, because they "got stuck in corridors of the  Russian power due to unknown reasons," as Bulovas put it.    The working group head dismissed the allegations by some  opposition leaders that the current Lithuanian authorities were  secretly negotiating Russian military transit to the Kaliningrad  region and had allegedly signed "some secret protocols."    Bulovas said that the Russian side had submitted no  proposals  regarding military transit to the Kaliningrad region pointing  out that "neither open, nor secret negotiations were held on the  issue."</p>

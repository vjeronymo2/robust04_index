			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Tajikistan opposition militia seizes control of capital THE communist government of Tajikistan was in disarray yesterday after opposition militia groups seized most of the capital, Dushanbe. But there were signs of a possible compromise last night, with attempts to put together a coalition between the opposition and moderate members of the government. Opposition forces said up to 60 people had been killed in clashes in the republic since Monday. The government appeared to have lost control of all key structures of power in the capital, apart from the parliament buildings. Mr Rakhmon Nabiyev, the Tajik president, appeared to have vanished and a split was said to have emerged in government ranks between hardliners  - including Vice-President Nazrullo Dustov and parliamentary speaker Safarli Kenjayev - and moderate factions. The opposition, a loose alliance of Islamic and democratic parties, set up roadblocks, guarded by nervous and shabbily dressed opposition militia carrying Kalashnikovs. The presidential palace was under opposition control, and the television station, captured earlier in the week, broadcast pro-opposition statements. Gun battles broke out in the tree-lined parks around the city's radio station, as the opposition sought to take away the government's last channel of mass communications. Many Interior Ministry troops appeared to have joined the opposition militia group. In an attempt to stop the bloodshed, leaders from opposition parties re-opened negotiations with some of the more moderate government figures, with the aim of forming an interim coalition. But with armed militia groups still roaming the city, finding a compromise appeared extremely difficult. Although the government's hand seemed weak, many key government figures remained bitterly opposed to the political reforms the opposition has been demanding, and seemed far from ready to give in peacefully. The conflict is exacerbated by bitter regional splits in the republic. Most government supporters come from the Kulyab and Khodjent regions in the north and south-east, while most Islamic party supporters come from the east and south. Another problem lies with the fragile nature of the opposition coalition of Islamic and democratic parties. For a month, the opposition had been peacefully demonstrating against the government before being provoked into a more radical stance by the arrival of thousands of government supporters bussed into the capital 10 days ago. Its official aim is establishment of a multi-party democracy. But with the Islamic party clearly the stronger partner, many fear the democratic leaders could soon be swept away by more radical Moslems. The square where thousands have been demonstrating for the last month is decorated with Islamic placards and slogans. Many of these have been copied from Iran. White-veiled women and determined young men declare themselves ready to die as martyrs for Islam. Opposition leaders continue to insist that these fiery sentiments will not be necessary. But with most of their supporters insisting that they will not go home until the communist government is completely overthrown, the opposition leaders will find it difficult to persuade them to accept any compromise.</p>

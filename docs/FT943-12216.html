			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Taiwanese cement group tumbles 29% Taiwan Cement saw first-half pre-tax profits drop 29 per cent to NTDollars 1.77bn (USDollars 66m) compared with a year ago, due to a continued slump in the construction industry and a sharp fall in non-operating income, writes Laura Tyson in Taipei. Sales in the half year to June 30 were down 5.8 per cent to NTDollars 9.17bn. Analysts attributed the decline to increased cement imports and slack demand, partly due to delays in public infrastructure construction projects. After the shutdown next month of a large Kaohsiung plant for environmental reasons, Taiwan Cement will fall to second place behind Asia Cement in terms of production capacity, analysts said.</p>

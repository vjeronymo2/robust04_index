			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> USC;  </P> <P> YOUTH MOVEMENT GETTING STRONGER  </P> <P> With injuries knocking sophomore tight end Yonnie Jackson and senior nose guard  Gene Fruge out of Saturday's game against California at the Coliseum, USC could  start as many as eight freshmen against the Golden Bears.  </P> <P> Coach Larry Smith won't announce his starting lineup until Friday, but six  freshmen started in Saturday's 13-6 victory over Arizona State.  </P> <P> And the probable replacements for Jackson and Fruge -- Brad Banta or Elic  Mahone at tight end and Mike Hinz at nose guard -- are freshmen. Against the  Sun Devils, Jackson suffered a stress fracture in his left foot, Fruge a stress  fracture in his right leg.  </P> <P> Among those expected back this week are tailback Mazio Royster and fullback  Scott Lockwood, who were knocked out of the Arizona State game with  concussions; linebacker Scott Ross, who was sidelined because of a broken right  hand, and cornerback Jason Oliver, who missed the game to be at his father's  funeral.  </P> <P> Tailback Ricky Ervins, who hasn't played since Sept. 29 because of a sprained  ankle, will probably be available for limited duty against Cal, Smith said.

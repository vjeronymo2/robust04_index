			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Unita quits joint force in Angola UNITA, Angola's former rebel movement, withdrew from the country's newly formed joint armed forces yesterday in protest at what it called fraud in the country's first multi-party elections last week, agencies report from Luanda. The move came just hours after Mr Paulo Alcides Mango, the organisation's secretary-general, called on the National Electoral Council to halt publication of election results. 'If it does not, the (council) will have to accept fully what will happen in the country,' he said. A western diplomat said: 'This is very grave, one of many moves in a very complicated game.' Unita has about 3,000 soldiers in the newly unified armed forces. But it has 25,000-30,000 fighters being demobilised in 22 assembly areas across the country who could easily be rearmed.</p>

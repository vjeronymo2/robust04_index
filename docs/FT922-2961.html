			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Cancelled Domingo concert sparks litigation at Lloyd's A CANCELLED gala concert in Moscow featuring opera singer Placido Domingo has sparked new litigation at the beleaguered Lloyd's of London insurance market. Mr Ricardo Cerdan, a Zurich-based music promoter, has taken legal action after a Lloyd's underwriter, Mr Victor Broad, refused to pay SFr3m (Pounds 1.1m) on a contingency insurance policy taken out to cover losses due to forced cancellation of the event. Other insurers in a policy led by Mr Broad's syndicate include the Paris-based SCOR, Italy's Generali and 13 other Lloyd's syndicates. A writ was served last month by London-based solicitors Paisner on behalf of Mr Cerdan's company, International Cultural Sponsorship Corporation. ICSC initially signed a contract with Mr Domingo in January last year to perform a New Year's eve concert in the Russian capital. Subsequently Mr Cerdan made an agreement with leading TV companies and Sony, the Japanese electronics company, to broadcast and record the event. But last winter, as economic conditions worsened in the former Soviet Union, the event was dogged by a series of un-expected logistical difficulties such as fuel shortages. A fortnight before the event, ICSC was forced to cancel. An insurance policy providing for comprehensive coverage against cancellation had been bought in June - but insurers, led by Mr Broad's syndicate 370, have denied liability and are refusing to pay. Banks and TV companies supporting the event have written to Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, suggesting that the market's reputation could be further tarnished by the affair. Geneva-based Banque Scandinave en Suisse said: 'We simply cannot understand why this claim has not yet been settled.' Mr Broad said that the affair was a 'legitimate claims problem' and that the syndicate had denied the claim after Gaebel Watkins and Taylor, the independent loss adjusters, had expressed reservations. 'If there is something in the claim which wasn't satisfactory we have to protect our Names,' Mr Broad added.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Recession cuts into Fitzwilton profits FITZWILTON, the Irish industrial holding company, yesterday reported a further drop in interim profits, but transformed its prospects by confirming the part-acquisition of the Wellworth grocery chain for Pounds 122m. In the six months ending June 30, the group reported a decline in pre-tax profits from IPounds 1.22m to IPounds 1.16m on turnover of IPounds 234m (IPounds 238m). More than 95 per cent of Fitzwilton's trading activities are in the UK, where its profits have been gouged deeply by the recession. In the full year for 1991 the company reported a drop to IPounds 200,000, down from IPounds 10.4m in 1990. The acquisition of Wellworth is to be carried out through Erne Holdings. The specially created subsidiary is a joint venture between Fitzwilton and a group of institutional investors led by County NatWest Ventures. Erne is to be funded with Pounds 41.8m share capital, the 'balance being a mixture of senior and mezzanine debt.' Fitzwilton will hold a 42.7 per cent stake, the institutions 54.3 per cent, while the balance will be held by Wellworth management. Fitzwilton will subscribe Pounds 18.25m for its stake in Erne. This will be funded by a short-term bridging finance facility of Pounds 9.75m and an issue of Pounds 9m subordinated loanstock in Fitzwilton, which will bought by Mr Tony O'Reilly, Fitzwilton's chairman. This will give him an option to acquire 7.9 per cent of the issued share capital of Erne, held by Fitzwilton. Fitzwilton will also have the right to buy out the stake in Wellworth held by its fellow investors after one year. Fitzwilton said it intended to reduce its debt to equity ratio of 92 per cent by the year end. Earnings per share amounted to 0.6p (0.71p). The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Japanese drug 'could be used in Aids cases' A JAPANESE drug developed to suppress the immune system in transplant patients could be a powerful treatment for Aids, according to tests at Cambridge University in England, write Clive Cookson and Emiko Terazono. Dr Abraham Karpas, an Aids specialist at the university's haematology department, has discovered that Fujisawa Pharmaceutical's immunosuppressant drug FK-506 stops the replication of human cells infected with HIV, the Aids virus, while allowing uninfected cells to grow normally. This selective impact on cells seems to distinguish FK-506 from Aids treatments such as Wellcome's AZT, which act directly on the virus. Fujisawa's share price surged on the Tokyo stock market yesterday, as copies of a letter sent by Dr Karpas to the company about his studies on FK-506 circulated among brokers. The stock jumped 5.4 per cent to a day's high of Y1,440 before closing up Y70 at Y1,360. Fujisawa expects to launch FK-506 in Japan in 1993 and the US and Europe in 1994. Fujisawa said the company had just received a letter from Dr Karpas and would not be able to make any decisions until full data was available. Dr Karpas said he had applied for a patent to use FK-506 against HIV in clinical trials and hoped Fujisawa would co-operate with his research group.</p>

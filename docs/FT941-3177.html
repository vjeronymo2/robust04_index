			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Arts: A display of non-specific Hispanic angst - Clement Crisp reviews the Spanish National Dance company, in Britain for the first time Hispanic or not  - and I rather think 'not'  - the programme which marks the first appearance of the Spanish National Dance Company in this country is of curious and awful predictability. The company's director and, seemingly, only choreographer, is Nacho Duato, for several years a dancer and creator with Nederlands Dans Theater. There he showed himself a dutiful apostle of Jiri Kylian, who is Czech, and whose many NDT choreographies have propounded a torso-wrenching energy allied to a bleeding heart (no human suffering, no oppression or social social disaster, but can find its memorial in Kylian's oeuvre) as a dance-style that makes every creation a flag-day for a Good Cause. And Kylian and his followers (they include our own Christopher Bruce) shop for good causes in the Jumbo All-family packet. War, pestilence and famine are their themes; anguish their stock in trade; girls in deadly long dresses, men in no-colour work-clothes  - relieved by the occasional puttee  - their pawns. Their dance works begin all too often with the cast staring up-stage at some amorphous dun-coloured set  - 'the old country' or a heath blasted by radiation, or, I'll bet, a threatened rain forest. It is, you may be sure, ecologically sound, politically correct, Green as Green (except the favoured colour is a muddy beige), and guaranteed bio-degradable. There follow sequences of movement in which the women either behave like peasants who have lost their all, or are thrown, torn, forced into squatting poses, manhandled like sides of beef, by their partners. There is usually a trio in which some poor creature is tugged into sexually crass positions  - do these choreographers fear women?  - and spun on her poor knees on the ground, or made to slide face-down over the stage. The men also have a hell of a time, and tend to huge, pointless leaps and tense, meaningless gestures. Thus the common-places of the Kylian school, much adored in parts of Europe. It is, I suspect, a dreadful harking back, and a physically brutal up-dating, of the more tedious forms of central European dance of the 1930s, when despair was all. And, as this introduction should warn you, it is exactly what the Spanish National Dance Company proposed in its first programme of four Duato pieces. Na Floresta, said the programme, was in praise of the Amazon jungle, that well-known Spanish beauty-spot. At curtain-rise the cast were gazing at a dingy back-drop, then flung themselves into anguished action in the sort of outfits we have, alas, come to expect (Spain, I recalled, was the home of Balenciaga), while charming Villa Lobos music was played and delightfully sung. Cor Perdut was a duet for Catherine Allard (in one of those long skirts that do more for the dance than the dancer) and Mr Duato, in which they may have been lovers, or merely seeking to borrow some coffee-powder from each other. Cautiva was interminable, inexplicable, decked with voices intoning what they thought was poetry, while 16 dancers went on the rampage. It was set to a score by Alberto Iglesias which suited it exactly. Who was the girl in the red and unforgiveable ball-dress, in need of both a coiffure and an analyst? No reason was discernible for anything that happened, and what happened was bombastic effort, flatulent attitudinising, and the Olympic trials for rodomontade. Duato's choreography drains his dancers' energies with an undifferentiated blare of dynamics. It is vampiric tosh. The closing Rassemblement is about Haitian slave-songs, which sound touching, and are used for yet another display of mopery  - not especially relevant, one would have thought, but the Kylian School believe that any cause (however lost or remote) is better than none, better than choreographic invention or structural rigour. Another glum setting; more predictable clothes, and yet more predictable dances. The company work frightfully hard throughout the evening: Duato makes them look as if they are suffering from Non-specific Angst. There is no cure. Spanish National Dance Company is at Sadler's Wells until March 19. Sponsors: Gil y Carvajal, G&amp;C, BSIS</p>

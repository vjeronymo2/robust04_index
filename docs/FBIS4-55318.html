			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] At a 20 April news conference, General  Roman Harmoza, the recently appointed chief of the Defense  Ministry personnel department, discussed the major personnel  issues facing the Polish military and, in particular, the plans  for the Polish officer corps in a period of downsizing,  reorganization, and redefinition of mission. Harmoza explained  to the assembled reporters that "the most important task for the  Army personnel department at this time is adjusting the Army's  structures to the needs of a much smaller army. The  reorganization of the armed forces will mean eliminating a  number of positions and some military units as well as the  creation of new garrisons." Harmoza noted that, as it downsizes,  the Polish Army will also be increasing its reliance on career  soldiers instead of conscripts. He estimated that, by the turn  of the century, half of the Polish Army will be composed of  professional soldiers. Nevertheless, the number of career  officers will decrease, and promotions will be slower in coming  than in the past. Harmoza expressed his belief that "a smaller,  elite officers corps will increase the prestige of the Army."  Requirements for noncommissioned officers will also be  tightened, with secondary-school diplomas being made obligatory.  (Currently, only 40 percent of Polish NC0's are secondary-school  graduates.) (RZECZPOSP0LITA 21 Apr 94)    However, the general did not foresee the need for forced  reductions in the officer corps beyond the strict enforcement of  mandatory retirement at age 60. For the time being, the size of  the officers corps will be frozen at the 1993 level. All  promotions will depend on the number of slots that are vacated  and will be dictated by the "needs of the Army" and justified by  the "impeccable behavior" of the officer. (GAZETA WYBORCZA 21  Apr 94)    Harmoza emphasized that the change of government after the  1993 elections has not slowed down the process of reforming  military institutions. All decisions are made according to the  legitimate military hierarchy, with the commander in chief, the  minister of defense, and the chief of the General Staff  collaborating on all important initiatives. He stated that the  decommunization problem no longer exists in the military because  a large part of the old officer corps has already left the  service. (In the years 1989-94, more than 22,000 officers,  including 58 generals, left the Army.) Harmoza assured his  listeners that "the Army will not take part in any coup  d'etat--the Army today is mature, apolitical, and staffed with  new and different people." (TRYBUNA 21 Apr 94)</p>

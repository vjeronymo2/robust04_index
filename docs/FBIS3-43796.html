			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Mobutu Sese Seko in Kinshasa on 14 </F> January -- live or recorded]    [Text] Very dear compatriots, I am addressing you for the  second time in 10 days because in my 4 January message to the  nation I called on the political circles, especially the  negotiators, to go back to the dialogue table to sign the  agreements sanctioning their consultations that were taking  place in the Palais du Peuple.    Fortunately, the signing of the draft agreement and of the  particular arrangements related to the equitable and balanced  sharing of power during the transitional period is today a  reality. I therefore called on [break in reception] the  abolition of the double institution system and the creation of a  single parliament called the High Council of the Republic [HCR]  or transitional parliament, and the formation of a single  government, fourth, the adoption of a referendum and electoral  timetable. I am convinced that the proper implementation of  these provisions will definitively put an end to the political  confusion that has prevailed so far in the country.    The immediate consequences of the coming into force of these  Palais du Peuple agreements are the dissolution of the National  Assembly that resulted from the 1987 legislative elections and  of the High Council of the Republic that resulted from the  sovereign national conference, and the resignation of the  present transitional government which, as of today, is charged  with taking care of current affairs until the formation of a new  government.    Very dear compatriots, as promised in my recent New Year's  message, I will very soon sign the texts sanctioning the Palais  du Peuple agreements. Right now, as far as I am concerned, I  will summon the HCR, that is the transitional parliament, to an  extraordinary session on 17 January. The agenda for this  session, which will not extend past 15 days, might include the  following points: First, the internal organization of the  parliament, which implies the verification and validation of the  terms of office of its members, the working out and adoption of  its rules of procedure, the election of its standing executive  committee, and the setting up of its working commissions;  second, the drawing up and adoption of the constitutional text  of the transition; and third, the election of the prime  minister, head of the transitional government.    Dear countrymen, regarding the transitional government, I  would like to recall that in conformity with the spirit of the  agreements signed at the Palais du Peuple and my renewed promise  on 4 January, the prime minister and head of the government is  expected to be appointed from the opposition. His appointment  must be decided by consensus at a consultative meeting between  the political and social forces represented within the High  Council of the Republic, the transitional parliament.    As everyone knows, during the four months of consultations  at  the Palais du Peuple, no consensus was reached on the nomination  of the prime minister of the transitional government. On 9  January, that is five days after my 4 January message to the  nation, the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] allies  and the political forces of the conclave reached a consensus on  a prime ministerial candidate in the person of Professor Mulumba  Lukoyi. Furthermore, in a letter addressed to me on 12 January,  the USOR introduced the candidature of Mr. Tshisekedi Wa Mulumba.    In accordance with the democratic logic underlying the  accords of the Palais du Peuple and in virtue of the  attributions of the High Council of the Republic, the  transitional parliament, it is up to this institution to  deliberate the issue. I will therefore wait for the High  Council of the Republic, the transitional parliament, to  proposes to me an ordinance to be issued on the name of the new  prime minister and head of government.    Nevertheless, on account of the acute crisis facing the  country, along with the people, I expect that this time the  transitional parliament will not be bogged down in futile and  ill-timed quarrels.    My dear countrymen, to end this message, I urge all Zairian  citizens -- men, women, and children -- each in his sector, to  show a high sense of discipline, patriotism, and civic duty so  that in 1994, with the help of God and our ancestors, we can  conclude our democratic process. Thus we can allow Zaire to at  last play the role that belongs to it in the concert of nations  of Africa and the world.    God bless Zaire and its people. Thank you.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Watchdog acts to cut electricity bills OFFER, the electricity industry regulator, has allowed generators to make unlimited sales directly to customers in a move which could help cut bills for medium to large power users. The decision, effective from yesterday, is the latest in a series of measures to liberalise the market with the eventual aim of forcing prices down. Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users' Council, said that the relaxation would not in itself result in a large reduction in prices but might encourage generators to pass on lower coal prices to customers. 'The generators can bring down prices,' he said. 'Whether they will remains to be seen. This is one further step towards the competitive market we have been looking for.' Mr Simon Williams, electricity analyst at Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank, said the relaxation would bring pricing pressures to bear through greater competition. Under rules introduced during privatisation of the electricity industry three years ago, National Power and PowerGen, generators for England and Wales, could sell electricity directly to only a proportion of customers in each of the 12 electricity regions. Most of the direct sales market was restricted to the 12 regional electricity companies. Relaxations of the rules last year restricted the generators to 9 per cent, 15 per cent or 17.5 per cent of any regional company, depending on the industrial make-up of any region. Offer's latest ruling will end the limits altogether, enabling National Power and PowerGen to compete to supply the whole of the 'non-franchise' market. The non-franchise market is limited to about 5,000 customers who use more than one megawatt of electricity in any one half-hour period. From next year, in a further liberalisation of the market, the threshold will fall to 100 kilowatts, bringing in another 50,000 customers to the competitive market. In recent months PowerGen has been pitching for a larger share of the direct supplies market. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, said yesterday that competition would benefit customers and relaxation of 'artificial limits' was a positive move. Yesterday's relaxation is likely to have more effect on sales to medium customers than large ones, many of whom have recently started to buy electricity from the pool wholesale market. However, in the relaxed regime, the generators will not be able to sell electricity directly to customers at a lower price they quote to regional power companies. National Power and PowerGen say they are already passing through the effects of lower coal prices.</p>

Bunget-signed report: "The Number of Cancer Cases </F> Explodes -- 500 New Cases Each Year"]    [Text] While until recently in Mehedinti County they  registered a number of 400 new cancer cases each year, last year  the number of those found to be suffering from that illness  increased to 500. Among the most frequent forms of cancer are  those of the thyroid gland, lungs, and leukemia. According to  experts, such an alarming "explosion" of the number of new  cancer cases is the consequence of radioactive emissions from  Chernobyl. The peak is expected in 1996.    However, in the opinion of the experts, the large number of  people in Mehedinti County condemned to death by this merciless  illness may also be directly linked to the nuclear accident at  Kozloduy (Bulgaria) [on the Danube, close to Mehedinti County]  and with the risk factors currently existing in Mehedinti County  itself, of which the principal ones are the rubber plant, the  cellulose and paper mill, and, especially, the heavy water  plant. To all this one can also add the typical illness of  workers at the uranium extraction plant, endemic nephropathy or  E-type uremia. On top of all this, owing to the disastrous  financial policy of the current rulers, the number of hospital  beds is insufficient and the necessary hospital equipment is  also inadequate. Not to mention the current exorbitant cost of  chemotherapy!</p>

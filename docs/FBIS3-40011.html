			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Peter Almon, Defence Correspondent, and George Jones, </F> Political Editor, article: "MPs Fear Army Cuts Will Limit UN  Peacekeeping Role"]    [Text] The all-party Commons Defence Committee said last  night that it viewed with "utmost gravity" the Government's  decision to send out 7,016 redundancy notices to Army personnel  today. In a statement pointing to growing evidence of  instability and volatility in Central and East Europe, the  Committee said: "The Committee fears that these reductions will  mean that the Government will be unable to respond...to requests  from the UN for additional forces in the peacekeeping role  without unacceptable strains on other military commitments."    However, senior Army officials said the redundancies were  necessary to shape the Army properly to about 120,000 troops.  Announcing the cuts yesterday, they said they would launch a  major drive to recruit 12,000 full-time soldiers -- 20 percent  more than the current recruiting effort -- from April despite  the redundancy notices.    Senior Army officials explained the apparently contradictory  action by saying that the service had to find the right ages and  right jobs for its future structure.    Adjutant General Sir Michael Wilkes said: "Soldiering is a  young man's occupation. An ageing army year after year is not  the answer, and unfortunately some people have to go."    A total of 720 officers and 6,295 soldiers were being made  redundant today. For the first time 953 soldiers were being  made compulsorily redundant, in addition to 142 officers.    The cuts were being made across the Army, including soldiers  in Bosnia and Northern Ireland. After breakfast this morning  commanders were informing their troops who would be getting  their requested voluntary redundancies and who was being forced  to leave.    Army officials declined to say how many redundancy notices  were going to the 2,400 troops in Bosnia, but Gen Wilkes said it  was fewer than last year.    He also declined to say that this third, and last,  redundancy  phase in the 1990 Options for Change cuts would indeed be the  last.    Although the Army is moving about 3,000 support jobs to the  front line, the Ministry of Defence's Front Line First study is  expected to cost extra jobs.    Gen Wilkes said: "We live in a very changing environment. We  will have to get out of the Cold War mentality. When will the  changes stop? We have got to reconcile ourselves to be flexible  to any changes that are thrown out."    The redundancies fall heaviest on junior and senior NCOs and  on 31 colonels and 25 brigadiers.    They will all receive comprehensive redundancy packages  totalling 250 million pounds. Older brigadiers will, if they  commute some of their pensions, receive tax-free payments of  about 200,000.    However, politicians objected from all three major parties.  Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative MP for Upminster and chairman  of the Commons Defence Committee, said he was concerned at the  size of the redundancy list, the largest of the three phases.    Mr David Clark, Shadow defence secretary, said: "Once again  the Government are badly mis-managing British military forces.  It is outrageous that our troops will be sacked while they are  risking their lives in Bosnia."    Mr Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman,  said: "This decision is foolish and insensitive.    "It will severely damage morale and it will undoubtedly  affect the ability of the Army to meet its obligations."</p>

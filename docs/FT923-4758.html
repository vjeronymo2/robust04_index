			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hutchison Whampoa takes half share in Shanghai container port HUTCHISON Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, has acquired 50 per cent of Shanghai's container port for HKDollars 1.4bn (USDollars 181.2m). The container terminal is to be modernised and expanded to almost double its existing capacity by 1995. Hutchison owns 60.5 per cent of Hong Kong International Terminals (HIT), the world's largest privately-owned container terminal operator, which will manage the Shanghai port operations with the Shanghai Port Authority, Hutchison's joint venture partner. The port of Shanghai lies at the mouth of the Yangtze river and is the outlet for China's growing industrial heartland. Brokers welcomed the news. Hutchison recently announced a HKDollars 1.42bn write-down of the value of its investment in Husky Oil, and followed this by a share placement at the resultant low stock price. The newly-formed Shanghai Container Terminals (SCT) will control Shanghai's three existing terminals, which have a combined capacity of 850,000 TEUs (20ft equivalent units). By 1995, capacity is expected to be increased to 1.6m TEUs. In addition, SCT will have preferential development rights for a planned container terminal in the new 350sq km economic development zone of Pudong. The deal comes at a good time for HIT, which is involved in a battle for Hong Kong's ninth container terminal. If it loses, it will reach full capacity by 1995, with a throughput of 3.9m TEUs a year. Shanghai would add a further 41 per cent to that capacity.</p>

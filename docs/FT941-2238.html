			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Leading Article: The Korean conundrum International frustration is understandably growing at North Korea's refusal to allow full inspections of its nuclear facilities. With today's expected referral of the issue by the International Atomic Energy Agency to the UN Security Council, the frustration appears to be approaching the point of western action against Pyongyang. But in contemplating action - whether economic sanctions or something more direct - the US and its allies need to tread with the utmost caution. The latest threats from Pyongyang to turn the South Korean capital into a 'sea of fire' attest that they are dealing with an adversary of uncertain motivation and highly unpredictable reactions. Moreover, they have precious few options that seem likely to influence its behaviour in the way they wish. Part of the problem is that nobody outside has the faintest idea what is really going on in North Korea. While some western intelligence agencies claim that Pyongyang has a well-advanced programme to develop, deploy or sell nuclear weapons, other sources say the North Koreans are engaged in a giant game of bluff with the aim of securing US diplomatic recognition and forestalling a German-style absorption of their country by the South. Unconfirmed rumours abound of power struggles and of the imminent demise of ruler Kim Il-Sung. More solid evidence exists of severe economic problems in North Korea, which lend an air of desperation to the regime's behaviour. If not even North Korea's compatriots in Seoul can read its motives and likely responses, how can the west hope to frame a well-judged policy to contain its destabilising potential? Trade sanctions In the circumstances, there is bound to be a temptation to ratchet up the pressure through trade sanctions. There are a number of difficulties with this course, however. First, it is far from certain that such a measure would pass the UN Security Council. A sanctions resolution would very probably be vetoed by China, still at least a nominal ally to Pyongyang. Second, it is not clear what sanctions would achieve, beyond driving the Kim Il-Sung regime deeper into its laager. North Korea is already an international pariah; even if China co-operated with attempts to isolate it further, an embargo would leak to an extent that would enable Pyongyang to defy it for a considerable time. At worst, sanctions could provide North Korea - as it has frequently warned  -with a casus belli. Although some members of the Pyongyang regime might welcome such a confrontational diversion from their current plight, it is certain that hardly anyone else, in South Korea, China, Japan or the west, would relish such a prospect. Whatever the justified alarm about the implications of North Korea's alleged nuclear programme - in sparking a new arms race in Asia or setting back the international fight against nuclear proliferation - the west is in no mood to form a Gulf war-style military coalition to destroy it. Close neighbour Where does that leave the many countries in Asia and beyond that are anxious to neutralise the North Korean threat? Their least undesirable option is enlisting Chinese assistance in defusing the crisis. China, as a 'friend' and major trading partner, is the only power that has a chance of bringing Pyongyang to heel. In theory, as a close neighbour, it should have every interest in co-operating to foster peace and stability in the Korean peninsula. Instability could disrupt its march towards market-driven prosperity; hostilities, as happened four decades ago, might well force it to side with a regime from which it has done much to distance itself in recent years. The trouble is that the US - currently at loggerheads with Beijing on trade and human rights - is not best placed to seek Chinese co-operation on this issue. China, while making co-operative noises, has shown little public sign of putting pressure on Pyongyang, instead repeatedly counselling the west to show 'patience'. Unfortunately, Beijing may be right. Without active Chinese assistance, the west - forced to sit tight until the Pyongyang regime collapses under the weight of its contradictions - may find patience is its only option.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Arts: The Dutch Courtesan - Theatre Whatever scholars of English literature may tell you, with a few exceptions there is not a lot to be said for Elizabethan/Jacobean drama outside Shakespeare, Jonson and Marlowe. So it is a great pleasure to find such a fine production of John Marston's The Dutch Courtesan at the Orange Tree in Richmond. Marston was not a prolific playwright. He had an Italian mother, was educated at Oxford and wrote a couple of tragedies before turning to a bawdy kind of comedy. The Dutch Courtesan was first performed around 1605, early in the reign of King James I. Not long afterwards Marston gave up the stage for the church - possibly because he was in trouble with court censorship. He took up the living in Christchurch, Hampshire and died in 1634. One of the many merits of this production by Sam Walters is that the bawdy is not played up for its own sake. Another is that there are no gimmicks. The piece is played absolutely straight: costumes more or less of the time and nothing extraneous. It reflects the London of the period, a booming, rather cosmopolitan city with a natural share of knaves, dupes and clever women. It is possibly slightly xenophobic in that the only real villain is the Dutch courtesan. The English villains repent and even the English fools are likeable. There is no single key character. Indeed there are at least eight parts that anyone remotely qualified would love to play, plus one or two smaller ones like Holofernes Reinscure, the barber's boy, acted here with a wonderfully retarded smile by Vincent Brimble. (Brimble plays other parts as well.) All the characters have slightly odd names. The bawd is called Mary Faugh. The principal English villain, sometimes masquerading as a Scot, is known simply as Cocledemoy. David Timson looks as if he is thoroughly enjoying himself in this part, but the production never lets the spotlight linger too long on one person. Anyway it is Cocledemoy's main dupe - a vintner called Mulligrub - who has the best opportunities. Mulligrub loses practically everything, including almost his neck as he finally appears on the gallows. Frank Moorey's performance is a marvellous study in the frustrated rage of a stupid but benevolent man. The women excel. In the early scenes Amanda Royle's courtesan is devastatingly attractive: butch, gamin, almost no make-up, physically lithe and with an accent that is foreign without being exaggerated. It is a pity that she has to turn so nasty afterwards. The main English women are educated English roses. There is a theatrical in-joke here that must have seemed obvious at the time. One of them is called Beatrice; however, it is her sister Crispinella who plays very much the role of Beatrice in Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing. Caroline Gruber as Crispinella looks ravishingly beautiful; Janine Wood as Beatrice altogether more earnest. Other Shakespearean references will come to mind: the nurse Putifer (Auriol Smith) owes something to Romeo and Juliet; the scene with Mulligrub in the stocks, and the bumbling inefficiency of the night watchmen. The play is written in a mixture of prose and verse. It is like a Shakespeare comedy without the poetry and ultimately without the magic. It also lacks Ben Jonson's sharpness. But it is still very professional. The prize for putting it together so convincingly must go to Walters. The Dutch Courtesan, Orange Tree, Richmond, until November 28. (081) 940 3633</p>

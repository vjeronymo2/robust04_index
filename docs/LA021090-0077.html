			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIA INTERIM COUNCIL VOTES TO EXPAND  </P> <P> The Council of National Unity, formed to give all registered political parties  a say in governing Romania until the May elections, held its first meeting  Friday and decided to expand itself by a third to 241 members.  </P> <P> Interim President Ion Iliescu, who led organizational talks in the former  National Assembly building, apparently will lead the council, but no formal  vote was taken.  </P> <P> The Assembly building is being used for the first time since the uprising  against Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was overthrown Dec. 22 and  executed with his wife, Elena, on Christmas Day. It also is the first time  since the revolution that opposition groups have had a role in leadership.  </P> <P> After heated debate on whether new organizations representing ethnic minorities  should be admitted, the council voted to expand its size from 180 to 241. A  statement issued later said some delegates wanted the new groups limited to  observer status.  </P> <P> As envisaged in the original 180-seat council, political parties and the  non-party bloc each were to get 90 seats.  </P> <P> In the expanded 241-seat Council agreed upon Friday, 105 seats will go to 35  parties. Nine organizations representing ethnic minorities will get 27 seats,  three will go to former political prisoners and 106 are assigned to prominent  Romanians who were part of the National Salvation Front.  </P></p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK risks losing millions in EU aid Britain risks losing European Union aid worth up to Ecu674m (Pounds 525m), intended to retrain workers in frontline industries, because it is refusing to apply for it, the European Commission confirmed yesterday. Senior Commission officials warned that the UK would not be allowed to 'opt out' of this policy, which is intended to lift EU competitiveness, and to which Britain's partners are committed. The UK government's refusal to draw down its full EU aid entitlements comes as it faces a potentially damaging revolt by right-wing Conservative MPs because of planned increases in UK and other member states' contributions to the Union's budget. The aid Britain risks foregoing comes under the so-called Objective 4 of the European Social Fund. This policy, agreed by all member states in mid-1993, is designed to boost the skills of workers in industries being restructured. Previously, Social Fund money was aimed exclusively at young and long-term unemployed, while Objective 4 targets workers in threatened industries in order to prevent them from becoming unemployed. The UK regards this switch in funding as part of a French-inspired Commission effort to build up an industrial policy by subterfuge, and wants to be allowed to spend all Social Fund money on the jobless. The Commission yesterday agreed on a share-out of Objective 4 funds for the UK's partners, but confirmed that it was 'holding in reserve' finance for which Britain had submitted no programme. Britain is entitled to a total of Ecu3.37bn under the Social Fund in 1994-99. Under the Commission formula, about 80 per cent of this would go to training the unemployed, and 20 per cent to Objective 4 - in the UK's case, therefore, some Ecu674m. The UK has asked for 95 per cent of its full Social Fund entitlement in 1994-96 - the first half of the scheme - but purely for funding training for the jobless and ignoring Objective 4. Brussels has allowed this through, while withholding the 5 per cent remnant worth Ecu80m. But it is insisting that the UK redress the balance towards the Objective 4 programme in the second half of the scheme, in 1997-99. Brussels officials say they are prepared to be flexible, allowing Britain to spend perhaps no more than 10 per cent of its Social Fund grant on retraining employed workers. But Mr Padraig Flynn, EU social affairs commissioner, made clear yesterday that 'all member states should implement Objective 4'. 'Flexibility in dividing up the spending does not extend to opting out,' he warned. Mr Flynn would not spell out publicly the consequences for Britain if it continued to boycott the retraining policy, beyond stressing that 'we have no indication we are going to get a programme from the UK' to take up its Objective 4 entitlements. Britain has traditionally got the largest single share of the EU Social Fund. In 1989-93 it received Ecu2bn out of the Ecu7.4bn total; its full entitlement of nearly Ecu3.4bn in 1994-99 stands against a total of Ecu14bn parcelled out to all member states. The Commission retains a portion of the Fund for programmes it runs itself. These include the Adapt scheme for upgrading industrial skills across the Union, from which the UK should get Ecu250m in 1994-99. Commission officials see virtually no difference between Objective 4 and the Adapt programme. 'It's puzzling that (British) ideological differences don't appear to extend that far,' one Brussels official remarked yesterday.</p>

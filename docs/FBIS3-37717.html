Last week, three party officials -- Viktor Kobelyev,  Vyacheslav Marychyev and Alexander Pronin -- spoke of their  disagreement with actions and speeches by Party Chairman  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Deputy Speaker of the State Duma  Aleksandr Vengerovskiy.    Zhirinovskiy said that "no one stands to benefit from any  disarray within party ranks." As an example, he pointed to the  Russia's Choice Party which was defeated in the December  election because of disunity despite an enormous financial  backing and President Yeltsin's rule of the country.    "We have unity, a policy and leader and the party's rating  is  going up at a breakneck speed," he said.    The LDP leader warned that from now on, any conflicts must  be  resolved within the faction and should never be taken up with  parliament. "What our opponents want is party infighting and we  must not give them a chance," he said.    Zhirinovskiy called to suppress any betrayal from within.  "If  you dislike it, put your party card and deputy mandate on the  table and start from scratch in some other party," he told the  LDP deputies.    Zhirinovskiy also said that to avert a party split, the  party  chairman must be granted congressional powers in between party  congresses offering for appropriate amendments to be made in  party rules during the LDP's next forum in April. In his view,  the party leader must be made responsible for all issues --  personnel, financial and others -- in between party congresses.  The LDP's supreme council should play a consultative role while  the party chairman "like Russia in the U.N. Security Council"  must be allowed to veto down any council resolutions,  Zhirinovskiy said. This brought no comment from council members.    Zhirinovskiy said that from now on, his first deputy and  editor-in-chief of the party sponsored "Liberal" newspaper  Stanislav Zhebrovskiy would handle contacts with the LDP's  regional branches (earlier, Viktor Kobelyev's area of  responsibility). One other council member Aleksandr  Vengerovskiy is to be responsible for day-to-day management of  the party faction in parliament.    The two disgraced party members, Viktor Kobelyev and  Aleksandr Pronin, were conspicuously absent at the meeting while  the third one, Vyacheslav Marychyev, left it five minutes after  journalists. Eyewitnesses say there was "a tough male talk" in  those five minutes with Marychyev demanding an apology from  Vengerovskiy for having called him "a black sheep" in a recent  TV interview. Marychyev told reporters that he would quit the  party unless Vengerovskiy apologized.</p>

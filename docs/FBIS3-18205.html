Mr. Major spoke out before a breakfast at the British  Embassy  in Washington with Warren Christopher, the U.S. Secretary of  State, and other senior members of the U.S. Administration.    He said: "The United Nations passed a Security Council  resolution very nearly a year ago establishing a no fly zone.  That no-fly zone was plainly infringed.    "There was no reason for these planes to be there. They were  there with hostile intent.    "They were given a warning. They declined that warning.  They were shot down and frankly they could expect nothing else."    As expected, Mr. Major was giving full-hearted support to  action by U.S. war planes, which are part of the United Nations  contingent in the region.    He will express his support to President Clinton when the  two  leaders meet in Pittsburgh later today.    There was talk that the incident might cause the President  to  cancel a visit he was making to Chicago before meeting the Prime  Minister, but it seemed he was going ahead with his planned  programme.    The Prime Minister made clear he was 100 percent behind the  action. The incident is sure to dominate the talks betweeen the  two leaders.    Bill Perry, U.S. Secretary of Defence, who was attending the  breakfast with the Prime Minister, said: "We have incomplete  information about precisely what happened."    He said six Galeb aircraft were on a bombing mission.    "This was in strict violation of the United Nations  resolution."    The NATO air patrol issued a warning, but this was ignored.    "The F-16's attacked them and shot down four of the six.  This is as much information as we have at this time."    In London, Tory Peter Viggers, another member of the Commons  Defence Select Committee, said: "This is exactly the kind of  measure that could lead to an escalation of the war. We must  all hope that people remain calm and this does not lead to an  escalation."    Downing Street said the possible ramifications for security  of British troops would be assessed "on the ground" by the UN  and NATO.    "We are not rushing in with precipitate words at this stage.  It is far too early after the event," a senior Government  official said.    Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on ITN at lunchtime  that UN troops in Bosnia were well equipped to defend themselves  if attacked -- and had authority do so.    "The British Government has, as have other Governments, made  it clear from the begining that if UN forces are fired at, they  have the right to defend themselves by whatever means is  appropriate, and that includes using air power," he added.</p>

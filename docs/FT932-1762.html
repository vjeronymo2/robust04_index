			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pressure builds up in aluminium market IT IS ONLY a matter of time before the aluminium market succumbs to renewed downward pressure on prices, suggests Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. 'Demand remains poor, stocks continue to accumulate and still producers are demonstrating a strong reluctance to respond to calls for further hefty cuts in production,' says Mr Angus MacMillan, Billiton's research manager. Outlining in Billiton's latest weekly Metals Report those aluminium production cuts already announced, Mr MacMillan points out that the only recent addition to the total has been the closure of a second 45,000-tonnes-a-year pot line at Alusuisse's smelter in Germany. This follows the closure of a first pot line in March of last year. On the other hand, Columbia Aluminium in the US has restarted 17,000 tonnes of annual capacity at its Goldendale smelter, citing cash flow problems, and Spain's Inespal, after long talks with the unions, decided not to cut production or close either its Aviles or La Coruna smelters. Such moves could have resulted in the loss of about 73,000 tonnes of capacity. Instead it is to cut its workforce by about one third between 1994 and 1997.</p>

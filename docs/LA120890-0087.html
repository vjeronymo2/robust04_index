			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOLIS, PATTON HOSPITALIZED AFTER 3-HORSE SPILL  </P> <P> Jockeys Alex Solis, Robbie Davis and Dave Patton escaped serious injury in a  three-horse spill during the first race Friday at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> The accident occurred when Fields Of Belles, Patton's mount, broke down  entering the stretch.  </P> <P> Solis, riding Baffis Habitony, and Davis, aboard Vaunty, went down when they  were unable to avoid the fallen horse and rider.  </P> <P> Davis, who was able to walk away from the spill, was taken to Centinela  Hospital Medical Center, where X-rays of his right arm proved negative. He was  sent home and cleared to ride this weekend.  </P> <P> Solis, who is third in the Hollywood Park rider standings behind Chris McCarron  and Kent Desormeaux, and Patton, both suffered concussions and were to spend in  the hospital for observation.  </P> <P> Solis, who was scheduled to ride Balla Cove in today's $100,000 Affirmed  Handicap and Formal Dinner in Sunday's $1-million Hollywood Futurity, also was  treated for a scalp bruise. Doctors said Solis could ride if he is feeling well  enough.  </P> <P> Patton, who didn't regain consciousness until he reached the hospital, required  stitches for a scalp cut.  </P> <P> Fields Of Belles, a 3-year-old maiden filly making her second start for trainer  Mark MacDonald, broke the cannon bone in her right foreleg and was destroyed.  Baffis Habitony and Vaunty were not injured.  </P></p>

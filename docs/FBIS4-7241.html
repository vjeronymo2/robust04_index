			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 28 (YONHAP) -- Russia has yet to send  military experts to witness the dismantling of a decommissioned  submarine it sold to North Korea as stipulated in the contract,  diplomatic sources here said Thursday.    Due to Russia's failure to implement the terms of the  contract, western countries are worried that Pyongyang might use  the submarine for military purposes, the sources said.    According to the contract, Russia must send military experts  for on-the-spot observation to confirm that the submarine is  used only as scrap iron and not for military reasons.    The sources said North Korea began dismantling the submarine  it purchased from Russia some months ago, but without  on-the-spot observation by Russian experts, the North Koreans  could use the submarine for military purposes.    For example, Pyongyang could use the parts in its own  submarines or try to improve its military technology by  examining the Russian sub, according to the sources.    Concerned about this possibility, Japan recently asked  Russia  to dispatch military experts to North Korea to observe the  submarine's dismantling, ITAR-TASS reported from Tokyo Thursday.    Russia contracted with North Korea, through the mediation of  a Japanese trading company, to sell 12 decommissioned submarines  and has delivered one so far.    The Russian Navy Command earlier clarified that the  dismantling of the submarine will be observed by Russian  military experts and that it must be used only as scrap iron.</p>

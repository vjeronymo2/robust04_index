			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of the growing use of dry storage technology, the NRC has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gained over 35 staff years of experience in the review and licensing of dry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spent fuel storage systems. In addition, the NRC draws upon the knowledge and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience of outside scientists and engineers recognized as experts within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their respective fields in the performance of the independent safety analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the system and component designs submitted by applicants for dry cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licenses or certification. Reviews of numerous applications seeking site-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific licenses, certificates of compliance, or approvals of topical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports, have been conducted over the past eight years. More recently, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28496), which proposed to amend 10 CFR 72.214 to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one additional spent fuel storage cask (i.e., the VECTRA Technologies, Inc.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular Storage System) on the list of approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spent fuel storage casks that power reactor licensees may use under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of a general license issued by NRC in accordance with 10 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 72, Subpart K. The Standardized NUHOMS consists of two systems: (1) The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUHOMS&hyph;24P holds 24 specified pressurized-water reactor spent fuel assemblies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (2) The NUHOMS&hyph;52B holds 52 specified boiling-water reactor spent fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assemblies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequent to the expiration of the 75-day public comment period on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 16, 1994, NRC received a request, dated August 11, 1994, for a 6-week  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extension of the comment period from Connie Kline of the Sierra Club on behalf  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 12 citizen groups. The extension request asserted that several proprietary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents related to this rulemaking were not available to the public for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 2 weeks at the beginning of the comment period. The NRC granted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the request on August 29, 1994 (59 FR 44381) by extending the public comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period to September 30, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VECTRA Technologies, Inc. (formerly Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to the NRC a Safety Analysis Report (SAR) entitled ``Safety Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Report for the Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular Storage System for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Irradiated Nuclear Fuel,'' NUH&hyph;003, Revision 2, dated November 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequently, VECTRA Technologies, Inc. provided additional information to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC related to the SAR. In March 1994, the NRC issued a draft Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation Report (SER) entitled ``Safety Evaluation Report of Pacific Nuclear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fuel Services, Inc. Safety Analysis Report for the Standardized NUHOMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Horizontal Storage System for Irradiated Nuclear Fuel'' approving the SAR. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC issued a draft Certificate of Compliance by letter to Mr. Robert D. Quinn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Mr. Frederick C. Sturz dated April 28, 1994. These documents are part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the docket and record that support the proposed rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28496).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The objective of 10 CFR Part 72 is to protect the public health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety by providing for the safe confinement of the stored fuel and preventing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the degradation of the fuel cladding. The review criteria used by the NRC for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review and approval of dry cask storage under 10 CFR Part 72 consider the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following factors: siting, design, quality assurance, emergency planning,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training, and physical protection of the fuel. Phenomena such as earthquakes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high winds, tornados, tornado driven missiles, lightning, and floods are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the review of a specific system, either for a certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance or a site-specific license. In addition, applicants must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate to NRC's satisfaction that their proposed dry cask system will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resist man-made events such as explosions, fire, and drop or tipover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidents. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The design bases for these events and accidents are contained within 10 CFR Part 72. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on further NRC review and analysis of public comments, both the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SER and Certificate of Compliance for the Standardized NUHOMS were modified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section M contains a description of changes to the SER and Certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance in response to public comments. The NRC finds that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS, as designed and when fabricated and used in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the conditions specified in its Certificate of Compliance, meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of 10 CFR Part 72. Thus, use of the Standardized NUHOMS, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by the NRC, will provide adequate protection of the public health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety and the environment. With this final rule, the NRC is approving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of the Standardized NUHOMS under the general license in 10 CFR Part 72,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart K, by holders of power reactor operating licenses under 10 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 50. Simultaneously, the NRC is issuing a final Certificate of Compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be effective on January 23, 1995. A copy of the Certificate of Compliance is available for public inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Lower Level), Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Responses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the proposed addition of the Standardized NUHOMS,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 239 comments in 27 letters with one supplement were received from individuals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public interest groups, an environmental group, an association, industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives, a city, states, and one Federal agency. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrew his comments. Many of these letters contained similar comments that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been grouped together and addressed as a single issue. All comments have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been grouped into 15 broad issues designated A through O. A summary of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments and an NRC analysis and response to those comments is included for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each broad issue. The NRC has identified and responded to 89 separate issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that include the significant points raised by each commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

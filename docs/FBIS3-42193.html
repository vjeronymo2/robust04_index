Information obtained by  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI affirms that Turkey's minister of foreign  affairs returned from his "historic" visit to Israel with a plan  for the two countries to cooperate on security matters. This  would involve the implementation of a Turkish military plan to  send commando units to al-Biqa' and to Syria under the pretext  of shelling the PKK's positions. However, the real objective of  this plan, which received Washington's blessing, was to drag  Syria into the peace process by closing in on it and  intensifying the pressure on it. What are the particulars of  this plan? Why did Turkey reveal the Israeli cards it has been  holding at this time in particular? And what will it receive as  its payback?    Late last October, an emergency secret meeting was called by  Tansu Ciller, the prime minister of Turkey. The meeting was held  in her office, the prime minister's office in Ankara, and it was  attended by Ms. Ciller; by Mehmet Golhan, the minister of  defense; and by Dogan Gures, the chief of staff of Turkey's  armed forces.    At that meeting Ciller stressed the need to adopt a new  military action plan to fight what she called Kurdish terrorism.  She was referring specifically to operations by the PKK, which  is led by Abdullah Ocalan, also known as Apo. Recently, these  operations took a grave turn for the worse when General Aydin,  the chief of police, was assassinated in Diyarbakir. Aydin's  assassination aggravated Turkey's official position to such a  degree that Ciller removed Nevzat Ayaz, the minister of defense,  from his position. Ciller then issued very strong statements,  threatening neighboring countries who were supporting "Kurdish  terrorism." [She was referring] specifically to Syria and Iran.    Ciller started her meeting with senior military officials  with a pessimistic pronouncement expressing her disappointment  with the failure of previous military plans. She called for the  application of a new, more repressive strategy aimed at putting  an end to "Kurdish terrorism" once and for all. Application of  this strategy would start now, and it would continue through the  end of 1994. Ciller angrily pointed out to those officials that  their former strategy will have to be considered a failure, and  she read in front of them the most recent security report  prepared by Turkish intelligence. The report explained the  particulars of the strict security and military measures that  had recently been taken to pursue armed Kurds in southeast and  east Anatolia. More than 150,000 soldiers supported by the most  modern tanks, armored vehicles, explosives, and war planes had  been deployed in the region. Militias made up of Kurdish area  residents were utilized, and weapons as well as monthly salaries  were sometimes placed at their disposal to secure their  assistance in pursuing the armed Kurds. The Turkish army was  using all forms of repression against the population. Sometimes,  entire villages were burned, and the residents of those villages  were driven out of their homes. Although all Turkish security  agencies--the army, police soldiers, police officers,  intelligence officers, and special forces--took part in all  these battles and operations, Ciller herself asserts that they  were not able to bring about a resolution of the military  situation. Nor were they able to stop attacks by the PKK's  forces against security personnel, tourists, trains, and  economic facilities.    Ciller then asked the new minister of defense to give her  his  analysis of the reasons why the strategy had failed and [his  assessment] of the strength of the PKK fighters. He replied,  "Our information indicates that the PKK has more than 10,000  fighters, and perhaps 15,000. Kurdish residents who support the  PKK do so either out of conviction or as a result of coercion.  The problem, however, lies in the support the PKK is receiving  from outside the Turkish borders, because it is that support  that is allowing the PKK to make preparations for its  operations, to train its operatives, and to supply itself with  weapons. This is what is happening in Iran, in Iraq, and even in  Syria. It is also happening in the PKK's camps in Lebanon's  al-Biqa' Valley."  <H5>  A New Strategy </H5>   The Turkish prime minister shuddered and said, "They have to  be stopped. This is a crucial matter for the stability of  Turkey's security, economy, and international standing. A new  plan to fight terrorism must be devised, and everything has to  be utilized in that fight, even if we have to fight battles in  Iran, Iraq, and Syria and risk the danger of war breaking out  with those countries." Ciller then took out from one of the  drawers in her desk a report, which had been prepared for her by  military intelligence. She briefed the two men who were meeting  with her about the main points of that report, and she said that  it was incumbent on us to move in that direction and to prepare  an integrated military plan.    Ciller issued a new, strong statement after that meeting,  threatening Iran and Syria with a campaign to pursue the  terrorists inside their territories. After all, the terrorists  had been pursued for years inside Iraqi territory, and Iraqi  Kurds subordinate to Barzani and Talabani have been taking part  in those operations. Most Turkish military personnel and  politicians joined this stepped-up pursuit of the Kurds, and  Turkey's chief of staff declared, "We will put an end to the PKK  before the spring of 1994."    In early November it was noticed that Syria was the focus of  the campaign mounted by Turkish officials. They would sometimes  accuse Syria of offering the PKK support and giving it refuge on  Syrian territory, and at other times they would raise once again  the issue of PKK camps in Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley as well as  that of increased Kurdish operations near the Syrian-Turkish  borders. Last week Turkey's intensified political and media  campaign against Syria became extremely brazen, and its  implications became very grave when Hikmet Cetin, the minister  of foreign affairs in Ankara, took advantage of his visit to  Israel--it was the first such visit--and repeated the threat to  Syria. But Cetin added other indications to the threat when he  spoke unequivocally about "the need for cooperation between  Israel and Ankara to fight against Syrian supported terrorism."  Cetin accused Damascus of continuing its support for the PKK,  and he revealed upon returning to his country that "a new stage  in Turkey's relationship with Israel had begun." He reiterated  his rejection of the prospect that some areas of the Middle East  turn into free zones for terrorist activity. Cetin went further  than that in his military statements when he said that Turkey  "intended to respond to any terrorist action launched directly  or indirectly from its neighbors' territory. Such an issue could  not possibly be left without resolution." He added, "The future  of relations with Syria depends first of all on the elimination  of terrorism."    The implications of the warning issued by Ankara were  quickly  grasped by those who have been watching developments and  monitoring the secrets of Turkish politics and the question of  the PKK. And yet, given the public and unequivocal entry of  Israel into the picture, these observers wondered with  considerable concern about the implications of the warning and  its [possible] aftermath. They wondered, specifically, about  what Turkey and Israel had in store for Syria, the country which  was obviously becoming the object of attention, and they  wondered also about the roles the new Turkish-Israeli alliance  would play in the region.    Information available to AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI affirms that  Turkey's minister of foreign affairs visited Israel against the  backdrop of the new strategy devised by Turkey's military and  political leaders. The Turkish minister's visit to Israel was  not made in the context of making a contribution to promote the  peace process. The Turkish minister did not go to Israel to play  a part in the multilateral negotiations and in [the talks over]  the problem of water. The minister went to Israel in an attempt  to put an end to the PKK and in an effort to get Israel to make  a security contribution to that effort. The magnitude of that  contribution could become greater in light of developments in  the peace process.    This information indicates that Turkey's new military plan,  which was approved to fight the PKK, includes a declaration of  some sort indicating that all the [country's] military  capabilities would be mobilized and all of Turkey's regional and  international cards would be utilized to bring about the success  of the plan. Turkey's new military plan is based on increasing  the number of personnel in the Turkish army from 700,000 to 1  million soldiers. Military operations against PKK fighters in  Turkey would be stepped up, and those PKK fighters would be  pursued on land and in the air inside Iran's, Iraq's, and  Syria's borders, even if clashes with these countries' forces  were to become necessary and lead to the creation of tension in  relations with them. In conjunction with this plan Ankara would  go back to using the waters of the Euphrates as a weapon to  apply pressure to Damascus.    The new plan would also continue the policy of planting  mines  on the borders and moving forward with the establishment of an  electronic security zone along the border with Syria. This plan,  whose estimated cost exceeds $10 million, is being implemented  in close cooperation with Israeli military experts. This close  cooperation on security matters came about after Israel's  military experts persuaded Turkey to set up a security zone  similar to Israel's security zone in south Lebanon and to  improve upon it.    However, new developments in the Turkish security plan--and  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI was able to obtain details of this  plan--place emphasis on a larger role that Turkish intelligence  and special commando units would be playing in going after PKK  fighters in Turkey and in Iran, Syria, and Lebanon as well. To  this end, Ciller quickly approved the establishment of a  "special army." That is, she approved the establishment of  private militias that would not be officially affiliated with  the Turkish armed forces. These militias would be made up of  ordinary citizens who would be trained in combat, infiltration,  and explosive techniques. Included in that army also would be  Kurds from all countries, who are known for their support for  Turkey and their work for Turkish intelligence. That is, Kurds  from Iran, Iraq, and Syria would be included in that army, which  would also include units made up of Turkish Muslims, known as  Turkey's Hizballah, a group which has been engaged in war  against the PKK for quite some time.  <H5>  Turkish Commandos in al-Biqa' Valley </H5>   What will be the role of those militias? Based on  information  that has been leaked about the Turkish plan, it seems that  military and political leaders in Ankara will charge those  militias with the task of carrying out sabotage operations in  Iran and Syria. Those militias would conduct  counter-infiltration operations across the borders, and they  would penetrate the ranks of other Kurds. This information adds  that emphasis in the Turkish plan is still being placed on  shelling PKK camps in Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley and that  consideration is also being given to shelling some of the PKK's  locations in Syria. 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam, the vice president of  Syria, declared unequivocally that his country would not condone  having "any party use Syrian territory as a base from which the  security of any neighboring country would be violated." No  international source nor even any anti-Syrian intelligence  agency has so far confirmed the possibility that Turkey's  accusations might be valid.    Information available to AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI indicates that  the Turkish military plan to shell the PKK's positions in  al-Biqa' Valley was the subject of the security talks which were  conducted in Israel by Ankara's minister of foreign affairs.  That [in fact] was the main purpose of the visit. It is known  that economic cooperation between the two countries underwent  significant development in recent years and that the volume and  nature of trade has been such that large amounts of Turkish  water have been exported on oil tankers which dock periodically  in the port of Haifa. The Jewish lobby, which exercises strong  influence in Turkey, played a major role in reinforcing the  growing closeness between these two countries on political and  security issues. Turkey and Israel, located in an Arab and  Islamic world, share a concern about their relationship with  Europe, and they also share the role of defending Western and  U.S. interests in the context of NATO, an organization in which  Israel plays a supporting role. In the past years Israel started  applying Ben Gurion's theory of "a small zone around the Arab  world," which means relying on Turkey and the Shah's Iran to  form a ring around all the borders of the Arab world. Israel  decided to expand that zone around the Arab world after the  collapse of the Soviet Union by extending it across the Islamic  republics in Central Asia. It penetrated these countries with  the cooperation and coordination of Turkey, which was motivated  by domestic, regional, and international goals and aspirations.  This cooperation between Israel and Turkey strengthened the  cooperation between the two countries on security matters to  "fight terrorism." Ankara received significant services from  Israel, and those services transferred to Turkey the Israelis'  expertise in [dealing with] "terrorism." The Turks even received  detailed reports about the PKK camps in al-Biqa' Valley. These  reports included maps and photographs as well as information  about the movements of the party's leaders and the training of  its elements.    Cetin's recent visit to Israel served as a shot in the arm  for the cooperation between the two countries. Information  affirms that Israel did approve a protocol for some of the  temporary bases that will be used by Turkish commando units on  the Lebanese border strip. Israel agreed to offer these units  all necessary assistance that would enable them to gain access  to al-Biqa' Valley, hit PKK positions, and return [to their  bases] by way of Israel.    But the question that is being asked by observers is this:  Why did Turkey decide to increase the tension between it and  Syria at this time in particular? Why did it decide to bring its  strategic alliances with Israel out in the open? Given the fact  that a strategic alliance with Israel implies not only open  hostility to Syria but also to the Arabs, why did Turkey decide  to do this before the peace process ran its course? Why did it  decide to do this at a time when the region appears to be  starting to move toward a comprehensive peace as well as  regional economic cooperation among all the parties?  <H5>  A Ring Around Syria </H5>   It is known that the latest crisis between Turkey and Syria  over the PKK is not the first such crisis between them. That  crisis between the two countries, who had previously defused the  tension between them, had almost led Ankara to launch a water  war against Damascus. That situation was defused by means of two  high level security protocols, the first of which was signed in  1987. The latter, which was signed last year, affirmed that  problems between the two countries had been resolved and that  the two neighbors had agreed to get rid of the bone of  contention between them that had been caused by the PKK. At that  time contention over the PKK had led Ankara to threaten strikes  against PKK positions in al-Biqa' Valley.    Observers today are wondering in bewilderment about what it  was that they missed that caused Turkey to step up its campaign  against Syria and to make such threats against it. Why would  Turkey go so far as to declare its cooperation with Israel on  security matters? These observers point out that the fatal blows  that are being delivered by the PKK against Turkey are ones that  for the most part are delivered by PKK operations carried out  inside Turkish territory. These operations affirm that the  party's constituency and its power base are in Turkey and not  elsewhere.    That is why observers acted promptly to find other reasons  and other goals for the Turkish-Israeli campaign against  Damascus. It is now certain--and this was revealed by AL-WATAN  AL-'ARABI in issue number 870 dated 5 November 1993--that this  issue is not a simple one, but that it is rather complicated and  involves many other issues and concerns. Turkey is using the PKK  issue with Syria to achieve regional and international  objectives that are no longer a secret to anyone. That is,  Turkey is trying to contribute to the effort to set up a ring  around Syria, to isolate it, and to drag it into the peace  process. Informed sources are saying that when the prime  minister of Turkey returned from Washington some weeks ago, she  appeared to have received the kind of support that strengthened  and emboldened her. She started her campaign against Syria by  coordinating it with Washington and Tel Aviv. It was noticed  that coordination in this campaign placed special emphasis on  the terrorism issue, which is an international winner. While  Israel tried to undermine Syria's international reputation by  raising the issue of its support for "Hizballah terrorists" and  the resistance in Lebanon, Ankara chose to dwell on the support  which Damascus has been giving "Kurdish terrorism." That theme  is heard with sympathy in the West because the PKK kidnaps  foreign tourists and adopts a strategy of carrying out  operations with explosives in European countries against Turkish  interests. It is obvious that the payback Turkey is asking for,  namely, to become a visible member of an Israeli-American  alliance, is one that will strengthen its position for achieving  what it has been aspiring to and striving for. Turkey wants to  become a major power in the region, and it wants to work with  the United States to spread its influence in Central Asia as the  Soviet Union's successor. Turkey wants to penetrate Eastern  Europe by way of the Balkans, and it wants to have the right to  represent the West in the Middle East on an equal footing with  Israel. Turkey wants to benefit from the possible outcome of the  post-peace period.    Turkey's more obvious goal, however, is that of forming a  ring around Syria, preventing it from trying to foil the  Gaza-Jericho Agreement, and applying pressure on it to make it  join the peace process in Sidon with a weaker position and with  fewer cards.    That is why the Syrians regarded the threat that was made by  Cetin in Israel as obvious and expected. Consequently, their  reaction to it was cool and unruffled, because Turkey's action  to carry out such threats and declare the zero hour for the new  Turkish military plan depends, as Turkey's previous threats did,  on the balance [of power] and the variables in the region. The  implementation of Turkey's threats and new military plan depends  also on developments in the talks and on the results of  Christopher's visit to the region, which is scheduled for next  month. The outcome of all that remains to be seen. Until then  Turkey will keep the issue of the PKK alive, and it will  continue making threats.</p>

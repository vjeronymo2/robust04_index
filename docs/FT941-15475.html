			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: GTE to reduce staff by 17,000 GTE, the largest local telecommunications company in the US, yesterday announced pre-tax fourth quarter charges of Dollars 1.8bn, mainly to cover a restructuring of its telephone operations and the loss of 17,000 jobs over the next three years. It is the latest of several large programmes to cut jobs and improve efficiency announced recently by America's local telecommunications companies, which face growing competition from new rivals to their traditional monopolies. GTE, which serves a patchwork of markets across the US, said yesterday's redesign - the result of a management technique known as process engineering  -would give annual cost savings of Dollars 1bn. It would also 'revolutionise' customer service in its telephone operations, which was a critical part of its strategy to compete in the fast changing telecommunication industry. The charges will cut fourth quarter net income by Dollars 1.2bn or Dollars 1.22 a share. The company said that, excluding the charges, 1993 earnings were expected to be in line with analysts' expectations. Some Dollars 1.3bn of the pre-tax charges stem from the re-engineering initiative. They include Dollars 680m to upgrade customer service and administrative systems and software; Dollars 410m for employee separation costs; and Dollars 160m for consolidating facilities. Advanced computer systems mean the group can cut its customer service centres from 171 to 11; revenue collection centres from five to one; and regional centres monitoring its national network will drop from 19 to one. The remainder of the Dollars 1.8bn charge consists of Dollars 350m for the write-down of assets of Spacenet, its satellite communications business, which is being combined with a business serving the US Government; and some Dollars 200m in miscellaneous charges. The job cuts represent 23 per cent of the 73,000 staff of the group's domestic telephone business and 13 per cent of its total labour force. GTE has spent the last few years selling off peripheral businesses to concentrate on local telecommunications, but questions remain about its strategy for the emerging world of inter-active multi-media communications. It is one of the few large local telephone companies not to have announced a significant alliance with a cable television company, although it was one of the first companies to conduct trials of customer demand for inter-active home entertainment.</p>

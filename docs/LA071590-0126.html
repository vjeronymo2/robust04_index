			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKS: CREAMS OF THE CROP;  </P> <P> EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS PROMISE TO FIRM, UNWRINKLE AND SMOOTH DRY SKIN  </P> <P> SOME PEOPLE are so worried about facial wrinkles that they're willing to spend  $100 on a jar of moisturizer. Taking note, the cosmetics industry has expanded  its skin-care focus to the rest of the body and offers such products as $50  jars of green mud that promise younger-looking, radiant skin from the neck  down. That product's manufacturer says it sells "hundreds of thousands" of jars  every year.  </P> <P> Last year, cosmetics products that promised to moisturize and revitalize the  body accounted for about $50 million in U.S. sales. Now, according to recent  industry surveys, that number is increasing by 15% each year. But it's not only  hopes of alleviating parched skin that motivates people to buy these creams,  lotions and oils, nor is it merely the ads that promise a younger, sexier look.  Many consumers look upon these products as a way to help them relax while they  try to improve their skin.  </P> <P> "It's more than a dry-skin issue," says Mary Tumolo, training director at  Princess Marcella Borghese, makers of Fango, the green mud. "It's a given that  a product will moisturize; that's the norm. Now women want a product that does  more." Tumolo contends that consumers who plunk down big dollars for body  creams and lotions are trying to re-create the feeling of a spa in the home.  </P> <P> "I can't afford the time to go to a spa," says Linda Freedman, director of  marketing for a Los Angeles computer-software firm, "and even if I could, I  wouldn't spend $2,000 for a few days at the Golden Door." Instead, she gets  massages twice a month and spends several hundred dollars each year on body  creams and bath products.  </P> <P> Manufacturers insist that relaxation and pampering are only partial  explanations for the body-care boom. "Throughout the '80s, the trend was toward  sophisticated face treatments," says Carol Schuler, a vice president at  Clarins, a firm that specializes in treatment products. "Everyone became body  conscious," she adds. "The awareness that creams could make a difference on the  face led women to look for solutions to body-skin problems."  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration, which monitors cosmetics claims, constantly  reminds consumers that no cosmetic product will lift a breast, flatten a  stomach or smooth a cellulite-plagued bottom. But the popularity of such  products as Biotherm's Actif Ventre Ferme Stomach-Firming Treatment or Clarins'  Cellulite Control Gel indicate that consumers think they're getting results.  Most of these cosmetic creams work in one of two ways. Some, such as bust  creams, plump the skin cells by adding and trapping water on the surface,  causing the skin to feel temporarily firmer. Others, especially anti-cellulite  products, draw water out of the surface cells so the skin looks thinner and  firmer. Results are sometimes noticeable but are always temporary.  </P> <P> These products are no alternative to cosmetic surgery. On the other hand, many  products promise to help soothe, relax and moisturize the body in the bath, and  those often deliver on their promise. The therapeutic benefits of a leisurely  soak, which relaxes the muscles, have long been acknowledged by the medical  community. In addition, psychologists such as Dr. Ellen Siroka Robinson, a New  York-based therapist, recognize the bath's psychological benefits. Robinson,  who leads corporate stress-reducing programs, advocates the bath as a safe and  beneficial alternative to tranquilizers or alcohol for overstressed individuals  who have trouble relaxing.  </P> <P> "A tepid bath helps relax muscles, and the addition of oils and things  appealing to the senses, such as smell, helps soothe and calm," Robinson adds.  That line of thinking has led manufacturers to concentrate on many new products  for the bath. Quite a few, such as Avon's Aroma Spa collection, emphasize the  benefits of aromatherapy, which uses naturally scented essential oils to affect  the mood. Scientists who study scent have found that when certain oils such as  chamomile, basil and rose are added to a bath or massaged into the skin, the  body apparently relaxes more completely. Couple a mood-altering scent and some  moisturizers in a warm bath, and there seems to be a case for manufacturers'  claims that a product "nurtures" or "relaxes the mind and body."  </P> <P> But it's important for consumers to keep in mind that no matter what these  products are called, all of them are still cosmetics, items that are designed  not to substitute for medical treatments but to make good grooming easier and  more pleasurable.  </P></p>

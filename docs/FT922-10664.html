			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Book Review: Ideas into actions MAYNARD KEYNES, AN ECONOMIST'S BIOGRAPHY By D E Moggridge Routledge. Pounds 35. 941 pages John Maynard Keynes was one of the decisive thinkers and shapers of the century. He pointed out that, in a market system, economies can stumble along indefinitely in deep depression without any certainty that they will necessarily correct themselves. A company can improve its position by sacking workers and cutting investment, but not a whole economy. Keynes had nothing but contempt for those who could not, or would not, see beyond the operations of finance to the realities of jobs, incomes and human needs. The idea that Britain could have plentiful unemployed labour and materials and machinery lying idle, and yet could not 'afford' to build new houses or roads or other public works was a 'delirium of mental confusion'. Economics was, for Keynes, not a search for timeless truths, let alone a set of inexorable laws by which we are obliged to live, providing wealth for some and misery for others. Economics was a method of analysis, essentially historical and empirical, a modest and hesitant attempt to apply reason to current problems in order to alleviate them. Because of his unique personal access to the centres of British life, Keynes was able to mount persistent and ultimately successful campaigns to persuade governments to adopt new approaches. From his experience as a Treasury official during the First World War, when he was given huge responsibilities for the overseas financing of the allied war effort, he understood the minds and aspirations of politicians, civil servants, bankers and businessmen. He mastered the complex processes of inquiry, debate, pressures and bargains by which policy is actually made. Since he was clever, rich, self-assured, well-connected, witty, arty, homosexual and usually right, he made many enemies. But his life is a wonderful example of how ideas can make their way into political action. If, in the west, the second half of the century has largely escaped the prolonged mass unemployment, damaging trade wars, and associated political extremism which marked the inter-war years, much of the credit belongs to Keynes. In his large new book, D E Moggridge attempts a comprehensive account. As Keynes himself noted in his vivid biographical sketches of economists, men and ideas cannot be separated. Even the most innovative thinkers share the spirit of their age. Professor Moggridge was one of the editors of the excellent 30-volume edition of Keynes's economic writings published between 1971 and 1989 by the Royal Economic Society and Macmillan. He has also explored the huge archive of personal papers (equivalent to another 100 volumes, he estimates) and other public and private records. He sticks closely to the documents and is more an editor than a biographer. In a misjudged attempt to be comprehensive, he includes a great deal that obscures and slows his narrative. When Keynes joins a committee we are given the names and dates of the other members, and sometimes their subsequent careers even if they never cross his path again. During the years when Keynes was associated with the Bloomsbury group, he can scarcely have tea without our having to be told whether Ottoline or Vanessa or Duncan or Bunnie was there too. Although a Canadian, Moggridge easily slips into the English reverential style, to which books on Bloomsbury seem especially liable, whereby everybody who goes to this or that school or college, or who becomes a member of this or that undergraduate club, remains for ever beautiful and brilliant. The chapters on the economic controversies include slabs of summaries from Keynes's writings. However, Moggridge offers little explanation of the issues and the choices to which they relate or of the comparative magnitudes. Figures in, say, 1925 pounds are meaningless without some indication of whether they were big or small or catastrophic in the circumstances of the day. The book tells us what happened but seldom helps us to understand why. Did Keynes ever admit to himself that the book on which his reputation was built, The Economic Consequences of the Peace, was seriously deficient? Why is his most famous work, the General Theory, so tortuously obscure? When Keynes wrote to persuade, his style was bold and colourful, full of vivid and amusing metaphors, memorable images and striking phrases. Did Keynes make this book inaccessible to keep out policymakers? Did Keynes's intense feelings for Karl Melchior, whom he met at the post-Armistice negotiations, influence his subsequent attitude to Germany, which was sometimes too sympathetic? Many such questions remain largely unaddressed. The best part of the book is the account of Keynes's successful efforts, along with the American, Harry Dexter White, to devise and establish a new postwar regime for international trade and payments. The International Monetary Fund and the Gatt, which even former communist countries are now eager to join, are among the most visible reminders of the scale of his achievement.</p>

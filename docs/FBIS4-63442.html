			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 23 May (IBERIA) -- A so-called  constitutional commission of Abkhazia has completed its work on  Abkhazia's new constitution. It stipulates that Abkhazia is a  sovereign state founding its relations with Georgia on  agreements based on equality. Separatists intend to have the  constitution adopted at a referendum held after Georgian  refugees return to the Abkhazian region.</p>

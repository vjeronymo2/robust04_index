			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Deckel Maho near bankrupt Deckel Maho, one of Germany's largest machine tool companies, is on the verge of declaring itself bankrupt. Mr Werner Schneider, appointed receiver to the Bavaria-based group after it filed for protection against creditors in April, said that a formal application for bankruptcy was the next legal step after it had proved impossible to work out a solution with creditors to guarantee the group's survival. Mr Schneider said, however, that he was hopeful that it would be possible to rescue the group - which owes banks DM530m (Dollars 325.1m) - through a sale to a third party. Discussions are taking place with Traub and Gildemeister, two German machine-tool rivals, but neither company has made a firm offer, Mr Schneider indicated. It would be necessary to cut the workforce by 500 or 600 from 1,700 this week and next, he said. Deckel Maho is itself the product of a merger between two family-controlled south-German manufacturers. This took place last summer on the initiative of Deutsche Bank and Bayerische Vereinsbank in the hope that the merged group would better be able to withstand the severe downturn in the German machine-tools sector. In July last year, the combined group predicted that it would return to profits in three years after an aggressive cost-cutting programme. However, in the year to June 1 1994, turnover was DM340m to DM345m, considerably below planned sales of DM400m, while at the end of May the order book amounted to DM70m, just 2 1/2 months' production. Between 1990 and 1994, the two groups shed 3,000 jobs and combined turnover more than halved. Mr Schneider said that Deckel Maho shares were worthless in view of the group's heavy indebtedness. The takeover by a third party would involve a write-off of existing debt or the conversion of debt into equity, coupled with an injection of fresh capital from the new owner.</p>

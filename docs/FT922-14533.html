			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Debt burden setback for Latin America PROGRESS in lowering Latin America's debt and debt service burdens was interrupted last year, according to the Inter-American Development Bank. In its annual report today, the bank says the ratio of debt service payments to exports - an important measure of the burden of servicing debt - rose from 26 per cent in 1990 to 30 per cent last year. This was due in part to extra debt payments, for example by Brazil, to clear arrears with commercial banks. But it also reflected a slowing in demand for the region's exports stemming from the economic slowdown in the industrial countries, depressed and declining commodity prices and deteriorating terms of trade. Since demand for imports also rose as investment and output increased, the region's trade surplus shrank and its current account deficit expanded substantially. The stock of the debt of Latin America and the Caribbean fell slightly last year from the end-1990 level of Dollars 431.8bn (Pounds 251bn), as debt conversions roughly offset an increase in debt associated with new lending and exchange rate changes. However, foreign direct investment and portfolio investment continued to rise last year. This continued a trend in evidence since 1987: a rise in the proportion of the region's resource inflows 'which do not create debt'. These inflows more than covered the region's rising current account deficit, allowing for a rise in its international reserves. In fact, for some countries, increased imports were the consequence of high real exchange rates associated with the large capital inflows. In a generally positive assessment, the bank said Latin America and the Caribbean made impressive gains in economic growth last year, averaging 2.7 per cent. Nonetheless, average per capita output in the region is still only at the level of a decade and a half ago. This has contributed to 'severe social problems' deriving from high unemployment, depressed incomes and poor provision of social services. Many countries plan new initiatives to alleviate poverty, increasing the cost effectiveness of the delivery of social services and improving the targeting of such services. During 1991, the bank approved loans for more money than ever: 77 loans committing Dollars 5.42bn, up nearly 40 per cent on 1990. Of this, Dollars 2bn was committed in fast-disbursing balance of payments loans to encourage economic reform. Nicaragua and Peru cleared the arrears with the bank in 1991, allowing them to resume borrowing from the bank. Panama has done so this year, leaving no countries with so-called non-accrual status.

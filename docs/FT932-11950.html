			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Arts: Just a comic-strip Moll It was a good idea to stage Daniel Defoe's Moll Flanders; I can easily imagine a big production along the lines of the RSC's Nicholas Nickleby. And it would have been a bright idea to set it to music, were there a composer with the talent for it. Moll Flanders (1722) is the English counterpart to the Abbe Prevost's Manon Lescaut (1733). Both Moll and Manon are women who learn how to use sex and crime (and to forgo love) for economic gain. Both are departed to the New World. But whereas Manon - whose fatal allure appealed so much to the Romantics - has acquired famous reincarnations in opera and ballet, Moll, a more liberated lady who is in firmer control of her own destiny, is too little known. . But here the writer Claire Luckham has told Defoe's richly adult tale as if Moll were a strip-cartoon for 14-year-olds. Everything is all narrative, silly tableaux, and more narrative, with the odd bubble of live dialogue (sung) popping out of the characters' heads. Only when Moll returns for the last time to London, and discovers thieving, does the show stop treating the 18th century in terms of cheap caricature; and, as with so many inferior musicals, the most gripping moments are spoken. Paul Leigh's lyrics are in wiseguy rhymester vein. They have a certain satirical energy which - though it grows tedious overall - animates such episodes as Moll's arrival in Bath. A good composer might just have injected this libretto with enough lyricism to make it winning. But George Stiles's score - partly based, along The Beggar's Opera lines, on period tunes - is deft and negligible. The only tune that could stay in your head is good old Greensleeves, which becomes Moll's and Jemmy's big love tune; and even that is cut up into short phrases and rearranged so that it never opens into full bloom. This is a musical conceived by people who do not love singing. What I hate about Peter James's direction is that it so caricatures Moll's world that any kind of serious, fully-fleshed-out playing would be unstylish. The crudest, playing onstage comes from Issy Van Randwyck, but I came to be almost grateful for her sheer energy in a largely underpowered show. In the only episode that the show treats with any 3-D humanity, Angela Richards gives the thieves' agent Mother Midnight a brooding eloquence. As Moll, Josie Lawrence gives Moll no character. She goes through the motions, either in sardonic or earnest mood. But this Moll is just a bland girl caught up in a naughty world. And her singing and acting are all in dull shades of grey. At the Lyric, Hammersmith, until May 22.</p>

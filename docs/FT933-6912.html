			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Management: Moving towards independence - The changing face of US boardrooms Independent directors now far outnumber insiders on US boards. But more than three-quarters of US company chairmen still combine that role with the job of chief executive. These are two of the main findings of a new report on corporate governance from the Conference Board, the worldwide business organisation which has its headquarters in New York. The issue of independent, non-executive directors, was highlighted in the US this month with the enforced departure of Kodak's Kay Whitmore, chairman of the phototgraphic company. But according to the Conference Board's findings, US corporations have been making considerable strides in recent years towards more independent membership. Many companies, for example, have eliminated directors whose connection with the company could conflict with their ability to exercise impartial judgments. Thus 60 per cent of the 546 respondents had no board members representing leading customers or suppliers (including legal services), or who were related to or had a significant business connection with a member of the company's management. Outsiders were in the majority on 94 per cent of manufacturing and financial firm boards, and on 93 per cent of non-financial service company boards. In many companies, the Conference Board comments, chief executives have initiated the reduction of insiders. In this they appear to be influenced by the potential advantages of tapping outsiders' knowledge and contacts, the need to slim down board sizes and pressure from the corporate governance lobby. Another trend is management's loosened grip on the director nomination process through greater acceptance of the board nominating committee. The Conference Board notes, for example, that only 8 per cent of companies surveyed 20 years ago had such a committee - comprising solely outside directors and charged mainly with the task of finding and screening possible candidates for nomination to vacant board seats. The current figure is 64 per cent. More than 90 per cent of boards now have a compensation committee, against 69 per cent two decades ago. The finding that 76 per cent of chairmen combine the role of chief executive may seem a touch unlikely to a UK audience. Since the publication of the Cadbury report on corporate governance in 1991, splitting the two jobs in big companies has become very much de rigueur. The Conference Board states that combining them in the US is 'clearly the established pattern'. It follows that 'most CEOs expect to hold both positions when they assume leadership of a company. But the practice has again come under fire, as it did in the early 1970s'. Another section of the report highlights what directors actually do. Those in financial companies spend on average 35 per cent of their time on board committees, against 30 per cent for non-financial service companies and 24 per cent for manufacturing concerns. Committee time increases, though, as company size expands. Median board meeting lengths range from two and a half hours in financial firms to three and a half hours in manufacturing companies. In the largest manufacturing and financial firms the median board meeting frequency is nine times a year, although in some the frequency is as low as four and as high as 12. At board meetings directors spend two-thirds of their time on three main concerns: strategic issues (a median of 25 per cent), financial management (21 per cent), and operations control (20 per cent). Forty four per cent of the manufacturing companies said their directors were 'very diligent' in preparing for meetings, but the figure drops to 39 per cent and 34 per cent for non-financial service firms and financial firms respectively. The report includes a brief section on Europe, based on interviews with corporate executives in eight countries.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Asyut, 19 Apr (MENA) -- Four members of terrorist  groups have declared their repentance and decided to return to  the right path after having been misled by extremist leaders.  They declared their acceptance of the judicial verdicts in the  cases in which they were implicated. Stating this, Asyut  Governor Samih al-Sa'id added that the four extremists  surrendered to the popular departments in the governorate today  of their own volition and were handed over to the competent  security agencies.</p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: Consob issues rules governing takeover bids CONSOB, Italy's stock market and companies watchdog, has released its long-awaited rules governing takeover bids, in a further step to reform the country's stock market. The rules, governing the levels of share ownership which trigger a full bid, have been drawn up under bourse regulations which came into effect at the start of this year. Unlike other countries' rules, Consob has not defined a single, uniform, level of share ownership obliging a raider to launch a full bid for a quoted company, with identical terms for all investors. In the past, the absence of such rules in Italy has allowed control of leading corporations to change hands via deals between big shareholders, without the same terms being offered to small investors. Consob has examined the ownership structure of all Italy's big quoted companies, and defined different levels for what it considers to be the 'controlling' shareholding. In each case, an attempt to buy more than that proportion of the equity is defined as being sufficient to require a full bid. The quota is sometimes surprisingly low. In the case of Generali, Italy's biggest insurance company and its best example of a widely held public company, Consob has taken the 5.96 per cent holding of merchant bank Mediobanca, the biggest single shareholder, above which a bid is triggered. Consob's second category covers companies in which there is a single dominant investor, like Fiat, Ferruzzi Finanziaria or Pirelli, but which does not own an absolute majority of the shares. In this case, the trigger level is more than that held by the dominant shareholder. These rules have been eagerly awaited by bankers for their effect on shareholders' pacts, which are commonly used to control big quoted Italian companies, where no single shareholder has an outright majority. In the case of such pacts the watchdog has defined the 'controlling level', above which a bid is triggered as the sum of the various stakes held by the pact's members.</p>

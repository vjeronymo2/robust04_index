			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Management: Power to the people - Changing corporate culture / Christopher Lorenz explains the new fashion for shifting authority down the organisation Gather together any group of managers, shop floor workers, or frontline service employees. Plant the concept of 'empowerment' and stand well back. Wait for a burst of enthusiasm, followed by clouds of confusion. The principle of empowerment underpins almost every one of the thousands of corporate 'culture change' programmes now underway in Europe and America. In simple terms, its meaning seems obvious enough: freeing employees from instructions and controls, and allowing them to take decisions themselves. Hence the initial keenness which it engenders. Such freeing of employees is, some consultants and academics argue, becoming not just advisable but mandatory in the face of at least three sets of pressures: to make organisations more responsive, more quickly, to the market place; to 'delayer' organisations in order to make them much more cost-effective; and to get employees of various disciplines to collaborate together with minimal supervision, by communicating horizontally, rather than vertically up and down the hierarchy. As a result, companies all over the western world are abandoning the old principle that a 'span of control' of between five and 15 people is the most anyone can manage effectively; many managers used to argue that as few as eight was the maximum. Instead, they are installing what Peter Drucker, the doyen of management pundits, calls 'spans of empowerment' of well above 20, in which the manager's role shifts from controller to coach, or mentor. But what does this do to the authority of the manager, whether at senior or (especially) middle levels? And does it necessarily create what Tom Peters, Drucker's fellow guru, has called 'purposeful chaos' - a notion which some managers find downright threatening? The ambiguity that managers feel about the concept is exemplified by research undertaken recently among the top managers of 10 large British companies by Laurie International, a management consultancy. These leaders all agreed that empowerment was vital to the improvement of business efficiency and quality, but they detected worry among their managers 'that empowerment could open up a Pandora's Box'. Some of the leaders shared this concern quite openly. They were emphatic 'that empowerment boundaries would have to be set'. For this group of worried managers, and the thousands of bemused others, help on some of these issues is at hand. It comes in the form of a plain person's guide to three issues: why to empower; how to empower (the guide suggests three basic options); and when to empower (depending on the situation). The guide comes courtesy of two little-known business academics in America, David Bowen of Arizona State University and Edward Lawler III of the University of Southern California. It focuses on service organisations, but most of its advice is applicable to all kinds of enterprises. Reporting their work in the spring issue of the Sloan Management Review*, which will be published in mid-April, they illustrate it with examples of companies which embraced empowerment in a big way, such as Federal Express and Club Mediterranee. But they also cite competitors which prefer to stick to production line-like controls and rules, such as United Parcel Service (UPS) and Disney - as well as McDonald's, American Airlines and Delta. Rather than adopting an either-or approach to empowerment versus control, the academics point to three optional courses of action, two of which combine both of them. The degree of empowerment increases as additional knowledge, information, power and rewards are pushed down the organisation. SUGGESTION INVOLVEMENT This is only a small step away from control - indeed, critics would argue that this option does not warrant the label 'empowerment' at all. Employees are encouraged to contribute ideas, but their day-to-day work activities do not really change. Also, they are not empowered to implement, only to recommend. McDonald's follows this approach: its Big Mac and Egg McMuffin dishes were both apparently invented by employees, as was a system of wrapping burgers that avoids leaving a thumbprint on the bun. JOB INVOLVEMENT A significant departure, this involves extensive job redesign so that employees use a variety of skills, often in teams. They have considerable freedom in deciding how to do the necessary work. Supervisors need to be reorientated towards supporting the front line or shop floor, rather than directing it. Despite the heightened level of empowerment that it brings, the job involvement approach does not change higher-level strategic decisions about organisation structure, power and the allocation of rewards. These remain the responsibility of senior management. HIGH INVOLVEMENT Here, employees become involved not just in how to do their jobs, or how effectively their team performs, but also in the whole organisation's performance. Virtually every aspect of the organisation is different from that of a control-orientated one. Information on business performance is shared. Employees develop extensive skills in teamwork, problem solving, and business operations. They participate in work-unit management decisions. There is profit-sharing and employee-ownership. High involvement organisational designs may be expensive to implement, warn Bowen and Lawler. Perhaps most troublesome is that these management techniques are relatively undeveloped and untested. People Express tried to operate as a high involvement airline, and the constant struggle to learn and develop this organisational design contributed to its severe operating problems. Both empowerment and the production line approach have their advantages, and each fits certain situations, the academics emphasise. They suggest five 'contingencies' that determine which approach to adopt. The five are Type of business strategy (low cost, high volume versus differentiation through personal service and customisation). Type of relationship with customer (degree of one-off, short-term versus extended relationship). Type of technology (degree of simple and routine versus complex and non-routine). Business environment (degree of predictability versus surprise). Degree to which people in the organisation (managers and other employees) are control versus empowerment-minded. Exemplifying these different situations, Bowen and Lawler say that customers in some situations prefer to be served by an employee who is not friendly and empowered, but just ultra-fast. Not all employees want more autonomy, challenge and responsibility at work, Bowen and Lawler emphasise. Nor are all employees (including managers) suited to the teamwork that empowerment generally involves. Surprisingly, perhaps, research in the US suggests that service companies tend to use significantly fewer employee involvement practices than do manufacturing companies. This may be partly because it can be easier in manufacturing than in service to see the pay-offs from different management practices, say Bowen and Lawler. But these differences are now blurring as service competition increases and service companies become more sophisticated in tracking the benefits of customer service quality. Bowen and Lawler conclude with the common-sense adage that before any company rushes into empowerment programmes, it should determine whether and how empowerment actually fits its situation. This may be pure common sense, but it is all too often forgotten in the rush to create a 'new culture.' *Reprint 3333. Subscription information: fax (USA) 617-253-5584.</p>

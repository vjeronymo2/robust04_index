			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Property: Profits replace purges as demand explodes - The booming housing market in Moscow The most famed block of flats in Moscow is a vast grey block across the river from the Kremlin. Known as the Government House, or the House on the Embankment (the latter after the novel by Trifonov), it was built for ministers and high government officials in the 1930s. The flats are large, airy, high and light. They were at once the summit of Soviet achievement and among the most dangerous of living quarters: when the Communist party purges started in the 1930s, the NKVD cars would, early in the morning, slip quietly into the courtyards to collect this or that senior comrade for a journey from which he did not return. No more of that today. The stairways echo now to the self-confident conversation of expatriates speaking in English, German, French and Japanese. Many of the flats have been renovated, the wood polished, the imported Scandinavian and Italian furniture placed to best advantage. For Dollars 3,000 a month up, you can look out on the Kremlin at night and thrill to the vicarious fantasy that the black Volga idling on the street below waits for you. But the mad scramble for profit in the Moscow housing market has replaced the NKVD as the main disturber of the peace in this and other elite blocks. Most people in Moscow pay very small rents to their local municipality for their flats: a rent of Dollars 5 a month is high. Those who can move in with parents/children and rent their flat to foreigners for Dollars 300-plus a month thus make huge gains, and many do. But when the parents/children get fed up, the landlord usually tries to eject the tenant. The only recourse the tenant has (if he is savvy) is to threaten to enquire of the Inland Revenue whether the landlord is declaring his income. The dispute usually ends in violence, or the threat of it. This, though, is the low end of the market. The higher end is big money. Already, says one UK lawyer who specialises in Russian property work, elite districts are emerging in a Moscow which was officially (and, in part, actually) monochromatic as to class and income differentials. 'Patriarch's Pond (near the centre) is coming up nicely,' he says, 'and the Lenin Hills area (where the town houses of the party bosses were). Also the Stalin Buildings (vast, neo-Gothic fantasy blocs of which two were apartment complexes) at Vosstaniya and Taganka are much sought after.' For foreigners who want to live the suburban life, purpose-built estates are now available: 'communities' constructed outside the Moscow outer ring road which, typically, are well-protected against increasingly self-confident criminals and have their own services and shops. Rossinka, one of the first, was pounced upon by American companies but later ones are more mixed, while the newest are largely for the emerging Russian rich. This new class - conspicuous in its top-of-the-range foreign cars with personal guards and luxurious clothes - constitutes a small but significant section of the population. However it gets its money, it wants to spend it rapidly. The houses - or kottedzhi, after English cottages - it buys on new estates, like the Moscow Country Club or Istrinskoye, are at least Dollars 180,000 and can be three times as much. The old ruling class had dachas, usually of wood, on secluded estates round Moscow. The first wave of the new rich, and the first foreign dachniks, took over many of these as the former tenants were ejected or retreated to their Moscow flats. Now, those in the new wave want to make a break with the decorous and languid routine of long dacha weekends: their brick houses are for their families, out of the Moscow danger and dirt. The two-car garages are for the Mercedes and the Jeep Cherokees; the smaller house at the foot of the garden holds the driver, cook and maid. Like other foreigners in Moscow, I rent a dacha about an hour from Moscow. It stands on an Academy of Sciences estate which once was reserved for physicists. An academy deputy-president, Konstantin Frolov, who led the wholly unsuccessful Dignity and Charity Party in the recent election campaign, has the dacha next door, with brick walls and a drive. For a reasonable sum (no one talks about rents), I have a six-room, two-storey wooden house in about two acres of ground, mainly wooded, sloping down to the Moscow river. It has fierce gas central heating, erratic light and (a great comfort this, distinguishing the elite from the proletarian dacha) an indoor flushing toilet. The landlady is the wife and daughter of an academic: she inherited 'my' dacha from her late father, while using that of her present husband. She and he, in late middle age, are not creatures of another age; they are fascinating and sympathetic people. But they are, typically and uncomfortably, poised between regarding what they are doing - renting a house - as distasteful and trying to get as much as possible for it. Moscow property is in the same no-man's land as all of Russia. The rawest free market principles, backed by obvious and always-present threats, prevail in the midst of a ruined socialism. Activity is intense; on my estate, with some 40 original wooden dachas, there are half as many again of new brick ones being thrown up. The remaining academics, like Frolov, hate it. What have these new owners done to deserve a dwelling which took them years of scientific endeavour? Merely made money. But there it is.</p>

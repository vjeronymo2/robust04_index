			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Former Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham -- impeached and removed from office a year ago  -- said he will run again in 1990. "I committed no impeachable offense," the  Republican said at an evening rally at a hotel in Phoenix. The audience of  about 400 gave a standing ovation to Mecham and his wife, Florence, when they  arrived. The 64-year-old former auto dealer, elected in 1986 on his fifth try  for governor, was convicted by the Arizona Senate and removed April 4, 1988, on  charges he misused funds and obstructed justice. Earlier in the day, Mecham  said he had filed papers with the Senate asking it to reconsider the votes by  which it impeached and ousted him. Senate leaders said they doubted lawmakers  would grant the motion.  </P></p>

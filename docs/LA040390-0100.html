Museum  officials said they were forced to reopen the exhibition to latecomers twice  Sunday night. That followed a public pledge by the museum's director that the  show would not close until the last visitor had gone away. But about 40 people  were turned away shortly after midnight, despite banging on the door and  chanting "We want in!" BETH KLEID  </P></p>

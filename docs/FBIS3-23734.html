Niyazov and K. </F> Zhigitekov, sociologists, dated 22 December 1993: "Eight  Parties, and One of Me; Political Parties and Their Leaders in  November"]    [Text]    [Begin boxed material]    From 19 through 26 November, our sociological group  conducted  a routine survey of the republic's residents. A total of 1,978  persons were surveyed. We indicated their breakdown by regions,  age, sex and national indicators in our previous publication  (cf. SLOVO KYRGYZSTANA, 18 December 1993).    Today we are presenting part of the responses to questions  concerning the respondents' attitudes toward the political  parties and their leaders.    [End boxed material]    The republic is gradually making the transition to a real  multi-party system. Recently another party registered with the  Ministry of Justice--the Agrarian Party. Altogether we have  eight of them now. As yet it is difficult to say whether the  process of party formation will stop here. We do not exclude the  possibility of formation of other parties as well.    In speaking of the formulation of a real multi-party system,  we must also point out the December session of the Zhogorku  Kenesh which, in our opinion, will be memorable also in the fact  that for the first time the legislators decided to listen to the  opinion of the parties. All the parties of Kyrgyzstan will be  able to enter the date of 14 December in their chronicles as a  day of reckoning in their formulation: The deputy corps listened  to the opinion of the party leaders regarding the vacant  position of prime minister.    The tables presented below (N1, 2, 3) show the weight of the  parties by regional, national and age parameters. Without  commenting on them in detail, we will focus on two figures. In  first place by a sizeable margin are the communists. This is the  only party which has surpassed, and quite significantly, the  10-percent margin. In principle it is understandable why this is  happening: The complexities of the republic's socio-economic  development are forcing ordinary residents to recall that  "golden" time when the communists ruled and prices were  affordable. The situation which is developing in the economy and  our as yet bleak prospects will evidently lead to a further  increase in the authority of the republic's communists.    The second figure which calls attention to itself is the  percent of those who found it difficult to respond. On the whole  throughout the republic, over one-third of the respondents could  not define themselves on this question. Here is the sphere of  activity for our parties.    Table N4 gives the rating of party leaders in points. Here  too the communists draw attention to themselves. Their leader,  Zhumgalbek Amanbayev, is in first place among the leaders of the  political parties. An informal rating conducted among deputies  of the Zhogorku Kenesh also gave priority to the leader of the  communists.    We will not comment further on the tables. The next survey  will probably be conducted at the beginning of January, and we  hope to present a detailed report to our readers in the last  third of January.    Table N1.

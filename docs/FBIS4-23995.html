			<p>BFN     [Text] The Republic of Angola yesterday signed an accord on  the rescheduling of its debt to Portugal. The debt is worth  more than $1 billion. The accord was signed by Angolan Finance  Minister Alvaro Craveira and Briosa e Gala, Portugal's secretary  of state for cooperation. Minister Craveira said the accord  will ease the pressure on Angola's debt and prevent spending  scarce financial resources on the payment of debt.    [Begin Craveira recording] The debt has been rescheduled on  a  short-term basis for seven years. There will be two years of  grace. On a medium- and long-term basis, the rescheduling was  for 10 years, with two years of grace. With this accord, we  have eased our situation in that we will not spend scarce  financial resources on debt payments. We have secured new lines  of credit to finance other transactions, amounting to about $60  million on a short- and medium- term basis. There will be 100  to settle our accounts with Portuguese exporters with whom we  could not apply the petroleum (?clause). [sentence as heard] A  financial package worth $50 million could be signed. [end  recording]</p>

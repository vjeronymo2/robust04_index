			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Bonds: American Express poised for Dollars 1bn asset-backed deal AMERICAN Express is next week expected to launch a Dollars 1bn global asset-backed bond issue, its first bond offering backed by charge card debt. The deal will be lead-managed by Lehman Brothers, a subsidiary of the credit card group. Bankers were yesterday anticipating a deal comprising two Dollars 500m tranches of five-year and seven-year paper. The deal is likely to be structured as a global bond issue, with registered bonds traded simultaneously in the US, Eurobond and east Asian financial markets. Citicorp has already used global asset-backed bonds to securitise credit card debt. However, the assets backing the American Express deal will have slightly different characteristics. Charge card holders are not allowed to maintain unpaid balances. American claims a lower default rate than on credit cards. Elsewhere, Nationwide Building Society yesterday raised Pounds 100m capital from an issue of 15-year subordinated bonds, callable after 10-years. Nationwide will pay a punitive rate of interest if the call option is not exercised, so the the deal was viewed as a 10-year issue, yielding 135 basis points more than gilts of the same maturity. If the bonds are not called, the coupon will be raised to a level where the yield is 250 basis points over gilts. The structure is designed to ensure that Nationwide can count the full Pounds 100m as capital for 10 years. The Building Societies Commission, the industry regulator, demands that subordinated bonds gradually cease to count as capital in the five years prior to maturity. The deal, lead-managed by Credit Suisse First Boston, was seen as aggressively-priced by some sterling bond underwriters. Outstanding Nationwide eight-year subordinated paper trades at a yield spread 150 basis points over gilts. Subordinated debt issued by building societies of similar credit quality trades at a lower yield spread than yesterday's issue. Two Japanese companies launched equity warrant bond issues, in a rare flurry of activity in the sector. Penta-Ocean Construction launched a Dollars 200m issue lead-managed by Yamaichi International, while Kuraray raised Dollars 150m and SFr100m via Daiwa Europe and Credit Suisse. The two Eurodollar issues saw strong demand trading up to 103 7/8 bid and 102 7/8 bid respectively, both from an issue price of par. The deals benefited from the paucity of new issues this year. The bonds carry a coupon of only 2.25 per cent, but in most cases the warrants to buy shares are stripped from the bonds and sold separately. Once stripped, the bonds trade at around 86 per cent of face value, for a yield of around 6.25 per cent. Although yesterday's performed well, bankers do not expect a flood of new deals.</p>

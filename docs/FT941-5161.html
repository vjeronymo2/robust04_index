			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Observer: Return trip So BOC has finally found a new chairman, or rather an old one. The news that Richard Giordano, who headed the group for more than a decade, is re-occupying the BOC chairman's suite may be good for BOC's shareholders, but some British Gas shareholders might feel a bit miffed. When British Gas recruited its new Pounds 450,000 a year chairman, Giordano undertook to reduce his other non-executive commitments. Now Giordano is adding the non-executive chairmanship of another company which is going through a bit of a rough patch, but promises that 'his principal activities and office' will remain at British Gas. Presumably, this means that he won't be paid the Pounds 305,000 a year he commanded the last time he was BOC's chairman. If Giordano was the natural successor to Pat Rich, who announced his surprise early retirement over six weeks ago, why didn't BOC nominate him at the time?</p>

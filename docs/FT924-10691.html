			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Goldsmiths trims loss to Pounds 1.88m An improvement in sales enabled the Goldsmiths Group of jewellery and watch retailers to reduce pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.09m to Pounds 1.88m in the half year to August 29. Sales were Pounds 18.3m (Pounds 16.4m), a rise of 11 per cent overall and 4 per cent on a like-for-like basis. That stemmed from increased market share but compared with poor trading in the corresponding period. Five new retail outlets were opened and two relocated. However, the interim dividend is passed (1.5p) after losses per share of 5.74p (6.38p). The loss would have been reduced by a further Pounds 200,000 but for a number of one-off charges. There was still some consumer resistance at the top end of the market, but the middle market in watches and jewellery continued to be strong. The group was in a position to benefit from any upturn in the economy, and also believed the excessive discounting of last year would not be repeated over the Christmas period, so leading to improved sales and margins.</p>

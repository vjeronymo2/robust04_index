			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sandvik profits decline but dividend is raised SANDVIK, the Swedish speciality steel and engineering group, saw profits fall to SKr1.53bn (Dollars 200m) for 1992 as demand for its products weakened. Although slightly higher than forecast, the figure was 20 per cent lower than the SKr1.92bn profit in 1991. The group is increasing the dividend to SKr9.50 from SKr9.00 per share despite the decline, and said it expected higher sales and profits in 1993. The current year is 'likely to be another year of reduced demand but the weaker krona is increasing the competitiveness of our Swedish units,' the company said. Sales fell 2 per cent in 1992 to SKr17.2bn on a virtually unchanged order intake of SKr17.33bn. Sales to the EC, the group's main market, fell 2 per cent to SKr7.52bn, and there was a 5 per cent fall to SKr3bn in sales to North America. Higher sales in both Sweden and Latin America helped to compensate. The group's cemented carbide activities saw earnings fall to SKr896m from SKr1.18bn as sales dropped to SKr8.53bn from SKr9.01bn. Steel operations recorded a SKr151m profit, SKr128m less than in 1991, on sales which fell to SKr5.27bn from SKr5.57bn. Losses within saws and tools deepened to SKr81m from SKr16m.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Newmont Mining weaker NEWMONT Mining, a leading gold-producer based in Denver, Colorado, said lower gold prices weakened its fourth-quarter results, but it still showed a profit, writes Laurie Morse. Newmont reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 3.9m, or 3 cents a share, down from Dollars 22.7m, or 33 cents, in the corresponding period a year ago. Consolidated fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 140.9m, compared with Dollars 155.9m in 1991. For the year, Newmont reported earnings, before a special accounting charge, of Dollars 90.6m, or Dollars 1.30, down from Dollars 94.3m, or Dollars 1.39, in 1991. The company said the earnings decline was directly related to a Dollars 12-per-ounce fall in the average price it received for gold in 1992. Newmont had consolidated annual sales of Dollars 613.2m, down from Dollars 622.8m in 1991.</p>

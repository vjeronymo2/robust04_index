			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- The government and the  ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) held a policy coordination  meeting on Saturday to decide to continue efforts to solve the  North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue.    The meeting, attended by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, DLP  Chairman Kim Chong-pil and other government and party officials,  also decided to study measures to be taken when the efforts  through dialogue fail, officials said.    The meeting confirmed the position that the government  respects the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s  decision on the technical issues of the inspection of the North  Korean nuclear sites and observation of the replacement of fuel  rod of the five megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon in North  Korea.    But if North Korea replaces the fuel rod without observation  of the IAEA, suspension of the North Korean-U.S. talks is  inevitable, the meeting reaffirmed the position.    The government and the ruling party discussed another issue  of the North Korean loggers.    The senior officials decided to have close consultation with  the Russian Government on the North Koreans who escaped from the  Siberian logging camps to solve the problem in an early date.    They will study ways to invite international organizations  to  intervene in the problem in an effort to prevent possible  diplomatic trouble with Russia.    Meanwhile, the government and the ruling party will reject  the North Korean proposal to replace the 1953 Armistice  Agreement with a peace treaty with the United States alone,  according to officials.    They reaffirmed that the Military Armistice Commission and  the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should continue to  exist.</p>

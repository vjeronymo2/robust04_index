These institutions served solely as correspondent banks, or as trust companies, or as clearing agents, and they did not extend credit to the public for their own account. The FDIC concludes that the CRA is not intended to cover these institutions. It is the purpose of the CRA to require the FDIC to encourage banks to meet the credit needs of their local communities. To this end the FDIC must assess banks' records of performance and take those records into account in acting on certain applications affecting the banks. The FDIC believes that these provisions were intended to cover all banks that are in the business of extending credit to the public including both  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> wholesale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> retail <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  banks. The lending activities of these banks affect the economic health of the communities in which they are chartered. However, the FDIC believes it would be pointless to encourage or to assess the credit granting record of institutions that are not organized to grant credit to the public in the ordinary course of business, other than as an incident to their specialized operations. Accordingly the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bank <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as used in the FDIC's regulation, part 345 (12 CFR part 345), does not include banks that engage solely in correspondent banking business, trust company business, or acting as a clearing agent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

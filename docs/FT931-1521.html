			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: American Express downgraded by S&amp;P STANDARD &amp; POOR'S, the US credit-rating agency, yesterday downgraded its rating on American Express, the travel and financial services group. The American Express Credit Corporation was downgraded from AA- to A-Plus, while commercial paper was downgraded from A-1-Plus to A-1 and preferred stock from A-Plus to A. S&amp;P said the downgrades reflected lower profitability at the core travel-related services (TRS) division and the company's continuing card member attrition rate. TRS, according to S&amp;P, faced increasing competitive pressure, which is expected to continue to affect net earnings. S&amp;P also pointed to the group's plan to sell a large shareholding in its First Data Corporation subsidiary as one way of offsetting write-offs, such as a Dollars 342m charge last year related to the restructuring of the TRS division. The First Data offer began yesterday. But S&amp;P noted 'there may be fewer such non-recurring gains available in the future to offset unforeseen weaknesses.' American Express said the ratings changes would have 'an insignificant impact' on its funding costs. Last year, losses at Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment banking and brokerage subsidiary, helped cause a 65.4 per cent slump in fourth-quarter 1992 net income at American Express, to Dollars 82m. American Express agreed earlier this month to sell the Shearson brokerage business to Primerica, the financial services group headed by Mr Sandy Weill. S&amp;P yesterday affirmed its A rating of Shearson's senior debt.</p>

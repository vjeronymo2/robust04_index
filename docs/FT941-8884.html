			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Hanson refinancing plans for Quantum junk bond debt Hanson yesterday announced plans to complete the refinancing of Quantum Chemical Corporation's Dollars 2.35bn (Pounds 1.6bn) of junk bond debt. Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, acquired Quantum on September 30 last year, the final day of its financial year. The purchase price of Dollars 3.4bn included taking on Dollars 2.6bn of debt. Hanson is to redeem three bond issues on March 15 with a total of Dollars 900m outstanding, which were paying an average interest rate of 11.4 per cent. It has already redeemed Dollars 1.15bn of bonds at the end of October last year and bought Dollars 300m of bonds in the market. Altogether this debt bore an average rate of 11 per cent. Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman, said the group would refinance this debt at about half that interest rate, through a variety of markets. Hanson shares rose 4p to 287 1/2 p yesterday. When Hanson bought Quantum it said refinancing the debt would save Dollars 125m a year in interest. At the time of the acquisition it made a provision of Pounds 132m to cover the redemption costs, which included the difference between the actual interest being paid and the rate Hanson would normally pay on its debt. Thus the high interest cost of Quantum's debt was not responsible for the Pounds 87m swing to interest payable in Hanson's first quarter results announced on Tuesday. As well as refinancing the debt, Hanson has taken action to cut costs at Quantum. It closed the New York corporate office and Quantum's three oldest polymer reactors. It has separated the two sides of the business, polyethylene and Suburban Propane, which now report independently into Hanson Industries, Hanson's US head company.</p>

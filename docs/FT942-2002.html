			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / EU splits Finnish government A dispute over Finland's move to join the European Union yesterday split the centre-right coalition for the first time since it took office in 1991 as the anti-EU Christian party pulled out of the government. But the remaining three government parties, led by the Centre party of the prime minister, Mr Esko Aho, retained an absolute majority with 108 seats in the 200-seat parliament, despite losing the backing of the seven Christian party MPs. The coalition, now comprised of the Centre party, the Conservative party and the Swedish People's party, went ahead yesterday with the formal ratification of Finland's agreement on the terms of accession with the EU following approval at a special conference of the Centre party at the weekend. A similar meeting of the Christian party rejected EU membership, forcing the leadership to withdraw from the coalition in which Mr Toimi Kankaanniemi, its leader, was minister for overseas aid.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On Friday Russia's State Duma adopted a decree "On  the Constitutional Court." As many as 331 deputies voted for  this decree, five -- against, and 27 abstained from voting (as  it is known, the RF Constitutional Court and members of the  State Duma Committee on Legislation and Legal Reform submitted  this bill for consideration). The procedure of filling  Constitutional Court (CC) vacancies remains unchanged -- a CC  judge is appointed by the Federation Council following the  president's nomination.    Given its authorities the CC hears trials on correspondence  with federal laws, normative acts of the Russian president and  of both chambers of the Federal Assembly, of Russian government,  Constitutions of the republics, charters and laws of the RF  constituent members to the RF Constitution. The court can also  determine the congruence with the Constitution and treaties made  between state bodies of power of the Russian Federation and  state bodies of power of the RF constituent members, and  agreements between state bodies of the RF constituent members.    It is within the Court's competence to determine the  congruence with the Constitution of the international agreements  of the Russian Federation which are not in force yet, to  interpret the RF Constitution, to make conclusions about the  observance of the procedure of accusations against the Russian  president of high treason or of committing any serious crime.  The CC has the right to initiate legislative actions on issue  which are in its competence.    Any citizens of the Russian Federation who is over 40, has  an  excellent reputation and higher juridical education and  experience of juridical work of no less than 15 years can be  appointed to the post of a judge on the CC.    The decree stipulates that powers of a CC judge can be  suspended if the CC agrees to arrest him or to bring charges  against him or if he is unable to fulfill his duties due to the  state of his health.    The mandate of a judge in the CC can be taken away if the  rules on his appointment were violated.    The same measure is taken if a judge looses citizenship of  the Russian Federation or if he is sentenced or if the judge  continues to behave incompatible with his post despite warnings  on the part of the RF Constitutional Court.    The decree foresees that the chairman of the CC is elected  at  its plenary sitting by a secret voting by the majority of  judges. Chairman of the Court, his deputy, and judge-secretary  are elected for three years.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Building societies aim to shake off shackles: A look at the controversy over the limits to their activities Even the largest building societies believe they should get a little extra help from the government to compete effectively in the mortgage and savings markets. At its meeting today the Building Societies Association council will discuss a paper on the current review of the 1986 legislation on building societies. Announcing the review in January, Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury economic secretary, highlighted for discussion areas such as the limit of 40 per cent of funds which societies can raise on the wholesale markets; merger and takeover procedures; and the process for societies to change their status. The BSA, to which the Treasury has sub-contracted much of the consultation process, believes the chance of a full review - with the ending of legislative constraints on societies - should not be missed. Mr Adrian Coles, association director-general, says some detailed changes it would like could be done reasonably quickly as part of the de-regulation initiative. Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive of Woolwich building society, the UK's third largest, says: 'In fundamental terms, the only thing really pressing down on building societies is the wholesale funding limit.' Societies want greater access to wholesale funds, where borrowing is cheaper at present, so they can offer more attractive deals to potential borrowers. For much of last year they lost market share to the banks. But for the medium term, the association would still like an end to legislative limits on the powers of societies, except those needed to define their mutual status. One suggestion for defining mutuality, set out in an association paper about 18 months ago, is that a society should raise a set proportion of its funds from its members and have a set proportion of its commercial assets as loans to members. Removing the existing constraints on what societies can do would inevitably mean changes to the way they are regulated. The paper was tactful enough to say it would prefer the Building Societies Commission to remain the regulator, but acknowledged the argument for moving supervision to the Bank of England as differences between banks and societies diminish. That prospect was raised by the Bank itself when Mr Brian Quinn, an executive director, gave evidence to the influential Commons Treasury committee of MPs last November. Mr John Watts, the Tory chairman of the committee, says it will pursue this issue when it takes evidence from the commission and the association during its current inquiry into financial regulation. There are also broader concerns at Westminster. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, says: 'The legislation should allow societies to expand their activities. 'But I would be very reluctant to give them carte blanche to do whatever they like.' As Mr Coles puts it, the issue is one of efficiency: no matter how amenable the Building Societies Commission has been, the need for changes in societies' powers to be considered by parliament inevitably means delay. He says: 'Building societies don't want the ability to lend in Bosnia and Brazil. 'The change would allow us to do things in the markets where we operate in the most efficient way possible.' But others question whether societies are trying to seize an unfair advantage, given the protected environment in which they exist and the lack of shareholders to hold boards accountable. Mr Peter Birch, chief executive of Abbey National, the former society which converted to plc status in 1989, dismisses the argument that societies are fully accountable to their members. He says that most savers and borrowers do not see themselves as having a controlling role in the society. 'When people go into a building society, they do so because the goods are attractive, rather than to become members,' he says. His comments seem borne out by members' involvement. For example, at Halifax building society, the UK's largest, only about 10 per cent of its 5.5m voting members took part in decisions at last year's annual general meeting. Even at Nationwide, the second largest, where the running of the society became such an issue that members insisted on a couple of their own candidates becoming directors, only about 103,000 of the 3.5m voting members were involved in voting for the board at last year's AGM. Mr David Gilchrist, Halifax corporate development manager, describes the society as 'happy to look at ways of improving accountability'. But far from enhancing accountability, the most likely immediate changes from the de-regulation initiative may reduce the prospects for internal democracy, since they are directed at streamlining the occasions and ways for societies to consult and notify their millions of members. Society chief executives are reluctant to concede the point publicly, but some privately admit that greater freedoms should be accompanied by more accountability.</p>

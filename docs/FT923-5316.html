			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Management: Thanks for the memory - Health Check Modern managers are always complaining of memory loss. They say they cannot remember conversations, dates, names and appointments. Help is at hand: in the vast majority of cases, mild memory lapses can be corrected. Judging by the growing weight of literature on the subject, there is no single memory system, but multiple systems with different functions. Memory functions can be divided into two: declarative (or explicit), in which we learn and remember with awareness, and non-declarative (or implicit) in which we learn without being aware of the process of information storage and retrieval. This process is a delicate one, and can be affected by your life-style. Memory failures are often due as much to a failure to acquire and store information, as to disruptions in the process of transforming the information into more permanent memories. There is some evidence that the memory works better if the individual is in the same state of mind at the time of retrieval as at the time of storage. This could mean that if you are given information after having had a few drinks, you will be better able to retrieve it in the same inebriated state. Throughout the literature on memory, there is constant reference to attention or awareness. This is one of the keys to better memory. If you are mentally 'elsewhere', you have little chance of registering that bit of information. The more you perceive the information to be trivial, the less likely you will be to recall it. To an extent, this is normal. You are bombarded with facts and faces all day, every day: your brain censors what you should retain and store. Without this function, you would be buried under mountains of useless information. Memory skills can be developed with practice and with regular use. Attend to to the present moment. A useful drill to practise at the airport, on planes or in traffic jams is to bring your mind to focus on a single object in front of you (such as a pencil) and concentrate on it for one minute. It may not sound long, but within 20 seconds or so, your active mind will be distracted and will tend to drift. Another trick is to make a conscious effort to pay attention to the names of people you are meeting for the first time. This not only helps you to remember the names, it is provides good practice for being in the present moment. To reinforce the connections between ideas as they are stored, try using mnemonic devices, tools designed to link otherwise isolated ideas. Generations of music students have used the mnemonic devise 'Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge' to learn the notes on the lines on the treble clef. Create your own mnemonics to give you 'memory handles'. Get plenty of exercise to bathe the brain memory centres in oxygen-rich blood. Get enough rest to let the brain relax after a day of stimulus bombardment. This includes five minute 'power naps' and deep breathing during the day. Fatigue will impair your concentration and your ability to remember. Excessive alcohol and uncompensated stress will also compromise your memory skills. The author is the medical director of the Insead Business Health course.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A simple boost to rented sector Sir, John Willman's report, 'Clarke to boost initiative on private finance' (November 15), that the Treasury is about to 'breathe new life into the private financial initiative' is good news. It at least suggests that the Treasury is capable of movement. Before tackling the complex task of introducing private capital to major infrastructure projects, why not do a simple job first? The private rented sector is crying out for investment to build the 100,000 new homes that are needed each year. Minor changes to the inequitable tax regime that penalises landlords in favour of owner occupier could be made on Budget day. Designing a modified investment trust to attract institutional funds for investment in the private rented sector should not take long either. Good practice for the Treasury, you may feel, before it gets round to roads, bridges and railways. Alan Thurlow, Leaders, 28 New Road, Brighton, Sussex BN1 1UG</p>

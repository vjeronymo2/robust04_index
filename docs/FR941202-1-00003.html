The amendments implement recent changes made to the Truth in Lending Act by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The law imposes new disclosure requirements and substantive limitations on mortgages bearing high rates or fees. The amendments would provide greater protections to consumers entering into high-rate, high-fee mortgages. The law also imposes new disclosure requirements to assist consumers in comparing the cost of reverse mortgage transactions, which provide periodic payments to primarily elderly homeowners and rely principally on the home's value for repayment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before January 18, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0858, and may be mailed to William W.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) is to promote the informed use of consumer credit by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost. The act requires creditors to disclose credit terms and the cost of credit as an annual percentage rate (APR). The act requires additional disclosures for loans secured by a consumer's home, and permits consumers to cancel certain transactions that involve their principal dwelling. Limitations are imposed on some credit line plans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. The act is implemented by the Board's Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Proposed Regulatory Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (Equity Protection Act), contained in the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Community Development Act), Pub. L. 103&hyph;325, 108 Stat. 2160, amends the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). Section 152 of the Equity Protection Act adds a new section 129 dealing with high-rate, high-fee mortgages. Section 154 adds a new section 138 dealing with reverse mortgage transactions. The Equity Protection Act was enacted in September 1994, and directs the Board to issue final regulations within 180 days. It provides that the statutory provisions and rules adopted by the Board shall apply on the October 1 following six months after the final regulation is issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board is proposing regulations for comment, and expects to adopt final implementing regulations in March 1995. Compliance with the law would be mandatory by October 1, 1995. Section 156 of the Equity Protection Act states that the final rule governs all high-rate, high-fee mortgage transactions consummated after the mandatory effective date. The Board believes that the same compliance rule would apply to reverse mortgage transactions consummated after the mandatory effective date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Section-By-Section Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 226.2_Definitions and Rules of Construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2(a) Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2(a)(17) Creditor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 152(c) of the Equity Protection Act states the number of high-rate, high-fee mortgage transactions a lender may make before becoming a creditor for purposes of the TILA. The proposed regulation parallels the statute. The regulation provides that persons making occasional home-secured loans_less than five during a calendar year_are not subject to the act. The proposed regulation provides that a creditor includes a person originating two or more high-rate, high-fee mortgage loans, or one or more such mortgage loans through a mortgage broker during any 12-month period. Thus, for example, a person originating one high-rate, high-fee mortgage that soon thereafter enters into two home-secured loans, one of which was a high-rate, high-fee loan, would be required to comply with TILA for both transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart B_Open-End Credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 226.5b_Requirements for Home Equity Plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5b(f) Limitations on Home Equity Plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The TILA allows creditors to terminate open-end plans and demand repayment in narrowly drawn circumstances such as when the consumer fails to make payments or takes actions that affect the creditor's security. Section 154(c) of the Equity Protection Act excludes reverse mortgage transactions from these substantive limitations. The legislative history states that the amendment is intended to codify the Board's interpretation regarding a creditor's ability to accelerate an open-end reverse mortgage loan in accordance with the credit contract. The proposed amendment reflects that intent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart C_Closed-end Credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 226.23_Right of Rescission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 23(a) Consumer's Right to Rescind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 152(b) of the Equity Protection Act provides that high-rate, high-fee mortgage disclosures are ``material'' for purposes of the TILA. Proposed amendments to footnote 48 implement the change. The effect is to give consumers the right to rescind a high-rate, high-fee mortgage if a creditor fails to furnish the disclosures set forth in proposed &sect;226.32(c) or provides for a prohibited credit term set forth in proposed &sect;226.32(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

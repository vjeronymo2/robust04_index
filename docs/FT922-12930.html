			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Beijing remains relaxed Formal approval by the authorities in Beijing is not needed for Hongkong Bank to take over Midland. But with China set to assume sovereignty in 1997 of a territory in which Hongkong Bank occupies such an important role, outright opposition would be unfortunate, writes Alexander Nicoll. Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank chairman, has sought to prevent this by keeping Beijing informed of the bank's moves at every stage. So far, the indications are that Beijing is adopting a relaxed approach, in spite of criticism and suspicion expressed in Hong Kong newspapers that usually reflect the official communist line. None of the many unofficial voices of the Chinese government commented yesterday on the terms of the deal. However, an official government statement said that the merger of the two banks was an internal affair for them. The statement, issued by the Chinese Embassy in London in response to a question, said: 'Due to the status of the Hongkong Bank in the economic activities of Hong Kong, we hope that whatever actions the bank takes, apart from consideration of its own needs, it should take a responsible attitude towards Hong Kong; and we hope that it will continue to make its contribution to the prosperity and stability of the Hong Kong economy.' This seemed the clearest sign yet that China has no intention of mounting opposition that could put the deal in doubt or place obstacles in the path of the merged company. The concerns expressed by some Chinese officials and newspapers are understandable. Hongkong Bank is not just a commercial bank. It performs some of the functions, including issuing banknotes, of a central bank, its chairman sits on the governor's main decision-making body, and its board includes leading Hong Kong political figures, as well as local businessmen who have strong relationships with the Chinese authorities. Chief among Chinese worries is that Hongkong Bank will use the Midland takeover to syphon assets out of Hong Kong. Businessmen, however, believe that the bank's prominent role in backing the boom in Hong Kong business in southern China suggests that its commitment to the area is firm - and the bank yesterday repeated this pledge. Perhaps the more telling criticism from the communist Chinese has been on markedly capitalist grounds. An official of the state-run Bank of China, which competes intensely for local business with the Hongkong Bank, attacked it on the grounds that Midland was a poor performer and that the interests of Hongkong Bank shareholders, including many local people, were at risk.</p>

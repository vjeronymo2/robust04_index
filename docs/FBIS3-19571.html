			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sian Clare and Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] The Prime Minister was flying out to the former  Yugoslavia tonight on a morale-boosting visit to Britain's  troops in the war zone.    John Major's trip, only formally announced this afternoon,  was shrouded in secrecy for security reasons and full details  were still not being disclosed.    He will be giving a pat on the back to some of Britain's  2,000 troops working to reinforce the fragile truces in Bosnia.    Mr Major, keen to build on the peace breaking out across  central Bosnia, is also expected to talk with military leaders  and politicians.    He wants to assess the situation on the ground, and discuss  future military and aid requirements should the truces around  the capital Sarajevo and across central Bosnia be extended.    He also wishes to consider how the burden of future help  could best be shared among the UN member countries.    Mr Major is expected to meet Lieutenant General Sir Michael  Rose, the UN's commander in Bosnia.    Sir Michael's leadership has been hailed as a great success.  His robust style has helped secure the ceasefires.    Mr Major's trip, expected to last no longer than 24 hours,  comes as Serbs and Muslims signed an agreement ending the  23-month-old seige of Sarajevo.    Under the deal, signed today under UN supervision, a bridge,  key roads linking Serb and Muslim sections of the Bosnian  capital and a route from Sarajevo into central Bosnia controlled  by allied Muslims and Croats, will be freed.    The Prime Minister's visit also coincides with the arrival  of  the 900-strong reinforcement battalion based on the Duke of  Wellington's Regiment.    The reinforcements will bring the total number of British  troops in the region to 3,400.    Britain has played a leading role in trying to resolve the  conflict, and in persuading other UN member countries last week  to send an extra 7,200 troops to the region following pleas from  military leaders.    The extra troops are needed to implement the ceasefires and  create confidence.    Mr Major is likely to travel to Vitez where British  Battalion  One has its headquarters. The battalion is based on the  Coldstream Guards with responsibility for the area from Maglaj  in the north to Vitez and west to Travnik.    British Battalion Two, based on the Duke of Wellington's  Regiment with its headquarters in Bugojno, is responsible for  the area south of Vitez including Gorni Vakuf, which has been a  key flashpoint, Tomislavgrad and Prozor.    Mr Major will be keen to meet the two commanding officers --  Lieutenant Colonel Peter Williams of the Coldstream Guards and  Lt Col David Sanat-Olalla of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment.    He is also expected to meet Brigadier John Reith, overall  commander of British forces in Bosnia and UN forces in the  southwest sector and chairman of the Joint Commission set up  with Croat and Muslim leaders.    Sarajevo is certain to be on Mr Major's itinerary, and he  will want to assess the capital's infrastructure needs now the  shelling has stopped.    Mr Major and U.S. President Bill Clinton sent a joint civil  planning mission to Sarajevo to assess the state of basic  services such as electricity and water following their meeting  in Washington earlier this month.    Mr Major will want to assess the progress of the mission,  and  is expected to make some announcements on it.    Downing Street officials said Mr Major's first priority was  to show personal support, and that of the Government and country  at large, to the troops.</p>

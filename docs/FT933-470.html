			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Pig genes advance transplant hopes SCIENTISTS yesterday claimed a 'breakthrough' in the genetic engineering of pigs to provide organs for transplantation to humans. Researchers from DNX Biotherapeutics of Princeton, New Jersey, told a conference in Cambridge that they had bred animals with human genes which would prevent their organs being rejected by the patient's immune system after transplant-ation. 'If we are able to maintain our current rate of progress, DNX should be poised to begin human clinical testing of transgenic pig organs in three to five years,' said Dr John Logan, the company's head of research. Kidneys and hearts are likely to be used first. If unaltered pig organs were transplanted to humans, they would be destroyed within hours by part of the immune system called 'complement' which is normally held in check by 'inhibition factors'. With genetic engineering, the DNX scientists have produced pigs that make two human inhibition factors. Patients are expected to react to the transgenic organs as they would to a transplant from another human. They will still need to be treated with drugs to suppress the immune system, but the pig organs are likely to last for as long as their human equivalents. Mr Steven Holtzman, DNX president, said the company wanted to solve the severe worldwide shortage of transplant organs by breeding special herds of transgenic pigs. 'We estimate that at least 100,000 patients worldwide could then receive transplants.' 'We believe it is ethical to use an animal to save a human life,' Mr Holtzman added, though he conceded that some animal rights advocates would find the work unacceptable. Asked about possible religious objections to pig transplants, he said: 'We have taken rabbinical advice and for Jews it is a dietary prohibition, so there is no bar to the use of pig organs. I don't know what the Koran has to say on this.'</p>

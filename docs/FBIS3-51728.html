This is the first lot of a $500,000 export operation.  The first export to eastern Europe is consigned to the  UkrSots-Bank, a bank in the Ukraine. Digitel contracted with  this bank to supply modem units with a speed of 14,400 bits per  second for each telephone line dialed.    The second largest data communications equipment  manufacturer  in our country, Digitel has other plans as well. Digitel  President Gilberto Machado said: "We intend to transfer the  technology of our products keeping in mind the huge potential  for exports to the former Soviet Union."  <H5>  New Markets </H5>   In order to gain new markets and increase the number of  customers, especially in eastern Europe, Digitel participated in  the Computer Science and Communications Fair held in Kiev last  year. Digitel has also already signed a coopeation agreement  with the Ukrainian enterprise Vector-Scientific Novation Company  to represent Digitel in that country.    In its strategy to diversify its exports, Digitel signed a  letter of intent in December with the state-run enterprise China  National Post Telecommunications, the Chinese equivalent to  Embratel [Brazilian Telecommunications Company], seeking the  establishment of a joint venture. The goal is to facilitate the  importation of data communications equipment for a fabulous  potential market in which the Chinese Government plans to invest  $60 billion within the next five years.    According to Gilberto Machado, after entering partnerships  with six U.S. companies, Digitel will open a company of its own  in Miami, in the United States. Digitel is scheduled to receive  its ISO-9000 enterprise certificate (international quality  certificate) in March, after one year of conforming to  international standards and investing $1.6 million in equipment,  training, and internal changes.    Digitel's modem line has more than 20 models of high-speed  and multiplexor modem units.</p>

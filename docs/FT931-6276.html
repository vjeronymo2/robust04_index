			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Australian poll could unlock door to bank mergers - Kevin Brown analyses the prospects for financial services if John Hewson wins this month's elections THE possibility of a conservative victory in Australia's federal election on March 13 raises the prospect of a radical shake-up of the troubled banking sector. Mr John Hewson, leader of the opposition Liberal/National Party coalition, has yet to release a considered strategy for the financial services industry under a conservative government. But, as the coalition increases its lead in the opinion polls, attention is turning to the likely consequences of the defeat of the decade-old Labor government, now led by Mr Paul Keating. The impact of a conservative victory would be felt first by the four trading banks - National Australia Bank (NAB), Westpac, ANZ and Commonwealth - and the two big life insurance institutions, AMP Society and National Mutual. Merger negotiations between the big six have been banned since 1990, when Mr Keating, the then treasurer, (finance minister) unexpectedly blocked a proposed merger between ANZ and National Mutual. Mr Keating's sought to prevent a diminution of competition within and between the bank and insurance sectors. However, Mr Hewson and Mr Peter Reith, the opposition's candidate for treasurer, have promised that merger proposals would be considered 'on their merits'. Officials say Mr Hewson believes a merger might strengthen competition by reducing the substantial differences in the financial strength of the banks. Westpac and ANZ have sustained heavy losses since 1990 on loans secured against commercial property in the late 1980s, when both banks gave a higher priority to rapid asset growth than to credit control. By contrast, NAB has benefited from its more conservative policy of lending against cash-flow and largely eschewing the risky corporate lending market in favour of housing loans. Mr Don Argus, NAB managing director, has publicly played down prospects of a takeover offer, claiming the bank is fully occupied in digesting its recent ADollars 1.1bn (USDollars 765m) takeover of the Bank of New Zealand. However, he is known to have looked closely at the merits of a bid for either Westpac or ANZ. A management committee is believed to be working on details of a bid. Analysts say NAB is likely to be most interested in ANZ, which wrote off ADollars 1.9bn against bad and doubtful debts last year, but is widely believed to be on the road to recovery. Westpac wrote off ADollars 2.6bn last year, but Mr John Uhrig, chairman, has said the bank's troubles may not be over. Mr Robert Joss, the chief executive recruited last month from Wells Fargo, is supervising a property review which may force further provisioning. Meanwhile, National Mutual has indicated it is still interested in merging with one of the banks to gain access to a retail branch network, which offers a cost-effective means of marketing life policies. Such a merger would give the bank involved greater access to Australia's growing market in compulsory superannuation contributions, which is emerging as the biggest growth area in financial services. It might also provide an escape hatch for one of the weaker banks, probably ANZ, which had reached an advanced stage in negotiations with National Mutual when Mr Keating stepped in in 1990. Westpac and AMP have a more limited marketing arrangement which might also provide a basis for a merger or close defensive alliance. AMP owns 15 per cent of Westpac, and the two groups share a number of directors. An incoming conservative government could drop the ban on mergers without legislation, but a bid by any of the big six might be opposed by the Trades Practices Commission, the competition regulator. The TPC can block mergers if it believes they would lead to 'a substantial lessening of competition'. The commission has not yet decided how this test would apply to the banks. Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), told a parliamentary banking inquiry last year he would not object to a banking merger on grounds of prudential supervision. A coalition government would probably draw the line at a single merger. However, Mr Hewson might also be tempted to allow one of the weaker banks to be acquired by a strong overseas bank. Such a takeover would end the balance sheet weaknesses undermining the sector. But it would require an amendment to the Bank Shareholders' Act, which would probably be opposed by the non-conservative majority in the Senate. Mr Hewson has indicated a conservative government would sell the federal government's 70 per cent stake in Commonwealth, which was part-privatised by Labor last year. Commonwealth has a strong balance sheet and the largest share of the loans and acceptances market. But it is unlikely to play much part in the rationalisation of the banking sector until after full privatisation, which could take some time. The quoted banking sector will be expanded during the three-year term of the next parliament by the sale of state-owned banks in South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales. The coalition has also suggested during campaigning that it would set up an inquiry into the system of prudential supervision, described by Mr Hewson as 'haphazard'. The inquiry would probably focus on the division of responsibilities between the RBA, which supervises the trading banks, and the state governments, which regulate building societies. But it could be widened to review the roles of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, which oversees the life offices, the Australian Securities Commission, the main corporate regulator, and the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

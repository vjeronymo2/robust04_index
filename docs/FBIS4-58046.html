			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Windows" column by Diya' Hasan: "An Agent Is One </F> Condoning the Killing of One's Own"]    [Text] Agents are too cheap to say no if the population of  a part of their region comes into harm's way. Indeed, as  servants doing the bidding of foreigners, they will stop at  nothing to hurt and slander the worthy people guarding the  homeland.    Sham patriots have overstepped the limits of decency in  kowtowing to foreigners. While they knock at the doors of the  West to antagonize it against their own people, as the agent  Jalal Talabani is doing, they look away from what is going in  the northern part of the autonomous region, where the Turkish  military is waging war with heavy weapons and the most  up-to-date F-15's and F-16's against Iraqi border villages.    The armed gang leaders remain tight-lipped as Turkish  military forces cross the Iraqi border and engage in mass  killings, with the full knowledge of those who have sold out to  the foreigners. In the meantime, the Turks declare that their  occupation of undesignated areas of our beloved north will last  for months, until the end of summer.    We have no sympathy for some people being duped by  foreigners. But we are saddened by the sight of the Kurdish  parties and their collaborators sacrificing the fate of Kurds  along the border with Turkey, in return for guarantees that  Ankara's military forces will spare their own men.    In an unsavory transaction, agents are purchasing their  survival with the blood of our Kurds, who are being slaughtered  in the beloved north of our country.</p>

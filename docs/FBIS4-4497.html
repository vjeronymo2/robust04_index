			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Opening speech by Kim Ki-nam, secretary of the Central </F> Committee of the Workers Party of Korea, at the national meeting  of party cell secretaries held at the Pyongyang Gymnasium in  Pyongyang on 31 March -- recorded]    [Text] Comrades: Today we are holding the significant  national meeting of party cell secretaries at a historic time  when all the people throughout the country are vigorously  accelerating the general march of socialism with the might of  singlehearted unity and the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude, upholding the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song's New Year's address and the decision of the 21st  plenary session of the sixth party Central Committee.    During the entire period from the time when it took roots in  the Down-With-Imperialism Union to date, our party has been  paying special attention to strengthening party cells, firmly  grasping it as its consistent organizational line to strengthen  infrastructural party organizations.    Our party, which has hundreds of thousands of militant party  cells, which are infinitely loyal to the party and the leader  [suryong], has been strengthened and developed into a veteran  and tested party that has been ever-victorious in the  complicated and arduous struggle for pioneering a totally new  path of socialism without knowing failure and without going  through twists and turns and into a mighty and revolutionary  party of chuche that has been in solid unity with the masses  while enjoying our people's absolute trust and love. [applause]    All victories and successes attained in party building and  in  the accomplishment of our revolutionary cause under the wise  leadership of the party and the leader [suryong] are a result of  the brilliant fruition of the chuche-oriented party building  line of our party, and the devoted efforts of party cell  secretaries who have made the victorious advance of the  revolution and construction dwell precisely on this. [applause]    The current national meeting of party cell secretaries held  under the auspices of the party Central Committee and for the  first time in the history of our party, as well as the history  of the international communist movement, will become an epochal  occasion, which further enhances the militant function and role  of party cells in strengthening the party's might in conformity  with the demands of the party and the developing revolution and  in vigorously accelerating the socialist cause of chuche.  [applause]    The current meeting has been attended by party cell  secretaries from the entire party and party functionaries from  central and local party organization--totaling some 10,600--who  have actively contributed to building our party and to  developing the revolution.    The meeting will sum up the successes and experiences  attained thus far in party cell work under the leadership of our  party and discuss tasks and methods to build all party cells  into militant organizations which are infinitely loyal to the  party and the leader [suryong], resolutely safeguard and defend  the socialist cause, and further add luster to it.    Firmly believing that the current meeting, held amid the  great interest and expectation of all party members and the  people throughout the country, will successfully carry out its  work on the strength of the high political zeal and active  efforts of all participants and, thus, will become a historic  meeting that marks a new turn in further strengthening and  developing our party and in adding luster to the socialist cause  of chuche, I declare the opening of the national meeting of  party cell secretaries.</p>

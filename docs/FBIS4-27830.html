			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- A film distorting the  history of the Korean war screened in Russia aroused a strong  protest among people.    On May 21, the Russian Ostankino TV Broadcasting Station  screened the film distorting the history of the Korean war, a  criminal political brainchild of Dmitriy Volkogonov styling  himself a historian.    The Central Committee of the Young Communist League of  Russia  published a statement on May 26 exposing the attempt of  pretended historian Volkogonov to distort history at the  biddings of a Western special agency.    The Korean war (1950-1953) was a war of the working people  of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea against the aggression  troops, the statement said, and stressed:    The heroic Korean people struggled for independence and  socialism from the beginning, holding high the banner of the  chuche idea under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song.    The screening of such a film over Russian TV is a campaign  for the U.S. ideological pressure on the DPRK. The statement  demanded the Russian TV leadership to show the objective and  historic truth of the Korean war.    The Young Communist League of Russia and young public  circles  studying the chuche idea in Moscow, together with the  progressive young people of Russia, demand that the Russian TV  not be allowed to screen false documents aggravating the  international situation, stressed the statement.    The employees of the Vladivostok "Roza Company" in a  statement of protest to general director of the Ostankino TV  Broadcasting Station Yakovlev Aleksandr Nicolayevich and Dmitriy  Volkogonov vehemently denounced Volkogonov's fabrication of  history and truth as an unpardonable insult to the Russian  people and the peaceloving people the world over.    The statement said that the Korean war was ignited by the  U.S. imperialists and their puppets, and branded venal  Volkogonov as a traitor of Russia and a political charlatan.    It sternly warned the Ostankino TV Broadcasting station not  to libel the dignity and honor of Russia.    Russian citizens Kim Andrei and Maxim, Rahimbek, general  director of the Bereke state farm in the Kazakh Republic,  Kazakh citizen Nam Valeri and others sent letters of protest to  the broadcasting station and Volkogonov.</p>

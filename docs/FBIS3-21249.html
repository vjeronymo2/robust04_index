			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Katsuo Katayama] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   As VLSI technology achieves a greater degree of  miniaturization and high-density capabilities, users  increasingly are demanding improved process technology and  equipment which will enhance miniaturization process performance  and will improve productivity.    Concerning etching techniques and equipment, as a wafer  aperture becomes larger, increasingly it becomes difficult to  ensure uniformity and to reduce etching damage. In etching  process which utilizes ECR plasma, formation of a  uniform-particle plasma is essential in solving the problems  mentioned above. As the methods of obtaining uniformity in  plasma, what have emerged thus far consist of the use of  multi-pole magnetic field[.sup]1)[/] in the ECR plasma  currently under research, improvement in uniformity of a  magnetic field in the direction of wafer surface in the ECR  region, and other such methods based on arrangement of a  magnetic field.[.sup]2),3)[/]    The plasma particle density distribution is dependent not  only on arrangement of magnetic fields but also on a microwave's  electric field mode. In the vicinity of walls inside the plasma  generation chamber, the above-mentioned microwave's electric  field has a low-level strength. Moreover, diffusion of the  plasma toward its interior walls results in lowering of plasma  particle density. Therefore, by keeping walls of a plasma  generation chamber away, namely, by enlarging the aperture of  the plasma generation chamber, we can maintain the uniform  particle density in plasma at the center of the plasma  generation chamber involved in etching.    This paper will evaluate change in plasma density  distribution, caused by the enlargement of a plasma-generating  chamber, by measuring ionic current density. Also covered will  be a large-aperture diameter ECR plasma etching technology,  making a high-aspect ratio etching feasible through the  application of the above evaluation result to the process of  oxide film etching.  <H5>  ECR Plasma Etching Equipment </H5>   Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a divergent magnetic type  ECR plasma etching equipment. Microwaves will be introduced into  the plasma generating chamber through a tapered waveguide and a  granite entry window of the chamber. Around the  plasma-generating chamber, 12 multi-pole magnets are attached.  The main coil magnetic field has been structured so as to be  able to achieve approximate uniformity in the ECR region in the  direction of a wafer surface. Moreover, the secondary coil  attached to the area surrounding the reaction chamber is  structured in such a way that it is possible to print a mirror  magnetic field.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-57A>           Figure 1. ECR Etching Equipment Components </FIG>       The plasma generated in the plasma chamber is irradiated on  the specimen table inside the reaction chamber through an  aperture. We measured ionic current density by using the single  probe method, arranging a probe on the specimen table  approximately 170mm away from the aperture.  <H5>  Effects of Expansion of Plasma-Generating Chamber </H5>   Figure 2 shows a distribution of ionic current density when  the plasma generating-chamber's inner diameter is changed from  200mm to 270mm while maintaining the aperture diameter at 190mm.  Although enlarging the plasma-generating chamber's inner  diameter will lower ionic current density centering around the  specimen table, in the peripheral area, almost no change has  been noted.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-58A>         Figure 2. Ionic Current Density Distribution When Plasma </FIG>       Figure 3 shows the distribution of ionic current density  affected by the change in the aperture diameter. Change in the  plasma chamber's inner diameter to 250mm increased the ionic  current density, thereby improving the degree of its uniformity.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-58B> Figure 3. Ionic Current Density Distribution When Aperture </FIG>      Figure 4 shows the ionic current density distribution when  the degree of the magnetic mirror impression is changed by the  secondary coil. Although the effect of plasma confinement by the  mirror magnetic field does appear, insofar as density  distribution is concerned, no significant change is noted.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-58C> Figure 4. Ionic Current Density Distribution When </FIG>      From the foregoing result, we have concluded that enlarging  the diameters of both the plasma-generating chamber and the  aperture not only expands plasma inside the reaction chamber but  also reduces effect upon the plasma in the region of the  irradiated specimen table by the diffusion and attenuation of  the plasma at the plasma-generating chamber's inner walls. These  effects enabled us to achieve the uniformity of density  distribution.    Figure 5 shows the ionic current density distribution when  12-electrode multi-pole magnets are attached to the region  surrounding the plasma-generating chamber area so as to prevent  scattering of the plasma toward the inner wall and to lower  ionic temperature. We used a permanent magnet with a surface  magnetic flux density of 3500 gauss and 45mm-block for the  multi-pole magnet. In the surrounding area of the  plasma-generating chamber, it is possible to attach up to 3  blocks. As shown in Figure 5, the distribution of density is  greatly influenced by the number of blocks attached. When only  one block is attached, without the magnet, density distribution  hardly changed; the tuning region of the incident microwaves,  however, expanded, stabilizing plasma discharge. In the future,  it will be necessary to ensure the optimal number of magnetic  poles and blocks, as well as to optimize magnetic flux density.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-59A> Figure 5. Distribution of Ionic Current Density When the </FIG>      In the following section, we will describe the oxide etching  technology which uses a large aperture ECR plasma source,  characterized by a 270mm-diameter plasma-generating chamber, a  250mm-diameter aperture, and a multi-pole magnet (with a 1-block  attachment).  <H5>  Application </H5> [.sup]4),5)[/] to Oxide Etching Process    Figure 6 [figure not reproduced] is a SEM photo showing a  cross section form of a contact hole when a high-frequency bias  potential is impressed and a thermal oxide film is etched using  a C[.sup]4[/]F[.sub]8[/] gas plasma. With the etching  condition producing [tai] resist selection ratio of  approximately 10, a 50% overetching was performed. The  only  differences between (a) and (b) in Figure 6 are the inner  diameter sizes of the plasma-generating chamber and the  aperture. Other parameters (gas pressure, microwave electrical  power, bias potential, and magnetic field) are the same. In the  past, even under the condition in which etching normally was  halted, the expansion of plasma generation chamber made it  possible to continue, thereby making a high aspect ratio  possible. This is due to the enlargement of the aperture, which  improved the degree of uniformity of the plasma density  distribution in the direction of the diameter and reduced  backward drift caused by the density difference.    Figure 7 shows the etching velocity and the in-plane  distribution of [tai] resist selection ratio based on an 8-inch  diameter wafer. We were able to obtain the thermal oxide etching  velocity of 340nm/min and etching uniformity within 5%,  plus or  minus, which are sufficient for handling an 8-inch wafer process.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-59B> Figure 7. Distribution of Etching Velocity and [tai] </FIG>      Figure 8 [figure not reproduced] shows the shape of a  cross-section of a 1.6-micron-thick BPSG film when a 50%  overetching was applied. We were able to achieve the type of  etching which produces the same form whether in center or in a  peripheral area of the wafer.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   By expanding diameters of both the internal part of the  plasma generating chamber and the aperture, we were able to  obtain the uniform distribution of ionic current density on the  specimen table. This is due to reduced effect on the specimen  table's irradiated plasma of plasma diffusion in the direction  of the plasma generating chamber walls.    As a result of application of the large aperture diameter  ECR  plasma to oxide etching process, even under the high-selectivity  condition (under which etching did not progress when the  conventional small aperture diameter plasma generation chamber  was used), we were able to obtain good etching form. Moreover,  with respect to the 8-inch diameter wafer, we were able to  achieve uniform etching with its velocity uniformity within  5%,  plus or minus.    Since the large aperture ECR plasma etching unit can  generate  uniform particle plasma in the low gas pressure region, it can  be expected to serve as an etching device offering uniformity,  high aspect ratio, and low damage features.

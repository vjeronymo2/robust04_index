			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, 17 Jan (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the republic of Srpska, today issue an order to all  subordinate commands and members of the republic of Srpska army  strictly to refrain, as always before, from engaging in any  military activities against UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and  other international organizations.    The order, issued ahead of the new round of Geneva  negotiations on former Bosnia-Herzegovina, is one more measure  of precaution in order to reduce to the minimum possible  manipulations, imputations, and accusations at the expense of  the republic of Srpska army, that it allegedly imperils members  of the international organizations in former Bosnia-Herzegovina,  sources close to the republic of Srpska leadership believe.    The Serbian side has so far been exceptionally cooperative  with international organizations, but it has often been accused  of putting humanitarian missions in jeopardy, despite the fact  that it has never engaged in military actions against members of  the international organizations, the sources say. [passage  omitted]    With a view to preventing any undesirable incidents with  international organizations, Karadzic issued a strict ban on all  military activities in the direction of Sarajevo airport  directed against any aircraft landing at the airport, any points  of deployment and convoys belonging to UNPROFOR, the UNHCR, the  International Committee of the Red Cross, and other humanitarian  organizations.    President Karadzic ordered that all UNPROFOR convoys,  military observers, and convoys belonging to international  humanitarian organizations, that have obtained valid permission  to move around in the territory of the republic of Srpska, be  provided with full protection and unhindered movement, with  planned and necessary inspection, and that "a completely fair  and professional attitude" be taken toward representatives of  all these organizations.    He also ordered that all controversial issues arising with  UNPROFOR representatives and military observers be dealt with  exclusively through corps commands and the main headquarters of  the republic of Srpska army, while disputes with international  humanitarian organizations are to be dealt with through the  government's coordinating body, a statement dispatched from the  office of republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic says.</p>

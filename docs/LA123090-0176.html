			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOURTH ANNUAL TRIVIA QUIZ;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY 1990  </P> <P> So, you thought you had seen your last pop quiz when you got out of school?  Wrong! There are fewer than 48 hours left until the new year begins, so it's  final exam time, to see just how close you were paying attention to the news in  1990. That's right, it's the fourth annual Times Orange County Trivia Quiz.  Don't bone up on subject areas such as world peace, global warming or the size  of the federal deficit. You'll be better prepared if you know such important  facts as the cost of an official souvenir tie at the Richard M. Nixon Library  &amp; Birthplace ($25), how many times bigger the new John Wayne Airport  terminal is than the old (12), and what Bishop Desmond Tutu's least favorite  ride was when he visited Disneyland (Splash Mountain). Answer 35 to 40 right  and you can rent yourself out to the public library's local history room. Get  25 to 34 right, and go to the head of the metered on-ramp. Get 15 to 24  correct, and go to the back of the line of the metered on-ramp. Fewer than 15  right? Move to Los Angeles County. But don't worry, this is an open-book test.  So pull out the last 364 issues of the daily newspaper and let's get trivial.  For answers see B12.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1.

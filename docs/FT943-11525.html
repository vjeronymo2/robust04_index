			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Pillar to float with Pounds 170m tag - Offer price represents 5.5% discount to net asset value Pillar Property Investments is coming to the market at 150p per share, an offer price which values the company at Pounds 169.7m - a 5.5 per cent discount to net asset value. Two of the better-known developers of the 1980s, Mr Raymond Mould and Mr Patrick Vaughan, are respectively chairman and chief executive of the group. The 60m shares on offer have been placed with institutions, with 15m subject to clawback for the public offer. Applications must be in by August 5 and dealings will begin on August 15. The offer, fully underwritten by BZW, will raise Pounds 87m for the company. Of this, Pounds 40m will be used to pay off loans, with the rest used to repay short-term borrowings and fund future acquisitions. Pillar was set up as a vulture fund to prey on institutional quality properties in the collapsing market of 1991. It has built up a Pounds 352m investment portfolio, comprising 26 commercial properties. At present, 64 per cent of Pillar's properties are let to either FT-SE 100 companies or government bodies, and there is an average unexpired lease length of 22 years. The company estimates that 85 per cent of its leases are now at, or below, current market prices. Debt will fall to Pounds 165.9m, with gearing reduced from 168 per cent to 92 per cent, improving interest cover from its Pounds 25.4m rent roll. COMMENT 'Full but fair' was the consensus verdict on the pricing of Pillar, which has amassed a quality portfolio of properties. The initial yield of the investment portfolio is currently 7 per cent, but that should go up sharply as rents rise - Pillar has a 41 per cent exposure to the retail sector, where rents are forecast to increase rapidly over the next few years. The shares offer a notional dividend yield of 3.1 per cent - below the sector average of 3.8 per cent - but Pillar will be better able to increase its dividend than other competitors with less attractive properties. The pricing means the shares may not go to much of an initial premium, despite having attracted solid institutional support.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DREXEL MAKES GLITZY PITCH FOR JUNK BONDS IN TOKYO  </P> <P> Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., whose Beverly Hills office pioneered high-yield  bonds, rolled out a bit of Hollywood glitz in Tokyo today to try to breathe  life into the sagging U.S. junk bond market.  </P> <P> Japanese investors hold only about 5% of outstanding junk bonds and analysts  fear that share could erode in the wake of highly publicized problems in the  market.  </P> <P> Eight junk bond issuers, led by Drexel Chairman John Shad, made private pitches  to local investors who were enticed to come to a conference by the attractions  of a sports clinic and dinner with a top Japanese television star.  </P> <P> Drexel provided artificial golf-putting greens and miniature driving ranges for  its guests. Later, women pros held a short seminar.  </P> <P> And at dinner, popular Tokyo TV host and singer Akiko Wada performed for about  300 persons attending. Waitresses were decked out in traditional kimono or  Playboy-bunny-like outfits and fishnet stockings.  </P> <P> At some of the presentations, a team of technicians sat perched behind a bank  of TV monitors and light controls worthy of a rock concert.  </P> <P> "It is a very entertaining program," one Japanese investor said. "Nobody went  to sleep."  </P> <P> But Japanese investors may not have been impressed enough to increase their  holdings of the high-yield bonds. "We are very cautious and a little worried,"  said another investor.  </P></p>

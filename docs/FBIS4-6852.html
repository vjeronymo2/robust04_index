			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- A top opposition lawmaker  Monday called on just-elected Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to  step up efforts for political reform to restore the credibility  of Japanese politics.    "I want to see him work toward dispelling the people's  distrust in politics," said Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP). "I heard the ruling coalition say  repeatedly that it should follow through on promised political  reform in order to restore the credibility of politics," Kono  told reporters.    Earlier in the day, Hata was elected prime minister to  succeed Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation on  April 8 over financial improprieties.    The LDP chief said his party may or may not cooperate with  the coalition, depending on whether the new administration will  do things for the benefit of the people. "If they carry out  steps that bring profits to the people, we will cooperate, but  if they take a stance that is not beneficial for the people, we  should stand firmly against them," he said.    Kono also said at a meeting of LDP legislators that his  party  should take a firm stance against the coalition's "forcible"  handling of Diet business. "The coalition's forcible way in its  handling of Diet business could destroy Japan's democracy...we  should firmly oppose that," he said.    Kono earlier criticized the coalition for a delay in  selecting Hata as their candidate for premier. "It took too  long since Hosokawa announced his intention to resign," Kono  said.    "The coalition should do some serious soul searching for the  political vacuum," he said.    On the LDP's intraparty affairs, Kono said he had agreed  with  former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe over joint efforts for  party reform. During the political uncertainty following  Hosokawa's resignation announcemment Watanabe expressed his  intention to leave the party to become a candidate for the  premiership, but later dropped the plan after he failed to  secure enough support among the coalition members or among his  followers for the move.</p>

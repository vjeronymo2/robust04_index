			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / The Long View: Weight of money Money on the move can be an awesome sight. This week it has again been pushing stock markets rapidly higher, with the FT-SE 100 Index topping the 3,500 level at one stage. It seems that equities can only go up and up and up; but across the Atlantic the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, yesterday threatened to spoil the party by announcing his long-awaited move to push up dollar short-term interest rates. His move comes amid clear signs of excess demand for financial assets around the globe. Look, for example, at the way money is cascading into investment trusts in the UK. The Tweedledum and Tweedledee European privatisation trusts being launched by Kleinwort Benson and Mercury Asset Management are each on course to raise around Pounds 500m. Elsewhere, the existing Fleming Japanese trust is seeking almost to double its size to over Pounds 500m, by exploiting the fact that its share price has moved to a premium over underlying assets. Most of the time shares in these closed-end funds are available at a discount because of chronic oversupply. But at periods like the present people are so desperate to get out of cash that they cannot tolerate the delay and inconvenience of buying particular investments - whether individual shares, or assets like property or gold. Instead they pay a premium for quick entry to indirect investment vehicles. Demand, however, creates supply. Not only are the investment fund promoters working overtime but the company flotation pipeline is full. In the queue for a London listing are Alpha Airports, Ashanti Goldfields, House of Fraser, Beazer and a whole lot more. I never fail to be astonished at the shifts in the balance of financial power between the end of one economic boom and the beginning of the next recovery - even though the changes are predictable. In the late 1980s the banks were financing a string of immense corporate transactions whereby companies were changing hands at twice the stock market price. Today the banks are cowed, and the stock market is carrying all before it. Normally I would trust the stock market on price, but today we are moving into dangerous territory. The figures are remarkable. In 1989, the most extreme year, British industrial and commercial companies spent Pounds 26bn on the securities of other companies at home and overseas in a massive takeover spree. In all they borrowed Pounds 34bn from banks that year. For last year we only have nine months' figures, but on an annualised basis the purchase of securities was down to Pounds 4bn and over Pounds 11bn was repaid to the banks. There are few takeover bids going on at present other than for special reasons, as amongst the ITV contractors. Instead companies are spinning off subsidiaries for what they see as temptingly high prices: Alpha is the airport catering side of Forte, while Hanson is proposing to float Beazer into a buoyant UK housebuilding sector. Formerly empire-building chief executives are at last forced to recognise that investors actually want clearly focused companies to invest in rather than rambling conglomerates. British Aerospace has this week trumpeted the merits of concentrating on its core activities rather than arguing, as it did five years ago when it bought Rover, that making cars was much like making planes. But the acquisitive tycoon's minis-to-jumbos philosophy is right out of fashion. The FT-SE Mid 250 index of medium-sized companies outperformed the Footsie index of the 100 biggest blue chips by some 12 percentage points in 1993 and it has already shown a relative gain of 7 points in 1994 so far. But if takeovers are out, expansion by direct investment in new productive assets surely ought to be in. The cost of capital to listed companies has tumbled: the average dividend yield is little more than 3 per cent, the average earnings yield is just 5.6 per cent on the basis of expected 1993 profits. Although more complex formulae are used by corporate planners, equity capital has certainly become cheaper. But fixed capital investment continued to fall last year in the UK, for the third year in a row. The January CBI opinion survey at least showed that on balance companies are now expecting to increase their capital spending over the next year but the positive tilt is still only small. The puzzle here is whether there is a lot of spare capacity in the British economy or not. Economists are all over the place on this point, because nobody knows how much old capacity has been closed or is unusable. At any rate there is a mismatch between the sudden enthusiasm of investors, who are pouring money into the securities markets, and the caution of company executives still influenced by the recession. It takes time to shift your priorities from survival to growth. According to the CBI survey British companies are keener to raise prices than increase their capacity: old habits die hard. Capacity utilisation in manufacturing, meanwhile, though not exactly high, is above the historical average level, the survey suggested. If the money pouring into equities is not in due course matched by an expansion of the productive and profit-generating assets owned by companies then it is inevitable that shareholders will end up losing heavily. In economic terms the bursting of a market bubble is a mechanism for wiping out wealth. There is a clear warning here from the bankers' unfortunate experiences of the late 1980s when they too poured billions into financing overpriced deals involving corporate assets or real estate and often wound up with huge bad debts. The extraordinary popularity of the privatisation trusts may reflect the perception of investors that one of the few havens of fair value is found in corporate assets newly available through privatisation. It could be a better idea than chasing existing shares still higher. But not at a big premium - certainly not when the Fed has signalled a possible new phase for the global market.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One State proposed retaining in &sect;20.2104(a) a requirement to determine prior occupational dose if an individual enters the restricted area. The NRC staff believes that retaining only the words ``is likely to receive, in a year, an occupational dose requiring monitoring,'' is sufficient to trigger a determination of prior dose. The State also suggested wording which would make licensees responsible for accounting for occupational exposure from nonlicensed activities. This is consistent with the Commission's position and the draft is revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provision in 10 CFR Part 20 for a ``Controlled area,'' its definition and its use in several other sections of Part 20 would be deleted. Licensees would continue to have the option to control access to areas for reasons other than radiation protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rulemaking would revise the definition of ``Occupational dose'' to delete reference to the ``Restricted area'' so that the occupational dose limit and its associated radiation protection provisions, such as training and individual monitoring requirements, would apply to an individual who in the course of employment has assigned duties involving exposure to radiation and/or to radioactive material. This change would also indicate that public dose limits cannot be exceeded for members of the public even if they enter a restricted area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``Unrestricted area'' would be revised to make it clear that for the purposes of radiation protection areas, are either restricted or unrestricted and that access to unrestricted areas can be controlled for reasons other than radiation protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Instructions to Workers,'' 10 CFR 19.12, would be revised to make clear that training commensurate with the hazards present must be provided to all individuals who have the potential to be occupationally exposed rather than just to individuals working in or frequenting any portion of a restricted area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Reports to individuals of exceeding dose limits,'' 10 CFR 20.2205, is added to restore to part 20 the Commission's intent that any identified individual, including members of the public, who receives an exposure in excess of the dose limits for which a report to the NRC is required, will receive notification of that exposure from the licensee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that these proposed changes will have some, albeit relatively minor, impacts on licensees. The impacts associated with each of the changes are outlined below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the deletion of the definition of controlled area, the Commission believes that there will be little impact on most power reactor licensees. Although some confusion has surfaced associated with the intent of the terms ``controlled area'' and ``occupational dose,'' these definitions have been discussed extensively with and by industry representatives, and the Commission believes that the proposed rule generally reflects current and planned practices of many reactor licensees. Licensees can continue to designate areas as controlled areas for purposes other than radiological protection, irrespective of whether the term appears in the rule or not.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some licensees have already implemented the revised standards, and procedures have been written which would require changes as a result of this proposed rulemaking if these procedures have employed the concept of controlling areas for radiological protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For those reactor licensees who have already formally implemented the revised standards or who have a need for the additional flexibility afforded by the use of the concept of controlled area for purposes of radiological protection, the provisions for exemptions from the NRC's regulations provides an avenue of relief. The NRC currently believes that the elimination of the concept of ``Controlled area'' will have such a small impact on most power reactor licensees that it does not constitute a backfit as envisioned by 10 CFR 50.109. The action removes flexibility but does not directly impose new procedures. However, the NRC welcomes comments on whether this action does in fact constitute a backfit, the degree of burden imposed by the action, particularly for licensees who have already implemented the revised standards, and on whether in the limited matter of ``Controlled area,'' provisions for grandfathering should be provided in the final rule to avoid such burdens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revising the definition of ``Unrestricted area'' further makes clear the NRC's intent that for purposes of radiation protection, areas are either restricted or unrestricted. Some minor modifications to procedures and training may be necessitated by this change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the change involving the term occupational exposure, the Commission believes that some minor editorial modifications of procedures and training will be necessary. Occupational exposure was previously defined to include both presence in a restricted area and activities involving exposure to radiation and/or radioactive materials. Elimination of the reference to restricted areas will not change the scope of applicability of the term occupational dose for most licensees' employees. Furthermore, this change as it relates to doses to members of the public, makes it clear that doses to members of the public must remain within the limits for members of the public, even if they are present within a restricted area. This distinction may result in some minor corrections to procedures and administrative control levels. However, it should be noted that licensees have controlled and continue to control the exposure of these individuals to small fractions of the public dose limit. Thus, there should be no significant change necessary in licensee activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The conforming change to 10 CFR part 19 is minor and will affect only a small number of licensees and will have a negligible impact. For the modification of the training requirements to match the definition of occupational exposure, the Commission believes that licensees will need to make relatively minor modifications to training procedures to reflect the new definition. Training remains ``commensurate with potential radiological health protection problems'' and, thus, the scope of the training activities is not anticipated to require modification. The Commission also believes that any small incremental increase in burden of additional occupationally exposed individuals requiring training will be offset by the reduction in burden inherent in the fact that members of the public entering a restricted area will no longer be required to be trained in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR part 19.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

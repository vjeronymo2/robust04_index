			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Embraer cuts workforce as aircraft demand falls EMBRAER, the state-owned Brazilian aeronautics company set for privatisation, is to reduce its 8,200-strong work force by 30 per cent. The company's factory will remain idle until June 4, and about 5,200 employees will join another 2,600 who have been on paid leave since March. Depressed international demand for aircraft had led to the cuts, the company said. Production of Embraer's leading product, the 30-seat turboprop Brasilia, is still projected to reach 36 units this year but output dropped from 48 units in 1990 to 31 last year. The worldwide recession, especially in the US, has been taking its toll on the company. In 1991, sales reached just Dollars 402m; exports accounted for Dollars 271.5m of the total. In 1990, overall sales were Dollars 582m and exports Dollars 365m. Brasilia sales account for half of Embraer's receipts, and the depressed market was evident in the results for 1991, when the company lost Dollars 235m. In 1990, it suffered a loss of Dollars 265m. Analysts warned, however, that comparisons between 1990 and 1991 results for Brazilian companies were difficult due to changes in accounting regulations.</p>

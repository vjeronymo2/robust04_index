			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nadja Pengov and Suzana Kos on news conference by </F> Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek in Ljubljana on 19 January --  recorded]    [Text] Regarding the different public assessments on what  Partnership for Peace means for Slovenia, Prime Minister Dr.  Janez Drnovsek has presented his view. According to him, the  offer for Slovenia to actively participate in the NATO security  concept is very advantageous and at the moment, the optimum  opportunity. Partnership for Peace provides Slovenia with the  equal initial conditions that other European countries have.  However, it is up to Slovenia to decide how it will join the  partnership. According to the prime minister, what is important  for us is to cooperate on drafting defense concepts. We also  have the opportunity to hold consultations if our security is  endangered. It is also important that the document has  particularly presented the concept of the so-called clear  defense -- in fact, defense that is under the complete control  of civilian politics.    Regarding relations with Croatia, our government does not  want to bring the events connected with Croatia's debts to the  Krsko nuclear power plant to the state level. The government is  convinced that Croatia has to settle its liabilities for the  electricity that belongs to it and that this is a matter of  usual business relations. The prime minister expects that this,  as well as other open questions between the two states, will be  solved soon at the meeting with Croatian Prime Minister Nikica  Valentic, which is to be held in Ljubljana next Tuesday, 25  January. The meeting should be a new stage in our relations.  However, we cannot guarantee that, he said, even though  Slovenia is interested in solving all disputed questions and in  not having mutual relations become aggravated.    The Piran Bay border will be, according to Dr. Drnovsek, one  of the most difficult problems in the negotiations.    [Drnovsek] The Slovene stands in this respect are clear and  proceed from our sovereignty. The Croatian views, however,  about the Piran Bay have so far been somewhat different.    The way in which this issue will be solved depends on how  all  the other problems are solved. Regarding the nuclear power  plant's debts, the government expects the Croatian side to begin  settling the debts. In case this does not happen, some  technical measures are already being prepared in the nuclear  power plant, but this may not be necessary. Slovenia will also  guarantee the rights that ensue from the Croatian share in the  nuclear power plant.    Dr. Drnovsek also touched upon the decision that Slovenia  will no longer directly pay part of the debts of the former  Yugoslavia to the group of commercial banks until an agreement  is reached on the division of these liabilities. There is still  no reaction on the part of the creditors to the Slovene  decision. Our side expects this decision to speed up  negotiations and that the (?solidarity) clause and the freezing  of assets of the receiver of the loans will not be implemented.  According to Dr. Drnovsek, the decision will not affect the  promised loans that Slovenia, among others, should receive from  the World Bank.    Regarding this year's budget, the prime minister said that  the government will submit the document to the parliamentary  procedure within the next 10 days. The deputies should adopt it  at a session in March. The government will continue the present  orientations concerning the volume of the budget, which should  not exceed 402 billion [currency not specified], Prime Minister  Drnovsek said. The coalition partners should coordinate all key  questions before the parliamentary debate. For example, the  coalition will try to agree, among other things, on the fact  that all [word indistinct] funds will come within the framework  of the budget.    [Drnovsek] Concerning money for gasoline, the Army, and  education, it is important that solutions be coordinated within  that joint framework of 402 billion. It is in this direction  that we seek coordination, which means that funds earmarked for  defense, for example, should not exceed the funds for education  and that the education funds should not, conditionally speaking,  exceed the Army funds. These are two spheres, and there are  also other ones, but there should be a rational solution  available that is reasonable and which can be argued for and put  into the framework of these 402 billion.    Regarding the social agreement on the basis of which all  partners, including the trade unions, will accept their share of  responsibility for Slovenia's future, the prime minister said  that in case the social agreement is not adopted, the government  will adopt the appropriate measures -- above all, on the  regulation of wages. According to him, administrative measures  will not be involved, but the paying of wages will be regulated  by law as it is regulated by the current collective agreement.  [Word indistinct] of the mentioned wages is fatal for the  Slovene economy and could lead to its bankruptcy, said the prime  minister. The government will wait for the decision by the  coalition partners for approximately two more weeks. Let us  also mention that the Association of the Free Trade Unions  yesterday rejected the draft social agreement. Dr. Drnovsek  comments on that decision:    [Drnovsek] If it is true that this is their response, then  what I just said also holds. The real assessment is that a  social agreement is not possible at this time, that obviously  not all partners are ready, that some of the partners are not  ready to accept responsibility or cannot accept the  responsibility ensuing from such an agreement. In that case,  all this responsibility would have to be taken over by the  government, along with all the difficulties that would ensue  from that.</p>

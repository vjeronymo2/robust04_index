			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> IN A COOLER CLIMATE, GARDEN GROVE'S ETHNIC STRAINS UNWIND  </P> <P> A woman steps to the podium to express her anger about the abundance of foreign  language signs in the city. A Korean man comes forward to protest a proposed  ordinance requiring the English language on business signs.  </P> <P> The place is Garden Grove, and the issue spawns a heated debate that stretches  well into the evening, punctuated by occasional fist pounding, exasperated  sighs from the audience, discourses on civil rights and the English-only  initiative, and accusations and counter-accusations of discrimination.  Anti-Asian hate flyers mysteriously fill the City Council chambers.  </P> <P> A few months later, 15 people are gathered in a circle, sipping coffee and  nibbling on egg rolls in a Korean-owned carpet shop on Garden Grove Boulevard,  the pulse of the Korean merchant and social center of Orange County. They are  there for the third session of a dialogue.  </P> <P> The Orange County Human Relations Commission, with support from the city of  Garden Grove and the Korean Chamber of Commerce, brought together this group of  Korean merchants and Anglo residents to reduce simmering tensions and discuss  issues of mutual concern. Many are the same players from the council chambers,  but in a different setting and working under different rules.  </P> <P> A Korean immigrant explains to the group how in spite of his 20-plus years in  the United States and his U.S. education, he never entirely forgets that he is  different. He has an Asian face and speaks with an accent; he's always a little  bit an outsider. Hence the love for "Koreatown," a kind of emotional/social  sanctuary where one can breathe the luxurious air of an insider for a few  minutes each day.  </P> <P> A longtime Garden Grove resident talks about feeling like an outsider in  "Koreatown." Being American is about being united as one community, she says,  not creating separate clusters within a city.  </P> <P> Garden Grove, once dotted with orange groves and home to the annual Strawberry  Festival, was already stretching beyond its rural, small-town roots well before  the Korean immigrants began to arrive in the mid-'70s.  </P> <P> Veteran residents point to the construction of the Garden Grove Freeway as the  beginning of the end of Garden Grove Boulevard as a thriving hometown business  district. The boulevard slumped into economic decline, and the Koreans, like so  many immigrants before them, discovered in the boulevard a tremendous  opportunity to prosper and be self-sufficient in their adopted land.  </P> <P> The fact that not one of the participating Korean merchants is a resident of  Garden Grove raised a sore point: Outsiders. What is the acid test,  participants wondered, for loyalty to one's community? Does one who owns  commercial property have less of a stake in a community than one who owns  residential property? How long must one reside in a community to establish a  sincere commitment? One interesting discovery from the dialogue: The mayor is  the only native-born resident of Garden Grove in the group.  </P> <P> Differing cultural values can also create tension. For example, immigrants have  an intense drive to succeed, for their children to succeed. Assumption:  Native-born Americans are not hard-working, not goal-oriented, don't care if  their children get an education. Assumption: Koreans are elitist, too  status-driven.  </P> <P> Participants adjust the focus on their cultural lenses for a moment. "Of course  we want good things for ourselves and our children. But there are many  definitions of success," an Anglo participant says to agreeing nods. "I  understand," a Korean man responds. "But this broader interpretation of success  is a luxury for a new immigrant. Perhaps for the next generation."  </P> <P> And what about senior citizens? The American institution of nursing homes  becomes a topic for discussion. Koreans explain traditional Asian values of  respect for elders and the extended family unit. Assumption: Americans don't  care about their elders, don't have a strong commitment to family.  Anglo-Americans share emotional anecdotes about the frustration, the pain in  choices made for aging parents, about exploring innovative solutions to  shortcomings in today's elderly care. A critical value, they point out, is  independence, to not be a burden to one's adult children.  </P> <P> One Korean member mentions that local Korean leaders are exploring options for  elderly housing, because, given the alternative, many Korean elders would  rather be on their own. The imaginary lines that divide "us" from "them" begin  to blur.  </P> <P> In another session, dialogue members talked about awarenesses that had been  created as a result of the meetings. "I found that Americans were more  generous, kinder than I had thought before," one participant said in a  statement seconded by other Koreans. Their original, negative impression was no  doubt helped along by their experiences in City Council debates.  </P> <P> Again, the lines blur as to who is the insider and who is the outsider.  </P> <P> One of the future challenges for the dialogue members will be to explore how to  help the Korean and Anglo communities adjust the focus on their lenses as well,  to move beyond assumptions about culture or newcomers versus old-timers and  work together to reduce community tensions.  </P> <P> A similar challenge, or opportunity, exists for Orange County in general. Just  as Garden Grove Boulevard is no longer what it was before the freeway, so too  has the county's face changed in recent years.  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors created the Human Relations Commission to  transform inter-ethnic conflicts into opportunities to build strength from our  differences. We can accept our growing diversity and work to develop mutual  respect and understanding, or we can stubbornly cling to old ideas that will  lead us down the path to inter-ethnic conflict and violence.  </P></p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: MCC liabilities exceeded assets by Pounds 763m MAXWELL Communication Corporation's liabilities exceeded its assets by Pounds 763.5m at the end of last year, according to a letter sent yesterday to MCC's creditors by Price Waterhouse. The accountants, who are joint administrators of MCC under UK insolvency law following the collapse of the business empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell, will meet creditors on May 14 to discuss plans for selling the businesses. The letter's Statement of Affairs, drawn up by some of MCC's directors and sworn by Mr Basil Brookes, finance director, says that at December 20 MCC had liabilities of Pounds 1.49bn but assets of only Pounds 724.9m. Liabilities included unsecured borrowings of Pounds 1.28bn and foreign exchange and swaps contracts of Pounds 59.7m. They also included a Pounds 52m liability for the deficit on the pension fund which was plundered by Mr Maxwell, together with the pension funds of his other companies, in an attempt to prop up his tottering private companies. However, the administrators have received legal advice that 'MCC has no liability in this respect'. The biggest part of the asset figure - Pounds 673.5m - is the estimated sale value of MCC's subsidiaries. However, the letter emphasises that the administrators have not yet decided whether to sell the US publishing businesses, the largest of the subsidiaries, in one piece or broken up. Price Waterhouse will now ask other directors for their sworn statements of concurrence with these figures, and confirmed last night that this will include Mr Kevin Maxwell, the late publisher's youngest son, formerly MCC's chief executive.</p>

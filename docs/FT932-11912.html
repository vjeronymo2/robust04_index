			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Shareholders criticise Barclays' chairman MR ANDREW Buxton, chair-man and chief executive of Barclays, was yesterday subjected to fierce criticism, including repeated calls for his resignation, at the bank's annual meeting in London. Mr Buxton, whose bank last year incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m, was told by several shareholders that he should take responsibility for lending mistakes that led to it making Pounds 2.5bn provisions against bad and doubtful debts. A group of the 400 shareholders at the meeting applauded as Mr Buxton was told by one shareholder that there was 'no reason to believe that someone who has failed in the past should succeed in the future'. Mr Buxton, who was appointed executive chairman in January, told shareholders that they should 'look to the future' and accept that the management had put in place measures to improve risk management and earnings. 'I have been given a job to do by the board as chairman, and I think we should be getting on with it and improving the company. We have started that process,' said Mr Buxton, who answered largely hostile questions for two hours. Despite the verbal criticism, all motions proposed to the meeting were passed. Lord Camoys, Sir Nigel Mobbs and Mr Humphrey Norrington were all re-elected as directors with only a handful of shareholders voting against. Mr Buxton said that the appointment of a new chief executive, which he announced last month after criticism from institutional shareholders, 'should not be rushed, but I assure you that does not imply any lack of progress.' He was 'looking forward' to the arrival of a chief executive who would be responsible for ensuring 'the hands-on implementation of strategy, and the smooth running of the group' while he ensured the correct strategies. He said one of the functions of the chief executive would be to 'maximise the benefits of co-operation' among the operating divisions, including branch banking and the BZW investment bank. Mr Buxton also announced that Barclays was setting up a pilot telephone banking service covering 10,000 customers from this summer, as well as making a number of experimental changes to its branch network and use of technology. He faced calls for cuts in the salaries and bonuses of the directors to reflect the halving of the final dividend last year. However, he said that the level of bonuses had already fallen as a result of the loss. 'I do not think that wholesale sacking of your board and your management would be in the interests of the company', Mr Buxton told one shareholder.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / BAe in friendly takeover talks with VSEL British Aerospace has made a friendly bid approach to VSEL, the Barrow-based maker of Trident submarines. Discussions are continuing about the terms of the deal, which would offer BAe shares in exchange for those in VSEL. A deal may be finalised as early as next week. As VSEL confirmed an approach from an unnamed suitor yesterday, its shares leapt 252p to finish at 1,225p, valuing the company at Pounds 465m. BAe shares fell 15p to 449p. A successful bid would strengthen VSEL's attempt to become a prime contractor, controlling all aspects and risks of future submarine contracts, since it would be backed by BAe's experience of managing large projects. BAe would be able to expand its business base from prime contracting in aircraft to naval systems. The deal would mark a further consolidation of the UK defence industry, which is forming around GEC with its electronics expertise and BAe with its complex contract management skills. VSEL was floated out from the government-owned British Shipbuilders in 1986. Employees subscribed for 20 per cent of the equity at 100p a share, but most of them have since sold their holdings. VSEL is currently competing to build the next batch of Trafalgar nuclear hunter-killer submarines for the Royal Navy, an order worth around Pounds 2.5bn. For the first time in submarine construction, the contract will be awarded on a fixed-price basis, with the prime contractor taking much of the risk. As a small company, VSEL had difficulty persuading the Ministry of Defence that it was a credible prime contractor. An alliance with BAe would ease such fears. VSEL is currently teamed with US electronics company Loral to bid for Trafalgar, and it is unclear whether a deal with BAe would scupper that alliance. BAe is involved in the Horizon programme to develop the next generation of frigates for the UK, France and Italy, and was known to be interested in bidding for the next batch of Trafalgar submarines. BAeSema, a joint venture company partly owned by BAe, makes the command and control systems for Trafalgar submarines and Royal Navy frigates. GEC is also interested in the Trafalgar order, but had apparently decided against bidding for VSEL to win the contract. It is not known whether BAe's approach to VSEL will change GEC's view of such a bid. The proposed share exchange with VSEL would strengthen BAe's balance sheet, and the Pounds 325m of cash which VSEL held at its year end in March would almost eliminate the Pounds 367m of net debt which BAe reported in June. Such a deal would resemble a disguised rights issue, though BAe's prime motive for the deal is thought to be industrial, not financial. London stocks, Page 40</p>

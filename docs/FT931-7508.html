			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Foreign Affairs: Vote to break the bosses - Italy needs an Irish, not UK, electoral system Few countries are wholly satisfied with their electoral system. In Britain many people are acutely frustrated by the unfairness of a system in which most voters have no chance of influencing the result one way or the other, and many live all their lives without being represented by either the party or the individual of their choice. Even the Labour party, which traditionally has favoured the system, seems now to be coming round to the idea of reform after losing four general elections in a row. Yet in Italy there is even greater frustration at the effects of the party list system, where voters choose between lists of candidates drawn up by political parties. This ensures proportional representation (PR) for the parties but is also blamed for the immobility and corruption of Italian politics. The British system is envied in Italy because it gives voters the chance to choose between alternative governments. The problem is, of course, that in a parliamentary democracy parliament has two functions - to represent the different strands of public opinion and to provide effective government - which are not easily compatible. PR achieves the former, but sometimes at the expense of the latter - a good reason, perhaps, for opposing it as a method of choosing national parliaments, but hardly applicable to the European Parliament, unless or until it is proposed to make Europe a parliamentary democracy, with a federal government responsible to a federal assembly. In Israel, which at present has an even purer version of the party list system than Italy, with somewhat similar results, a law has been passed providing for the next prime minister to be elected directly by the people. Israelis do not seem to have realised it yet, but the effect will be to turn Israel from a parliamentary democracy into either a presidential one like the US (welcome to gridlock) or a semi-presidential one like France (welcome to co-habitation). Italian reformers, less radical, are campaigning for a mixed electoral system. Although they would like a majority of MPs to be elected in single-member constituencies (with either one or two ballots), they want to keep the party list system for a minority - either one third or 40 per cent  -to give a somewhat more proportional overall result. Oddly enough this converges with the proposal currently favoured in the Labour party, which would keep the present British system for 500 MPs, but allow 150 to be chosen on a party list system. Such ideas approximate to, but fall well short of, the system used in Germany. There, half the seats are filled from single-member constituencies, the other half from party lists in such a way that each party's share of seats in the Bundestag is proportionate to its share of the popular vote, with the important qualification that parties obtaining less than 5 per cent of the votes cast get no seats at all. If what Italians want is to keep a reasonably representative system while abolishing the overweening power of party politicians, they should consider the single transferable vote system (STV). This is used in the Irish Republic; in Northern Ireland (for local and European, but not Westminster, elections); and in Malta, which one might think quite close to Italy culturally as well as geographically. But for some reason it is never mentioned in discussions on the continent. In Britain, STV is usually advocated as a form of PR, but in a way that misses the point. PR is purely concerned with the relative strengths of political parties, taking for granted that voters identify with parties and wish to be represented by them. (That probably explains why there is little discussion of PR in the US, where political parties are relatively unimportant and personal followings, especially on the local level, count for much more.) STV, by contrast, ignores the existence of parties. Voting takes place in multi-member constituencies, but votes are cast for individual candidates, not for party lists. Voters number the candidates in order of preference, in which they may or may not be influenced by party affiliation or endorsement. In so far as they do follow party advice the result will tend to be proportional, because surplus votes for a successful candidate are transferred to the voter's next choice. But marginal seats will often be decided between two parties by the second or lower preferences of voters whose first choice - whether already elected, or eliminated as having two few votes to win a seat in his own right - was a candidate of neither. Thus the final outcome may give a different ranking of parties than would a straight proportional system, and yet be more representative, because even voters whose first choice was eliminated will be represented by their second or lower choice. This has the effect of limiting the number of parties in parliament, but in a more democratic way than either the single-member constituency system or the use of a percentage threshold - both of which effectively disfranchise supporters of small parties. Most politicians hate STV, because it is subversive of party discipline. Even national leaders can on occasion be beaten by challengers from within their own party, if they lose touch with local opinion. That has led Labour's Plant Commission (chaired by Professor Raymond Plant) to reject STV as 'capricious'. But what it really means is that ordinary voters gain power at the expense of party bosses. In the present European - and especially Italian - political climate, that is surely a point in its favour.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO PASSES ORANGE COAST 'TEST,' WINS EASILY, 36-17  </P> <P> So much for John Featherstone's prediction. The El Camino College football  coach said his team would be tested in its Mission Conference opener Saturday  night against visiting Orange Coast.  </P> <P> But after overpowering Antelope Valley in their opener two weeks ago, the  Warriors could have used a better test. El Camino, which has been idle since  Sept. 9, kept a nine-game winning streak alive by defeating Orange Coast,  36-17, in what turned out to be more of a scrimmage.  </P> <P> The Warriors, ranked No. 10 in the nation by the JC Grid-Wire and No. 4 in the  state by the JC Athletic Bureau, improved their record to 2-0, while unranked  Orange Coast fell to 1-1.  </P> <P> El Camino was extremely productive against the Pirates' defense. Sophomore  quarterback Frank Dolce completed 20 of 28 passes for 277 yards.  </P> <P> With nine minutes left in the third quarter, Dolce completed a 48-yard bomb to  sophomore David Blakes. A minute later, he found Al Savea open in the end zone  on a three-yard pass that gave El Camino a 30-3 edge.  </P> <P> Orange Coast scored its first touchdown four minutes later when quarterback  Greg Angelovic connected with Tim Parker on a 25-yard pass that made the score  30-9. Angelovic completed 6 of 17 passes for 90 yards.  </P> <P> With 8:51 left to play in the game the Pirates scored again on a 13-yard run by  Jason McGehee. Mike Vaez ran for the two-point conversion to make it 30-17.  </P> <P> The Warriors answered with their last touchdown, a 4-yard run by sophomore  running back Alfred Lowe with 6:19 left to play.  </P> <P> "I realized we got a little sloppy in the third quarter," Featherstone said,  "but when you're up like we were, that happens. I was really pleased with our  effort."  </P> <P> It was evident from the start that El Camino was anxious to get the show  started. The Warriors had lengthy drives in the first half, and Dolce completed  12 of 18 passes for 170 yards and one touchdown.  </P> <P> Freshman Louis Perez kicked a 46-yard field goal on El Camino's first  possession.  </P> <P> El Camino also scored on its next possession, a 66-yard drive capped by Dolce's  3-yard pass to freshman wide receiver Shannon Thompson, and led 23-3 at the  half.  </P> <P> El Camino plays top-ranked Fullerton on the road next Saturday. The Warriors'  last loss was against Fullerton on Oct.1 of last year.  </P></p>

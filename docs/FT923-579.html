			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Gould quits shadow cabinet to oppose Maastricht THE BATTLE over the Maastricht treaty finally engulfed the Labour party yesterday when Mr Bryan Gould shattered the leadership's fragile truce on Europe by quitting the shadow cabinet. His resignation from the post of heritage spokesman - on the eve of the party's annual conference in Blackpool - boosted growing opposition to the leadership's pro-Maastricht policy. It also cast a pall over the conference that senior party officials had hoped would capitalise on Conservative disarray on Europe and rally support to Mr John Smith in his first appearance as leader. Senior party figures and union leaders last night expressed open anger with the timing of Mr Gould's decision, arguing that he had seriously underminded Labour at a moment when the Conservatives were on the defensive. Mr Gould's widely anticipated resignation frees him to act as standard bearer for those opposing any return to the exchange rate mechanism and to head the growing campaign for a referendum on the Maastricht treaty. In an exchange of letters with Mr Smith, he said he no longer felt able to reconcile his 'strongly held views on the economy and the future of Europe' with his obligation to uphold collective responsibility for shadow cabinet decisions. 'I am accordingly, and with deep regret, obliged to resign from the shadow cabinet,' he wrote. In reply, Mr Smith, who trounced Mr Gould by a ratio of nine to one in the leadership election this summer, acknowledged that in the light of the 'clear decision taken by the shadow cabinet on policy towards Europe' it was impossible for him to stay on. The resignation came amid mounting evidence that Labour MPs are increasingly divided over the party's response to the Maastricht treaty and Britain's suspension of its ERM membership. The official stance - similar to that of Mr John Major - rejects any resumption of the Commons debate on the ratification of Maastricht until the Danes have clarified how they plan to proceed. Labour also opposes a return to the ERM until an industry policy is in place and agreements are reached with other EC countries on reforming the system. However, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said yesterday that Labour supported a system of 'managed but flexible exchange rates' and rejected a free-floating pound. Evidence of Labour MPs' disquiet emerged in a poll of 100 MPs conducted by the BBC's On The Record programme. A total of 42 opposed ratification of the treaty, 19 wanted amendments and only 25 backed the pact. Forty six backed a referendum with 44 against. Today, the conference will debate a resolution demanding a referendum. By allowing the motion, which is certain to be defeated, Labour leaders hope to undermine future attempts by MPs to press for a plebiscite. Observer, Page 23</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Transportation Minister Bernard Bosson by </F> correspondent Sylvie Johnson; place and date not given--recorded]    [Bosson] We have confirmed what we have always said; that  is, that we would open the Orly-London route; that we are  getting what we wished, in other words that this opening should  take place without undue haste, enabling the French authorities  to sort out all the technical, security, environmental, and  traffic problems at Orly; finally, the British have accepted for  their part to take into account the difficulties faced by our  companies in gaining access to London's airports, and in  particular to Heathrow. We will be able to work on this  together: these are not simple problems, but from the moment  that we approach them openly together, I believe that we will be  able to solve them in the best possible manner.    [Johnson] Has a date been set to open Orly Airport to  British companies?    [Bosson] Before 30 June.    [Johnson] Have the British committed themselves to giving up  their attempt to force a landing at Orly this evening or  tomorrow?    [Bosson] Absolutely. There remains the problem that British  airlines are much more independent of the government than are  French airline companies, but the British minister is doing  everything that has to be done in this direction, and the  problem is completely solved.    No plane will land either this evening or tomorrow, and as  soon as Monday [16 May], we will be working together to examine  our reciprocal difficulties. Concerning Orly, they are clear,  and they will be solved quickly, and concerning the London  airports and Heathrow, the difficulties are known, and they are  finally being taken into account. I am therefore very satisfied  at the understanding shown by my British counterpart, and by the  work we have done, which reflects the our good relations, in  that it has been open, and has taken due account of our  reciprocal concerns.    [Johnson] Would you describe the agreement as a victory for  France, for Britain, for Europe?    [Bosson] It is a victory for the Franco-British friendship,  which has enabled us to solve this problem together, with  reciprocal understanding. It is a perfectly balanced accord.</p>

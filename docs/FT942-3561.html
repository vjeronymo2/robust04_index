			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Few non-professional investors can understand new accounts guidance Few non-professional investors can understand the operating and financial review, the new guidance on commentary in accounts which is designed to explain a company's performance in words, a survey suggested yesterday. Analysts and investors believe non-professional readers of accounts will not bother to read nor be able to use the information in the review, research sponsored by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said. Professionals, however, found them very useful. The review was introduced by the Accounting Standards Board last year as a voluntary code, and its guidelines are now being followed by a growing number of companies. The aim is to allow directors to describe their company's performance in a way that they feel most appropriate, outside the restrictions of formal accounting standards. The survey, conducted by Professor Pauline Weetman, director of research for the Institute, calls for the review to be made into a mandatory standard as quickly as possible. It says the review should have statutory backing through changes to Stock Exchange rules or more rigorous audit guidelines. Based on detailed interviews with 20 institutional investors and senior staff with broking firms, it rejects the argument by companies that much new information cannot be disclosed because it is commercially sensitive. It says companies should see the review as a way to demonstrate their openness and accountability by reporting significant uncertainties and providing forward-looking information. It also recommends that ways should be found to reduce the time lag between a company's results and the production of the annual report months later.

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ANNIE 2' RATES RAVES, LIKE IN RAVING 'WITLESS'  </P> <P> "Annie" was a musical to take to your heart, but you'll want to take a paddle  to "Annie 2: Miss Hannigan's Revenge," the sequel that opened Thursday night in  the Kennedy Center Opera House.  </P> <P> Most of the same creative talents are back on the job, looking to repeat the  miracle that made "Annie" the sleeper of 1977.  </P> <P> But you'd never guess it if your program didn't say so. What was so disarming  the first time around has become witless and belabored. The plot cooked up by  Thomas Meehan is preposterous. The score by Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin  is dull.  </P> <P> And this decade's Annie, Danielle Findley, while possessed of a voice that can  no doubt be heard in West Virginia, seems to have acquired a bratty side now  that she's living in the lap of luxury.  </P> <P> About all that serves to connect the two shows are the sets by David Mitchell,  who can make New York City in the Depression one swell-looking place. The  highlight of "Annie 2," in fact, occurs when a vast ocean liner sails past a  dilapidated tugboat attached to a pier on the East River. The tugboat tosses  wildly in the wake, while the liner, a dark colossus, blasts its horns and  glides efficiently out to sea.  </P> <P> Watching "Annie 2" is like being invited to a fabulous party and then  discovering that there's no one interesting to talk to. You wind up staring at  the pictures on the wall.  </P> <P> The musical continues its pre-Broadway tryout through Jan. 20.  </P></p>

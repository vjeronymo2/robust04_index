			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (14): Money for butter, not guns, is the priority - A radical overhaul of the armed forces presents big problems AS the legal successor to the former Soviet Union, the reforms which are being undertaken by the Russian government will include a radical overhaul of the armed forces. More importantly, the Russian government will remain committed to introducing sharp and deep cuts in its strategic weapons, as well as drawing up a new military doctrine. This seems a packed and ambitious agenda over the coming months. But without reductions in the defence budget, coupled with reductions in the production of weaponry, Russia's economic reforms could be jeopardised. Money for butter, not guns, is one of the Russian government's priorities. Revamping the armed forces is easier said than done. First, there is the question of how to cope with the 12m people who are employed directly, or indirectly with the defence industry. The Russian government is only now coming to terms with this enormous task which will entail retraining, and accepting large unemployment. In the meantime, Russia is trying to convert part of the military industrial complex into civilian projects. For instance, in some of the military factories in the Urals, managers, admittedly with a sense of regret, and shame, about the way the Soviet Union as a super power has collapsed, have stopped manufacturing tanks. At a giant tank factory at Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, Mr Oleg Guz, a floor manager, explained how the plant is now switching production to earth-remover tractors, and equipment for hospitals. However, besides airing nostalgia for the old days of regular orders for tanks from the Soviet ministry of defence, he conceded that his plant was still producing parts for tanks. Nor is the task of converting tanks into household goods welcomed by sections of the former communist nomenklatura in Chelyabinsk. They still believe in the 'potential enemy' (the west), seeing little reason for accepting such sharp cut-backs in arms productions. Indeed, they also still believe they should continue to export weapons as a means of earning hard currency. Conversion is not an easy process. Besides the social cost of rising unemployment - in one enterprise in Chelyabinsk alone, a work force of 60,000 will be reduced by at least 5,000 - it is costly. Mr Andrei Nechaev, Russia's economics minister says the government would provide Rb40bn in soft credits to cover social costs. 'To stop military production, you need money to stop it,' he explained recently. Mr Nechaev reckons that the defence budget in 1992 will account for about 6 per cent of GDP. If military conversion will be a costly, and time-consuming process, so too, will be the attempts to pare down the Russian army. Mr Andrei Kokosin, one of Russia's two deputy defence ministers - Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, is commander-in-chief of the armed forces - says the army will eventually total between 1.2m and 1.5m people. 'It will be leaner, more efficient, and more professional,' he says. But he, and other defence experts in Moscow are quick to add that provisions have to be made for those who will be retired, or retrained. The last thing Russia wants is a disgruntled, redundant officer class, which is partly at the root of the Yugoslav crisis. Because of these concerns, Russia is in no hurry to withdraw its remaining troops from the Baltic states, eastern Germany, or the central Asian republics. Besides the fact that Russian troops continue to play an important role in guarding the frontiers which borders with Turkey and other countries in the south of the former Soviet Union, there is a widespread consensus that if these troops were withdrawn, they would have no homes to go to. This is one of the reasons why troops from the Baltic republics have not yet been withdrawn. 'It is not yet clear when and how we will withdraw these troops. It will be carried out on a case by case basis. But withdrawing troops from the border with Turkey - which is a Nato country, will be subject to negotiations with Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and with NATO as well,' says Mr Kokosin. Parallel to the question of troops withdrawals, and reductions of Russia's armed forces, is the question about formulating a military doctrine. Since the cold war has ended, Russia must now ask itself what role the army should play and what defence strategy it should adopt. Mr Kokosin says Russia 'will have the foundations of a doctrine pretty soon which should be ready in detail by the end of the year.' He envisages the doctrine to include the following elements: A Russian army would consist of a growing proportion of professionals. There will be a shift away from big formations, to corps and brigade structures, with a much smaller number of tanks - a long-standing tradition of the Soviet army. 'We will be moving towards a west-European structure,' said Mr Kokosin. The emphasis will also be placed on rapid deployment forces - and rapid reaction forces; The 'shock armies' which had been stationed in eastern Europe - the equivalent of the US's green berets - will act in the rear of the enemy in case of war, and will be integrated into the rapid reaction forces. The doctrine will not be based on the existence of a potential enemy or adversary. The role of the armed forces 'will be like an insurance for some unexpected events - for deterrence of any kind of aggression. Also, there will be more emphasis on international peace- keeping exercises,' says Mr Kokosin. The Russian military establishment believe that low intensity conflicts will be the main challenge in future. The ethnic conflicts in Moldavia, Tadjikistan, Azerbaijan and Armenia, and Georgia confirm this assumption. It will be impossible to protect every kilometre of the border (that is, the entire former Soviet Union) with troops and other military formations - 'but we should control territory, in some cases, with our allies (of the former Soviet Union),' Mr Kokosin explains. 'We will have special arrangements with the former republics of the Soviet Union, and probably we should have some basic framework of security and co-operation. Russia is already drawing up a set of bi-lateral or tri-lateral agreements with regard to bases, stockpiles of ammunition, and ways in which to bring forces into action,' he adds. In the case of a conflict, if the Russian army was not able to deter, the role of the armed forces would be to act quickly and decisively to restore the peace on the terms favourable for those who were attacked. In some cases, units of the Russian army could be stationed on some of the territories of the former Soviet Union - 'there will be national armies in these newly formed states. But in some cases, there will be special agreements between the Russian armed forces and the national armed forces - co-operation on training of officers, providing them, not just with equipment but with spare parts, and technical assistance,' explained Mr Kokosin. Air defence will also be the subject of bi-lateral negotiations between Russia and the republics. At the moment, air defence is under the control of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russian defence experts say it is impossible for the Baltic republics to have any kind of serious air defence system of its own. 'I would prefer to have a special agreement with CIS forces and Russia Federation and the Baltic republics, whereby we could keep our radar in Riga, for example, which is very important for air defence. We should probably have a joint air defence system, but under special agreements,' explains Mr Kokosin. So far, so good. But the road to a military doctrine will not be smooth. There are many problems facing the more liberal sections of the Russian defence establishment. Relations with neighbouring Ukraine, in particular, the future of the Crimea, and who should control the Black Sea Fleet, have to be sorted out. More nationalist-minded politicians, especially those grouped around the Russian Congress of People's Deputies, resent any concessions Russia might make with Japan over the future status of the Kuril islands. And negotiations with the Ukraine over ratifying the START treaty, which entails deep cuts in the former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal (see report, left: Moscow's concern) have to be resolved. In the months ahead, Mr Kokosin and his colleagues can expect few days rest.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Surge in US business optimism may aid Bush WHITE HOUSE hopes that economic recovery will arrive in time to improve President George Bush's election prospects will be boosted today by a survey suggesting that US chief executives are more confident about the economic outlook than at any time since 1984. The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, says its index of confidence jumped eight points to 70 in the past three months. It says the 'overwhelming majority' of business leaders expects the economy to improve in the next six months. The quarterly index rose seven points in the first quarter of this year and is now more than double the low point reached in the final quarter of 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Confidence is now well above the highest levels registered last year when the economy began a faltering recovery. The improvement in boardroom sentiment is running ahead of consumer confidence, which is up modestly but still far below levels normal during a recovery. The discrepancy may reflect extensive restructuring in many sectors, which is improving profitability but undermining job security for white collar as well as blue collar workers. The board's index is based on the assessment by chief executives of current economic conditions compared with those six months ago, their expectations for the economy six months ahead, and predictions for their own industries. The most recent survey notes a sharp improvement in business leaders' assessments of current conditions. Nearly 80 per cent said the economy had improved in the past six months; only 30 per cent expressed such optimism in the previous survey. Chief executives are also more optimistic about the outlook for their own industries; 65 per cent reported an improvement, against fewer than 40 per cent in the first quarter. The 'overwhelming majority' of chief executives are optimistic, said Mr Jason Bram, an economist at the board. Some 85 per cent of those polled forecast economic improvement in the next six months. Three out of four business leaders predicted an increase in their companies' profits over the next year, with only 6 per cent expecting a fall. Executives cited growth of demand as the main source of higher profits. Only 12 per cent said they expected to generate profits by raising prices, indicating that inflationary pressures may remain subdued during the recovery.</p>

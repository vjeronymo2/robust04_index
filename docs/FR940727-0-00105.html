McDonald, Fort Smith Medical Treatment Facility. Pursuant to 32 CFR &sect;&sect;516.33&hyph;516.49, you may depose him subject to the following conditions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> He may testify as to his treatment of his patient, Sergeant Rock, as to related laboratory tests he may have conducted, or other actions he took in the regular course of his duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> He must limit his testimony to factual matters such as his observations of the patient or other operative facts, the treatment prescribed or corrective action taken, course of recovery or steps required for treatment of injuries suffered, or contemplated future treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> His testimony may not extend to hypothetical questions or to a prognosis. He may not testify as an ``expert.'' This limitation is based on Department of Defense and Army policy prohibiting present or former military personnel and Army civilian employees from providing opinion or expert testimony concerning official information, subjects, or activities in private litigation. See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  32 CFR &sect;&sect;97.6(e), 516.42.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The witnesses may not provide official information that is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from public disclosure. To protect the Army's interests, CPT Taylor or another Army attorney will be present during the depositions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To overcome restrictions imposed by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect;552a, Dr. McDonald may not discuss matters derived from the patient's medical records absent the patient's written consent or a court order signed by a judge. A subpoena issued by someone other than a judge or magistrate is insufficient.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See Doe  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> DiGenova, 779 F.2d 74 (D.C.

Supp. 798 (N.D. Ga. 1978).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decision whether to testify in private litigation is within the discretion of the witness, subject to the approval of his supervisors to be absent during the period involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, because this is private litigation, the witnesses' participation must be at no expense to the United States.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 32 CFR &sect;516.48.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If you have any questions, please call me or CPT Taylor at 919&hyph;882&hyph;4500.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;&blank;Sincerely,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert V.

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Henderson/Touche On an optimistic reading of the cycle, Henderson Administration could hardly have chosen a better time to exchange its cash for earnings geared to the equity market. The All-Share Index has risen by 7 per cent since its acquisition of Touche Remnant was first mooted in mid-October. The returns on cash, meanwhile, are not what they were. Strange, then, that Henderson's shares have notably underperformed following the initial euphoria over the deal. Yesterday's 7 per cent rise simply retraces some of that lost ground. True, the sudden departure of Mr David Backhouse last month was an unwelcome distraction, but Henderson has yet to convince that it is spending wisely. The Pounds 42.5m purchase price looks sensible enough, although Societe Generale doubtless thought as much when it paid Pounds 50m in 1989. Stable earnings from investment trusts are a neat fit with Henderson's strength in pension fund management, yet Touche will barely break even this year on Pounds 2bn funds under management. Henderson shareholders might feel they were more secure with the cash pile. The success of the deal turns on Henderson's ability to take out costs without prompting the best of its newly acquired talent to walk out the door. Handing over Touche's lease to its former parent is an encouraging start. Equally there should be savings from combining back office and administration. But it remains to be seen whether the two sides can avoid falling out during the subsequent pruning of manpower. With the shares on an 8 per cent yield - even after yesterday's rally - the market is clearly not taking much on trust.</p>

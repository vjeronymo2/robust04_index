			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House committee that  investigated the Iran-Contra scandal in 1987, said that he will formally ask  Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence, to examine whether the White House withheld key  documents from the congressional inquiry into the scandal. The Senate  Intelligence Committee already has been asked to open a similar inquiry by  Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Sens. Daniel K. Inouye  (D-Hawaii) and Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), chairman and vice chairman of the  Senate Iran-Contra panel. Documents that had not been given to the  congressional inquiry have been introduced at the trial of former Lt. Col.  Oliver L. North, raising questions about how complete White House cooperation  with the committees had been.  </P></p>

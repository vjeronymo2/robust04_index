			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Ford to stop production for six days at Halewood plant FORD, the leading UK vehicle maker, is to stop production for six days in September and early October at its Halewood car assembly plant in Merseyside. Its announcement came as Aston Martin, the specialist UK luxury sports carmaker in which Ford holds a 75 per cent stake, revealed it was cutting its workforce by about 16 per cent with the loss of 64 jobs. Ford is being forced to reduce output in response to disappointing sales in the UK and weakening demand from export markets. The move follows Ford's announcement earlier this week that production would be reduced at its car assembly plant in Dagenham, Essex, and at the Transit van plant at Southampton. The company this week warned there was no sign of any improvement in UK new car demand and said it saw 'no indication of any real recovery before mid-1993'. With new car registrations so far in August virtually unchanged from last year's depressed level, some carmakers are being forced to cut production to reduce stock levels. Halewood is already in the middle of a two-week period of single-shift working in response to weak demand, but Ford yesterday said assembly would be stopped completely for the week beginning September 21. In addition no cars will be produced on Friday, October 2. The latest measures at Halewood will cut output of about 5,500 Escort/Orion cars and vans in addition to the reduction of 5,000 Fiestas at Dagenham and 1,245 Transit vans at Southampton next week. Aston Martin is to cut the workforce at its Newport Pagnell plant from 388 to 324. Worldwide sales totalled 121 last year compared with an average of 185 a year during the previous 10 years. It has now cut its workforce by 39 per cent during the recession. Large vehicle fleet operators warned that new vehicle sales would continue to decline and jobs would be at risk unless the government introduced measures to stimulate demand. The British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association said there was no prospect of demand for new vehicles increasing this year or well into 1993 because of 'complete lack of confidence in the economy in the corporate sector'.

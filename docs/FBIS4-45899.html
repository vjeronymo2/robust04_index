			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Louise Fleischer and Bent Winther: "Legal </F> Experts Warn Against HIV Law"]    [Excerpt] Folketing politicians are upset over two verdicts  issued yesterday, according to which an HIV-infected person  cannot be convicted for having unsafe sex.    The Supreme Court's acquittal of a 36-year-old Haitian  caused  particular indignation. After being convicted by a city court  and the Eastern High Court for having unprotected sex with 23  women, the 36-year-old man was surprisingly acquitted yesterday.  Shortly after the Supreme Court's decision, an HIV-infected  female drug addict was acquitted in a similar case before the  Western High Court in Arhus.    The Conservative spokesman on legal affairs, Helge Adam  Moller, compared these cases to attempted murder and demanded an  immediate change in the criminal code. The chairmen of the two  coalition parties CD [Center Democrats] and the Christian  People's Party made similar demands. Yesterday, Justice Minister  Erling Olsen (Social Democrat) issued a brief news release  stating that the verdicts "could bring about a change in the  law," so that HIV-infected persons who fail to protect their  partners could be punished.    But prominent experts on the criminal code with whom  BERLINGSKE TIDENDE has spoken warn emphatically against changing  the law. Professor of criminal law Gorm Toftegaard Nielsen,  University of Aarhus, believes this could give women a false  sense of security. [passage omitted]</p>

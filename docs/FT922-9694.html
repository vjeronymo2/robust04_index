			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Mortgage lenders to follow lead: Immediate response to base rate cut IoD welcomes 'stimulus' Retail confidence encouraged HALIFAX, the largest UK building society, cut its standard mortgage interest rate by 0.3 percentage points to 10.65 per cent within an hour of the base rate cut being announced. Mr Jim Birrell, Halifax chief executive, described the latest base rate cut as good news for home buyers. The reduced rate applies immediately to new borrowers but the society declined to say yesterday when the 0.3 point cut would be applied to existing mortgage customers. The reduction means a saving of Pounds 10.63 a month on a Pounds 50,000 endowment mortgage and Pounds 8.91 on a repayment mortgage of the same size. Halifax's move took the rest of the mortgage industry by surprise. Mr John Bayliss, managing director of Abbey National, the second-largest UK mortgage lender, said later in the day that Abbey National would also reduce its rates by 0.3 of a point. Leeds Permanent, the fifth-largest society, said it would lower its rates later this week. The other societies have little option but to follow Halifax and Abbey National, but they will do so with serious misgivings about the effect on their balance sheets. Although most mortgage lenders agree that some sort of stimulus is needed to encourage the housing market to revive, many building societies are under strong market pressure on both the lending and the savings sides. In January, following Abbey National's lead, Halifax and the other building societies cut their rates to borrowers to about 10.95 per cent, less than 0.5 of a point above the base rate. Some societies have said privately that they would like to put up mortgage rates to be able to pay savers more. Halifax's move means that this will not now be possible. The flow of retail savings into building societies accounts been disappointing for several months, partly because of competition from National Savings. By cutting their rates to mortgage customers now, building societies will also have to reduce their rates to savers. Mr Dick Spellman, general manager for marketing at Halifax, said yesterday that it was too early to say how the savings market would settle down. He said Halifax and other societies were experiencing a reduced inflow of savings because they were having to compete against 'overpriced' one-year and two-year offers from National Savings. Mr John Simson, chairman of Connell, the estate agency chain owned by Scottish Widows, said he was uncertain how much difference the latest interest rate cut would make to the housing market. He said there had been no sign of a recovery in April. The clearing banks yesterday said that they had their mortgage rates under review, but the centralised lenders are likely to have more difficulty in making a reduction. Mortgage lending was very subdued in the first quarter of the year, growing by only 1.5 per cent over the previous, the Council for Mortgage Lenders said yesterday. New lending during the quarter was Pounds 4.6bn, down from Pounds 5.4bn during the final quarter of 1991.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    MORTGAGE PAYMENT CHANGES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly payments on a 25 year mortgage                    Endowment Loan size      Previous rate       New rate      Difference pounds      percent  pounds     percent  pounds    pounds 30,000       10.95   205.33      10.65   199.70     5.63 50,000       10.95   387.83      10.65   377.20    10.63 APEX 80,000       10.50   634.38      10.20   616.25    18.13 100,000      10.30   793.96      10.00   770.84    23.12 150,000      10.30  1223.13      10.00  1187.50    35.63 200,000      10.30  1652.30      10.00  1604.17    48.13  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Repayment 30,000       10.95   238.47      10.65   233.96     4.51 50,000       10.95   424.52      10.65   415.61     8.91 APEX 80,000       10.50   697.24      10.20   682.03    15.21 100,000      10.30   874.95      10.00   855.57    19.38 150,000      10.30  1344.62      10.00  1314.60    30.02 200,000      10.30  1814.28      10.00  1773.63    40.65  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Halifax Building Society based on a 0.3% cut in rates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

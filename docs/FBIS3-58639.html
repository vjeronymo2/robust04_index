Inacker report: "Will 20,000 Fewer Conscripts </F> Be Called Up Than Originally Planned"]    [Text] Bonn -- The Bundeswehr must expect further drastic  cuts totaling at least 1 to 1.2 billion German marks [DM] in the  current fiscal year. Thus, it becomes questionable whether its  serviceability can be maintained to the originally planned  degree.    According to WELT AM SONNTAG, the new cutbacks, higher than  the Bundeswehr leadership expected, are part of a necessary  austerity package that the government and the coalition want to  use to cover a budget deficit of DM5 billion. On Monday [17  January], Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic  Union) and other ministers affected by the austerity measures  are to meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The Bundestag group  leaderships will discuss the required cutbacks on Tuesday, and  the Budget Committee on Wednesday.    The leadership of the Defense Ministry and the defense  politicians of the government coalition intend to absorb the  latest cuts largely within the existing structures and with a  planned Bundeswehr strength of 370,000 men, and not carry out  fundamental changes concerning the Bundeswehr planning over the  next few years.    Through cutbacks in training, exercises, and Armed Forces  maintenance, and by "waiting for the election year to pass,"  further reductions in investments and modernization are to be  forestalled, an officer pointed out. According to the latest  calculations, the share of investments in the defense budget  will drop to 21.9 percent in 1994 (in 1989, before the collapse  of the socialist camp, it was 32.4 percent).    Defense Ministry officials hope that these are the last  cuts,  and that the Bundeswehr will have a budget of DM47.5 billion at  its disposal from 1995, as agreed between Chancellor Helmut  Kohl, Finance Minister Theo Waigel, and Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe in June 1993. Only if these promises are kept are the  additional cutbacks acceptable, officials pointed out.    The following measures are expected:    -- 50 percent reduction of the funds for training and  exercises. Thus, the costs for railway transports and the  transfer of an army division will be lowered from the planned  DM5 million to 2.5 million. In the main armed forces divisions,  exercises at the unit level (battalion, brigade, division) will  be drastically reduced. For the first time, the cuts also affect  exercises of the crisis reaction brigades.    -- Expense allowances of soldiers for stays at training  areas  ("bush money") will partly be reduced by 20 percent. For some  divisions, this will mean DM1.5 million instead of DM2.5 million.    -- Duty training of reservists will be reduced.    -- Funds for material maintenance -- that is repair or  replacement of wornout equipment -- will be reduced by 15  percent.    -- The annual flying hours of air force pilots will be  reduced from 180 (as demanded by NATO) to 150.    -- Construction and infrastructure projects will be reduced.  Thus, the planned transfer of the officer's college from Hanover  to Dresden might be postponed.    -- To "save money quickly," about 10,000 to 20,000 fewer  conscripts are to be called up throughout 1994. This measure  will be particularly effective in the second half of the year  and means that over 100 companies will not be complete or will  have to remain idle for three months. However, this entails  problems concerning the recruitment of young officers.    Within the Armed Forces, the expected cuts have been  described as "disastrous for the motivation" of the young  soldiers and conscripts in particular. On this basis, it will  no longer be possible to achieve training goals (above all,  "combined arms combat") in many areas.    For Paul Breuer, the defense spokesman of the Bundestag  group  of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, this  "additional defense budget contribution to balancing the federal  budget is unavoidable." However, the austerity measures do not  require a new Bundeswehr structure. "Amid great difficulties,  it might be possible to save DM1 billion in 1994 that might  relieve the budget considerably."    Breuer cited "quicker decisions on applications for early  retirement among civilian personnel" as possible fields where  money can be saved. He mentioned a "possible amount of DM250  million." Moreover, rationalization measures in the spheres of  supply, material maintenance, and operation should be moved  forward. Also, money will be released as a result of the end of  the Somalia mission on 31 March.    According to the planning guideline issued by Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe in fall last year, the Bundeswehr is  again, to a greater extent, to be considered an entity. In  fact, the division into rapid reaction and main defense armed  forces remains, but the development of a two-class army should  be prevented.    After experts favored lighter forces transportable by air,  mechanized armored units are to be given priority again because  of UN experiences in Bosnia and Somalia and the increased army  awareness of its task to defend the country. There are plans to  upgrade the combat effectiveness of 225 "Leopard II" and of  another 600 armored personnel carriers of the army to "Marder  A3." On Ruehe's orders, it is to be determined whether  approximately 160 multipurpose support helicopters (UHU) should  be procured instead of the planned 75. There are also plans to  buy the jeep-like light reconnaissance vehicle "Zobel" for  crisis reaction and UN tasks.    The personal equipment of the soldiers is also to be  improved. The new combat uniforms, the new helmets, and the  fragmentation protection vests are to be supplied more quickly.  The obsolete G-3 rifle is to be replaced with a more modern and  lighter weapon with a smaller caliber (5.56 mm).    For the Navy, eight new frigates and four U-212 submarines  are still planned -- in the interest of the German weapons  industry.</p>

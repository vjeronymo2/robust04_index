			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Ramco rises to Pounds 1.1m and seals Soviet joint venture RAMCO OIL Services, which provides tubes to the North Sea oil industry, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m for 1990, compared with Pounds 942,000 previously. The heavy burden of maintenance currently underway in the North Sea, which requires the shutdown of installations, kept turnover static at Pounds 4.78m, but Ramco is paying an annual dividend of 2p - its first for five years. Earnings rose 0.1p to 3.96p. Mr Stephen Remp, chairman, said he was looking for a boost to turnover next year when extensive North Sea maintenance work would be complete. At the beginning of this year, Ramco set up a joint-venture operation to import oil pumps from the Soviet Union in a bid to capture 10 per cent of the Dollars 500m (Pounds 292m) western market for electric submersible pumps. Alnas, the Soviet company which makes the pumps, has taken a 50 per cent stake in the Aberdeen-based venture to market the pumps in the west and two Soviet directors sit on its board. The first shipment of pumps is due to arrive in June. In an effort to break into the market, Mr Remp said the company would try to get round any reluctance it encounters among western firms by offering generous guarantees to replace any pump which fails in its first year of operation. Alnas started making the electric pumps 12 years ago in a bid to reduce the dependence of the Soviet oil industry on imported equipment. Its manufacturing facilities were set up using western technology to make a Soviet-designed pump. Mr Remp said the high quality of the pumps meant that they could last up to 800 days while western pumps will last 200-600 days. Nevertheless, he said he thought the venture would have to offer some price advantages to make them attractive to western buyers. Flexible arrangements would also be offered on hire or hire-purchase and giving companies the chance to have the pumps on a trial basis. Alnas is carrying the cost of holding stock by supplying pumps and taking the payment when they are sold.</p>

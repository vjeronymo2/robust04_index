			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Generators make coal offers ELECTRICITY generators have made their opening offers in negotiations with British Coal for long-term supply contracts based on world prices. According to Coal UK, an industry newsletter, National Power and PowerGen have made offers well below British Coal's present price of Pounds 1.85 a gigajoule. National Power, the larger of the two, is believed to have offered Pounds 1.50, and PowerGen Pounds 1.10. PowerGen's lower price reflects its lesser dependence on supplies from British Coal. The contracts will run for five years from next April. The present contracts are based on artificially high prices intended to help the coal industry. Although the central element of the negotiations is over the amount of coal to be taken by the generators, the price will have a strong bearing on the amounts, as well as on British Coal's ability to compete with new gas-fired generating capacity. The generators are determined to bring UK coal prices down closer to world levels, but British Coal needs prices that will make it a viable business after privatisation, due later this year. National Power yesterday declined to comment on details of the negotiations. It said the talks were aimed at satisfying the distribution companies' requirements for realistically priced power and British Coal's interest in suitable prices, quantities and contract lengths. Juliet Sychrava writes: Large industrial consumers in the UK faced the highest electricity price increases for seven years in the 12 months to April, according to a survey of 1,200 companies by National Utility Services. Large electricity consumers pay 4.28p a unit, the survey found, compared with 3.94p last year. That is cheaper than Italy, Germany, Belgium, and Eire, but more expensive than the US, France, Netherlands, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Australia and Canada. The survey warned that prices might rise further if more competition in electricity generation did not emerge and it supports large consumers' claims that they have not benefited from electricity privatisation. Those consumers, represented by the Major Energy Users Council, have been lobbying the government to intervene in the new electricity market created at privatisation. The users council says the market gives too much power to National Power and PowerGen to push prices up.</p>

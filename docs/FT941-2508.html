			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Japan to curb rise in car exports to EU Japan has agreed to restrict the rise in car exports to the European Union to 0.4 per cent this year, reducing Japanese car industry hopes for an export-led recovery. The deal, agreed on Saturday between trade officials from the European Commission and Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, means Japan's EU market share is set, in theory, to fall fractionally. Japan and the EU agreed three years ago to set annual Union-wide import quotas, to be reassessed every six months, to pave the way for an open European car market by the end of the decade. Japan's car industry accepted the small increase in exports without complaint, reflecting the fact that their overall EU sales would be little affected as a result of the build-up in European-based production. 'We will continue to hold back our exports and respect the spirit of the agreement, which was made under the premise that the EU car market will be liberalised in the year 2000,' said Mr Yutaka Kume, chairman of Nissan and the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association. The accord allows Japan to export 984,000 cars to the EU this year, 8.2 per cent of expected EU demand for 11.97m vehicles. Tokyo and Brussels differ over how much the European market will grow, but the accord is based on an expected 2 per cent increase in demand, a weak recovery from last year's nearly 16 per cent decline in the European car market. Last year, Japanese car exports to the Union fell by 18.5 per cent to 980,000 units, and it achieved an 8.3 per cent share of a total market of 11.74m cars. However, a senior Commission negotiator said the EU expected Japan to ask for a change in its export ceiling if the market were to show a 'substantial deviation' from forecasts.</p>

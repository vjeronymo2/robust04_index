			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Helen Vogt report: "Fisheries Agreement in Sight in </F> Brussels"; as released by the TIETOTEHDAS Database]    [Text] Brussels -- Norway and the EU [European Union] have  finally taken the bull by the horns and begun to discuss fish  quotas. This morning both the Norwegian negotiators and EU  diplomats were taking an optimistic view of the possibility of  reaching an agreement.    Trade Minister Grete Knudsen and Fisheries Minister Jan  Henry  T. Olsen had an hour-long meeting with EU Commissioner President  Jacques Delors and Greek European Affairs Minister Theodhoros  Pangalos. At the meeting Norway put forward new proposals for  how the interests of Spain and Portugal can be satisfied in the  negotiations. Both countries have demanded fish quotas from  Norway. The outcome of the meeting was that representatives of  the Commission and Norwegian officials were set to work to draft  proposals for fisheries which will be put before the EU foreign  ministers.  <H5>  Perhaps a Fish? </H5>   "The position of the Norwegian side is founded on a clear  principle. The EU is very well aware of this. But we are not  opposed to lending a hand so that the interests of Spain,  Portugal, and Ireland can be taken into account. What is clear  is that there cannot be a solution for Norway alone," a  Norwegian negotiator said. Norway understands that Spain and  Portugal feel themselves to have been badly treated in their own  accession agreements in the fisheries sector, but it has been an  important point for the Norwegians to get the EU to understand  that Norway cannot atone for the EU's old sins in this field.  The Norwegian negotiators have also made it very clear that  they will not allow themselves to be pressured into giving  anything extra in the fisheries negotiations in order to make it  easier for the EU countries to get Spain to agree to a solution  to the internal wrangle about voting rules in the Council of  Ministers. "If such pressure is put on Norway, we have made it  clear that we have nothing more to talk about," a Norwegian  source said.  <H5>  Agriculture Agreed </H5>   According to NORSK TELEGRAMBYRA'S information, the  agricultural agreement between Norway and the EU is complete and  will be made public as soon as it has been formally approved by  the EU Council of Ministers. In the last few days of  negotiations, the Norwegians believe that they have succeeded in  achieving a better deal for the food industry than Finland  achieved last week. In concrete terms, measures will be adopted  to prevent the market from disappearing while the food  processing industry restructures in order to adapt itself to the  new pricing situation. The measures will only apply to a  limited number of sensitive products and will only apply for a  transitional period.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Coup idea embarrasses Japanese THE Japanese government was highly embarrassed yesterday when a military officer suggested that a coup d'etat would clean up the political system. Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, described the coup idea as 'extremely inappropriate', and the Defence Agency said the major who made the suggestion in a weekly magazine would be disciplined. Ordinary Japanese did not take the statement as a serious threat, but the article reminded many of a series of coup attempts and assassinations during the 1930s, when young officers demanded that the government intensify the military campaign in Asia. The magazine commentary, by Major Shinsaku Yanai, a lecturer in strategy and military history at Japan's Defence Academy, has caused particular embarrassment for the military, as it coincided with the controversial dispatch of Japanese troops on peace-keeping activities in Cambodia. Maj Yanai's comments were inspired by the controversy over Mr Shin Kanemaru, who resigned from parliament on Wednesday, after public protests over his violation of a political donations law and alleged links to gangster groups. 'History has shown that a military solution is the only way left when democracy does not work and justice is not done,' Maj Yanai wrote in an article penned before Mr Kanemaru resigned. 'It's now impossible to right the wrongs legally through elections, the basis of a democracy. What paths can we take to get rid of this? Only a coup d'etat or a revolution.' Meanwhile, the struggle for control of the faction previously run by Mr Kanemaru may be settled, for the moment, at a meeting today. About seven members of the faction are possible candidates for the title of chairman, but even if a chairman is quickly selected, the dispute could continue for several months. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, showed his frustration at the attention paid to Mr Kanemaru's departure, which dominated the Japanese media yesterday. The prime minister insisted: 'I am the prime minister and leader of the government'. Mr Miyazawa's future is likely to depend on the outcome of the battle within Mr Kanemaru's old faction, the largest in the LDP, as the premier's faction is not large enough for him to be certain his two-year term in office will be completed. Attention has also turned to Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister, on whose behalf Mr Kanemaru is said to have sought the help of gangsters to silence embarrassing protests by extreme right-wing groups. Opposition parties yesterday demanded Mr Takeshita appear before parliament to answer questions on the episode, while Mr Hiroshi Saito, president of Nippon Steel, Japan's biggest steel maker, made an unusual call for the former prime minister to clarify his role. Business leaders have been more critical of the government in recent weeks; there are signs that the close links between the LDP and corporate Japan are fraying.</p>

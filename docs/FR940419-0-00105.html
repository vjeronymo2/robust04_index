			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, contributions in HOME-eligible projects will be counted in the same manner as match contributions in HOME-assisted projects. A contribution will be counted only to the extent it is a permanent contribution and repayments are placed in the HOME local account. Once deposited in the HOME account the funds must be used for HOME-eligible projects; funds from repayments do not have to be matched but can not count as match. The contribution itself may be for any eligible forms of match except those in &sect;92.220(a) (2) and (4), which by statute must be made for affordable housing assisted with HOME funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 92.220(a)(1) is expanded to clarify that repayments of matching contributions in HOME-assisted projects, or in affordable housing projects that are not HOME-assisted in accordance with &sect;92.219(b), must be made to the local HOME account to earn match credit for the full loan amount. In both cases, HOME-assisted and non-HOME-assisted affordable housing projects, the contribution must be contributed permanently to the project in order to qualify as match.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 92.220(a)(2) is revised and expanded to permit as an eligible form of match contribution all taxes, fees, and other charges that are imposed or charged on projects and waived by a State or local government. Before this change, only such charges waived by a participating jurisdiction were eligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional guidance on the match eligibility of contributions of land is provided in this rule. The general rule that the value of land not acquired with federal resources is a permissible form of matching contribution is still applicable. The reason for excluding land acquired with federal resources is that the authorizing statute for the HOME Program permits cash contributions only from non-federal resources as an eligible form of match. The ineligibility of federal resources cannot be circumvented by purchasing land with federal resources (for example, with CDBG funds) and then contributing the land to a HOME project in order to obtain match credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the question has arisen of whether or not the difference between the fair market value and the purchase price of land acquired with federal resources and donated to affordable housing would be an eligible form of match. The Department recognizes that this difference in value could qualify as an eligible contribution, but also recognizes that there are inherent difficulties in distinguishing between when such a transaction would merely be a ``good buy'' and when it would constitute a true contribution for match purposes. To provide guidance on this question so that match credit may be recognized for this form of contribution, &sect;92.220(a)(3) is revised to state that the acquisition cost in such a transaction must be demonstrably below the appraised value and must be acknowledged by the seller as a donation to affordable housing at the time of acquisition. Property that is acquired with federal assistance must be acquired specifically for HOME-assisted housing or for affordable housing that will be counted as match pursuant to &sect;92.219(b)(2). If these conditions are met, the full value of the difference in price may be claimed for match credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments disagreed with the prohibition in &sect;92.220(a)(5)(iii) against permitting carryover of excess match related to bond proceeds to apply to subsequent years' 25 percent limitation. Upon reconsideration, the Department agrees that such a carryover is appropriate, and this interim rule permits it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;92.221, the provision that defines when bond proceeds are recognized as match, which appeared as paragraph (b)(6) in the proposed rule, is added as paragraph (a)(7). This is because in the period between the publication of the proposed rule and this interim rule, an interim rule was published on June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34130) that revised the structure of &sect;92.221. In addition, a new paragraph (c) is added to &sect;92.221 to clarify which entity receives match credit for a contribution. The general rule is that the PJ that makes the match investments in HOME-assisted or HOME-eligible projects is the entity that receives the match credit. If a non-PJ makes a contribution for affordable housing to a PJ, the PJ receives the match credit. By way of additional clarification, the interim rule also declares that a State that makes a contribution to a local participating jurisdiction to be used for affordable housing, whether or not HOME-assisted, may take the match credit for itself or may permit the local participating jurisdiction to recognize the match credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seven comments were received on the proposed revisions to &sect;92.222 on reduction of the matching contribution requirement. These comments were generally favorable, especially concerning the two year match reduction period provision at &sect;92.222(a)(4). A few comments suggested alternative criteria to use for local government participating jurisdictions, but these criteria are established by statute, and the interim rule merely repeats the statutory language. There were also suggestions to use other distress criteria, such as changes in non-agricultural employment or in State taxes collected, for State participating jurisdictions. However, for the reasons stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, this portion of the interim rule remains unchanged. The list of State participating jurisdictions that qualify for this match reduction is published as a Notice elsewhere in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

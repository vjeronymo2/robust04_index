			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Japan seeks help to stem yen rise THE JAPANESE government warned yesterday that the yen's rapid appreciation is jeopardising the country's economic recovery and sought international intervention to ensure that Japan will be able to contribute to world growth. Finance and trade ministers hinted at the need for co-ordinated intervention following a record close in Tokyo of Y107.38 to the dollar. They said the currency's fluctuations, blamed on 'speculators,' has undermined a recent spending package designed to stimulate the ailing economy. A flood of gloomy profit forecasts this week by Japanese manufacturers expecting to be hit hard by yen appreciation and a fall yesterday in employment figures have stirred fears in the government that the recovery expected in the autumn will not materialise. The government is particularly concerned because the immediate effect of the yen's appreciation will be to push the country's already embarrassing trade surplus even higher, while a continued slowing of the domestic economy would reduce demand for imports and encourage manufacturers to export. Mr Masakuni Murakami, the labour minister, said that the ratio of job offers to applicants fell to 0.84 in April, down from 0.88 in March and from 1.08 last June, and suggested that demand for new employees is still softening and will 'take some time' to recover. Working hours also slipped from an average of 44.4 a week in March to 41.3 in April, reflecting companies' attempts to cut costs by reducing overtime and encouraging employees to take extra holidays. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was unchanged at 2.3 per cent. The electronics sector and car manufacturing are under increasing pressure from the yen's appreciation. Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the finance minister, said that 'appropriate steps' should be taken to curb the yen's rise and hinted that Japan would like co-ordinated intervention by the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations, which appears unlikely.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by New York correspondent Tzadoq Yehezqeli] </F>   [Text] Kahana Hay activists have threatened attacks along  the lines of the Hebron massacre if the Israeli Government does  not revoke its decision to outlaw their organization.    In a statement delivered over the telephone to the local  YEDI'OT AHARONOT offices on behalf of the organization, which is  now calling itself "The Unified Command of the Global Uprising,"  the callers mentioned the existence of an underground group for  the first time.    The message said that if the Rabin government does not  accept  their ultimatum by Lag B'Omer (29 April), the "`Unit of the God  of Vengeance,' the military arm of the unified Jewish uprising,  will follow the example set by the hero and martyr Barukh  Goldstein." The message also stated that the organization would  launch violent activities even earlier "if Rabin increases his  persecution of us or if the Jewish settlers are evacuated from  Hebron." The group also demanded the immediate release of  Binyamin Ze'ev Kahana, the leader of Kahana Hay.    The sources who delivered the message clarified that the  attacks would be carried out only against Arabs, not Jews. The  message also stated that if the ultimatum is rejected, the Arabs  "will have no respite in this country and the ground will burn  under their feet day and night, in the streets, their homes, and  the mosques."    According to the callers, supporters of the movement have  flown to Israel from Europe over the past few days and are now  operating clandestine cells.</p>

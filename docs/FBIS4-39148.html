			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 4 Jun--The conflict between Ukraine and its  autonomy, the Republic of Crimea, evokes serious disquiet in the  world community. This explains why Max van der Stoel, CSCE high  commissioner for minorities, is visiting Ukraine for the third  time in a month and a half. After returning from Crimea, he  gave a news conference that was devoted to the results of his  visit to Ukraine.    Max van der Stoel acquainted the Ukrainian and foreign  journalists with the program of his visit. Most important were  meetings with senior officials of Ukraine and Crimea. The CSCE  high commissioner had an hour long conversation with Ukraine's  president and twice met Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy.  In Kiev, he had talks with Oleksandr Yemets [minister for  nationalities and migration], Anatoliy Zlenko [minister for  foreign affairs], and Roman Shpek [minister of the economy]. In  Crimea, van der Stoel met President Yuriy Meshkov, Deputy Prime  Minister Yevgeniy Saburov, and Crimean Supreme Council Chairman  Serhiy Tsekov.    The important guest's visit to Simferopol coincided with the  consultations on the situation in Crimea between the  parliamentary delegation of Ukraine, headed by Mr. Butkevych,  and the delegation of the Republic of Crimea. The main  conclusions drawn by the CSCE high commissioner for minorities  were that both sides had taken part in the talks. Max Van der  Stoel stressed, however, that, in addition to discussions at the  level of parliamentary delegations, talks at the level of the  governments of Ukraine and Crimea would not hurt. It is  important to the high commissioner that the governments of  Ukraine and Crimea confirm their wish to avoid incidents.    The aim of van der Stoel's mission was to find ways for the  CSCE to contribute to maintaining peace and stability in the  region. According to the high commissioner, his organization is  ready to extend a helping hand in resolving the problems that  have arisen between Ukraine and its autonomy. Van der Stoel  refused to comment on exactly what sort of help this should be,  but noted that he would submit his conclusions to the  participants of the consultation of CSCE countries in Prague on  13 June. He believes the Crimean issue to be a domestic  conflict between Ukraine and Crimea. Regarding the influence of  Russia, which is a CSCE member, on the Crimean issue, it should  be guided in its actions, like all countries, by the main  principle of the inviolability of borders and respect for the  territorial integrity of states.    At the news conference, van der Stoel reported to the press  the decision by the CSCE standing committee of (?28) May. The  standing committee, a body representing 53 countries of the  world, expressed concern at the development of events in the  Republic of Crimea because they run counter to the basic  principles of the CSCE.    The last question at the news conference concerned the  latest  "Ostankino" "sensation" regarding the presence of 120 Ukrainian  paratroopers in Belbek. "I did not inspect the territory of  Crimea, van der Stoel said, but everything I saw refutes these  wild rumors. The situation in Crimea looks very calm."</p>

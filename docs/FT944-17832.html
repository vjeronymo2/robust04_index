			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Helicopter makers in a spin: The fierce international competition to win a large UK defence order The British army's plans for a new fleet of attack helicopters have generated the competition of the decade for the world's aerospace manufacturers. The Pounds 2bn order for 91 helicopters - to be decided next spring - is likely to be the largest helicopter purchase in the world for at least the next five years. As the UK Ministry of Defence last week took final bids for the order, it was shaping up as a fierce contest between some of the world's largest aerospace companies. The winning bid will be expected to offer a fixed price for the contract and assurances that much of the work will go to UK industry. Military planners in the US, and now in Britain, see attack helicopters as essential to the armed forces of the future, with tanks and helicopters becoming the main battle zone weapons. A new fleet of attack helicopters, now the British army's highest priority, will allow high mobility and flexibility of response from bases at the rear of battle zones to targets far behind enemy lines. Attack helicopters established their value in the Gulf war. McDonnell Douglas, the US aircraft manufacturer, proudly boasts that its Apache attack helicopter fired the first shots in the allied attack on Iraq, destroying radar installations to allow stealth fighters to fly unobserved to Baghdad. In futuristic scenarios, attack helicopters are seen as essential to protecting British tanks from well-equipped enemy armour. Lurking behind cover a mile or so from the main action, helicopters will be able to pick up advancing enemy tanks with their sensors, loose off a salvo of missiles, and dive for home before the enemy commanders know that they are being watched. In placing the contract for the UK fleet of helicopters, the MoD is looking for three characteristics in the winning bid. First, companies must offer an 'off-the-shelf' product which is already in service with armed forces elsewhere. This will avoid the time and expense of developing an attack helicopter specifically for the UK. Second, bidders must agree a fixed price for the contract, so that the risk of cost overruns is born by the contractor rather than the taxpayer. Third, potential suppliers will be expected to place as much of the work on the helicopters in the UK as possible. As well as proving the military worth and cost-effectiveness of their products, bidders have to outline what level of involvement UK industry will have in production. Four main competitors are attempting to win the contract. The favourite is the Apache, some 800 of which are already in service with the US army. With its proven service record and firepower, it is the helicopter favoured by the British army. A large helicopter, Apache can carry a heavy load of anti-tank missiles. It will be equipped with the new sophisticated Longbow radar, which is currently under development by US defence companies Martin Marietta and Westinghouse. Longbow allows the pilot to identify a target such as a tank from cover, lock a missile on to the target, and move away as soon as it is fired. The Apache bid is led by Westland, the only UK helicopter manufacturer. Westland would make the helicopter - and bear the risks of the fixed-price contract - under licence from McDonnell Douglas. Westland's chairman, Mr Alan Jones, says that more than half of the Pounds 2bn contract will be placed directly with British companies. The Apache team would also place a further Pounds 1bn of contracts on other aerospace projects as indirect 'offset' work with UK industry. The main European competitor is the Tiger, designed by the Franco-German Eurocopter group. Tiger is a lighter helicopter than the Apache and is still under development for the French and German armies. Its main armament is the Trigat anti-tank missile, developed by Britain, France and Germany. British Aerospace is the main UK participant in the Tiger bid. If the bid succeeds, BAe will get 20 per cent of construction work for all the 500 Tigers expected to be sold in Europe. BAe claims that this, combined with the value of its contribution to the Trigat missile, would bring high-technology work for British companies worth more than the full value of the attack helicopter fleet. The company also says that the Tiger's new design means that it will have much lower running costs than its competitors, which are based on older technologies. The other large UK defence contractor, GEC, is also fielding a bid. Its candidate is Venom, an updated version of the Cobra, a veteran of the Vietnam war built by Bell, another US helicopter manufacturer. It, too, is a light helicopter, acknowledged by GEC as offering less in performance than the Apache. But Venom has cost on its side: a Venom helicopter may be only two-thirds the price of an Apache and, says GEC, it will be substantially cheaper to run. The wild card in the competition is the South African Rooivalk, made by Denel, a subsidiary of Atlas, the state-owned arms manufacturer. Rooivalk entered the competition late, and was not taken seriously at first. However, its brute strength means that it can carry heavy loads and has won admirers. The aerospace company Marshalls of Cambridge would act as prime contractor for the UK. Plenty of mud has been slung in the fight to win the UK contract. Opponents of the Apache say that it has proved expensive to maintain in the past and that the US government will not share details of the state-of-the-art Longbow radar with the UK. The Tiger is criticised for being too light for the job, as expensive to buy as the Apache and of unproven technology. The Venom airframe is said to be too old, while development work on a new cockpit leaves its real cost uncertain. Rooivalk, meanwhile, is also based on an ageing design and comes from a country which is going through enormous political change. The MoD will want to be certain that the order can be completed and maintainance continued over the life of the fleet. Despite their competing merits, the Apache remains the hot favourite. The large number in service with the US army and the heavy weapons load it can carry argue strongly in its favour. Politically, it may also be attractive. Giving the order to Westland, which is based in the south-west of England, might help Conservative MPs defend their seats against the advance of the Liberal Demo-crats. Even the Apache's main drawback, cost, may be reduced by the pressure of competitive bidding. Westland - like all the bidders - will have to provide the MoD with extensive guarantees capping the maintainance costs of the aircraft. There is, however, one obstacle that could trip up the Apache. The UK is currently holding another competition to replace the RAF's ageing fleet of Hercules transport aircraft. This involves a bitter battle between Lockheed, the US manufacturer of the latest generation of Hercules, and BAe, which is offering the Airbus-produced Future Large Aircraft. If the MoD buys the Lockheed Hercules as it originally wanted, there will be a huge outcry from the UK manufacturers about buying American rather than European equipment. To soften the blow, the MoD might be tempted to award the attack helicopter to the European Tiger. That would not please Westland, and would not be the outcome BAe was looking for either. 'My feeling,' said one executive involved in the competition, 'is that buying Hercules and Apache will be one American purchase too many for the MoD.'</p>

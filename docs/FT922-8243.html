			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Letter: The price to be paid for learning a language Sir, In reviewing the book, Languages in International Business (Management: 'Talking turkey on foreign language lessons', May 13), Christopher Price omits to mention one of the fundamental questions that confronts employees who learn languages for business. Whatever the employer's intentions, there is a definable cost in money terms to the employee. If an employer pays even part of the cost of language lessons then the employee will be taxed on that amount as a perk in the same way as he or she is taxed on the benefit of a company car. Even worse is the fact that someone paying top rate 40 per cent tax will be charged at 47 per cent of the cost of the lessons because even the tax on lessons is taxed. This matter was raised not only with the Inland Revenue but also at high level in the last Treasury team. The government's answer was that if such perks are not taxed then the government would have to give the same benefit to the ladies of the night in Bayswater. I admit to being surprised that the Inland Revenue cannot tell the difference between a large international bank in the City and a sole trader who does not import or export. By contrast, my subordinates in Frankfurt do receive very considerable personal fiscal benefits in respect of any training; this must surely be seen as a hidden subsidy to assist German foreign trade and therefore contrary to stated General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade policy. Is there any good reason why an employee should pay for a benefit to be enjoyed by his or her employer? David J Brown, 219 Priests Lane, Shenfield, Brentwood, Essex CM15 8LE</p>

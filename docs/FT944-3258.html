			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Observer: Going spare A small advertisement in last night's London Evening Standard seeks a flatmate to share 'spacious apartment. Corpse in spare room. Lunatic in loft. Torturers in bathroom'. Intrepid inquirers were asked to call a number where a recorded Scottish voice continues the macabre description, ending with a plug (useful for the torturer) for the film Shallow Grave. Sounds like one to miss.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Janez Jansa, president of the Social Democratic  Party of Slovenia, said in an open letter to Prime Minister  Drnovsek that he has received his letter concerning his  replacement as defense minister.    Janez Jansa rebukes Prime Minister Drnovsek as the  government  commission that was investigating the Smolnikar case did not  study all the necessary material. He also asks Janez Drnovsek  how the government has acted in other cases in which there has  been an overstepping of authority.    According to him, the prime minister proposed the  replacement  before the meeting of the parliamentary inquiry commission and  in the midst of a media lynching. Jansa believes that Drnovsek,  in this way, prevented the investigation into the background of  unlawful activities in which individuals and groups have engaged  for months.    The Presidency of the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia  will discuss this issue tomorrow.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Norman Chandler] </F>   [Text] The South African Defence Force [SADF] says the  integration of various military forces in the country into a  national defence force is progressing well. It has denied  outright that it is "dragging its feet" over the matter, as  alleged by Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC  military wing] (MK) commander Joe Modise in Bloemfontein at the  weekend.    The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) comes into  being next Wednesday as a successor to the SADF. It will  comprise MK, members of the Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei and  Transkei defence forces and, later, APLA [Azanian People's  Liberation Army] forces.    General Georg Meiring, Chief of the SADF, told THE STAR  yesterday that Modise's allegation was not true. The SADF had  presented a comprehensive proposal regarding integration in  October but this had been rejected. Subsequently it was decided  to form a multiparty team to plan and facilitate integration and  this had only recently got off the ground.    "This team went through a planning process aimed at  accommodating people in the assembly areas, the end result being  the same plan that w?s originally rejeited," Meiring added.    He said he was confident that the integration process was  progressing well. "Planning is a joint effort and cannot be  laid only at the defence force's door. We are adamant that  integration should be a success."    Modise said he suspected the SADF had "its own agenda" and  wanted to delay the integration process in the hope it could  stay in command and determine who joined the SANDF. "This we  will not allow. We are very worried about it ... but we are  going to ensure that integration takes its course once a new  government comes in". He said the SADF had previously had  facilities for Citizen Force intakes of up to 20,000 new  recruits but had now "reluctantly identified three of its bases  where MK members could assemble".</p>

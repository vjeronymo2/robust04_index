			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [An unattributed article: "Flight 63: Analysis and </F> Corrective Measures"]    [Text] On February 18, 1994, at Evry, Charles Bigot,  Arianespace chairman and CEO, Jean-Paul Herteman, chairman of  the Flight 63 Inquiry Board, and Claude Quievre, Arianespace's  Deputy Vice-President, Technical and Industrial Affairs,  presented to the press the Inquiry Board's conclusions, the  corrective measures plan and the outlook for launch resumption.  <H5>  The Work of the Inquiry Board </H5>   The Inquiry Board met from January 28 to February 14,  working  in four phases as explained by J.P. Herteman: "First, try to  imagine all possible causes of the anomalies observed; compare  these causes with all Flight 63 production, control and  acceptance files as well as the flight's telemetry data; decide  on their degree of probability, i.e., classify these causes into  proven or established categories; finally, put forward  recommendations based on this analysis."    The Board thus sent out, in particular, 113 inquiry or  action  requests to the manufacturers involved.    No nonconformity with quality requirements and processes was  found in any of the production, assembly, control, testing and  preparation operations on Flight 63's third-stage engine.    The work basically focused on analyzing the initial causes  of  an imbalance noted in the functioning of the immersed bearing of  the HM7 engine's LOX turbopump between 8 seconds (at engine  ignition) and 60 seconds after second-stage separation.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   The Inquiry Board did not establish a "unique and proven  cause" for the Flight 63 failure. However, it concluded that  the engine shutdown was probably due to the conjunction of a  late precooling of the LOX pump bearing and a series of  aggravating factors, probable or possible.    In fact, Flight 63 telemetry data indicate unusually slow  precooling of the bearing itself, while the cooling at the turbo  pump inlet was normal, even slightly early. This anomaly was  never observed on previous flights.    As regards aggravating factors considered by the Inquiry  Board, Jean-Paul Herteman mentioned a possible penetration of  humidity during the opening of the oxygen drain valve on the  ground and/or the trapping of purging gas inside the bearing  cavity; certain pump components may have particular  characteristics which could possibly lead to a higher level of  energy or greater friction loads than usual. The Board also  asked for further analysis of the Clevite seal (see photo on  page 4), which was part of a new batch.  <H5>  Recommendations </H5>   The Inquiry Board put forward 15 recommendations, based on  three complementary phases: first, to prevent the risks of late  precooling of the LOX pump bearing cavity; second, reduce the  risk of the appearance of aggravating factors which probably or  possibly contributed to the failure; third, and more generally,  reduce the bearing's sensitivity to functional disturbances.  <H5>  Corrective Measures Plan </H5>   Claude Quievre stressed the fact that the corrective  measures  plan adopted by Arianespace to implement the Board's 15  recommendations will further improve Ariane 4's reliability,  which remains at a high level after Flight 63.    This program aims at "improving the cooling circuit of the  oxygen immersed bearing to make this function more independent  of external conditions, and reinforcing the capacity of the  bearing to stand the inevitable dispersions of functional  parameters."    The measures adopted can be grouped in two categories: those  concerning the thermal behavior of the oxygen pump, and those  concerning its mechanical behavior.  <H5>  Thermal Behavior </H5>   A more thorough analysis of the precooling anomaly on Flight  63 was undertaken to ensure that all possible causes were taken  into account. The team involved has already been at work for  the past few weeks and has contributed to drawing up the  corrective measures plan.    To improve precooling of the bearing and ensure  reproducibility, a purge line for the oxygen bearing cavity will  be designed and qualified by SEP. This line will allow a  controlled flow of the fluids during the purge of the oxygen  circuit, during the precooling of the bearing and during engine  operation. It should minimize overheating due to the highly  leaktight Sealol and Clevite seals.    Improvement of the onboard and ground helium flushing of the  purge line is also planned, to prevent any possible penetration  of moisture in the circuit.  <H5>  Mechanical Behavior </H5>   To improve the robustness of the oxygen immersed bearing, it  was decided, starting with Flight 64, to use a bearing whose  ball races, and cage surfaces are fitted with a self-lubricating  coating of molybdene disulfide, and that has increased cooling  flow. This modification should make it possible to bear much  higher axial loads.  <H5>  Tests and Qualifications </H5>   These two modifications will naturally be qualified with  respect to Ariane specifications. The qualification program  includes tests on the engine stand at Vernon and on the bearing  test bench at Liege University (Belgium).    The tests will allow an experimental check of the  self-lubricated oxygen bearing's resistance to extreme  conditions of various functional parameters. The purge line  will also be checked during engine tests.  <H5>  Other Measures </H5>   Recommendations aimed at improving models will naturally be  respected. The thermal model of the bearing used by the Inquiry  Board to establish its scenario will be completed. Along with  limit tests, it should contribute to finally establishing the  causes of Flight 63's late precooling.    Finally, as recommended by the Inquiry Board, redundant  turbopump assembly checks will be carried out.  <H5>  The Situation is "Well in Hand" </H5>   Charles Bigot explained that this type of incident -- though  extremely serious because of its consequences -- was not unusual  at all in launcher operations. It will be handled as all  incidents which arise during equipment production, checking and  acceptance tests or pre-launch operations.    "We have the situation well in hand," he emphasized, thanks  to "the perfect cohesion, total concertation, devotion and  enthusiasm" of Ariane industrial teams, and thanks to the  extensive data available to the company, "the result of  considerable work and knowledge acquired, on the part of the  industry, research organizations and laboratories."    For Charles Bigot, the two modifications are indeed  "effective means to increase our system's reliability": the  first because it provides a global solution to all possible  causes of insufficient precooling, and the second, already well  known, was already in the process of qualification.  <H5>  Quality First </H5>   However, Arianespace's corrective measures plan is quite  complicated. Introducing beneficial modifications is not  enough; it is also essential to ensure that any possible  secondary effects are innocuous. Modifications will be  qualified in accordance with the tradition of rigor and  vigilance of the Ariane program, which "forces us to respect not  only the well-established formal sequences, including critical  review, qualification board, etc., but also a fundamental  methodology." Arianespace will naturally continue to give top  priority to quality and security: "We owe it to our customers  and we will not compromise on this point," said Charles Bigot.  <H5>  Technical Details </H5> <H5>  Overheating </H5>   Some cases of overheating of the LOX turbopump immersed  bearing were observed prior to Flight 63.    There are three types of overheating: small, very short  peaks  of low amplitude (approximately 1 degree), frequently recorded;  show non-dispersed drifts, changing at less than one-tenth of a  degree per second, observed on seven flights from L07 to V62;  rapid drifts, never seen in flight before V63; six cases,  however, were recorded during ground tests or checks.    These observations led to a series of measures: a hardening  of criteria and conditions for the acceptance of HM7 engines;  the setting-up of test benches in universities to analyze  bearing behavior with a fine tooth comb; development of digital  simulation of bearing behavior; finally, the study of a  modification to reduce sensitivity of the bearing to thermal  imbalance.  <H5>  Humidity </H5>   Among possible aggravating factors, the Inquiry Board  analyzed a possible penetration of moisture during the ground  opening of the oxygen purge valve. This problem never occurred  before. On Flight 63, a minute amount of humidity may have been  deposited on the cooling circuit filters. This humidity may  have, not obstructed the filters, but slightly modified the  oxygen flow during the precooling phase. Circuits are purged by  helium flushing and compression/expansion cycles.    Corrective measures decided after Flight 63 -- installing a  purge line and improving the on-board and ground helium flushing  -- will ensure improved purging of the circuits.  <H5>  The Cost of Corrective Measures </H5>   Major expenses will of course be borne by the launcher  operator. The interruption of flights, equipment disassembly and  transportation, new acceptance tests, engine re-assembly, launch  campaign resumption, additional transportation, air  transportation of the third-stage engine over several months,  etc. -- all this will be very expensive. This is why  Arianespace regularly sets aside provisions and reserves.    Naturally, responsibilities are also shared with the  industry, and this is provided for by multiple contracts.  <H5>  Towards Flight Resumption </H5>   The time required by the corrective measures plan will be  "well used." The Inquiry Board set the example by releasing a  very comprehensive report only three weeks after Flight 63. As  for the industrial teams, they have committed themselves to work  without stinting on their time or effort. "We know that our  customers suffer, and will suffer, from this necessary delay. I  would like them to rest assured that our only goal is to provide  them with a regular, reliable service."    The date of the next flight cannot be set now, as it  obviously depends on the state of progress of the different  phases of the program, some of which affect subsequent ones.    However, Arianespace decided to complete all corrective  actions within a reasonable timeframe, currently estimated at  three months. This would allow launch resumption towards the end  of May.    From Flight 64 onwards, every possible effort will be made  to  catch up on the flight schedule, through a substantial increase  in the launch rate. Arianespace is therefore re-adjusting  operational procedures -- but not modifying them -- to "carry  out in three weeks, with the same quality and the same rigor  what we carried out in four weeks up to now."  <H5>  The Launch Manifest </H5>   Arianespace's basic rule is to give priority to customers  whose satellites could not be placed into orbit.    This will therefore apply to two customers involved:  Eutelsat and Aerospatiale on behalf of Turksat.</p>

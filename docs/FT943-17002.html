			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / People: Development Securities - on its Marx Martin Landau, the property entrepreneur who bought into Development Securities last June, has made a further move to reshape its management with the appointment of Michael Marx to replace joint managing director Robert Ware. Ware was running the troubled property developer at the time Landau spearheaded a financial restructuring for the loss-making Clayform Properties, which was renamed Development Securities. Ware's contract was reduced from three years to one year last July, and his role was widely regarded as transitional. Anthony Bodie was brought in as the other joint managing director to manage the company's rapidly growing property portfolio. Ware's departure was described as 'amicable', and a spokesman said no compensation would be paid. His successor has also had experience of troubled property companies, as the finance director of Gerald Ronson's Heron Corporation, where he has been central to the group's recent restructuring.</p>

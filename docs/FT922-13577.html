			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Nellist splits Labour vote MR Dave Nellist, the former Labour MP expelled from the party for his alleged links with the far-left Militant Tendency, split Labour's vote in Coventry South East so that the Conservatives nearly won the seat. The official Labour candidate Mr Jim Cunningham polled 11,902, Mr Nellist, Independent Labour, polled 10,551, and Mrs Martine Hyams polled 10,591 for the Conservatives. Mr Nellist was expelled after a 12-hour disciplinary tribunal last September. It decided that he could be reasonably described as a member of Militant, which Labour members are forbidden from joining. Mr Nellist warned that his expulsion would damage Labour's prospects of winning Tory marginals in neighbouring constituencies. He said that an imposed Labour candidate would not be able to win the seat.</p>

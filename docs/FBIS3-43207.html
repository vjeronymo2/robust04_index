			<p>This     press review series focuses on economic, social, and  demographic issues in the Maghreb countries of Algeria, Libya,  Morocco, and Tunisia.     ALGERIA     UMA, Algerian Presidency Viewed     According to London expatriate daily AL-HAYAH, Algeria may be  distracted by its civil unrest and economic problems in leading the  Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) after assuming the UMA presidency on 1  January 1994.  However, Algeria may be able to promote a resolution  of the Western Sahara issue, possibly by supporting the UN-mandated  referendum, and may find itself in a better position to negotiate  its border with Morocco.  According to the article, "All observers  agree that the UMA will not be an effective organization as long as  Morocco and Algeria have no strategic accord since they form the  backbone of the Union."     The AL-HAYAH article also stated that Algeria's relations with  Tunis have improved since the two countries finally drew fixed  borders, but that its relations with Libya were still uneasy because  of al-Qadhdhafi's alleged support for the Islamic Salvation Front  (FIS).  Regarding the UMA's international role, AL-HAYAH said that  Algeria will not be able to repeat its 1990 hosting of the  Mediterranean Basin summit because of the impasse between Libya and  the United States, France, and Britain.     A commentary in Casablanca daily AL-ITTIHAD AL-ISHTIRAKI compared  the UMA to an invalid still confined to the recovery room, and  questioned whether Algeria could revitalize the UMA in view of its  own problems.  In addition to its internal strife and the UN  sanctions against Libya, Algiers would have to deal with the  significant problem of the European Union's insistence on  negotiating separate deals with individual Maghreb countries, rather  than negotiating with the entire region.  AL-ITTIHAD AL-ISHTIRAKI  commented, ??Now five years old, the UMA needs a thorough evaluation  to recognize its fractured state and to put things back together.  If there really is an intention to continue the organization and to  build it, it must not remain a structure far removed from the  citizenry and from being concerned with their needs and idealism.  Indeed, the Arab Maghreb, which fought collectively against  colonialism in the Tangiers Conference 35 years ago, should not now  be under the exclusive control of the ruling powers, nor should it  be a prisoner of their transitory policies." (London AL-HAYAH 30 Dec  93; Casablanca AL-ITTIHAD AL-ISHTIRAKI 22 Dec 93)     MOROCCO     Regional Utilities, Rural Finance Projects     The World Bank has approved two loans to taIling $260 million to  back projects costing over $1.5 billion.  Both projects also include  large-scale co-financing from international donors and domestic  institutions and reportedly reflect the international community's  high support for rural development and water-supply projects.     A $353.6 million water supply project is to receive a $160  million loan, repayable over 20 years with a five-year grace period.  Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) and the African  Development Bank will provide $84 million and the rest will come  from domestic sources.  The project is intended to restructure  regional utilities in Casablanca, Fes, Rabat, Kenitra, Meknes, and  Marrakech, and strengthen other water-sector institutions, including  the National Office for Drinking Water (ONEP).     The World Bank has also committed $100 million to a $1.15 billion  rural finance project to promote private investment in rural areas.  One of the project's main aims is help the Caisse Nationale de  Credit Agricole move away from its core farm and forestry investment  to banking on a broader scale.  This will receive substantial co-  financing including an estimated $30 million from the French Caisse  Francaise de Developpement; $34 million from Germany's Kreditanstalt  fuer Wiederaufbau; and $60 million each from the European Investment  Bank, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and the  OECF.  (London MEED 25 Dec 93)     TUNISIA     AL-HADATH Director Receives Threat     Rabat daily AL-MAGHRIB has reported that the staff of Tunisian  Arabic-language weekly AL-HADATH received a telephone call on 29  December directed at the manager-chief editor, demanding that he  "stop writing about the (Muslim) brothers; otherwise he will suffer  the same fate as Faraj Foudah."  Additional threats were made on 30  and 31 December.  AL-HADATH reportedly stated that management  attached "little importance" to these threats, attributing them to  "traffickers in religion" and to "plain assassins," and noting,  "This strengthens our belief that we are on the right track--that of  fighting for Tunisia."  (Rabat AL-MAGHRIB 1 Jan 94)     Health Services Statistics     According to public health sector statistics, as of 1 September  1993 there were 1,579 general practitioners and 1,113 specialists  providing medical services in Tunisia.  The specialists numbered 243  surgeons, 86 gynecologists, 54 opthalmologists, 42 ear, nose, and  throat specialists, and 44 radiologists; the remaining 523 were in  other fields.  In the private sector, there were reportedly 2,100  doctors, including 1,000 specialists.  (Tunis LE TEMPS 19 Nov 93)     Technical Cooperation Program     The Tunisian Agency for Technical Cooperation reported that 694  individuals departed for Gulf and Western countries in 1993 as part  of bilateral cooperation programs.  Many of these technical programs  were underwritten by international organizations such as the World  Bank, the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development, and the  United Nations Development Program.  One-third of the 694 came from  the education sector, another third from the health sector, and the  remainder from engineering, electrical energy disciplines,  telecommunications, petroleum, agriculture, mechanics and computer  science.  The number of Tunisians currently employed by these  programs in other Middle Eastern countries is as follows:  Saudi  Arabia (4,034); Oman (1,909); Qatar (502); UAE (404); Bahrain (111);  Kuwait (87); and Yemen (62).  Some 283 are employed in Western  countries, including Europe, the United States, and Canada, with 114  of these working in France.  (Tunis LE TEMPS 8 Dec 93)     Olive Oil Surplus Reported     According to LE TEMPS, olive oil production has been facing  pricing, distribution, and stocking problems due to the domestic  market's inability to absorb surplus quantities.  Although  production totals have been estimated at 320 million tons, exports  will only absorb 110 million tons, with the remaining 210 tons to be  sold on the local market, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.  The article noted that the domestic olive oil market is "sluggish"  since consumption has moved to other types of seed oil because of  the longstanding policy of reserving olive oil for export.  In  addition, olive oil must compete on the domestic market with  "inferior" imported seed oils that are sold at competitive prices.  The article further reported that "significant quantities of  imported oil at subsidized prices" will also be marketed.     The Ministry of Agriculture has proposed a revised price schedule  to make the surplus olive oil more competitive; however, by lowering  prices, production in the northern and southern regions could be  discouraged altogether.  According to LE TEMPS, Minister of  Agriculture Mohamed Ben Rejeb believes that the current problems are  temporary and will diminish "if everyone does his part."  The  state's Office of Olive Oil has reportedly "hidden" the problem by  "financial juggling" that "has created a deficit of 137 billion  (dirhams) and 400 billion in bank debts,..  The bailout bid is  costing the government 103 billion and the banks 20 billion."  The  article further stated that companies will not weather reduced  prices at a time when the industry is being privatized.  According  to LE TEMPS, although the supply of olive oil is increasing, the  lack of financing and distribution systems will ensure a continuing  surplus problem.

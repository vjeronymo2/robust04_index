			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: A Fisher dips 17% in tough trading - Balance sheet remains strong despite Pounds 47m cost of acquisitions ALBERT FISHER, the fresh produce distributor and food processor, blamed extremely difficult trading conditions in the US and UK for a 17 per cent drop in interim profits. Turnover, boosted by acquisitions, rose 16 per cent to Pounds 588m (Pounds 506m) in the six months to February 29, but pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 45m to Pounds 37.2m. Shares in the group peaked at 133p last year, but fell steadily following the resignation of its chief executive in the US. Yesterday they closed at 69p, down 2p. Mr Tony Millar, the executive chairman who rapidly built up the group by making more than 50 acquisitions, has since strengthened the US management. This month Mr Tim Howden, 55, joined as group chief executive in Europe, having previously been managing director of Rank Hovis McDougall, the food group. Mr Millar said that last year the City had been swept by fears over companies which had experienced rapid growth during the eighties. He took a pragmatic view of such shifts in sentiment and the group's strengthened management team intended to get their heads down and concentrate on producing growth. The biggest problems in the half-year were in the US, with a 38 per cent drop to Pounds 6.7m in underlying operating profits from fresh produce. Although market shares were maintained, the volume of sales to leading food service customers declined, reflecting a fall in hotel occupancy and bookings for cruises, airlines and restaurants. However, the group said its strengthened management team had cut staffing levels by between 3 and 5 per cent, and was making good progress in turning round the results of the distribution operation in Los Angeles. In Europe, operating profits from fresh produce grew by 4 per cent to Pounds 7m. The UK potato packing operation performed disappointingly, and adverse weather reduced volumes of fruit from Spain and Chile, but this had been offset by the group's international sourcing expertise. Operating profits from frozen and chilled foods in Europe were down 11 per cent to Pounds 11.1m. Large increases in the fish and vegetable businesses were offset by weakened UK demand for frozen vegetables and cockle supply problems in the Netherlands. Food processing and distribution in Europe saw a marginal dip in operating profits to Pounds 8m (Pounds 8.1m). The group said the merger of three UK operations - Stratford-upon-Avon Foods, Rowats Foods and Unimerchants - into Fisher Quality Foods had resulted in substantial benefits. The balance sheet remained strong, with net cash of Pounds 14m, following Pounds 47m expenditure on acquisitions, Pounds 15m of capital expenditure and a seasonal investment of working capital. Net assets fell from Pounds 273m to Pounds 253m. The fall in UK interest rates cut interest income from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 4.41m. In March, Albert Fisher sold Holco, a Dutch mushroom and asparagus bottling plant, to Hillsdown Holdings, the food processing group, at a loss of Pounds 5.95m, which it treated as an extraordinary item. Earnings per share fell by 17 per cent to 4.31p (5.18p), but the interim dividend is lifted to 1.85p (1.75p). See Lex</p>

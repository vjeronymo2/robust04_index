			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN ALBUM: WHO'S ON FIRST? NO QUICK ANSWERS IN THIS GAMEIN THE FINNISH  VERSION OF BASEBALL, PLAYERS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. NOW THEY'RE IN THE U.S.,  SEEKING A FOOTHOLD.  </P> <P> There were lots of reasons why Jimmy Piersall was known as a flake back when he  played major league baseball, but one of the best came the day he hit a home  run as a New York Met and ran the bases backwards.  </P> <P> All of which has little to do with the subject of this story except to  illustrate the maxim that what may seem like buffoonery in one setting could  make perfect sense in another. Had Piersall been playing in, say, Helsinki  rather than Queens, he might have fit right in.  </P> <P> Yes. Baseball has been Finlandized.  </P> <P> The Finns call the game pesapallo and are so crazy about it that it's  considered their national pastime. Of course they do it a little differently.  They don't actually backpedal their way from base to base ala Piersall but,  looking at it from a chauvinist American perspective, they do take a backwards  route around the basepaths.  </P> <P> First base is where third base ought to be, second is sort of around where  first should be and third is somewhere out in left field.  </P> <P> That's right, Abbott. Who isn't on first. I Don't Know is. Sort of.  </P> <P> Anyway, Finnish emigres have spread the game to Scandinavia, Canada and even  Australia. And over the weekend they took their first crack at the toughest  market of all -- the United States, the guarantor of all that is pure and noble  about baseball.  </P> <P> Here in Michigan's rugged Upper Peninsula, the heart of Finnish America, two  Canadian pesapallo teams squared off Saturday in a demonstration game before  thousands of slightly befuddled spectators at an ethnic festival. In a real  slugfest, the Toronto Sisu eked out a 16-15 win over the archrival Thunder Bay  Repais.  </P> <P> Organizers of the annual FinnFest say that they hope to field enough domestic  talent to stage home-grown pesapallo matches at future gatherings. Already, the  Hancock High School baseball coach is talking about teaching the Finnish  version to his team.  </P> <P> The main selling point of pesapallo, devotees say, is action. There are no long  pauses between pitches, the ball is almost constantly in play and both fielders  and runners are forever scampering all over the place.  </P> <P> "In American baseball, a runner on second is in scoring position but in our  game he's just tired," winked Jari Leinonen, who plays for the Repais. "Usually  when we get out there, we pack a lunch."  </P> <P> The Abner Doubleday of Finland was Lauri Pihkala, a professor who apparently  was mesmerized by baseball during early 20th-Century study tours in the United  States. He combined the American game with some native ball-playing sports and  pesapallo was born.  </P> <P> Both baseball and pesapallo feature four bases, three outs an inning, nine  innings, nine players on a side, a hard ball, mitts and a bat -- although the  Louisville Slugger of Finland is called a Jarvinen Kanuuna. It's also safe to  say that neither game will have Roseanne Barr sing the opening anthem in the  future.  </P> <P> That's where the similarities end. The pesapallo pitcher, for instance, stands  next to the plate and tosses the ball up in the air, varying his delivery not  with curves or sliders but by the height the ball goes. (Orel Hershiser please  note: if the shoulder surgery doesn't work, a career could still beckon in  Finland.)  </P> <P> Instead of waiting in a dugout, teammates of the batter stand around what's  roughly equivalent to the batter's box and scream out advice whether to swing  or not at a pitch. The batter can hit as many as three fair balls before he has  to run. And the route around the basepaths sort of zigzags first to the left,  then the right, then the left again.  </P> <P> Confused? Try this. A three-base hit is a kunnari, or home run. The batter  scores, even though he's allowed to stay on third and score again if somebody  knocks him in. But getting a kunnari is not easy because a ball that's knocked  out of the park -- about 300 feet from home to the farthest point of the  pesapallo outfield -- is considered a laiton (foul).  </P> <P> When an outfielder catches a fly ball, that doesn't necessarily mean the batter  is out. He might just be haava (wounded), a sort of purgatory state for  sluggers that requires them to forfeit the turn at bat but doesn't exactly  count toward ending the inning. And when someone does make an out, he's not  just out, he's pallo (killed). This is no game for wimps, that's for sure.  </P> <P> There's one other important difference. At the end of the game, American  ballplayers hit the showers. "When we're done," said Thunder Bay shortstop  Pavli Kaki, "we go off to the sauna."  </P></p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: CBOT to support top derivative investors THE Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, intends to take measures to better accommodate the increasing number of large institutional investors which use futures and options. The CBOT board has proposed to lift position limits on three of the exchange's main financial contracts, the Treasury bond and the five and 10-year Treasury note futures. The move must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Option limits on those contracts would remain the same. The board also approved regulations that will allow member firms to provide average prices and order quantities when executing large orders or series of orders. The aim is to make the market more efficient for fund managers. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange earlier this month won approval from the CFTC to lift position limits on futures and options on Eurodollars and leading currencies. It cited the need to accommodate the trading requirements of large managed funds. Late last year, the CME put in place a system for average pricing of large orders. Managed funds are estimated to contain as much as Dollars 30bn, up from just Dollars 10bn at the start of 1990.</p>

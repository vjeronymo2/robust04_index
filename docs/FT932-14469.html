			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / People: Farmer takes over at Moscow Narodny Moscow Narodny Bank, the 73-year-old London-based bank which has been trying to find a new role for itself following the collapse of the Soviet Union, has appointed Derek Farmer as deputy general manager. Farmer, 48, will be the senior British executive in a bank which has had a reasonably rapid turnover of general managers over the past few years. He will be acting general manager following the departure of Cliff Evans who had been in the job for just over two years. Evans, a former Citibanker, had replaced Campbell Dunford, a former Midland Bank trade finance official, who had been doing the job since February 1988. Moscow Narodny gave no reason for Evans' departure but it is understood that he may be involved in setting up a joint venture bank in Moscow. Moscow Narodny, which used to be the main overseas commercial bank of the former Soviet Union, is recovering from a turbulent period in 1991 when it lost Pounds 120.6m. The disintegration of the Soviet Union caused a run on its deposits and Russia was forced to step in and inject more than Pounds 300m of new capital to guarantee its survival. The balance sheet of the bank, which is now controlled by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, has shrunk from Pounds 2.5bn in 1989 to Pounds 1.1bn in 1991. The new acting general manager started his banking career at the Royal Bank of Scotland. Between 1970 and 1982 he worked for Toronto-Dominion Bank, including seven years in Toronto and two years in the Middle East. He has since worked at The Royal Trust Company of Canada, Ubaf Bank and Banque Paribas, and has most recently worked as a consultant with Harrods Bank.</p>

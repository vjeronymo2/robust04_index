			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ntumba Matulu commentary] </F>   [Excerpt] Today, we continue our series of commentaries on  the important New Year message by head of state Marshal Mobutu  Sese Seko to the nation on 4 January.    Reviewing the state of the nation in order to take stock and  reflect on the consequences of about four years of hesitation  and confusion, Marshal Mobutu dwelt in his speech on economic  and political harmony in our country.    It is often said: Give me sound politics and I will give you  a sound economy. But what can be expected when we observe that  the president himself cries angrily at this laconic order and I  quote: It is enough! Enough is enough! In any case, by this,  one can understand, if I may say, politics has precedence over  the economy. One can then ask to know if it is the latter that  commands the former -- or vice versa. Upon analysis and on  account of the situation currently prevailing in Zaire and the  world, one thing is certain: If it is true that the bad conduct  of the political game annoys the [word indistinct] of the  economy to the point of causing even confusion, no one can deny  that the ruin of the economy has finally made the political  sector nervous and has led to the economy's modification, just  as economic successes contribute to the reinforcement of  political stands.    Concerning Zaire, our country, one can note that at the  beginning, it was, above all, the serious economic difficulties  and the unrest that ensued that forced our people to question  the institutions of the Second Republic and demand change. As  one can observe, the detonator for democratization was economic.  But later, when there was hesitation and other acts of  tardiness and stalemate in the machinery of democratization, it  was economic arguments that external partners resorted to in  order to continue the process of political reform.    At the home level, we can remark that any time there is  something wrong in the democratic mechanism for one reason or  the other, it is the economic weapon that is resorted to in  order to make things work once again: Unlimited strikes are  decreed, civil disobedience is called for, industrial units are  attacked, and in commerce, the transportation network is  targeted. In short, people want to paralyze the economy and  prevent the government from working in order to force it to  change its mind and orientate its policies to a given direction.    In the light of all these arguments, there is no doubt that  the economy controls politics, hence the president of the  Republic's recommendation to his fellow citizens to behave in  such a way that 1994 may be a year of national redress.

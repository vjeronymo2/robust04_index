			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-DEPUTY FILES $400-MILLION SUIT  </P> <P> Former Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Rickey Ross Tuesday filed a  $400-million suit against the city of Los Angeles and Police Chief Daryl F.  Gates for alleged civil rights violations stemming from his arrest on murder  charges.  </P> <P> Ross was held for 82 days earlier this year on suspicion of killing three  South-Central Los Angeles prostitutes, largely due to Los Angeles Police  Department ballistics tests linking his gun to the murders. But the charges  were dropped May 15 when outside ballistics experts concluded that the evidence  was faulty.  </P> <P> Ross was arrested by Los Angeles police in late February with an alleged  prostitute in his car in South-Central Los Angeles. According to the lawsuit,  the woman told Ross she was stranded, had no money and needed a ride.  </P> <P> The suit, which includes Ross's wife Sylvia as a plaintiff, claims that the  former deputy was beaten during his arrest, that he was not allowed to call a  lawyer during questioning, that his wife was kept in their home for hours after  his arrest and that their home was searched without a warrant.  </P> <P> Among other things, the 41-page suit charges the city, Gates and 11 LAPD  officers and detectives with false arrest and imprisonment, unlawful search and  seizure, filing false arrest reports, battery and malicious prosecution.  </P></p>

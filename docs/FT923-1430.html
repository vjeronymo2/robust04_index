			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Ratification of Maastricht urged: Paris and Bonn stress commitment to monetary and political union GERMAN CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand gave their firm commitment at a mini-summit in Paris yesterday to ensuring that European monetary and political union should not be halted. After the two-hour meeting, Mr Kohl said on German television: 'For me and for the president it is clear. We want the ratification of Maastricht. The process must not be stopped. We want to expand but also deepen the Community.' However, both leaders refused to say, or to let their officials say, anything about the content of the talks. The meeting has fuelled rumours of a Franco-German initiative following last Sunday's narrow French vote of approval for the Maastricht treaty, and of possible currency realignment. German officials said Mr Kohl would discuss any plans with other government heads before anything was finalised. The chancellor is to make a full statement on the Maastricht treaty to the German Bundestag on Friday, and has cancelled a week-long trip to Asia in October to attend the European Community London summit and to work on the issues involved. French and German officials stressed that yesterday's meeting should be seen as the start of the run-up to the mid-October EC summit in London, which the leaders of France and Germany hoped would produce important clarification - but not re-negotiation - of the Maastricht treaty. Downing Street confirmed last night that the summit had been fixed for October 16. The news black-out on yesterday's meeting may have been partly due to a desire to avoid the impression that the German and French leaders are ganging up on Mr John Major. They recognise the UK prime minister's increasing difficulty of squaring his back-bench difficulties over Maastricht with his responsibility as current president of the EC to orches-trate further ratification moves. However, the other reason for their secrecy is that the two leaders have little new to say. Part of the 'clarification' of Maastricht - designed to ease popular fears about the treaty creating an autocratic super-state - was set in train at the June EC summit. Paris and Bonn also believe the London summit should stress the need to reinforce democratic control of EC institutions, and to widen Community membership, say officials in both capitals. The Elysee Palace said yesterday that Mr Mitterrand would be convalescing for the next three weeks after his prostate cancer operation.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Albion The closure of its County Down trouser factory left Albion, the Belfast-based men's wear company, with pre-tax profits substantially lower at Pounds 291,673 in the six months to March 31, against Pounds 507,940. There was a charge of Pounds 250,000 relating to the closure. The shares fell 17p to 96p. Turnover advanced 47 per cent to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 9.14m), mainly reflecting the acquisition of Maitland Menswear. However, with margins cut to maintain market share, operating profits were only 7 per cent higher at Pounds 541,673 (Pounds 507,940). Earnings per share were 5.6p (9.6p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 1.6p.</p>

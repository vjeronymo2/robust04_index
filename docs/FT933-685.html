			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Arts: Today's Television Icelanders used to be addicted to killing girl babies and were extremely reluctant to give up the practice on converting to Christianity. In India, it seems that not only has there always been female infanticide but it is now hugely on the increase, according to Assignment; Live and Let Die (BBC 2; 7.45). Ultrasound has been a boon for Indian families, because now they can abort female foetuses - a decision some parents justify on moral grounds, so wretched is the quality of life an unwanted female can expect. But as well as abortion, murder continues to be practised on a wide scale (if you accept that distinction). It is a natural transition to the sufferings of Chinese women in Omnibus: Wild Swans (BBC 1, 10.30). This is the film of Jung Chang's best seller, a poignant account of the experiences of three generations of the women in her family. Tonight's light-hearted moments come with Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City (C4, 9.00), another writer with a talent for transporting us to an exotic society, San Francisco in the 1970s.</p>

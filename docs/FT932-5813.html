			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / ITV companies fear takeover rule changes AT LEAST three significant ITV companies will vigorously oppose any immediate relaxation of the rules on ITV ownership, which prevent any of the nine largest companies taking each other over. The companies are Anglia, the ITV company for the east of England, HTV, which covers Wales and the west, and Meridian, the south of England franchise holder. Anglia and HTV, medium-sized quoted ITV companies, are worried that they could be taken over if the rules changed. Mr David McCall, Anglia chief executive, said yesterday: 'I am not convinced by the economic arguments at this stage that there need to be only four ITV companies.' Anglia had a stronger balance sheet than some larger ITV companies and has been expanding internationally through deals with Home Box Office of the US. Mr Charles Romaine, chief executive of HTV, said ITV should be reviewed in 1996. 'We fear that the regional nature of ITV will disappear if changes are made so quickly to ownership,' he said. Lord Hollick, chairman of Meridian Broadcasting, also believes there should be no piecemeal tinkering with the rules. The Labour peer recently told the House of Lords he wanted an extension of the moratorium on hostile takeovers of ITV companies that runs out in December. He also called for a comprehensive review of the 1990 Broadcasting Act in 1996. Following intense lobbying by a number of the larger ITV companies, Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage secretary plans to review ITV ownership rules. He wants to examine the economic case that might justify the proposition that ITV companies need to be bigger to compete internationally. He intends to call a meeting of all the ITV companies to discuss the issue and is likely to hear sharply conflicting views. HTV is scathing about arguments that Pounds 100m could be saved each year by the removal of unnecessary duplication in the ITV system. The Independent Television Commission has made it clear that although it will not oppose a relaxation of the ownership rules it will insist on maintaining separate regional licences and the programme obligations that go with them. This could limit potential savings. The ownership issue is also likely to become political. Backbench MPs will almost certainly be mobilised to oppose anything that would undermine the separate existence of companies such as Anglia or HTV.</p>

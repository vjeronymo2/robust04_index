			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 29 (AFP)--The pro-China political  party Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong called  Friday on China to maintain "normal contacts" with the territory  in the run-up to 1997.    In one of its 10 recommendations to the Chinese government,  the party urged that "normal contacts" to be maintained between  Chinese and Hong Kong officials "at all levels...to enable  continuous and efficient cooperation over transition matters."    Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997.    The recommendations were made as Lu Ping, head of China's  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, was expected to arrive here  Sunday [1 May] to attend a meeting of sub-groups under the  Preliminary Work Committee (PWC). The PWC, which is appointed  by Beijing, was set up by China to prepare for the 1997 hand  over. Lu however has decided not to meet Hong Kong Governor  Chris Patten while in the territory.    Patten, who has irked Beijing by going ahead with  controversial electoral reforms, expressed disappointment at  Lu's refusal to meet him but reiterated his willingness to meet  Lu at the Chinese official's convenience.    The party also pointed out that "disruption caused by the  lack of convergence (on political issues) should be minimised as  far as possible," and urged the PWC to work "with more  transparency."    In a statement, the party said that "the people of Hong Kong  need to learn more about China, while the Chinese government  must attend to the hopes and fears of Hong Kong, so that mutual  trust can be built up between the two sides."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, 17 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The international  community and the world financial organizations today committed  themselves to delivering $150 million to Nicaragua during the  1994-95 period to consolidate the peace process and promote  economic development.    The Advisory Group for Nicaragua said the two $75-million  financial aid installments for 1994 and 1995 will be used to  boost the economic development of that Central American nation.    At the conclusion of a two-day, closed-door meeting,  Edilberto Segura, World Bank director for Mexico, Central  America, and Panama, remarked on Nicaragua's democratic progress  in 1993.    The donor countries asked the Nicaraguan Government to focus  on fighting poverty, reducing the foreign debt, modernizing the  public sector, and settling property disputes.    Mark Schneider, deputy director of the U.S. Agency for  International Development's Latin American and Caribbean  division, said: "The poorest of the poor must be the main  beneficiaries of this financial aid."    The World Bank said the main challenge for Latin America "is  to promote and sustain balanced growth while maintaining  economic stability in view of possible reductions in  international financial aid."    Nicaraguan Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo, who headed  the  Nicaraguan delegation, said "the only war we can wage now is a  war on poverty," adding that "the armed conflict,  totalitarianism, and backwardness must be left behind."    The government official asked the World Bank and the IMF to  expedite their disbursements and increase their co-financing.  Lacayo emphasized that it is necessary for them to provide $60  million annually to increase funds to invest in rural  production, especially small-scale production.    The Advisory Group meeting took place at the Paris World  Bank  quarters and was attended by delegates from Germany, Austria,  Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Japan,  Luxembourg, and Mexico. Representatives from Sweden,  Switzerland, Spain, the United States, and Venezuela were also  present, as were World Bank and IMF officials.    The Pan-American Health Organization, UNICEF, the OECD, and  the International Agricultural Development Fund also attended  the meeting.</p>

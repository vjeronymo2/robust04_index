			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Leading Article: The Fed points up Testifying to Congress last month, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, claimed that it was 'an open question' whether US interest rates had increased enough to head off inflationary pressures. Yesterday's half-point rise in rates closed it for the time-being. Timing of such decisions can be debated endlessly. Since interest rate changes have most of their effect a year or two after the event, such debate is fruitless. What matters more is the direction and size of the change. Mr Greenspan's Federal Reserve likes fine-tuning policy. By those standards, this is a decisive move, one that shifts US monetary policy close to his elusive objective of 'neutrality'. The case for such a move is provided by the domestic economy. The aim, one that is close to Mr Greenspan's heart, is non-inflationary growth. By those standards higher interest rates were evidently justified. The recovery, now more than four years old, has brought the economy near to full capacity. But employment growth remains quite strong, as does that of the economy. The world economy is now also picking up. Meanwhile, the slope of the yield curve - the gap between short and long-term rates of interest - is still strongly positive. One reason has been the rise in the interest rate on long bonds. While difficult to interpret with confidence, this rise suggests that the credibility of monetary policy remains fragile. The Federal Reserve is merely doing its job and deserves support when doing so. What it will receive from many politicians instead is condemnation. Such carping should be ignored. They are also just doing their job.</p>

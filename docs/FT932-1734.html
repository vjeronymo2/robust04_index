			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (10): How to survive in a competitive jungle - Trade BEYOND FREE TRADE: FIRMS, GOVERNMENTS AND GLOBAL COMPETITION edited by David B Yoffie Harvard Business School Press Dollars 40, 466 pages ANYONE WHO wants to understand the thinking behind President Clinton's more aggressive approach to trade policy will find this book a help. Indeed, in its quiet way it says quite a lot about the direction of the trade policy debate generally. For some time US opinion, which has tended to set the agenda in recent years, has been moving away from the simple notion that comparative advantage is all that matters and that the best policy is therefore to ensure markets are open and unprotected. The realisation has grown that, for certain industries, other things, such as regulation, matter as much, if not more, to the direction of trade flows. The starting point of this collective enquiry - it includes contributions from nine separate authors - is that natural comparative advantage matters only in the early stages of a product's life and for industries that are highly fragmented. As industries become more concentrated - and entry barriers grow - other forces swing into action. Decisions on location will be taken with regard to what competitors are doing and shifts in government regulation. Sometimes location decisions that no longer make particular sense will not be reversed because companies suffer from inertia. The thesis is tested with reference to a range of industries, from semiconductors and computers to ball-bearings, mineral processing and insurance. One conclusion is that as more companies compete head-to-head in multiple international markets, the more they will gravitate towards similar production locations, trade patterns and technical as well as managerial capabilities. More interesting, though, is the underlying question of which are best equipped to survive the process. The book holds out one piece of advice for companies - that they need to tackle their international and not just their domestic competition. Caterpillar has emerged as one of the survivors in construction equipment, but it had a tendency to worry too much about Dresser and too little about Komatsu. Another conclusion of greater relevance for government policy is that survivors benefit from a strong position in their domestic market. The mistake the US made in telecommunications may have been to de-regulate while other countries did not. Similarly the US has been more open than other countries such as Germany and Japan to non-life insurance. As a result its insurance industry suffers from intense price competition and damaging cyclical swings. In Japan, where the industry is more regulated and local companies control the distribution channels, the cycle is less vicious. Domestic companies have a stronger base from which to expand internationally. One thus begins to see why US trade policy is so concerned with market access. This is fine when it involves a genuine insistance on national treatment - or regulatory policies that do not discriminate against outsiders - and on international co-ordination of the de-regulation process. This kind of question is likely to come up in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if and when it can finally lay the Uruguay Round to rest. Competition policy could well be on the agenda of future rounds. More worrying is the book's lack of emphasis on the multilateral framework. In her chapter on semiconductor trade Laura d'Andrea Tyson, who is now President Clinton's chief economic adviser, glosses over the fact that aspects of the 1986 US semiconductor agreement with Japan were declared illegal by the Gatt. The book conveys the impression that the agreement is a fine example of a government policy directed at influencing the flow of trade. Some US companies resumed production as a result of the agreement while, albeit slowly, foreign penetration of the Japanese market increased. It matters little to Ms Tyson that users of semiconductors in Europe were forced to pay higher prices. That tendency towards bilateralism, however, is a reason for the rest of the world to be careful. This book is good at identifying the issues; it would be even better if it tried to pre-empt the more dangerous conclusions.</p>

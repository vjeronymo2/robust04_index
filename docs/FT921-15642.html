			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Bespak nears Pounds 3m on 46% increase Sales ahead 23 per cent and pre-tax profit increased by 46 per cent were reported by Bespak for the half year to November 1. The group makes specialised valves and other engineering components. As earnings rose from 9.7p to 11.9p per share, the interim dividend is stepped up from 3p to 3.5p on increased capital. From sales of Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 13.3m) operating profit grew 21 per cent helped by revised arrangements with CMB Packaging for the exploitation of a flow-control device, resulting in the release to revenue of Pounds 300,000 pre-paid royalties. Pre-tax profit came to Pounds 2.98m (Pounds 2.04m), boosted by the virtual elimination of interest charges following the rights issue last June.</p>

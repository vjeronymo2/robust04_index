			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F>Language: &lt;f 105&gt; 11  Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Roman Hofbauer, minister of transportation, </F> communications, and public works: "The Storm's Distant Thunder;  Dawns and Dusks of Year 1" -- "abridged" article published in  the weekly SLOVENSKE NARODNE NOVINY, date not given]    [Text] On 17 September 1993 at 0830, the telefax at the  Secretariat of the Ministry of Transportation, Communications,  and Public Works started to churn out a report from an overseas  sender. Initially, I had doubts and thought that the document  might be a forgery. Unfortunately, however, the material was  authentic and its contents deserved attention, because of its  quite peculiar orientation. It was a report by the U.S.  Congress Helsinki Commission for Security and Cooperation in  Europe, [prepared] under the auspices of liaison officer Erika  B. Schlager. The text of the report deserves to be published in  full, not only to document the present, but also for the sake of  history. It documents the concerns of U.S. senators who are, at  the same time, leading representatives of the U.S. Commission  for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Their concern about  freedom and democracy in the state between the Danube river and  the Tatra mountains is all the more remarkable as they probably  never set foot on its territory, which ordinary Americans mostly  confuse with Slovenia or Croatia and which they place somewhere  in the Balkans.    The full text of the report follows:  <H6>  CSCE PRESS REPORT </H6> <H6>  COMMISSION FOR SECURITYAND COOPERATION IN EUROPE </H6>   For immediate circulation    Liaison: Erika B. Schlager    Washington 9 September 1993. Senator Dennis De Concini  (Democrat - Arizona) and Representative Steny H. Hoyer (Democrat  -- Maryland), chairman and deputy chairman of the Helsinki  Commission, have sent the following letter to Peter Burian,  charge d'affaires at the Slovak Embassy in Washington:    ``We feel obliged to voice our concern regarding Slovakia's  continued intolerance for non-Slovak ethnic and religious  communities, as reported in the press. In word and deed,  Slovakia's officials have raised serious doubts about the  state's willingness to observe human rights commitments  voluntarily accepted by the new state as part of the Helsinki  process. The acts and statements of several Slovak government  officials not only give grounds for warranted apprehension about  the security of minorities in Slovakia, but also about the  prospects of democracy itself.    ``For example, the highest officials of the present  government -- including Prime Minister Meciar and Minister of  Culture Dusan Slobodnik -- have repeatedly warned that those who  `slander' the Slovak state or disseminate `erroneous  information' about it, or are not `objective' in their reports,  should be punished or subjected to control. This intimidation  is reminiscent of the legal situation under communism, such as  the well-known ban on `anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda' in  the Soviet Union. Moreover, by systematically defaming the  press, Slovak representatives have taken steps, the clear result  of which is the stifling of freedom of speech. In this context,  the political use of the state subsidies system in converting  the Slovak economy to a market economy comes to our mind  [sentence as published].    ``Moreover, as we have noticed, the general approach of  intolerance is being stepped up. In the course of the last few  weeks, Slovak Minister of Transportation Roman Hofbauer started  a campaign to render impossible the use of the Hungarian  language in traffic signs throughout the state territory.  Leaving aside questions concerning the economic justifiability  of expenditures, this uncompromisingly controlled and highly  centralized manner of governing does not heed the interests of  local communities. This runs counter to specific commitments  undertaken by the Slovak Government upon admission to the  Council of Europe and the general assurances made by Prime  Minister Meciar to Congressman Tom Lantos this spring about a  just approach to minority communities.    ``This week we have heard further disquieting reports.  First, it has been announced that, in his speech at Spisska  Nova Ves, Prime Minister Meciar warned against the high birth  rate in the Romany (Gypsy) community, claiming that `if we are  not going to deal with them, after a while they will deal with  us. We must perceive them as a problematic group that is  constantly growing.' In the light of Slovak deportations of  Romanies to death camps during World War II and the forced  sterilization of Romany women under the postwar communist  regime, these are shocking statements. They are also in sharp  contrast to Slovakia's commitment, adopted at the CSCE forum in  Copenhagen in 1990 and approved by the Slovak Government in  January 1993, `to clearly and unambiguously condemn  totalitarianism, racism and ethnic hatred, anti-Semitism,  xenophobia, and any discrimination, as well as persecution for  religious and ideological beliefs. In this context the  participating states also acknowledge the special problems of  Romanies (Gypsies).'    ``It has also been announced that a U.S. citizen serving in  the Slovak Jewish community -- Rabbi Baruch Myers -- was  assaulted in Bratislava this week. Apparently, the manner of  public pronouncements by representatives of the Slovak  Government about the problems of minorities in the course of  last year might have contributed to an atmosphere that is  conducive to official indifference to racially-motivated  attacks, or even to their toleration. In sum, this development  has seriously disrupted confidence in the process of Slovak  conversion to democracy.    ``The CSCE will meet in Warsaw in a few weeks to discuss  human rights, including questions of CSCE member states'  observance of their commitments. We would welcome by then any  supplementary information on the problems we have outlined.''  <H5>  Cowardly Slovak Charge d'Affaires </H5>   Since the authors of the letter and the report, and  exponents  of the views expounded in them, expressed their interest in any  further information on their assertions (concerns?!), which they  would welcome, a prompt and businesslike reaction was to be  expected from those to whom these alleged problems, which are  actually accusations, were addressed.    The first reaction came from the Slovak charge d'affaires in  Washington (not from our ambassador because, after nine months  of existence as an independent state, our republic still does  not have an appointed ambassador in the world's foremost  superpower). This reaction to the assertions raised was more  than cowardly. He expressed the view that realities in the  Slovak Republic were not as bad as presented in the senators'  viewpoint or as they appear to be, and that intolerance or  anti-Semitism occur, as they do also in other states. Well, the  reaction to the senators' letter, to such grievous accusations  -- accusations, not concerns! -- of our state, our government,  and our supreme constitutional officials was neither fish nor  fowl and almost apologetic. The worldwide dissemination of a  written statement by senior senators of the CSCE committee on  the eve of the drafting and the discussion of a final CSCE  report on human rights in Warsaw and the naming of [Slovak]  constitutional representatives in connection with untrue  assertions extracted from one-sided information sources -- that  has nothing to do with concerns! The diplomatic vocabulary and  the diplomatic code have established very precise rules in this  regard.  <H5>  Silent Foreign Ministry </H5>   The staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the  sovereign  and freely and democratically established Slovak Republic  considered the whole matter settled with the Washington charge  d'affaires' statement. So it seems, at least, for the ministry  itself did not react at all.    I do not like it when anyone associates me, as a member of  the Slovak Government, with alleged permanent Slovak  intolerance, suppression of freedom of speech, ban on the use of  the Hungarian language, deportation of Romanies to death camps,  the forceful sterilization of Romany women, or even toleration  of racially motivated attacks in Slovakia. I therefore assumed  a clear and unequivocal stand on all points in the report.    For the sake of documenting the present for the future, I  consider it warranted to acquaint the public with my reaction.  It is uncommon in the world of diplomacy to make such  correspondence public but, in doing so, I am only following in  the steps of the U.S. senators, whose action went beyond the  framework of diplomatic fairness.  <H5>  My Reaction to the Congressmen's Report </H5>   ``In connection with the report of Senator Dennis D. Concini  (Democrat -- Arizona) and Representative Steny H. Hoyer  (Democrat -- Maryland) of 13 September 1993, intended for the  CSCE, in which the two gentlemen express their apprehensions  about Slovakia's alleged continuous intolerance of non-Slovak  ethnic and religious communities, about alleged punishment and  control of the press with the alleged aim of stifling freedom of  the press, about the transportation minister's alleged campaign  to render impossible the usage of the Hungarian language, about  Prime Minister Meciar's alleged statements directed against the  Romany ethnic group, or about the allegedly racially-motivated  assault on Rabbi Baruch Myers, a U.S. citizen serving in the  Slovak religious community -- I consider it unavoidable to  inform you about the following:    ``1. I think it is deplorable that the aforementioned  gentlemen assume a stand on a state, the existence of which they  are aware only on the basis of tendentious and distorted  arbitrary information. It would be extremely beneficial if they  visited our country personally, to confront their apprehensions  directly with the persons they mention in their report. This  would be the easiest way to convince them that their  apprehensions are based on arbitrary disinformation.    ``2. The Constitution and the entire state legal framework  establish scope for a democratic and free society, to which  intolerance of non-Slovak ethnic groups and religious  communities is alien. The Slovak Republic is the only European  post-communist country that has thoroughly redressed the wrongs  of the past that were committed against all churches. This  redress of wrongs is based on a return to the situation prior to  1948 (communist coup) or 1945. The Jewish religious community  constitutes the only exception; the starting point for  redressing the wrongs committed against it is 2 November 1938,  that is, the date of the occupation of southern Slovakia by  fascist Horthyite Hungary in the wake of the Vienna arbitrage.  Your assertions about Slovakia's continued intolerance are  completely false.    ``3. In respecting the freedom of the press, the government  is basing its policy on Council of Europe Resolution 1003 of 1  July 1993 on journalistic ethics. I am enclosing the text of  this resolution. Unlike journalists in advanced democratic  countries, some representatives of our press confuse reports  with commentaries, facts with hypotheses, arguments with  opinions, and comprehensive information with excerpts torn out  of context. I am of the opinion that the Council of Europe  recommendations concerning this issue are warranted and correct.  I hope that you are of the same opinion.    ``No one in the government can control the press because in  Slovakia there is no censorship. If, however, journalists are  authors of damaging lies, it is possible to seek legal recourse  in conformity with valid laws. Judicial power is independent of  the state in our country. The realization of such steps has  nothing to do with suppressing the freedom of the press but is a  normal legal mechanism of a democratic state, such as is applied  also in other free and democratic states of the world.    ``4. Statements about the `extermination' of the Hungarian  language from Ministry of Transportation road signs are grossly  distorted. In every state there is an established legal  framework for traffic signs that cannot be changed at will and  arbitrarily on the basis of the views of a certain ethnic  community. If such a situation were common in all states, it  would lead to organizational chaos in traffic signs. Even in  the United States there is a large number of traffic signs with  inscriptions, and I did not notice languages of other nations  being used on them. If my observations were inaccurate, I would  welcome more specific details from your side.    ``5. Prime Minister Meciar's alleged statements about the  Romany community were apparently gleaned from the Czech news  agency CTK. Its journalist [Karel] Hirman put into Prime  Minister Meciar's mouth words that he did not utter. Because  slander of this kind is criminally liable in civilized and  democratic states, the prosecuting authorities have initiated  proceedings against him.    ``6. The physical assault on Rabbi Baruch Myers of the  Jewish community was connected with the deplorable growth in  crime in the wake of the opening up of society and had nothing  to do with racial motives. The offenders were three juveniles  who stole Mr. Baruch Myers' characteristic black hat. They were  detained still on the day of the theft and the stolen object was  returned to its owner.    ``I consider it extremely unfortunate that our state is  assessed by persons who have never been in our country and on  the basis of out of context information. Such a course of  action cannot be positively received, also in view of the  methods that had been applied against our country until recently  and that we thought were a matter of the past since 1989.''   <H5>    Assurance That Was Not Kept </H5>   My reaction went to Eleonor Sutter, U.S. charge d'affaires  in  Bratislava, Senators Steny H. Hoyer and Dennis De Concini, the  Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Slovak American  National Council in the United States.    After the intervention of the chairman of the National  Council of the Slovak Republic [Ivan Gasparovic] with those who  prepared the report in the United States, the Slovak side was  assured that, in view of the Slovak side's objections, the  report would not be published. This was presently disavowed, as  confirmed also by the commission's assistant Erika B. Schlager,  and the report was widely distributed to the public. Can it be  considered a coincidence that this happened immediately before  our talks with the World Bank?    One can calmly reason that this is quite an effective point  of departure for levying financial and economic sanctions  against a country that has been questioned in this way.  Sufficient scope is created for intervention by UN troops, with  massive participation by the Marines, in the interest of  protecting human rights and combating racism. Scope is created  for the materialization of the intention to peacefully alter  borders in Central Europe on the basis of arbitrage by the world  powers. He who does not believe this, let him study the U.S.  Congress Helsinki Commission's report about Slovakia to realize  where it is necessary to intervene against evil, in the interest  of the good. The world powers did this twice before, at the  international arbitrages in Munich and Vienna [in September and  November 1938], for the sake of saving peace and calm and in the  interest of addressing the situation of minorities deprived of  their rights. After their "remedial" steps, millions of Czechs  and hundreds of thousands of Slovaks found themselves in the  position of minorities without rights in Germany and Hungary.  Instead of the longed-for peace, the war broke out!  <H5>  Mrs. Schlager's Sources of Information </H5>   I am of the opinion that it is appropriate to stop for a  while to consider a matter of principle -- the sources of  information about the Slovak Republic on which documents of this  kind draw, and to which they refer. In an interview for Radio  Free Europe, Erika B. Schlager said that members of the U.S.  Congress Helsinki Commission are responsible for the preparation  of the aforementioned report.    According to Erika Schlager's information, staffers of  various U.S. Congress offices travelled to Slovakia and their  reports served as a point of departure in preparing the  aforementioned document. Hence, this is not the viewpoint of  private persons but a document expressing views that are close  to the U.S. Administration. The report on Slovakia also draws  on materials sent by various people directly from Slovakia,  materials of unofficial institutions in the United States which  monitor developments in Slovakia, and many articles from various  Slovak newspapers and magazines. Mrs. Schlager, who was in  Slovakia twice, in 1990 and 1992 (!!!), states that the view  that the report's section on minorities is based on clippings  from the Hungarian press is not quite accurate.    There is really nothing to be added to this, except,  perhaps,  for one thing: It suffices to attentively study the senators'  letter and the "apprehensions" concerning democracy and freedom  in Slovakia expressed in it, to very easily identify the press  sources of such reports from Slovakia. These are newspapers  that given their print run, the number of unsold issues, and  attained economic results, should have theoretically gone  bankrupt and perished a long time ago. In spite of that, these  newspapers are prospering, evidently not from their own  resources. It is being said in some circles that the pay of  some of their reporters, who dip their pen in venom and spread  untruths about Slovakia, reaches four digits and not in korunas,  as everyone knows....    Nothing happens of its own accord, without a cause. Let us  identify the aims of this escalated anti-Slovak crusade and we  will come to understand the steps being prepared and realized  and, in particular, their purpose. Let us assert our interests,  our needs, and our plans.    Only, let us do this quickly, effectively, and vigorously.    Our ill-wishers are doing it too!    Current developments within the state and abroad signal the  warranted risk that the Slovak Republic may not live to see the  second anniversary of its independence. It should, and  definitely will, live to see it, however! And not just the  second anniversary but countless further anniversaries, within  the framework of the broad family of sovereign European national  republics.    No nation in the world is better off under foreign rule, no  matter what foreign rule this is, than when it decides on its  affairs itself.    Well, then: Shall we let ourselves be intimidated,  perturbed, divided, and corrupted?! Shall we allow the social  atmosphere to be poisoned by ill-wishers who are full of hatred  and who, not infrequently, wage a struggle for foreign interests  and aims for foreign money?    Or shall we confirm the continuation, along our own path,  into our own promised land? After all, the results achieved in  the brief period of the first year of our statehood are far more  favorable than expected by any world political scientists,  economic experts, and forecasters. We are also facing  considerable problems, which is understandable. We are building  and furnishing the home of our own statehood in conditions of a  deep worldwide economic recession. But just as bad weather can  only improve after some time, depression can only be followed by  prosperity. We are not going to achieve it in a month or two.  We are going to make it, however, provided all of us will  really want it!    The decision is in our hands and our decisions will affect  many generations of our children's children. Let our decisions  be wise.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Supermarkets 'will undercut BP' Supermarket chains Asda and Tesco said last night they would beat any cuts in the price of petrol made by BP, the oil company, which has launched a campaign to win back customers from supermarket filling stations. BP this week unveiled an advertising campaign devised by Mr Joe Johnston, the Hollywood director whose films include Honey I Shrunk the Kids, aimed at reinforcing the message that its petrol stations offer good value for money. It is backing the campaign with a promise to match the price of petrol at supermarket petrol stations, on a town-by-town basis. BP said it was 'fed up with the growth in volume achieved by hypermarkets' and the erosion of its share of the petrol market. But in statements last night both Tesco and Asda said they would undercut any price moves by BP, raising the possibility of a petrol price war. Mr Reg Curtis, Tesco petrol trading manager, said: 'Where we find BP matching the Tesco petrol price we will drop our price. 'Our petrol business is successful because we provide customers with what they want - good quality petrol at the cheapest prices.' Asda said it was 'not going to be undercut by BP'. Mr Laurie Boyle, commercial director, said Asda continued to invest heavily in its petrol business and was 'confident that our customers will continue to enjoy unbeatable value'. Competition between oil companies and retailers has intensified as grocery superstores have built up a 17 per cent share of the petrol market. Tesco recently opened three stand-alone petrol stations in London.</p>

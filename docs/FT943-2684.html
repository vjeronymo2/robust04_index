			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When nil is not negligible Under section 24(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, when an asset has become of negligible value, what is the advantage of claiming that the asset has been sold and re-acquired at the specified value? Can't it be claimed simply that it has a negligible value? Is negligible value the same as 'nil' value for CGT purposes? Section 24(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 says: 'If, on a claim by the owner of an asset, the inspector is satisfied that the value of an asset has become negligible, he may allow the claim; and, thereupon, this act shall have effect as if the claimant had sold, and immediately re-acquired, the asset for consideration of an amount equal to the value specified in the claim.' As you will see, the claimant has to specify his estimate of the asset's present value in the claim. No, 'negligible' does not mean 'nil': there is a contrast between the phrase 'the value . . . has become negligible', in section 24(2), and the phrase 'becomes valueless' in section 146(2). Both phrases originated in the Finance Act 1965, so parliament's intention to distinguish between negligible values and zero value is beyond question. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

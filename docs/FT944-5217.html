			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Arts: Bad behaviour? Moi? - Sandra Bernhard on the South Bank Halfway through Sandra Bernhard's performance at the Royal Festival Hall she reads out a letter from a fan who has renounced her devotion: she had been to a Bernhard concert, where, instead of watching her idol lead the attack of the Lesbian Front against the barricades of straight society, she was forced to endure Bernhard's singing. The disillusioned dyke bewailed the fact that the most starry icon of her tribe was a performer first and an activist only in the dreams of her admirers. My letter to Bernhard would be equally bigoted - stick to singing and cut the reveries. They are too predictably camp, sending up with phoney enthusiasm such sitting ducks as the intellectual powers of supermodels and the fantasy of true romance. Sing, Bernhard, sing Bernhard, sing. Sandy B, as she tags herself, cannot fail to impress. Over six feet tall, she has the face of Mick Jagger and the dress sense of a nymphomaniac. No wonder her slowly remorseless version of 'Sympathy For The Devil' brings Lucifer into the auditorium more potently than the Rolling Stones original. Sandra Bernhard must be one of the last people you would dare to follow down a dark alley. With a suitably cowed and passive band she presents a unique act; there is no British equivalent of a singer who spends most of her act swearing at the audience, chasing hares, and subverting society - all done in the seductive voice of a siren. There is little quality control and Bernhard's own songs are beacons of self-indulgence, but she cleverly repackages familiar material. Using 'Stairway To Heaven' as an intro to 'Fifty Ways To Leave Your Lover' is a particular delight. Anyone so belligerently materialistic has problems making a crowd love her, but the audience was determined to enjoy this oh-so-modern phenomenon, the woman famous for being famous. She comes across as too idiosyncratic for her own good - but possesses a voice that will keep many more tedious performers in clover. Sandra Bernhard's current show is billed as 'excuses for bad behaviour': the excuses being, 'me, me, me.' It is fun to watch such a stylish egomaniac at a safe distance for a short time, but must be a burden to have to live with such trendiness.</p>

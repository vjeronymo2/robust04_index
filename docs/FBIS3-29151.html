			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata predicted Tuesday [15 February] that foreign exchange  markets, where the yen has been surging against the U.S. dollar,  will naturally return to normal.    Hata told a press conference he thinks the currency markets  will naturally return to normal as Japanese monetary authorities  make close contacts with their counterparts in other countries.  He said such a rapid surge in the yen against the dollar will  greatly affect the lives of people in the United States.    Hata also criticized some comments by U.S. officials  approving a higher yen against the dollar, saying those who have  posts which could exert great influence on markets should be  cautious in making comments.</p>

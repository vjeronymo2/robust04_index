			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Computers that put the 'face' into interface: A race to apply the personal touch to the world of information technology There may be someone new in your future. You will be able to choose the appearance, name and personality of this new companion and nobody, not even your spouse, should raise any objections, even if you take it home with you. This 'person', who you may be spending many hours with, will be a computer 'agent', an electronically created personality that acts as your personal assistant; arranging meetings, finding information, making travel arrangements and reminding you that it is time to pay the phone bill, get the car serviced or send a birthday card to your mother. And when you are tired after a long day at work, you can look forward to coming home to find that he or she has recorded television programmes selected to match your tastes and ordered your favourite dinner to be delivered. It may sound too good to be true. But not if the visions of some of the world's largest computer and telecommunications companies are realised. By 2000, the 'personal' in personal computing could take on a very different meaning. Making computers companionable will require some big advances in semiconductor, communications and computer software, but already the electronics industry is moving forward rapidly on several fronts. International Business Machines, for example, has several projects under way to develop what it calls 'human interfaces' for computers; speech recognition technology that will enable a computer to comprehend spoken commands and visualisation techniques that could be used to give the computer a human-like 'face'. IBM recently demonstrated this technology by creating a computer-version of its vice-chairman, Mr Jack Kuehler, who engaged in a mock conversation with his computer-simulated image. Apple Computer is also in the forefront of making computers more 'user friendly'. This year it will launch its first 'Newton' product, which it calls a 'personal digital assistant', a pocket-sized device that can be used to send hand-written messages electronically and keep track of your personal diary and notes. Competing with Apple is a group of companies including AT&amp;T, Matsushita of Japan, and Olivetti of Japan, which is backing EO, a Silicon Valley venture that has launched a 'personal communicator' a device that combines a computer and a cellular telephone. Wireless communications systems that extend cellular technology to allow electronic handsets to send or retrieve messages 'anytime, anywhere' are a critical element of this new world. So too is digital technology which converts electronic signals into binary codes. Digital systems store a much larger amount of data than existing analogue systems and process the data much more quickly. Motorola, one of the leaders in communications technology, has formed an international alliance with telecommunications companies from the US, Europe and Asia to help fund Iridium, an ambitious Dollars 3.8bn satellite system that would provide global wireless communications. In the US, Ardis and Ram Mobile Data are building competing national wireless data networks. Such wireless networks could free office workers from their telephones and facsimile machines and enable them to take their work with them wherever they care to go. Yet if you see yourself conducting business while basking on the beach of some remote island, keep in mind that in the future you may not want to stray too far from an 'information superhighway'; a fibre optic cable that can transmit video signals as well as voice and text messages. US telephone and cable television companies are rushing to build these high  -speed data channels. In California, for example, Pacific Bell, a regional telephone company, has announced plans to provide such a service to nearly half of the residents of the state within the next decade and to all Californian homes by 2015. Over the next 18 months, the company will begin trials of services such as 'movies on demand', video games, home shopping and tele-education. The prospect of enhanced communications services has set off a race to provide devices that will connect to these new networks. Intel, the leader in microprocessor chips - the 'brains' inside a computer - is working with Microsoft, the leading personal computer software company, and General Instruments, a supplier of cable television control boxes, to develop a decoder device that will take the signals from the information superhighway and display them on a television set. General Magic, another Silicon Valley company which is developing software for personal communicators, calls the approach 'whole person' computing. Computers should be fun to use, not devices that try the patience and test the technical acumen of users, the company maintains. Not everyone will be excited at the prospect of having vast quantities of information available at their fingertips whether it be the 500 TV channels promised by cable companies or instant access to libraries full of publications over the phone. People are already inundated with information from newspapers, television, junk mail, facsimile and telephone messages. But this is where the friendly computer 'agent' comes in. Your electronic assistant will filter all your messages, throw away the 'junk' and sort the rest according to your priorities.</p>

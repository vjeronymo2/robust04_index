			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Japanese bio-tech group to list in US Biomaterial, a bio-technology company based in western Japan, plans to list on Nasdaq, the US over-the-counter stock market. It will be the first Japanese company to bypass the domestic stock market for a listing on an overseas stock exchange. The move will increase anxiety among Japanese financial authorities over the 'hollowing out' of the country's capital markets. The company, backed by the government's venture capital programme, maintained that Japan's listing requirements were too stringent for start-up companies and it was seeking a wider investor base in the US. Biomaterial, which develops and produces stabiliser equipment for anti-pollution bacteria, said listing on the domestic over-the-counter exchange was impossible for high-growth companies, since corporations are required to post Y10 or more in earnings per share and to have net assets of Y200m or more. The company, which was established in 1992 and expects pre-tax losses of Y220m (Dollars 1.99m) this business year, plans to start providing information to US investors next month, for a listing on Nasdaq in 1996. Industry analysts say other small companies are likely to follow suit, since the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is encouraging the diversification of funding options among start-up companies. The move comes as criticism of Japan's over-regulated financial markets is heightening. Due to high capital gains tax, domestic investors are trading Japanese stocks on overseas stock exchanges. The rise in demand for Japanese stocks among leading US, European and Asian investors has provided further incentive for Japanese companies to seek funds abroad. Government officials are also concerned at the possible deterioration of Japan's status as a financial centre. The Tokyo stock exchange, which has been facing a sharp decline in listings of overseas companies, is looking at ways to stop the outflow and increase new company listings, while Japan's Ministry of Finance said it was about to launch a study of the outflow of activity from the Tokyo market.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 13 (CTK) -- The majority of Czech  citizens declare themselves supporters of the political centre,  a poll conducted by the Institute for Public Opinion Research  (IVVM) on April 28 to May 6 among 946 people over 15 showed.  Although most Czechs are still orientated to the right, a shift  towards the centre or left of the centre continues, the poll  revealed. According to the IVVM, such development is connected  with a repeated fall in voter preferences of the Civic  Democratic Party (ODS), the strongest party in the government  coalition.    Only five percent of those polled declared themselves  supporters of extreme right parties and only 2 percent said they  support extreme left parties. Thirty-three percent of the  respondents see themselves to be at the political centre.    Followers of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia  (KSCM), the Left Bloc Party (LB) and the Democratic Left Party  (SDL) are mostly left-orientated. As regards the Czech Social  Democratic Party (CSSD) none of its potential voters declared  themselves supporters of extreme left while 75 percent of them  support either left of the centre or centre parties.    The ODS's potential voters traditionally stand unambiguously  on the right spectrum of the political scene, while followers of  the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the Christian Democratic  Union- Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), both government  coalition parties, mostly declared themselves supporters the  right-centre spectrum.</p>

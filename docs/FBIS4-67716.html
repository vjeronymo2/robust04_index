			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. Lipikhin under the "News" rubric: "Conflict </F> at the Ambulance Service"]    [Text] A group of Ambulance Service workers has announced  its intent to strike. Moscow residents know that this is not the  first attempt of the people in the white coats to resort to  extreme measures. Newspapers reported on conflict situations at  the ambulance service two years ago. And what is the reason for  today's discord? First, a portion of the collective has come  out against the imminent reorganization of the ambulance service  and emergency medical service. Second, the ambulance service  workers believe that their service is not receiving adequate  attention from Moscow's government. Is this so?    In just nine months of the past year, the Main Medical  Administration spent an additional 2.34 million rubles to  increase the wages of the ambulance service's personnel,  8,856,000 rubles to insure the lives of the service's workers,  and 84,811,000 rubles to feed them. Each worker sent on a call  is provided with special clothing. And that costs nearly 100,000  rubles. The money was allocated systematically, beginning in  January 1993 when the ruble "hovered" much higher than now.    By directive of Moscow's mayoralty, seven substations will  be  built in 1994-1995 in rayons of new construction, and an  additional 13 substations and 4 base garages are slated to  become operational by 1998.    Still unresolved is the question of supplying the ambulance  service with vehicles. In the past 2 years, the motor vehicle  combine of the Moscow Administration of Motor Medical Transport  [Mosavtosantrans] received a total of 65 vehicles for the  ambulance service. And that's what they got even though each  year about 400 vehicles become unsuitable for operation. As a  result, each day there are 160 to 200 vehicles out of service.  Why has so critical a situation come about?    The problem is that the RAF [expansion not given] microbuses  for the ambulance service are manufactured in the Baltics. They  must be paid for in foreign exchange -- and in no small amount.  And according to specialists' estimates, they can serve a total  of 4 years and 7 months. That is in theory. In practice, the  little RAFs break down after 1 1/2 or 2 years of operation.    To solve the problem of providing transport vehicles for the  ambulance service, Moscow's government has sought the means to  buy 220 Mercedes vehicles. Twenty of them are already in  operation in the city, and beginning in February, another 10  vehicles will begin operating in Moscow every day. Furthermore,  the matter of purchasing the medical version of the RAF microbus  is not being decided.    But as far as strikes are concerned, no one has yet  abolished  the Criminal Code article regarding responsibility for failure  to provide medical assistance.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Europe endures cycle of price pressures  -Capital &amp; Credit It has been the same pattern for months now: each time Europe's bond markets edge cautiously higher after a bout of weakness, they get battered by another wave of selling pushing prices to new lows. Last week, European government bond markets were subjected to their latest pummeling, with Germany leading the way. By Friday, the yield on the 10-year benchmark bund had vaulted to 6.87 per cent, from 6.47 per cent a week earlier. Europe's other markets have been dragged down by the German sell-off, and stock markets have followed. Early in the year, it was the US Fed's monetary tightening which prompted the sell-off in world bond markets. And while US Treasuries dragged European bonds lower, Europe managed to outperform the US during that period. Now, Europe is racked by its own worries, and is underperforming the US. This puzzles many observers, who feel European bond markets are defying their bond-positive fundamentals of declining inflation and slow economic growth, accompanied by continued cuts in short-term interest rates. The latest wave of selling was triggered by comments from Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer which were taken to mean that German, and by extension European, interest rates don't have much further to fall. The futures market began pricing in monetary tightening as early as December, with the three-month Euromark contract discounting German three-month interest rates at 5.2 per cent by year-end, up from the current 5.05 per cent. The Bundesbank's cancellation of its scheduled auction of four-year treasury bills on Wednesday sent further shudders through the markets, raising fears that Bonn was having problems finding takers for its massive debt programme. Moreover, some countries seem to be staging stronger-than-expected economic come-backs which, with rising commodity prices, have reinforced fears of a pick-up in inflation and higher interest rates. Battered by wave after wave of selling, shell-shocked investors have fled to the sidelines, holding most of their funds in short-term instruments which are protected against price swings at the long end of the yield curve. 'The psychology is incredibly weak - some people who used to be really confident players are now saying they're nervous, confused and unsure where to go,' said Mr John Hall, head of European interest rate research at Swiss Bank Corporation. Banks' proprietary trading desks and hedge funds have also scaled down operations, shying away from the volatility that has been plagueing markets for months. However, many analysts feel the gloom has been overdone, and while few see a strong recovery, some expect a period of consolidation, interspersed with some trading rallies. Many still pin their hopes on the Bundesbank, which is expected to continue lowering its securities repurchase rate over the summer, even if it leaves its official rates unchanged. Indeed, Mr Tietmeyer on Friday clarified that his recent comments referred only to official rates, not the repo rate. 'Money market rates must be free to move within the bands (set by the Lombard and discount rates) and that naturally includes the repo rate,' he said. The discount rate stands at 4.5 per cent and the repo rate is at 5.20 per cent. 'Once people realise the Bundesbank is continuing to ease, that could bring some life back into the market,' says Mr Werner Kramer, bond strategist at DB Research in Frankfurt. But he warns any recovery is likely to be 'gradual, with the danger of setbacks'. While Mr Kirit Shah, international strategist at First Chicago, feels the bearish trend remains intact, he recommends buying 10-year bunds as their yield approaches 7 per cent. 'This offers good support, and there is a reasonable chance that yields will head back to 6 1/2 per cent.' However, even if Europe returns to calmer waters as the Bundesbank continues its cautious easing policy, it will remain prone to transatlantic shocks - as last Friday showed. The upward revision of first-quarter US GDP sent Treasuries tumbling, dragging Europe sharply lower. 'Europe is still very much tracking the US, where monetary policy is still not seen to be in neutral,' says Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets. With most European countries having to fund hefty budget deficits, supply pressures also won't help markets. 'The auctions schedules will remain burdensome in the absence of stronger investor participation, and supply will exert further upward pressure on real yields in an environment of economic recovery and reductions in liquidity,' says Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at SG Warburg. In the current environment, Mr Hall at SBC suggests buying two- to three-year German debt which, he says, 'still offers very, very good value' after the recent sell-off at the short end. For medium-term investors, he recommends buying bunds around current levels.</p>

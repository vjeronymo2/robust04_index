			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting Continental European companies have long adjusted their accounts to show a steady growth in reported earnings. The absence of hidden reserves in the UK may limit the scope for smoothing, but not the desire. Until they were curtailed by the Financial Reporting Standard 3 (FRS3), management latitude to classify items as exceptional or extraordinary left opportunities to massage earnings figures. According to research by Vivien Beattie of the University of Southampton and others, due to be published soon in the Journal of Business Finance, particular types of companies have a weakness for smoothing. Those with volatile earnings try to even out the figures to make their profits appear more consistent and thus more highly valued by the market. If dividend cover is low, smoothing may help generate the impression that the payment can be maintained. And while managers with options might be thought to favour share price volatility, their interest is better served by a smoothly rising share price and high market rating. Ownership and control are also important. If the shares are widely spread, managers are tempted to smooth and improve the company's rating. Only when management owns a substantial equity stake does the habit die out. All of this is driven by the desire to remain in control and get richer. Interestingly, although incentives such as share options are intended to identify managers interests more closely with shareholders, they may not be effective; managers seem to account differently when they actually are owners. And if self-interest is one determinant of accounting policy, the drive to smooth earnings is unlikely to be stopped by FRS3. The methods, though, may get more crafty.</p>

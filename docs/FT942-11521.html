			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Unilever focuses AGM on copycats Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, used yesterday's AGM to vent its irritation at the emergence of so-called copycat brands, which closely imitate brand name packaging, but undercut on price. Sir Michael Perry, chairman, said: 'I have no objection to sitting at the same table as my competitors - but I do object to them eating off my plate.' The issue is of concern to Unilever when it faces tighter competition in the US, combined with recession in continental Europe, and its soap war with US rival Procter &amp; Gamble. Sir Michael spoke of the investment Unilever has put into the development of brand name products, and the fact that their brand identity was legally protected throughout Europe, with the exception of the UK. Unilever, which has been joined by other industrial groups such as Coca Cola and even Procter, is attempting to persuade the UK government to prohibit what it considers to be unfair competition. So far, the government has opted not to extend trademark legislation to prevent lookalikes. Unilever has reflected the current operating environment by unveiling a Pounds 490m restructuring which should achieve annual cost savings of Pounds 240m. The US has been a main focus of cuts, as Unilever has been losing the detergent battle with Procter, but Sir Michael was anxious to emphasise detergents were 25 per cent of US sales, and only 4 per cent of group profits. However, this has spilled into Europe, with the row with Procter over Unilever's new range of concentrated washing powders. Sir Michael said this was 'already on sale in the Netherlands, and it is going very very well'. Some Pounds 26m will be spent on 'supporting' Persil Power - Unilever's new super-concentrated washing powder - in the UK this year, and Pounds 100m has been invested in production facilities. Unilever's legal action in the Netherlands to gag the perceived Procter campaign against the product has thus taken on critical importance. Yesterday was the retirement day for Mr Floris Maljers, vice-chairman, who has also been chairman of Unilever NV since 1984. He is being replaced in both positions by Mr Morris Tabaksblat.</p>

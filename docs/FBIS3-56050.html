			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel I. Ivanov (according to footnote, "The </F> author of these remarks is a colonel with the General Staff.  For obvious reasons, we have decided to change his name") under  the "Letters from Garrisons and Staffs" rubric: "In the  Corridors of Military Power: General Vanity" -- from issue No.  1 of "People's Army" section, described as "special issue for  Russia's soldiers"]    [Text] Arbat Square. A high white-marble building with  oak doors, a large contingent of armed guards. Few people have  an opportunity to take a look here. And even fewer have the  slightest general idea of what is actually happening here, what  processes are under way, and where they might lead. Meanwhile  our fellow citizens -- the taxpayers, in the West's parlance --  are entitled to know all this.    Right from the first few weeks of the Russian defense  department's existence, the incumbent minister took a fancy to  repeating that its apparatus would be significantly cut back.  But what do we actually have today? The following figures were  published not so long ago: Whereas in Yazov's time the Union  Ministry of Defense had about 6,000 staffers, under Grachev  their number has increased by a factor of 1.5 to almost 9,000.  But even these "official" data are hardly credible. Because  the numerical strength not just of the Ministry of Defense, but  also of the Army as a whole is so secret that, in all  likelihood, neither the minister, not his deputies, nor the  president's advisers have any precise information.    Some six or eight weeks ago, presidential adviser D.  Volkogonov said in an interview with ARGUMENTY I FAKTY that the  Russian Army's numerical strength was 1.8 million men. In the  last few days of last year, Colonel General M. Kolesnikov, chief  of the Armed Forces General Staff, claimed in the newspaper  SEGODNYA that our Army numbers 2.1 million men. At a press  conference held literally the next day, General P. Grachev cited  what he described as absolutely accurate figures -- 2.341  million men.... You must agree that this difference of 241,000  is quite a serious matter. It appears that the minister of  defense has "found" 24 divisions somewhere, while the chief of  General Staff has "lost" them.... You must agree: When there  are such blatant discrepancies in the data used by the Army's  top men, where is the certainty that they have accurately  counted their apparatus? Thus, instead of 9,000, there might be  10,000 or even 12,000....    How was the concept of the current Ministry of Defense  conceived and implemented? It was planned that, in  organizational terms, the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense  would comprise the General Staff and command and control organs  subordinate either to deputy ministers of defense or directly to  the minister. It ought to be specifically mentioned at this  point that the process of forming the Russian Federation  Ministry of Defense was left almost entirely at the military  department's discretion. This gave a completely free hand to  the top generals (who resurfaced in the wake of the August 1991  events), enabling them not only to retain as many subdivisions  as possible but also to create new ones. Even when the  expediency of doing so was doubted by individual functionaries  of the presidential or government apparatus or the Security  Council. Incidentally, the control they exercised over the  creation and reformation of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Defense proved to be formal and ineffective.    Grachev launched "cutbacks" in the Ministry of Defense by  increasing the number of his deputies. Never before in the  Russian Army's entire history has the military minister had as  many direct deputies as Pavel Sergeyevich has today -- seven, to  be precise! Each one of them, of course, has his own apparatus.    Back in the past, Andrey Kokoshin's appearance in the  ministry with the rank of first deputy minister of defense  prompted sharp debates among the professional military.  According to logic, this appointment should have symbolized a  "weakening of the militarist spirit" and the stepping up of the  military department's openness to civilian society. Kokoshin  was assigned responsibility for implementing a new  military-technical policy, organizing research and development,  and ordering arms and military equipment. Since time  immemorial, these matters have been decided by the General Staff  in its capacity as the Armed Forces' "think tank," which  actually determined the nature of the Army and the way it ought  to be armed. The separation of these two functions was absurd  from its very inception.    Many top generals in the military department admit that,  during the 18 months of its existence, the influence exercised  by Kokoshin's lot on military-technical policy in the Armed  Forces has been identical to "the influence of a fly on the  speed of a train rushing downhill." The reason is that  virtually all projects of military-technical policy concerning  the planning and coordination of research and development, the  planning of series-production orders and long-term research in  the sphere of new technologies, and mainly the actual  implementation of plans, have been swept aside like houses of  cards by the gigantic avalanche of financial shortages and the  downfall of the defense industry and its scientific and  technical potential (to almost 50 percent of its former level!).    Judge for yourselves: How can we talk of work efficiency in  view of the facts that not a single ship's hull was laid last  year, that only one of the almost 40 latest combat helicopters  that the troops need so badly has been delivered, that the  Russian Federation Air Force has not been allocated even 20  percent of the combat craft it needs, and that the manufacture  of aircraft for the Military Transport Aviation has come to a  virtual halt? The ministry does not even have the money to pay  for the reconditioning of old equipment. Everything that  Kokoshin showed to journalists during his publicity trips to  test sites and design bureaus had been conceived and implemented  long before he arrived at the Ministry of Defense.  Unfortunately, during the 18 months of its existence, the work  efficiency of this newly formed apparatus has not undergone a  single in-depth audit, and it has been mainly bogged down in the  preparation of many hundreds of papers, instructions, and  directives, most of which have remained unimplemented due to the  agonizing state of the military-industrial complex.    The duplication of functional duties is typical of the  organization of many of the present ministry's structures.  Hence the excessive inflation of their staffs. The authors of  the Ministry of Defense table of organization applied a flawed  principle: They first created the directorate and only  afterwards defined its tasks. Moreover, they lost sight of the  logic of building up all the department's "stories."    The General Staff, for example, has a specialized  directorate  that is in charge of nuclear policy problems. It also has the  Center for Military-Strategic Studies, whose attention is also  focused on "nuclear" questions. But the Ministry of Defense  structure also incorporates the National Nuclear Risk Reduction  Center. The absurdity of such parallelism is obvious. It is  also very expensive for the state, since all the aforementioned  subdivisions employ a total of about 300 staffers -- several  dozens of whom are generals. And yet, according to the opinion  of competent specialists from the General Staff, the tasks of  these structures could be tackled with equal efficiency by just  one directorate with a total staff of some 60-70 officers.    There are quite a few examples of parallelism between  Ministry of Defense and General Staff structures. We have  already said that the General Staff includes the Center for  Military-Strategic Studies. Its very name indicates that the  subdivision in question -- by dint of the fact that it is part  of the Armed Forces' "think tank" and by the nature of its  activity -- cannot disregard questions of military  organizational development or, consequently, questions of  military reform. This is because reform is a strategic question  of military organizational development at the present stage.  But a Directorate of Military Organizational Development and  Reform, directly subordinate to the minister, was also created  on the initiative of the minister himself. Incidentally, it is  as secret as the General Staff's Main Intelligence Directorate  [GRU] when it comes to monitoring by structures of state power.  It is no accident that it is also dubbed a ministry within the  ministry. Many people in the military department today have  realized with absolute clarity that this directorate is nothing  but a decorative superstructure. The General Staff's scientific  potential is sufficiently high to enable it to resolve with much  greater efficiency the selfsame tasks that the minister has seen  fit to assign to an "alien" structure.    Colonel General Boris Gromov, deputy minister of defense, is  in charge of the Directorate for Implementation of Military  Cooperation Programs with CIS member states. Another deputy  minister of defense is, in parallel, in charge of the  Directorate for International Military Cooperation which, in its  turn, comprises an impressive number of directorate staffers.  The selfsame deputy minister is also in charge of the  International Treaty Directorate. A total of, once again,  several hundred highly paid staffers who very frequently resolve  identical tasks.... All these numerous directorates,  duplicating one another, justify their existence by means of  constant frenetic activity, which boils down to useless  shuffling of cadres, offices, and subdivisions.    Ask any staffer of the Ministry of Defense or the General  Staff what he has found most tiring in the recent past. You  will get a unanimous answer: The endless organizational and  cadre reshuffles. One main directorate chief admitted that  people are already fed up with moving from one office to another  and compiling sundry statutes, job descriptions, and  instructions. Over the last 18 months, some Ministry of Defense  directorates have undergone three or even four changes of their  structure, name, job descriptions, subordination, and numerical  strength.    The Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Main Directorate  for Work with Personnel is in the throes of its umpteenth  fundamental reformation. This time, evidently, due to the fact  that quite a few Army votes were cast for Zhirinovskiy. But  this is not the sole reason for the perceived need to disband or  reduce this directorate. There is also the following reason:  "Soldiers cannot be educated from Moscow." By extension of  this logic, it can also be claimed that troops cannot be  commanded from Moscow.    Here is another interesting question, often asked by  taxpayers: Why is it that, despite the constant claims by  military authorities that the Army and the Ministry of Defense  are being cut back, the number of generals in the Armed Forces  and the military department itself is steadily growing? There  have been reports that Russia's 2 million-strong Army today has  500 generals more than the 4 million-strong Soviet Army. Do you  recall how, literally a few days before the April referendum,  the president signed an edict awarding general's rank to almost  150 officers.... Not a single army in the world today has so  few soldiers per general as the Russian Army.    Today it can be boldly asserted that the absence of real  reforms in Russia's Ministry of Defense, the mindless piling of  some structures' functions onto others, and the unjustified  inflation of staff strengths and the number of generals are the  direct consequence of the lack of monitoring of the Ministry of  Defense leadership's actions. The Ministry of Defense has  remained, just as it has always been, "a law unto itself," a  mysterious and inaccessible fortress in the heart of Moscow and  Russia. It remains in the grips of cadre and management  overstaffing, with generals manning the telephones of top  chiefs, reading official mail, and being in charge of desk  allocation, carpets, and light bulbs. This can be seen in the  apparatus of Pavel Grachev himself, where the chief of  secretariat (his office, in common parlance) wears a general's  stars. And yet his work could be successfully tackled by an  ensign or even a civilian employee. Or the office of secretary  of the Ministry of Defense Collegium. Do you actually need a  general to telephone all Collegium members and notify them of  the time of the next session and then compile an account of its  proceedings?    So far there has not been even a hint, as the saying goes,  of  proper reforms in Russia's Ministry of Defense. This is what  has happened so far: The military department's table of  organization has been redrawn on several occasions, the names of  various structures have been changed, unsuitable men have been  displaced and "their own" have replaced them. Incidentally, it  ought to be especially emphasized that a primitive purge of  unsuitable men from the apparatus is taking place under the  guise of the ministry's reformation. Dozens of most experienced  professionals -- colonels and generals -- have been taken off  the ministry's strength in 1993 and subsequently dismissed. A  similar purge is also expected now, in view of the fact that the  Army and many honest officers -- cadre military men --  demonstrated their scorn for the incumbent reformers at the  elections.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Patten US plea on China trade Hong Kong's governor, Mr Chris Patten, urged the US yesterday to renew normal trade status for China as a way of promoting further economic and political reforms there, Reuter reports from Washington. Mr Patten, in a speech at the National Press Club, said both reform in China and Hong Kong's economy would be hurt if the US withdrew China's most-favoured-nation trade status or attached tough conditions to its renewal next year. President Bill Clinton is expected next month to link MFN renewal for China to improvements in human rights and curbing weapons proliferation, among other things. During last year's campaign, Mr Clinton repeatedly urged such conditions, attacking then-president George Bush for 'coddling' China's rulers.</p>

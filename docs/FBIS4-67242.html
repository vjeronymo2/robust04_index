			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina Cruz] </F>   [Text] Federal Judicial Police personnel detailed to  Guerrero State uncovered a clandestine laboratory for processing  and refining opium gum into heroin, seizing a shipment of 5,500  grams of the narcotic, worth an estimated 35 million new pesos.  During the operation, conducted in the municipality of Eduardo  Neri and complying with a search warrant issued by the first  district judge of criminal proceedings, with headquarters in  Chilpancingo, the federal forces arrested a presumed drug  trafficker.    According to the briefing report submitted to the Federal  Judicial Police general director, Adrian Carrera Fuentes, by the  force's deputy commissioner in Guerrero State, Jose Pulido  Marin, the processing center was located at No. 10 Allende  Street, in the San Sebastian district of the settlement of  Zumpango del Rio. The action followed several investigations of  chemicals arriving at that domicile, and of strong odors emitted  there at night.    With the data collected by federal agents, the federal  social  representative requested that the pertinent judge grant a search  warrant to inspect the domicile. When implemented, it enabled  them to discover the clandestine laboratory, where they captured  the presumed drug dealer identified as Enrique Dimas Gonzalez,  with 35 million new pesos' worth of drugs in his possession.    During the execution of the judicial warrant, the agent of  the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, accompanied by the  aforementioned court's clerk, noted the presence of a loaded  7.65-caliber squad pistol, a 22-caliber rifle, and 21 useful  22-caliber cartridges.    Commander Marin also reported that various implements were  found on the site, such as trays, jugs containing alcohol, bags  of coarse and fine salt, two fumigators, a galvanized vat, and  adhesive tape for wrapping the packages of heroin.    Moreover, the federal social representative confiscated a  late-model pickup truck with Guerrero State registration, also  carrying metal containers used in the aforementioned laboratory.    In connection with this case, the representative of the  Attorney General's Office in the state, Joel Ortiz Hernandez,  stressed that an investigation is being made of the possible  participation of other persons presumably assigned to transport  the narcotic to the U.S. drug market. He noted that, had they  done so, thousands of doses would have been put into circulation.</p>

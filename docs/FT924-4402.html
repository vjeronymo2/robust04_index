			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Difficulties seen in sale of Fluor lead unit BANKERS and analysts suggested yesterday that Fluor Corporation, the US-based international engineering group, would have great difficulty disposing of its Doe Run subsidiary, America's biggest integrated lead business. 'Doe Run has been up for sale for about four years and I doubt if they will find a buyer now,' said one banker. 'The price has come down considerably in recent months - Fluor is practically giving it away. But lead is not a business people want to be in, particularly in the US.' Fluor said on Monday it would take a charge of about Dollars 95m to 1992 net earnings to cover the cost of the disposition of Doe Run. This included an loss after tax of Dollars 17m. Mr Jeffrey Zelms, Doe Run's president, said various methods for Fluor to divest itself of his company would be considered during the next year. These might include outright sale to a third party, a management buy-out, a sale of Doe Run shares to the public or a distribution of shares to existing Fluor shareholders. Fluor has retained Merrill Lynch as investment adviser. Mr Zelms said the Dollars 95m charge included a reserve for clean-up obligations related to Doe Run's past operations while 'we believe we are regularly improving the situation so as to keep clean-up costs to a minimum'. Doe Run owns six mines, four mills and two smelters. A strike at its Herculaneum smelter since July 30 has cut production to 50 to 60 per cent of capacity. Mr Euan Worthington, head of mining research at S. G. Warburg Securities, said a pound of lead was cheaper than a pound of potatoes. 'No one wants to produce it. But one day the price will rise and when, for example, people have to pay Dollars 300 each for lead-acid batteries to keep their cars going, they will understand lead is an essential metal.'</p>

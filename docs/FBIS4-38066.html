			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Limor Ressler] </F>   [Text] A sixth police district -- the Judaea and Samaria  District -- was inaugurated today. It will be made up of two  subdistricts: the Judaea and the Samaria subdistricts. Police  Minister Shahal, who presented the rank of commander to Alex  Ron, who will head the new district, said that Israel recognizes  the need to deal with routine security among both the Jewish and  the Arab sectors in Judaea and Samaria. Minister Shahal said  that the manpower being transferred to the new district will  come at the expense of the Israel Police. Border Police forces  will also join the new district. The headquarters of the new  Judaea and Samaria District has been set up in Ra's al-'Amud in  East Jerusalem, and when Commander Alex Ron enters next week, he  will find a headquarters that has already begun to operate.</p>

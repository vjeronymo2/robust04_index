			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov; from the </F> "Commonwealth Update" program]    [Text] Statements by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev that countries of the CIS and the Baltic states are  regions of Russian vital interests had a somewhat strange  response in Washington. A State Department spokesman said the  United States wished to get explanations. Explanations were  given, yet some feeling of perplexity over the first response  remains. Vladislav Kozyakov has been looking into the matter  and has written the following:    What we found surprising was the haste with which the  American official spokesman expressed his displeasure with the  Russian minister's statement. The State Department spokesman  did not have the full text of Andrey Kozyrev's statement made at  a Moscow conference on Russian policy on the territory of the  former USSR. All he had was brief reports for news agencies.  That, however, did not stop him from reproaching Russian  policy. Moreover, the American official interpreted quite  freely Kozyrev's statement about the need of a Russian military  presence in the territory and even claimed it contradicted what  the Russian spokesman said at the recent summit in Moscow.    But where has this hasty desire to put to doubt the  political  course of Russia come from? This question is to the point to  ask, especially in the light of the Moscow summit, which was  marked by a further strengthening of the Russian-American  partnership. Washington's hasty response to Andrey Kozyrev's  statement can serve as a reminder that even at the current  high-level of cooperation between Moscow and Washington, the  American side sometimes displays signs of the past policy of  double standards. The realities of today, when the CIS has  emerged in the territory of the former Soviet Union and when the  Baltic independent states have come into existence, have quite a  few specific features. One of the most important is to preserve  centuries-old contacts between Russia and its immediate  neighbors. It is therefore natural that Moscow regards them as  a region of primary vital interest.    Incidentally, the Americans also have such a notion. For  example, they include into the zone of their national interest  the countries of Central America and the Caribbean basin. On  these grounds, as is known, the United States resorted to  military intervention, for example, in Panama, Grenada, and a  number of other countries. The United States has imposed a  trade blockade and used other sanctions against some of the  countries of that region. As for Russia, it builds its  relations with the CIS countries and Baltic states on the basis  of respect of international law. And if Russia maintains its  military presence in, say, Tajikistan, Georgia, or some other  Commonwealth country, it does it fully in accordance with  bilateral agreement.    As far as the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and  Estonia is concerned, negotiations on the issue are under way.  At the same time, Russia is pressing for respect of human  rights, the rights of the millions of Russian speakers living in  the CIS countries. And Moscow says it is ready to act firmly if  the rights of Russian speakers are abused. Understanding of  Russia's vital interests in the countries, former Soviet  republics, is essential for maintaining its partnership with the  United States, as well as other countries.</p>

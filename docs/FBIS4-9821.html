			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Part four of a judicial reform series by Victor Andres </F> Ponce]    [Text] Just as it is important to resolve the problem of  the inadequate number of judges to meet the requirements of  justice, it is crucial to address the crisis of the judicial  career, which has been markedly degraded in recent decades.    Specialists contend that this is a key factor in the reform  because judges are responsible for handing down decisions and  bringing prestige to their offices.    The system used to appoint judges has been one of the most  controversial issues concerning the judicial career, as well as  a topic that has been widely debated in the nation. Political  interference has caused considerable damage in this respect.  <H5>  Background </H5>   In accordance with Article 223 of the 1933 Constitution, the  Judicial Branch Organizational Law provided that "the  performance and qualifications of first instance and appellate  court judges will be evaluated every five years by the Supreme  Court, which, acting as a jury and after conducting the  inquiries it might deem appropriate, may dismiss any judge from  office..."    It should be noted that the only time an evaluation was  conducted in accordance with that law was in 1966. No further  attempt to evaluate magistrates has been made since that year.    Later, a decree-law issued in December 1969 by the military  dictatorship provided for a special confirmation in office of  judges (based, of course, on criteria advocated by the  government at that time).    Later, the 1979 Constitution established that Supreme Court  justices must be confirmed by the Senate and that all other  lower-ranking magistrates must be confirmed by the Supreme Court  plenum. The 1979 Constitution did not provide for the periodical  confirmation of judges.  <H5>  Prospects </H5>   The new Constitution has entrusted the National Council for  Magistrates (CNM) with the task of selecting and appointing  judges and prosecutors. Until the CNM is organized, its  functions will be exercised by the Disciplinary Board for  Magistrates.    Specialists contend that the CNM organizational law should  include the requirement of periodical evaluations based on  established guidelines for each level.    In this respect it should be noted that the Judicial Branch  Organizational Law establishes clear, precise guidelines for  evaluating the merits of judges, namely the timely and correct  disposition of cases, moral integrity, the lack of sanctions or  disciplinary measures, duly accredited academic degrees and  training studies, publication of legal papers, awards, and  decorations.    Therefore, there can be no argument against establishing the  requirement for periodical evaluations in the CNM organizational  law, especially considering that the evaluation is to be  conducted by an independent, nonpolitical body.  <H5>  Impact of the New Procedural Codes </H5>   In earlier reports we stated that our procedural laws are  being rapidly modernized through the Code of Civil Procedures,  the Code for Minors, and the imminent implementation of the Code  of Penal Procedures.    Specialists have argued that the "pro-code" mentality that  prevails among judges and that is taught in our law schools is  not the most appropriate one for implementing the new procedures.    In fact, our judges have always preferred to go to trial  instead of promoting conciliation between contending parties.    As we reported earlier, judges now are required to seek  conciliation, because if they fail to do so the procedure may be  nullified. But what happens when judges have been trained for  litigation and for applying laws instead of administering  justice conscientiously and equitably?    A civil judge said: What could happen is that conciliation  may become a pro forma, pointless procedure because the judge is  not prepared to bring litigants together.    In this context, there is an undeniable truth: Law schools'  curricula must be reformed to conform to the new procedural  trends.  <H5>  Academy for Magistrates </H5>   The creation of a judicial school for higher studies, which  had been proposed in every reform initiative for decades, was  incorporated in the new Constitution. An organizational law --  which should be proposed by the judicial branch -- now is  required to outline its objectives and functions.    Through this institution, which will make it possible to  implement a policy of steadily training judges and prosecutors  and to promote discussions on the administration of justice in  our country, the Peruvian justice system will have the chance of  measuring up to the judicial branches of other countries.    In this respect, it has been reported that the judicial  branch manager went to the United States in October to negotiate  an agreement with the vice rector of Harvard University whereby  the latter would support the future academy for magistrates. A  well-informed source said: "The objective is to create a legal  school similar to ESAN [School of Business Administration]."    It also has been learned that the judicial executive council  is drafting the bylaws for the academy and all that remains to  be done is to remodel a recreational center in Chaclacayo that  formerly belonged to the Popular Bank.    In his book "Alternative Justice," specialist Alberto  Bustamente states his opposition to the idea that the academy  should be the only institution charged with training judges and  prosecutors for selection and appointment purposes. He contends  that this will pose the risk of allowing a single institution to  monopolize the training of magistrates on the basis of its own  ideologies, and this procedure would entail going back many  decades as far as training techniques is concerned. He  believes every law faculty should be prepared to give these  training courses so there will be several trends of thought in  the law.    Another decisive factor in the judicial career crisis is  salaries. In a previous report, we reported that the monthly  salary of Supreme Court justice amounts to only 3,800 soles  (less than $2,000), while their counterparts in other countries  earn an average of $5,000 monthly.    The Judicial Branch Organizational Law establishes that a  superior court member should earn 90 percent of the income of a  Supreme Court justice; that is, 3,400 soles. The reality is  quite different: He makes only 1,600 soles.    In the case of criminal, civil, and other judges, the law  provides that their salaries should be equivalent to 80 percent  of the salary of a Supreme Court justice; that is, 3,000 soles.  In reality, they only make 1,100 soles.    Justices of the peace with law degrees should earn 2,600  soles, but they only make 700 soles.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   The solution to the judicial career crisis requires actions  by several institutions, from the CNM to law faculties.    One of the key reform topics is to include the requirement  for a periodical evaluation in the future CNM organizational law  -- based on merit guidelines -- for confirmation and promotion  purposes. Thus, annual evaluation panels will become true  national events.    Additionally, law schools' curricula must be reformed to  conform to the new role assigned to judges in accordance with  procedural codes. This job must be coordinated with the Academy  for Magistrates.    Finally, there will be no judicial career reform if the  current salaries are not increased.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti deficit surges to Pounds 19m MR EUGENE Anderson, Ferranti's chairman, warned shareholders yesterday that the defence electronics group was 'trapped in a vicious downward spiral.' His warning came as Ferranti, the subject of a 1p a share rescue offer by GEC, announced a sharp rise in interim pre-tax losses from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 19.4m. 'Our ability to win new business and efficiently to deliver systems and products to our customers have been severely damaged by the company's extremely tight liquidity,' Mr Anderson said. 'This has led to a progressive deterioration of the company's financial position, leaving the directors no choice but to recomment a rescue bid from GEC. The only alternative would be to ask the banks to appoint a receiver.' The deficit for the six months to September 30 was struck from turnover which shrank 17 per cent to Pounds 91m (Pounds 109.4m), including Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 9.3m) from discontinued operations. During the period Ferranti won Pounds 66.2m of new business compared to Pounds 90.7m a year earlier. Accordingly, the order book fell from Pounds 246.1m to Pounds 164.8m. At the operating level costs fell to Pounds 96.3m (Pounds 112.3m) as the group shed another 1,000 jobs. However, the operating loss grew to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 2.9m). Non-operating costs jumped to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 2.7m) including Pounds 2.4m to cover surplus property costs in the UK and US, Pounds 1m in reorganisation and rationalisation costs and a Pounds 6.7m provision to cover two legal disputes. The group's share of profits from the Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems joint venture doubled to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 300,000), and interest costs fell to Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 5.6m). The after-tax loss continued to widen and losses per share increased to 2.1p (0.95p). At the end of September Ferranti's net debt stood at Pounds 98.6m, up from Pounds 74.1m a year earlier. In addition Ferranti has contingent liabilities of Pounds 38.1m and owes creditors Pounds 18.2m in overdue payments pushing its total exposure to Pounds 154.9m. Meanwhile, its balance sheet has continued to weaken with shareholders' funds shrinking to Pounds 34.9m at the end of September from Pounds 62.2m a year earlier.</p>

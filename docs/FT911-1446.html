			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Rules on pension fund self-investment eased RULES which would have forced many UK company pension funds to sell property in a depressed market have been relaxed by the Department of Social Security. The DSS has also relaxed rules which will force some funds to sell Unlisted Securities Market shares, in recognition of the thin trading in many USM companies. The changes came to light as Mr Tony Newton, secretary of state for social security, announced government regulations on self-investment by pension funds. In response to a written parliamentary answer, Mr Newton said the proportion of a scheme's resources that could be self-invested would be limited to 5 per cent, confirming a 1988 proposal by the Occupational Pensions Board. The principle of limiting self-investment was set out in the 1990 Social Security Act, with the precise level left to be fixed by regulation. The act defines self-investment as including any shares in or loans to a scheme's employing company, as well as any property leased to the company. Mr Newton also announced rules for disinvestment by schemes which are already over the 5 per cent threshold. Contrary to the fears of the pensions industry, he said disinvestment would be restricted to certain types of investments: listed and USM shares and loans. The National Association of Pension Funds welcomed the fact that companies would not need to sell property investments over the 5 per cent limit, as this could have been disastrous in a weak property market. It also welcomed a five-year transition period for schemes to sell USM shares. Loans and listed equities will have to be reduced to below the 5 per cent level within two years. Mr Newton's announcement was accompanied by publication of a report commissioned by the DSS from Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, into the extent of the self-investment by UK pension schemes. Ernst &amp; Young reported that, of 6,500 large company schemes, 300 to 500 were above the 5 per cent level. Of these, 150-200 had more than 10 per cent of their assets self-invested. It added that forced rapid divestment could cause significant problems, particularly for property. Study of Self-Investment by Pension Funds. HMSO. Pounds 5.80.</p>

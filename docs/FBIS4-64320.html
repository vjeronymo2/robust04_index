			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Thomas Michelsen report: "Warning Shots From Wibble"] </F>   [Text] The Swedes are now to be frightened into joining the  EU [European Union]. Finance Minister Anne Wibble paints the  picture of a black economic future for Sweden if we do not  become members. Outside the EU we will be threatened by mass  unemployment or low wages and low environmental standards.    Wibble was speaking at the launch of a translation of an EU  white book on the economy yesterday.    "If we do not become members we will not attract any  investment," Finance Minister Anne Wibble (Liberal Party) said.  What arguments can Sweden use to attract investment if we are  not members of the EU?    "Why should companies invest in Sweden if Sweden is not part  of the core market?" Wibble asked. If Sweden cannot offer a  stable relationship with Europe investors will choose to invest  in other countries.    In such a situation Sweden would then have to try to compete  using the tool of low wages and low taxes or perhaps lower  environmental standards, the finance minister said. If we are  outside we have a simple choice between lowering our standards  or accepting mass unemployment.    If things look black for Sweden outside the EU, the white  book does not paint a bright picture of the situation inside the  EU. Over the last 20 years unemployment has been rising the  whole time, with a brief exception in the eighties. At the same  time, in all important economic respects the EU's  competitiveness has worsened in comparison with the United  States and Japan.    The reason why the EU has produced its white book on the  economy is unemployment. Today 17 million are unemployed. This  is 11 percent of the EU's active population. And before the end  of the year unemployment could rise to 18 million, the EU's  ambassador to Sweden, Jaime Cavanillas y Junquera, said at the  launch of the Swedish translation of the white book.    Anne Wibble said that in the past the EU has not made  sufficient effort to combat unemployment. But now unemployment  is top of the EU agenda -- and this is a good thing.    The white book is a thorough review of various possible ways  of strengthening the economy, growth, and employment. What is  especially important is that it dismisses the notion that  technological progress is a cause of unemployment, Wibble said.    It also dismisses the notion that job-sharing is a way of  resolving the crisis. Rationing jobs to make them go further  among more people is no solution, the EU notes in its white book.    In the United States there has been growth in employment.  But many of the new jobs are so badly paid that people cannot  live on them. In Europe growth has been less, but the jobs that  have been created are better paid. We do not want to be forced  to choose between the American and the continental European  experiences, Wibble said.</p>

The press service at the elections and census department was  reacting to some news reports that parliamentary by-elections  should be held in some constituencies of which the judiciary  authorities annulled the results. In this regard, the source  underlines the government's commitment to organize in due time  by-elections as soon as it receives judiciary decisions from the  Supreme Court's constitutional chamber.</p>

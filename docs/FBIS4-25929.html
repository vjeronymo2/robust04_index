			<p>BFN     [Text] Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party  committee, received in the Youyi Guest House of Shenyang the  friendship delegation of North Pyongan Province of DPRK, which  is headed by Yom Chae-man, chairman of the North Pyongan  Provincial Administrative and Economic Guidance Committee, on  the afternoon of 4 June.    During the reception, Gu Jinchi first extended warm welcome  on behalf of the Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee and all  Communist party members and people throughout the province to  the visit paid by the Korean delegation. He said: The  Sino-Korea friendship cemented or fostered personally by the  elderly proletarian revolutionaries has experienced historic  trials. Over a long period of time, the peoples of the two  provinces have made due contributions to the development of  friendship between the two provinces through mutual assistance  and support. Hereafter, we will still continue to make all-out  efforts to enhance the traditional friendship and the friendly  and cooperative relationship between the two sides.    In reviewing his visit paid to the DPRK not long ago, Gu  Jinchi said: In April this year, the Liaoning provincial CPC  delegation headed by him paid a visit to the close neighbor of  DPRK. It was a great honor for the delegation to participate in  the celebration of the 82d birthday of Chairman Kim Il-song.  Leaving a deep impression on the delegation were the Korean  people's high revolutionary enthusiasm and the revolutionary  spirit of working hard to make progress, as well as the  tremendous achievements scored by them in the undertakings of  building socialism. He was convinced that under the wise  leadership of Chairman Kim Il-song and the Workers' Party of  Korea, the diligent and brave Korean people will certainly be  able to score a new and greater achievement in the future in the  undertakings of socialist revolution and construction.    During the reception, Chairman Yom Chae-man also made a  speech in which he extended thanks for the commendation. He  said: As soon as it set foot in China, the delegation deeply  felt the profound sentiment and friendship displayed by the  Chinese people to the Korean people. Through the two-day visit,  the delegation saw for itself the tremendous achievements scored  by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of the CPC in  the undertakings of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. This has fully shown that the line currently  followed by China is in conformity with China's reality. He  wholeheartedly wished the people of Liaoning Province to score  still greater achievements in the undertakings of revolution and  construction along with people throughout China.    After the reception, Gu Jinchi hosted a banquet in honor of  the Korean delegation.    Attending the reception and banquet were Xu Wencai, member  of  the provincial party standing committee and secretary general of  the provincial party committee; Sui Xudong, director of the  provincial foreign affairs office; and other personnel concerned.</p>

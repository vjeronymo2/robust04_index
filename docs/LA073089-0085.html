			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: THE AIDS STORY  </P> <P> Also from the AIDS file: A full page ad in the trade papers promoting a  low-budget movie called "The Victims" has roused a response. The ad pictures a  barechested man positioned sensually between two affectionate women under the  slogan: If you don't want to catch AIDS go see 'The Victims'!  </P> <P> Charles Cotayo, director of distribution for Florida-based Mochon International  Film Distribution, said: "We've gotten so many calls from that ad, it's  ridiculous" -- some from AIDS organizations expressing concern that the film  might sensationalize its subject.  </P> <P> Cotayo said the film concerns a successful Cuban emigre and family man in Miami  whose idyllic life is shattered when the threat of AIDS looms after his  impulsive act of infidelity.  </P> <P> Cotayo called it a cautionary tale of "significant social value" that delivers  a strong message about unsafe sex. "It's not a sensationalized, exploitative  movie," he said. "It's reality."  </P> <P> Cast with Florida actors, "The Victims" will get a trial release in south  Florida on Sept. 15. John M. Wilson  </P></p>

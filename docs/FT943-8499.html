			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Lords favour heavier trucks Heavier trucks should be allowed on Britain's roads, an all-party committee of the House of Lords says in a report out today. The committee recommends that the present maximum truck weight of 38 tonnes spread over five axles - soon to be raised to 40 tonnes under European Union legislation - should be increased to 44 tonnes on six axles. It says that this would reduce wear on roads from individual trucks and result in fewer journeys. Raising the maximum weight of trucks would not necessarily lead to an increase in the size of vehicles, because many lorries are capable of carrying more payload, the committee says. The report discusses a proposed EU directive setting maximum weights and dimensions for trucks of 3.5 tonnes and more. Present EU rules are fragmented and complicate haulage companies' planning. The committee acknowledges that heavier trucks will increase competition with rail, but says this can be countered. It says there should be tough enforcement to prevent overloading, increased grants to encourage companies to use rail and a move to charging hauliers the full cost of road use, including environmental and safety costs. The committee urges tight specifications for the suspensions of larger trucks to minimise road damage and says local authorities should be encouraged to make greater use of their powers to set routes for heavy vehicles. The report is in favour of an EU proposal for a small increase in the maximum width of trucks from 2.5 metres to 2.55 metres to allow the more efficient loading of pallets. This is still less than the 2.6 metres allowed at present for refrigerated trucks. Maximum Weights and Dimensions of Road Vehicles. HMSO. Pounds 16.60.</p>

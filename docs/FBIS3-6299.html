			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata leaves for Russia on Saturday [19 March] for talks with  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev, but no major progress on a long-standing  bilateral territorial dispute is expected from the meetings.    All indications are that Tokyo and Moscow will achieve no  major breakthrough on the territorial row during Hata's  three-day visit, since the new Russian parliament is dominated  by ultrarightists and conservatives opposed to returning the  four disputed islands in question to Japan.    Hata is scheduled to meet Chernomyrdin and Kozyrev on  Monday.    Government sources said Hata is likely to agree to Japanese  financial and technical assistance for the construction of  radioactive liquid waste disposal facilities to avert further  dumping of such waste by Russia into the Sea of Japan.    They said the foreign minister, who doubles as deputy prime  minister, will also strongly press Russia to exert its influence  over North Korea toward a resolution of the nuclear issue.    A meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin is seen as  unlikely since Hata's visit coincides with Yeltsin's vacation.    The sources said Hata will agree to provide Russia with  additional humanitarian assistance and will convey Japan's  readiness to help train Russians to acquire a basic knowledge of  the market economy system and in business management.    To that end, Japan plans to establish several "Japan Center"  facilities in such cities as Moscow, Vladivostok and Khabarovsk.  In addition, hundreds of young Russian entrepreneurs will be  invited to Japan.    Hata is expected to face calls from the Russian side for the  Group of Seven major industrialized nations to be expanded to a  Group of Eight to include Russia.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Bank backed in council swap case THE High Court has ruled in favour of Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale which sought to recover about Pounds 1m from an interest-rate swap with the north London borough of Islington. The case is the first to reach court since the Lords ruled in 1991 that local authorities had no power to enter into swaps.</p>

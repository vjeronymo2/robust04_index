			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Sterling fall sparks interest in depressed oil sector - Analysts revise their earnings forecasts as the pound continues its slide against the dollar AFTER months of depression, the outlook for oil companies is brightening and share prices in the unloved sector are showing signs of recovery. Since the devaluation of the pound a month ago, Monument has picked up 22 per cent, Goal 23 per cent, Clyde 44 per cent, Enterprise 21 per cent, Hardy 39 per cent and Lasmo 32 per cent. The latest monthly report on oil production from the Royal Bank of Scotland estimated the pound's devaluation would add about Pounds 2.5m a day to the value of UK North Sea oil production, taking it to Pounds 21.7m. Analysts, meanwhile, have been busy revising their earnings forecasts for oil companies. Hoare Govett, the London brokers, recently published a note forecasting a possible fall in the average value of sterling to Dollars 1.56 in 1993, which would mean a doubling of profits for some companies. Oil is traded worldwide in dollars, so a weakening of the pound against the dollar means a higher sterling price for each barrel of oil. For UK exploration and production companies without downstream interests, who specialise in finding, producing and selling crude, such increases feed through almost directly to the bottom line. It was the downward drift in sterling oil prices, to a 20-year low in real terms of about Pounds 10.50 a barrel in the first half of 1992, that was largely responsible for the poor performance of oil companies and the weakness of their shares. In the week before sterling's devaluation, exploration and production stocks were trading at an average 40 per cent discount to their asset values. Two years earlier, they had traded at a 40 per cent premium. But there were other factors. One catalyst was the takeover of Ultramar by rival independent Lasmo in December 1991, with an all-paper offer of 285p a share, compared with City valuations of more than 400p a share for Ultramar. With no company willing to step in with a higher (or cash) offer, the takeover had a depressant effect on the whole sector, and the City of London began to review its approach to the rest of the exploration companies. Analysts have moved away from asset valuations - which value a company according to the future potential of the exploration acreage in its portfolio - and towards valuations based on cashflow multiples and dividend growth. Some in the oil industry also claim that investment analysts and fund managers do not understand the way the industry has changed in the last few years - particularly the increasing importance of gas, and the international expansion by many companies. 'Many analysts aren't comfortable with the concept of billions or trillions of cubic feet of gas, or with developments in far-off places like Indonesia. They're much happier with barrels of oil, preferably from the North Sea,' said a director of one exploration and production company. Some of these factors will persist. But UK oil companies and analysts are waking up to the fact that the fundamentals for oil prices look stronger than they have for some time. With sterling now at about Dollars 1.65, and Brent crude at about Dollars 20.80 a barrel, the sterling oil price stands at more than Pounds 12.60 a barrel. Moreover, with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreeing at its meeting last month to freeze output at its August level - allowing only for a small increase by Kuwait - analysts say a tight market could push Brent crude prices to Dollars 22. If forecasts of an unusually cold winter come true, the price could go even higher. The improved price has already benefited stocks with large North Sea interests, especially Clyde - which recently formed a joint venture with Austrian oil group OMV to undertake further exploration work - Goal, Pict and Monument. Ranger could also benefit, although its shares have been among the few that have largely held their value during the downturn. Premier Consolidated Oilfields, which also has important North Sea interests, has performed less well. Mr Charles Jamieson, Premier's chief executive, said his company's stock is traditionally one of the more liquid and complains that the City is not placing sufficient value on the company's gas interests in a 3,500bn cu ft gas field in Pakistan. 'We only have 9 1/2 per cent,' he said, 'but that means 320bn cu ft of gas, which is roughly the size of most North Sea fields these days.' Two of the biggest winners, however, have been Enterprise and Lasmo of the independent sector. Lasmo is strongly geared to the strength of the dollar versus the pound. Mr Michael Pavia, finance director, has said every Pounds 1 rise in the sterling oil price adds Pounds 40m to Lasmo's cashflow. Enterprise is also seen as highly geared to dollar strength because most of its income is in dollars, and most of its spending in sterling. A 10 per cent increase in the value of the dollar adds approximately Pounds 40m to cashflow and Pounds 30m to earnings, analysts say. Some oil stocks have also benefited from a third factor - improved US gas prices. After falling for more than two years, US spot prices reached a nadir of 90 cents per million British thermal units in February 1992, 33 cents below the price a year earlier. By May, however, prices had risen above their corresponding 1991 level, and they continued to strengthen to reach Dollars 2.60 per million Btu by the end of September - helped partly by disruption to production caused by Hurricane Andrew. The price has settled back to about Dollars 2.40, but analysts believe this is supported by market fundamentals; the low prices made many companies cut back their drilling programmes, so supply is now more balanced with demand. This is good news for companies with exposure to the Houston or Louisiana gas business, such as Hardy Oil, British Borneo and Aran Energy. Cairn Energy, which has built up significant US gas interests and last week announced a 40 per cent interest in a 150bn cu ft gas discovery offshore Louisiana, is also likely to be a prime beneficiary. 'Every 10 cents on the US gas price adds Dollars 700,000 (Pounds 407,000) to our cashflow,' says Mr Bill Gammell, Cairn's chief executive. There is, of course, no guarantee that exchange rates or oil and gas prices will move as predicted. So, for the moment, the gains made by the oil sector remain fragile, and it may still take a takeover bid to underpin them. Speculation abounds that Enterprise, which has raised Dollars 280m through a public offering of American depository shares and a further tranche of dollar preference shares, might be considering an assets acquisition, or a swoop on a company. Favourite among possible targets is Monument, seen as having an attractive portfolio. The majors, too, might consider a swoop on one of the exploration and production companies. In spite of the pick-up in its shares, Lasmo remains a possible target. It would be ironic if the company whose own acquisition activity did so much to depress the market last year was itself the victim of a takeover which went on to boost prices.</p>

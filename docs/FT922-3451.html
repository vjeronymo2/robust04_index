			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (8): Move to ease securities rules / Examining the role of asset-backed debt A RECENT proposal by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities watchdog agency, to loosen the rules governing the issuance of asset-backed securities may prove a welcome boost to the industry in what promises otherwise to be a static year. The SEC proposal would exempt issuers of the debt from provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 which regulates mutual funds in the US, thereby opening the field to a wider range of asset categories so long as they remain within the bounds of structured transactions and receive one of the top two investment grades from a rating agency. At present, home mortgage-backed and auto-loan backed bonds are exempt from the mutual fund regulations, but junk bonds, backed by more general loans and some forms of credit-card receivables, are still subject to the mutual fund rules. The result is a cumbersome process where issuers must apply for an exemption to the mutual fund rules for each issue. The SEC's proposal, which is likely to stimulate volume and broaden the market, comes at a time when growth in asset-backed issuances has slowed to a virtual crawl after several boom years. The total amount of asset-backed debt issued, excluding mortgage-backed securities, stood at only Dollars 1.23bn in 1985. Between 1989 and 1990 the amount nearly doubled to Dollars 40.08bn, but grew only 17 per cent to Dollars 46.97bn in 1991 and is expected to remain fairly static in the coming year at about Dollars 50bn. Mortgage-backed securities, by far the biggest sector of the asset-backed securities business, saw volume nearly triple in the first quarter of this year to Dollars 101bn, thanks to a sharp drop in long-term interest rates which spurred a wave of mortgage-refinancing. Volume, however, is expected to taper off as long-term interest rates pick up. Players expect continued growth in commercial and multi-family deals from the Resolution Trust Corporation and other sources, however, through the year. In the credit card-backed securities arena, traditionally the most important component of the (non-mortgage) asset-backed securities business, volume slowed in the first quarter of this year and the pace is not expected to pick up significantly during 1992. Mr Jack Ross, director and co-head of Merrill Lynch's Asset Backed Securities group, the biggest on Wall Street followed by First Boston, cites a number of factors behind the slowdown in supply. Credit card volume is down for three reasons, according to Mr Ross. 'Firstly, the banks are faring better and have the equity market available to shore up capital. Secondly, we haven't seen as many credit card asset-backed deals come due this year, so refinancing volume is not great. And thirdly, with the recession portfolios are shrinking rather than growing, so there are fewer assets to securitise.' Indeed, one of the most important factors in the asset-backed market's growth during 1990-91 was the relative illiquidity of US banks, when many had trouble meeting capital standards and turned to off-balance sheet financing. One of the biggest areas of activity in the past year was in auto receivables-backed securities. In addition, new areas to securitise have also helped shore up volume, such as leases, trade receivables and commercial loans. Mr Ross says: 'In the auto sector not only have we seen consumer loans or retail paper securitised, we are now seeing wholesale paper being securitised with a structure similar to credit card-backed deals.' In spite of the fall in credit card business, participants are still enthusiastic, in part because spreads are tightening. 'Re-offer spreads are at the tightest levels they have ever been,' says Mr Ross. Merrill recently did a Dollars 500m MBNA credit card deal priced at a spread of 55 basis points over the treasury's five-year note. The issue was able to command an impressive spread partly because of the strength of the MBNA name, since the Delaware-based business is one of the top US credit-card issuers. In addition, Mr Ross believes investors have been impressed by the ability of credit-card backed portfolios, in general, to withstand increased consumer losses during the recession. 'They're not getting the downgrades or early calls so investors are willing to buy at tighter levels,' he says. Also contributing to the tighter spreads is the renewed strength of the corporate market. 'Our spreads move in sympathy with the corporate market as we are a corporate bond alternative,' says Mr Ross. The improvement in spreads is all the sweeter because of the comparison with a difficult fourth quarter last year, when spreads started to widen amid fears that pending legislation to cap credit card interest rates at 14 per cent would threaten the future of this part of the market. But the proposed legislation came to nothing and some of the major issuers, including Citibank and American Express, have now tiered their portfolios, bringing down the rates for better borrowers. With the market now maturing, last year asset-backed securities accounted for 25 per cent of the corporate bond market. And while they may not be able to command a similar share of the market this year, they have now become almost as mainstream as general debt or equity financing in the capital markets arena. 'The asset mix may change from year to year,' says Mr Ross, 'but asset-backed securities have proved themselves as a product that is here to stay.'  ---------------------------------       ASSET-BACKED DEBT     ISSUES* (DOLLARS BN)  --------------------------------- 1985                1.23 1986               10.00 1987                9.83 1988               15.30 1989               23.43 1990               40.08 1991               46.97  --------------------------------- *Does not include mortgage-backed securities, which would bring 1991 total to Dollars 300bn.  --------------------------------- Source: IDD Information Services  ---------------------------------</p>

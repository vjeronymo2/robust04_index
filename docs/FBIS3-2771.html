			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister of  Bosnian Muslim-led Government Haris Silajdzic left here this  afternoon after talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev on Bosnian settlement.    Silajdzic, who arrived in Moscow this morning from France,  held two hours of talks with Kozyrev.    Calling the talks "fruitful," the Russian foreign minister  said, "an encouraging progress emerged in the recent past in  settling the bosnian crisis in several spheres."    "It is important now not to lose and to develop the positive  impetus and to try to consolidate it," Kozyrev stressed, summing  up the results of his talks with Silajdzic.    Silajdzic, in turn, expressed his satisfaction with the  results of the talks, noting that "prerequisites have emerged in  the recent past to settle the Bosnian conflict." "This moment  must not be lost," the prime minister stressed.    He said the Russian side can play a constructive role in  promoting the talks on Bosnia, stating he favored "a more  balanced policy for Russia on some aspects of the Yugoslav  crisis."    In February, Russia's "go-between" efforts resulted in  relaxing the air strikes crisis over Sarajevo, the capital of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "We hope that Russian battalion stationed around Sarajevo  will play a positive role and will help preserve Sarajevo as a  multinational city," Silajdzic said.    Turning to the achieved understanding on the formation of a  Croatia-Muslim confederation, he stressed that its  implementation is impossible without Serbs' agreement.    Bosnian Serbs leader Radovan Karadzic visited Moscow last  week. His talks with Russian leaders resulted at least in a  major accord on opening the Tuzla airport provided Russian  observers are sent here.    The Bosnian prime minister also stressed, "we shall have a  new version but all the same it will be based on the main thing  -- territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina."    Later today, Croatia's Foreign Minister Mate Granic, who  also  is deputy prime minister of the Croatian Government, is due to  arrive in Moscow for talks on Bosnian settlement.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Brazil's Collor sacks two ministers PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil last night sacked two of his ministers, replacing them with federal deputies in an attempt to reduce his political isolation, writes Christina Lamb from Rio de Janeiro. The surprise move came after the government failed to secure Congressional approval of emergency legislation to increase social security payments to fund rises in pensions. The two new ministers are both from parties which support the government but voted against it this week. Mr Ricardo Fiuza, the new minister for social affairs, and Mr Reinold Stefanis, the new labour minister, both said Mr Collor had explained that he needed to increase his base in Congress. They will now have the task of trying to find the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) which the goverment says it needs for the increased pensions. The International Monetary Fund has delayed a decision over the approval of a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) loan to Brazil. Brazilian officials said the meeting, due to take place next Wednesday, has been delayed because it would clash with a meeting of heads of state from the former Soviet Union which Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF chief, is to attend.</p>

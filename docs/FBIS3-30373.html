			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, parliamentary group leader of </F> the Alliance of Free Democrats, by Peter Petan on 30 January;  place not given: "Growth Will Start by Itself -- Gabor Kuncze  Is Seeking the Answer"]    [Excerpts] After the three-day delegate meeting of the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], Gabor Kuncze, the party's  prime ministerial candidate, gave an interview to UJ  MAGYARORSZAG. [passage omitted]    [Petan] It has been said that you did not make the cause of  the Hungarians living beyond the border part of your program.  What is the reason for this?    [Kuncze] This has not been said. However, we did say that  we do not wish to make the cause of the Hungarians beyond the  border part of our campaign. As a matter of fact, other parties  have also agreed with us on this. At our talks with Prime  Minister Peter Boross, he also approved that this issue should  not be made part of the campaign, rather, the settlement of  their problems should be in all programs as a goal to be  resolved.    [Petan] At the meeting of delegates, you were radiant with  determination. It was stated many times that you cannot imagine  the next government being formed without the free democrats, in  fact, that you cannot imagine that it would not be the SZDSZ  that forms the government. You called for unity and  cooperation, advocated conciliation, and recommended the  competition of the programs to everyone instead of flinging  abuse at each other. Do you not think that this change of the  image is a little late? How much formality and how much real  content is in this determination?    [Kuncze] On one hand, the fact that the SZDSZ is able to  appear as a party like this is not a change of image, rather, it  is the result of much work and a long process. We have been  working on this since Ivan Peto was elected chairman. On the  other hand, there is no external appearance and inner content,  these cannot be separated. The SZDSZ looks 100 percent like a  party that is preparing for a governmental role. It has an  accepted election program that can be turned into a government  program when the situation arises, it has suitable candidates  who can gain people's confidence, and we have adequate political  experience and practice. In my view, the SZDSZ is indeed a party  that can be elected. [passage omitted]    [Petan] The biggest emphasis was placed on economic issues.  In your view, how many years will it take for the economy to  become restored and what are the most important tasks?    [kuncze] The economy will be in order when the conditions  for growth are established; after that, growth will  automatically start in the economy. Therefore, the real big  issue is the establishment of the conditions for growth. The  necessary measures will have to be made this year, and the  system of regulations will have to be adjusted from 1 January  1995. Through these, it will be possible to establish the  conditions in one or two years, and following this, it will be  up to the economy whether growth starts, which, as a matter of  fact, is the precondition for increasing living standards.    [Petan] Do you really think that the next government will be  forced to do its work under much more difficult circumstances  than the Antall-government was?    [Kuncze] The situation is worse than it was four years ago  in several areas of the macro-economy. This is a fact whether  we think about the foreign trade deficit, the foreign balance of  payments deficit, or the domestic balance of payments. We are  saying that the situation has to be honestly examined because  solutions will have to be found to the real conditions. Today,  the scope for maneuver in politics is much smaller than it was  four years ago, there is little point in arguing about this  because it is obvious. The unemployment of 700,000 is a terrible  problem, and the budget deficit is a problem that obstructs the  economy. Answers have to be found to these questions. [passage  omitted]    [Petan] You clearly declared that the Hungarian Socialist  Party [MSZP] is an elections and political opponent of the  SZDSZ. This was an answer to those who predicted the coalition  cooperation of the two parties. At the same time, you also  stated that, in the interest of solving the country's problems,  you are willing to cooperate with anyone who can and wants to  act. Do you not feel that you have opened another door by  saying this?    [Kuncze] Why do you not ask if I feel that this is a door  opened in the other direction? The SZDSZ has always emphasized  that, as a party in the center, it is open to all democratic  parties if the country's governability demands this and the  principles and programs can be harmonized.

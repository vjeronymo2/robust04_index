			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACKS AND MOVIES  </P> <P> It was devastating to again read the same old bromides about why black movie  projects cannot get funding by major studios.  </P> <P> The April 16 story was replete with shopworn excuses, such as the one that  white audiences will not support pictures without a white leading character.  </P> <P> Such justifications for not producing Afro-American projects is insulting to  black Americans and all other thoughtful people. The great success of  television's "Cosby" show would seem sufficient to put an end to that lie.  </P> <P> White people, like any other people, will support any movie or television  program that has a good story and characters and that is done well and properly  promoted. (Remember "Roots"?)  </P> <P> The problem lies in the fact that too many decision makers in the industry are  young, white yuppies whose isolated upbringings in all-white neighborhoods and  all-white schools and colleges has ill-prepared them for the role they have  inherited.  </P> <P> ROBERT W. WILLIAMS  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

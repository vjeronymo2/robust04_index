			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOND MEASURE HAD SUPPORT OF DEVELOPERS, WASTE FIRMS  </P> <P> Out-of-town developers and waste disposal companies were among the big  contributors to a group that supported an $8-million bond issue, rejected by  voters in April, to build a new library and fire station in West Hollywood,  financial records show.  </P> <P> In records filed with the city clerk last week, West Hollywood Residents for  Proposition A reported having spent $11,720 in its losing bid to promote the  bond measure.  </P> <P> The group, which closed its books on June 1, had as its treasurer Councilman  John Heilman. Mayor Abbe Land was listed as the only other controlling officer.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, an official of Fair Representation for West Hollywood, which led the  fight against the measure, and whose organizers included Councilman Steve  Schulte, said this week that the group raised $11,199 in contributions -- more  than half of it from landlords.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $100 in Debt  </P> <P> Treasurer David Gould said his group, which is $100 in debt, plans "to close  its books as soon as we raise the $100." By law, it has until June 30 to submit  its final campaign disclosure, he said.  </P> <P> Of the contributions to the group headed by Heilman and Land, $2,500 came from  people associated with Rossmoor Regency, the Laguna Hills-based real estate  company that developed Leisure World, which wants to build a luxury residential  complex for senior citizens in West Hollywood.  </P> <P> Rossmoor and a sister company each contributed $500. Three other $500  contributions came from individuals associated with the firm: developer Ross  Cortese; accountant Mary Kettle Larkin, and project manager Lewis Davis and his  wife, Carol Davis.  </P> <P> Among the other contributors were a couple of waste disposal companies that are  among a handful still in the running for a piece of the residential garbage  business, once city officials reduce the number of firms that haul West  Hollywood's trash from 23 to one or two.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Waste Disposal Firms  </P> <P> Records show that John Mardichian, who heads Murcole Disposal Co. of Compton,  donated $950, and served as an intermediary for another $950 contribution from  a Palm Desert man. Consolidated Disposal Service of Santa Fe Springs gave the  group $750.  </P> <P> Despite the endorsement of four members of the City Council and support from  the politically influential Coalition for Economic Survival, a renters' rights  group, voters opposed the measure by a margin of 52% to 48%. A two-thirds vote  was needed for passage.  </P> <P> Opponents of the measure portrayed the election as a referendum on the city's  long-planned civic center in West Hollywood Park. They claimed the bond issue  was a backhand attempt to squeeze more money for the center, because the  library and fire station were originally part of the center's design.  </P> <P> Fair Representation for West Hollywood received $4,500 from West Hollywood  Concerned Citizens, and $1,500 from the Greater Los Angeles Apartment Assn.,  Gould said. Both are landlord organizations.  </P> <P> Gould said that $3,000 of the group's donations came "from about 20  contributors" and that the remainder of the money was from West Hollywood  residents who gave $100 or less to help defeat the bond issue.  </P> <P> Other contributors to the pro-Proposition A campaign included Gruen Associates  of Los Angeles, architectural engineers for the civic center project, $900;  Raleigh Enterprises of Los Angeles, $900, and Pomona Enterprises of Cypress,  $900.  </P> <P> The campaign organization of Councilwoman Helen Albert donated $900, and the  Pacific Design Center gave $500 to the pro-proposition group. All 19 other  entities it listed as contributors were from outside West Hollywood.  </P></p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Ingham purchase talks continue Negotiations for its acquisition of Moss Europe were continuing, said Ingham yesterday as it also noted the recent rise in its share price. On Thursday the worsted spinner's shares rose 7p to 109p. Yesterday they lost 1p. The talks could result in Moss, a private UK company, being bought from Milard, a California-based car parts distributor, for Pounds 4m in shares. Ingham added that, if successful, it might raise extra funds by a share issue to provide additional working capital.</p>

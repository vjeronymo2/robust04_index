			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Indian industrial group plans issue Grasim Industries, one of India's leading industrial companies, plans a Dollars 100m issue of global depositary shares (GDS). It is the first Indian company to receive government approval to tap the international capital markets since the failed Dollars 1bn euro-equity offering by VSNL, the state-controlled telecommunications group, a month ago. Part of an industrial group run by Mr Aditya Birla, Grasim is the largest manufacturer of viscose fibre in India, and a big cement and steel producer. The shares, which will be priced next week, will be fungible with an existing Dollars 90m GDS issue. The money will go towards the company's Dollars 387m capital expenditure programme over the next three years. The company is building a cement works and a power plant, as well as expanding textile production. Mr Birla said: 'This is important for me and for the country. Grasim was the first company to come successfully to the international market in 1992, and the first after the VSNL failure. A lot of people will be watching us very carefully.' The postponement of VSNL's offering was the country's biggest setback in the international capital markets since Indian issuers first borrowed funds in late 1992, when the government's liberalisation programme permitted increased foreign trade and investment.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Brazil's suspended president to fight reversal of policies MR FERNANDO Collor, Brazil's suspended president, yesterday accused his opponents of carrying out his 'summary execution' and warned that the country's new government was 'plunging Brazil into the fifth world'. Speaking out for the first time since being suspended amid a multi-million dollar corruption scandal, an emotional Mr Collor said in an interview with the Financial Times: 'I can no longer just sit back and let myself be led to the firing range and watch my modernisation programme be destroyed.' Immaculately dressed in a tropical suit with monogrammed shirt and gold tie pin, the man now facing an impeachment trial and criminal corruption charges cut a tragic figure. The smart presidential offices of the world's ninth largest economy have been replaced by a fly-ridden and un-airconditioned library next to his house. He sat surrounded by memorabilia rescued from the presidency. Behind was a photograph of his wife, who is also facing criminal charges. Unable to keep his hand from shaking while lighting Cuban cigars, the strain clearly showed on Mr Collor's face. But despite the pinched cheeks, haunted eyes and occasional look of raw despair, he has not lost the fighting spirit of the young man who came to power in 1990 with a mission to modernise Brazil. He insists he will not resign. 'To resign is to flee, and I don't flee, I fight. I was elected for five years and have a project to carry out which I must finish,' he said. Asked about the criminal charges recommended by the attorney general on Thursday night, he laughed bitterly: 'What was my crime? Was it a crime to modernise the country, to build up Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.50bn) in reserves, to reinsert Brazil into the international community? 'Was it a crime to build up the largest food stocks in history, to remove price controls, to open our market, to defend the rights of indigenous people? Nobody ever did so much for the country.' He added: 'In no way did I betray the Brazilian people. It was me that was betrayed. The impeachment campaign was instigated by business and corporative interests threatened by my programme and by politicians hungry for power, all brought together under a false cloak of morality.' Mr Collor said he felt no bitterness over how his world had been destroyed through the allegations initially made by his brother. But he hit out at Mr Itamar Franco, his vice-president and now acting president. He said Mr Franco 'has no project, no command and no team' and warned that 'the whole modernisation process is under threat by a return to the nationalist effluents of the 1940 and 1950s'. He added: 'He's talking about freezing tariffs, reducing interest rates and getting Congress to approve each privatisation. The government leader is a communist who always opposed modernisation. They're throwing 2 1/2 years of sacrifice by Brazilian society into the rubbish bin.'</p>

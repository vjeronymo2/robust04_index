			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Books: Back through blood and voodoo 'BONJOUR BLANC': A JOURNEY THROUGH HAITI by Ian Thomson Hutchinson Pounds 16.99, 352 pages IAN THOMSON, a 30-year-old Briton, spent months travelling over a God-forsaken and singular land: 'a country turned upside down', according to one of the book's characters. This is a lively account of life in Haiti that alternately stimulates sympathy, humour and despair. Haiti is at this moment in the grip of military repression. The Tonton Macoutes, the terrifying security force of the dictatorships of 'Papa Doc' Duvalier and his son, have been resuming their positions of power around the island. Soldiers, having ousted the elected president, are beating, killing and arresting hundreds of people. As Thomson says: 'The horror of Haiti has always been in the army.' The trail of blood goes back at least to Columbus, for we know little of it before. Within 50 years of the navigator's arrival, the half million Arawak indians on the island had perished and the pre-Columbian culture had all but vanished. Columbus established in Haiti the first European settlement in the New World, 500 years ago this year. When he returned 11 months later, the settlement had been razed and his men killed. Columbus described a land of spices and cotton, mastic and aloes and 'a thousand other things of value'. What Thomson finds is 'a vast slum floating a few hundred miles off Florida, the poorest nation in the western hemisphere.' When independence was declared from Napoleon's France on New Year's Day 1804, Haiti became the first black republic: in today's parlance, the first third world country. Napoleon himself had cruelly deceived one of its few unalloyed heroes: Toussaint L'Ouverture, who led the the slave revolt that eventually brought about independence. His life ended in a dank French gaol. His hopes for democracy have never been realised: leader after leader used their positions to pillage the state. 'Pluck the chicken as long as it does not squawk,' said Haiti's first leader, Jean-Jacques Dessalines. Thomson follows fascinating trails all over the land: to the probable site of that first European settlement; on a search for the descendants of the Poles who settled part of the island and for Alexandre Dumas the Elder, the half-caste father of the author of the Count of Monte Cristo; to voodoo ceremonies. He talks to a zombi; to an ancestor of Simon Bolivar; to a sad Englishman ending his days among people who, even if they have heard of his native land, believe it to be one of the United States of America; and to many others. This book is the fruit of no little courage and long research. If it has a fault, it is the author's apparent unwillingness to leave out a fact painstakingly gathered or an individual met along the way. There is a surfeit of italics - French, creole, Spanish, Latin - which disturbs the narrative. As a result, the book is perhaps overlong. It remains none the less an achievement; a colourful, vital book of important insight.</p>

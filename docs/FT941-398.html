			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Italy Italy's financial markets wanted a clear outcome to the general elections. They have not really got one. Forming a government promises to be a much harder task for the rightwing Freedom Alliance than winning the election, and the markets have some grounds for anxiety about how its policies will turn out. The stock market might relish the continuation of the privatisation programme: some juicy offerings are coming up in the insurance and energy sector. But it is hard to square the Alliance's commitment to lower taxes with continuing reduction of the budget deficit. If that approach did not work in Reagan's America, it is unlikely to in Berlusconi's Italy. Arguably both equities and bonds are cheap. With inflation heading below 4 per cent this year, long-term yields of over 9 per cent provide a substantial real return. A prospective cash flow multiple of around six times is not demanding for equities, especially since Italy's strong export performance since the lira's exit from the ERM is starting to generate healthy growth in industrial earnings. Yesterday's weakness in both markets suggests that the political fog will have to clear before these factors come to the fore. There are risks along the way. Not least is the possibility that worries about fiscal policy might cause the Bank of Italy to go slow on interest rate cuts. With the domestic economy still weak, that would be particularly worrying for equities.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Surgery plans lead to complications: The government faces a tough decision, even if it does not close London hospitals Mrs Virginia Bottomley, UK health secretary, has vowed that the government will not shirk tough decisions when it responds this month to recommendations for widespread hospital closures in London. She is right that it will have tough decisions to make, but they may not be the ones she originally intended. As a cabinet committee prepares to finalise its position this week, some ministers are fearful of provoking a repetition of the public uproar that followed the announcement of the pit closures. They are therefore shying away from shutting world-famous hospitals - as recommended by Sir Bernard Tomlinson in his report on the future of London healthcare, published last October. A rejection of his plan to eliminate 2,500 hospital beds in the capital would, however, simply be exchanging one set of tough decisions for another. The internal market set up by the 1991 health reforms has led to a loss of patients from inner London's teaching hospitals to local ones in outer London and the home counties. If ministers abandoned Tomlinson, they would have to decide how to handle a financial crisis in the capital's hospitals, and face serious questions about their commitment to a market-based health service. The government's attack of doubt reflects concern raised by a series of public campaigns to save individual hospitals. All have been overshadowed by the fight to save St Bartholomew's hospital in the City, the most ancient institution on the closure list. In campaigning terms, it has been a brilliant, sustained exercise, even though staff at other hospitals regard the Bart's campaign as elitist and emotional. 'It has lacked nothing except artificial snow and a violin,' commented one senior manager at another hospital. It needed neither. Instead, the Lord Mayor of London visited Mrs Bottomley to plead for Bart's; the Duke of Gloucester made a rare intervention in the House of Lords on its behalf; there were services in St Paul's Cathedral; and an international brigade of alumni has written to the rescue. But the power of the Bart's campaign presents the government with a dilemma. The health reforms introduced in 1991 were intended to produce a more rational decision-making structure to the National Health Service, based on market principles rather than short-term political priorities. A decision to reprieve Bart's would look like capitulation to the campaign with the most political and media clout, rather than, for example, to those run by Charing Cross or St Thomas' hospitals. The message to the rest of the reformed NHS would be that political anxieties and vested interests can still beat the market. Another worry for ministers concerns the as-yet unquantified capital cost of a huge reorganisation - Sir Bernard was not asked to produce a detailed financial analysis of his proposals. In the 1980s, the sale of prime central London hospital sites like the Middlesex and St Bartholomew's would have funded new primary and community health centres, as well as redundancy payments; the current state of the property market means that this is unlikely today. Tomlinson's report was not the first to recommend change to London's hospital structure. About 20 others have been published in the past 100 years but, in the face of hostile public and professional opinion, little has happened. The public does not like hospital closures. Arguments to justify them - based on changes in patient flows, service provision, lengths of stay and medical technology - are often dense. They cannot compete with the instinctive, lay counter-argument that it must be wrong to close famous institutions dedicated to the saving of life. The latest restructuring attempt, however, began more promisingly for proponents of strong action than many previous ones. The Tomlinson inquiry was timed to report just after the general election, in the period of a government's life when tough action stands most chance of being taken. Its central recommendation is that resources be shifted from hospital beds to the capital's relatively poor-quality family doctor and community services. Critics worry whether, in the present state of public spending, the government will invest enough in local services to make Tomlinson's vision work. But the principle of shifting resources is widely endorsed. Expensive beds in London teaching hospitals are regularly taken by elderly patients: even when their medical treatment has been completed, they cannot be discharged because of deficient community facilities. Nearly half the capital's family doctors work from sub-standard premises. In a political bonus for the government, the British Medical Association and Royal College of Nursing endorsed the principle of hospital closures, although many of their members' jobs would disappear. If the government were now to back away from the large-scale closure programme, it would still have to provide funds for London's teaching hospitals. This financial year, they will receive a Pounds 50m subsidy. Health authority members in areas of the country with growing populations - and marginal Conservative constituencies - are complaining that their districts are underfunded because of over-provision in London. Mr Peter Fairey, chief executive of the Royal London hospital, was administrator of North East Thames regional health authority in the early 1980s, and took part in an earlier examination of hospital provision in inner London. 'We came to similar conclusions to Tomlinson,' he says. 'There had been another exercise in the early 1970s and that came to similar conclusions as well. 'The scale of the problem changes every time decisions are avoided, but people who study the issue always conclude that London cannot justify or sustain its present number of hospitals.' Ms Virginia Beardshaw, director of the London initiative of the King's Fund health policy unit - which also favours shifting resources from hospitals to community services - says: 'The government is between the devil and the deep blue sea. It faces political concerns about hospital closures on the one hand, and the continuing financial problems of the hospitals on the other.' Those ministers who fear that hospital closures threaten fresh political turmoil will argue for the deep blue sea, where things at least have a chance of drifting. Mrs Bottomley could make a statement of principle this month, leaving firmer decisions until later in the year when reviews of the allocation of specialist services in London have been completed. With a little dust on its cover, the Tomlinson report could soon look indistinguishable from its 20 unimplemented predecessors. Many of the London teaching hospitals, however, are in an even weaker financial position than their managers admit. Health authorities in outer London and the home counties have made it clear that they prefer to treat patients locally, and this trend is likely to increase as contracts for treatment - based on established service patterns in the early years of the NHS reforms - become more flexible. Sir Bernard's report leaves no doubt about what he thinks would happen if his recommendations were shelved. 'Change is inevitable, owing to the forces of the internal market highlighting inequity and inefficiency in the present distribution of hospital facilities. If this change is not managed firmly - and in certain cases, ur-gently - the result will be a haphazard deterioration in health services in London.' That deterioration would mean bed closures and cancelled operations - and it would be exacerbated by the current tight public spending pressures on the NHS. The government may fear the political repercussions of announcing hospital closures now. But if Mrs Bottomley's tough decisions are deferred, the financial position of the London hospitals is likely to worsen every year, and reach crisis point before the next general election - when the political pressures would be even more acute.  -------------------------------------   LONDON'S MOST VULNERABLE HOSPITALS  -------------------------------------                           Local                         population  ------------------------------------- UCH                       80,153 Middlesex                 80,153 Bart's                    34,775 St. Thomas's              84,373 Royal London             139,070 Charing Cross            115,139 Guy's                     75,969 St. Mary's               132,380 Royal Free               144,186 St. George's             273,042 King's                   265,723  ------------------------------------- Source: Tomlinson Report  -------------------------------------</p>

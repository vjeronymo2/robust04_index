			<p>BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, April 12 (CTK) -- The Muslim-Croatian  federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina will remain only a first step  toward an already problematic peace if the international  community does not aid in searching for a solution to the  Serbian nationality question, Slovene President Milan Kucan told  CTK.    Kucan is one of the seven Central European presidents who  will meet for informal talks in Litomysl, East Bohemia, on  Friday and Saturday at the invitation of Czech President Vaclav  Havel.    It is necessary to seek a solution to the problem of Serbian  minority rights in Croatia as well as Albanian and Hungarian  minority rights in Serbia, Kucan said.    For nationally homogeneous Slovenia, however, Kucan said he  sees no possibility for any kind of political union with the  lands of the former Yugoslavia any time in the future. But  after the war Slovenia would be willing to cooperate with  countries on ex-Yugoslav territory in a variety of fields on the  same basis as other European countries.    Kucan said that Slovenia had never belonged to the Balkans  either historically, culturally or even geographically, and  pointed out that Slovenia and the Czech Republic have always  been close and always belonged to Europe, despite its unnatural  division between 1945 and 1989.    However, the lack of understanding of the Balkans and its  traditional instability is one of the main reasons Europe  squandered so many chances to prevent, and later end, the war.    With regard to European integration, Slovenia has the same  kinds of capabilities and obstacles as other countries of the  former communist bloc, and likewise requires both time and  support to adapt itself to European institutions, Kucan said.    He also expressed his belief that the Czech Republic and  Slovenia, with their historical traditions and hidden economic,  scientific and cultural potential, could help make the common  European house a "functional and successful arena" where all  would be equal.</p>

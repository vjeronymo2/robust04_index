			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Order, order, as MPs stock up: The Palace of Westminster's retail success story Deep in the Palace of Westminster - between Strangers' Bar and the staircase to the members' tearoom - business is brisk in the most successful small retail outlet in the country. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, in sports jacket and corduroys, peruses the list of chocolates, alcoholic beverages and accessories, all bearing the distinctive House of Commons portcullis, before making his selection. Mr Tony Banks, never at a loss for a quip, has just told Mr Clarke that if the whole economy was doing as well as this little shop, Britain would be a happier place. After purchasing his bulk order, the Labour MP for Newham North West explains that each year he dons his Father Christmas hat and gives mints and wine to those who have helped in his constituency advice surgery. Goods from the shop - which range from gunpowder mustard to jacquard-lined dress wallets - are also 'useful for raffle prizes at constituencies', he says. A few minutes later a denim-jacketed Mr Calum MacDonald prepares to lug a cardboard box full of sherry and mints towards the members' staircase. As Labour MP for the remote Western Isles, Mr MacDonald faces the problem of trying to 'clamber aboard the shuttle' with his acquisitions. He, more than most, appreciates the MPs' privilege of being able to have their whisky orders sent direct to their constituencies. The shop's merchandise, he says, makes popular presents in hospitals and old people's homes. Measured by sales per sq ft, this tiny souvenir kiosk outstrips all British rivals. And as with the retail trade in general, the approach to Christmas is by far its busiest period. On the heaviest days, Mr Jose Alba, Mr Fidel Benserghine and its other green-jacketed stewards say they can shift as many as 2,500 to 3,000 boxes of mints and up to 25 boxes of whisky. According to Mrs Sue Harrison, director of catering services at the Commons, December accounts for nearly a third of the annual sales of Pounds 670,000. This turnover is doubly impressive as, according to a recent catering committee report, there has been 'a restriction on the amount of stock which can be available in the kiosk'. It ran out of chocolates for two days this month. A notice to customers says: 'Unfortunately, the after-dinner mints, coffee creams and orange creams will not reappear before Christmas due to a manufacturers' packaging deficiency.' Sales are also, at present, generated predominantly from the 651 MPs and 3,000 or so others who work in the palace. But proposals are afoot to change this. Subject to various approvals, a new kiosk - more easily accessible to the 800 tourists a day who visit the Commons - may soon be erected in Westminster Hall. The new facility could be operating after next year's summer recess and in time for next Christmas. There are even plans for a visitor centre, but these are not expected to come to fruition until early next century.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Arts: Ashton's shadow over a sad Sylvia - Ballet Delibes' Sylvia is a marvel. Whatever the failings of the first libretto, an Ecole pompier confection of classical Greek cliches, Delibes was inspired to produce one of the masterpieces of French music. A profusion of melody, wit in orchestration, and that rarest of commodities, true charm, have lured choreographers to the score, but with no lasting success. The most notable, and most felicitous, creator was surely Frederick Ashton, whose 1952 staging for the Royal Ballet was crammed with wonderful dances, as elegant in style, and as mellifluously touching, as the music. Delightful as this version was Ashton was beset by doubts, as he so often was about his work. He abbreviated it in 1967, when he should have been urged to preserve it intact, and the piece has been absent from the repertory for 25 years. What we lost was, I think, a masterpiece, enhanced at every turn by the brilliant designs of Robin and Christopher Ironside. These, like Ashton's choreography, looked affectionately at Sylvia's narrative, at its period charm, at the score's abundant felicities, and made them vivid and adorable in the theatre. This was never a 'serious' piece, but its lightness of touch, its abiding wit, were ideal. It should have been brought back to the stage years ago, not as an act of pietism, but as testimony to Ashton's genius in its greatest years. (I have been told that a full filmed record exists in the Covent Garden archives). The loss of this production struck me all the more piercingly on Tuesday night as I watched David Bintley's new version for Birmingham Royal Ballet, with designs by Sue Blane. In a programme note, Bintley indicates that he thought the old scenario too weak, and he has thus revised it. The result is, to my eyes, more foolish than the original. It mixes periods, confronting Diana and her huntresses with the hero, Aminta, entering in dinner jacket at the wheel of a motor car. Eros, the deus ex this particular machina, is an old buffer in modern dress; Orion, the villain, is seen in antique rig and then in dinner jacket; Sylvia swaps chiffon for a little black dress. The action veers between brutal lechery and a routine for camp pirates. I could believe neither in the narrative conventions implicit in the music nor in Bintley's need to up-date them by inserting modish elements about sexual identity, nor his depressing reliance upon cheap jokes. The result might seem less dismal were there buoyant choreography to carry us over anachronism and dramatic illogicality. Bintley's usual fluency and inventiveness seem less than effective, and he is in no way helped by Sue Blane's lumpen designs. The sets resemble Christmas grottos in a down-market store , and hem in the dance area; costuming is unflattering, dull. Performances at the official first night in Birmingham on Tuesday struck me as less than happy. Miyako Yoshida, so sweet and brilliant in style, looked lost and was not shown off by choreography for a role that is curiously shadowy. Kevin O'Hare ran the gamut of Aminta's anguish (the character is blinded early on in this version), but was seriously o'erparted by the dancing. Joseph Cipolla was Orion as charmless brute; Michael O'Hare, as Eros, has a role in which he must display a great deal too much charm. Diana and her huntresses appear at odds with their dances throughout. The staging is, alas, misconceived, and less than happily performed. The proper amends to Delibes, and to the idea of Sylvia as a wonderfully enoyable ballet, would be a revival of the Ashton / Ironside production at Covent Garden.

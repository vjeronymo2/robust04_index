			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SHOWDOWN ANTICIPATED OVER FUTURE OF MIRALESTE  </P> <P> At an acrimonious school board meeting last week, residents of the east side of  the Palos Verdes Peninsula accused the board of bad faith in its offer to keep  open Miraleste High School by converting it to an intermediate school.  </P> <P> The rebuff of the board's offer sets the stage for a showdown between the Palos  Verdes Unified School District, which has planned to close the school, and a  parents group known as the East Peninsula Education Council, which wants to  keep Miraleste open as a high school.  </P> <P> The proposal to keep Miraleste open, but as an intermediate school for 350 to  425 pupils in grades six to eight, was made last month by school board members  hoping to avoid continued legal and jurisdictional confrontations.  </P> <P> School board officials say that because of declining enrollment, the district  no longer can afford to operate three high schools on the Palos Verdes  Peninsula. Closing one would save money and enable the district to maintain a  full educational program at the remaining two.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Net $600,000  </P> <P> Converting Miraleste to an intermediate school would save about half as much as  an outright closure but would nevertheless net the district $600,000 a year,  according to school officials.  </P> <P> In return for keeping Miraleste open as an intermediate school, the board wants  the parents group to drop a lawsuit over the closure effort. It also wants the  group to stop attempts to secede from the Palos Verdes school district and form  a separate school district for the less populous east side.  </P> <P> Crunch points are coming up in both efforts.  </P> <P> The State Board of Education is scheduled to vote on a petition seeking an East  Peninsula school district at its March 7-8 meeting.  </P> <P> In the court case, school officials are close to commencing work on an  environmental impact report sought by the lawsuit. The report, which could cost  $100,000, was ordered by the judge in the case.  </P> <P> At the meeting Thursday night, Tom Jankovich, chairman of the parents group,  praised the school board for agreeing "in principle" that Miraleste could  continue to function as a school.  </P> <P> But he accused the board of negotiating in bad faith because of discussions it  has held with Marymount College officials to use a portion of the Miraleste  facility, which can accommodate 1,300 students, or perhaps to swap college and  school facilities. Jankovich said the parents group learned of those  discussions from college officials.  </P> <P> "Needless to say, we were understandably dismayed at the district's parallel  and mutually exclusive discussions, which were evidently being carried on  toward incompatible ends," Jankovich told the board.  </P> <P> "There are those in the community who take a dim view of having sixth graders  mixing with college students on the same campus."  </P> <P> Board President Jeffrey N. Younggren said he was stunned at the parents group's  response. "I don't understand how the Marymount issue has anything to do with  the proposal. It is a red herring," he said. Younggren said school officials  had openly discussed Marymount's use of the facility before the compromise  proposal was formulated, as one way to increase school district revenues.  </P> <P> "To have it distorted as a secret maneuver is ridiculous," he said. "What I  want to hear from EPEC is, are they willing to deal?"  </P> <P> Other board members said they were frustrated because the parents group did not  express any interest in settling the controversy and instead chose to attack  the board.  </P> <P> "I resent very much any innuendo that we have negotiated in bad faith or with  ulterior motives," said board member Joseph Sanford.  </P> <P> He said he believes that the east-side group's concerns about Marymount's  possible use of the facility could be negotiated satisfactorily.He promised to  attend a meeting of the group Wednesday evening in the Miraleste school library  to hear other concerns about the proposal.  </P> <P> After the school board meeting, members of the parents group said it would be  difficult to stop legal proceedings or call off the secession movement.  </P> <P> About 5,600 East Peninsula residents signed petitions seeking secession from  the Palos Verdes Unified School District.Although the parents group organized  the signature drive, it does not have the power to retract the petitions,  according to Bob Lyon, chairman of its legal committee.  </P> <P> Members also are reluctant to make any agreement with the school board that  cannot be binding on subsequent boards. Lyon said the group's lawyers are  researching whether an agreement that is part of a court order could have such  binding power. The attorney for the school board said it could.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 2 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry said  Saturday that it has decided to extend a measure to strengthen  the country's defense posture in preparation for an emergency,  which began last November and originally was to end at the end  of March. The ministry said the measure must be extended because  North Korea has kept heightening tension on the peninsula by  reinforcing its military training.    The ministry decided to watch North Korea's military moves  by  operating a 24-hour security monitoring system on the Korean  peninsula.    Meanwhile, the ministry lifted the special state of alert,  ordered for President's Kim Yong-sam's visits to Japan and  China, as of 5:30 P.M. last Wednesday.</p>

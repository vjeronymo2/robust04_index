			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Exide set to buy Fiat battery unit for Dollars 535m Exide, the US maker of automotive batteries, is set to become Europe's biggest car battery maker with the acquisition of a Fiat subsidiary for Dollars 535m, writes Richard Waters. The Michigan-based company said it had signed a letter of intent to buy Cia Europeenne d'Accumulateurs (Ceac) from Fiat. With annual sales of some Dollars 700m, Ceac is the current European market leader. It operates mainly in France, Italy and Germany. The deal is the third attempt by Exide to break into the European market in recent months. In July it agreed to pay around Dollars 250m for Tudor, a Spanish battery maker. Before that, it paid around Dollars 30m for Big Batteries, a privately-owned Welsh company. Exide said it would finance a 'significant' portion of the bid with equity, and that it would borrow from banks and raise sub-ordinated debt for the rest.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Five groups set to bid in Mexican media sell-off THE Mexican government has given investors until April 1 to register an interest in the soon-to-be privatised state-owned television channels, El Nac-ional newspaper, and cinemas. Five powerful groups have emerged as bidders, and reports suggest the winner may have to bid around Dollars 500m for the entire packet. The privatisations are intended to transform Mexico's media market, giving Televisa, the near-monopoly television company, effective competition for the first time. Televisa has about 90 per cent of Mexico's television market. Investors will be able to register interest for the entire media packet, or individual parts. Of the five bidders the favourites are Mr Clemente Serna of Radio Programas de Mexico, Mexico City's most successful radio programmer; Joaqin Vargas Gomez, of the subscriber-only television channel Multivision; the Aguirre family, of Radio Centro; and Mr Raymundo Gomez Flores, who owns Banca Cremi.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 25 (CNS) -- China has recently made  known regulations governing conversion of state assets into  shares in a bid to meet the needs of reform of the enterprise  system, especially the changing of state-owned medium- and  large-sized enterprises into shareholding companies. The  regulations stress that the overall restructuring of state-owned  enterprises into shareholding companies had first to be subject  to evaluation of their assets and prior approval was a must.    The regulations state that before the issuing of new shares,  the adjusted net assets book value of a particular enterprise  had first of all to be converted into the stake held by  shareholders. Should part of the assets not be turned into  shares, it would be listed in a capital accumulation fund and  the capital would in no way be changed into liabilities.    The matter of whether the ratio which the conversion of  assets into shares will employ is suitable has to be considered  together with the proposal for the issuing of shares and the  issuing price. The premium price for the issuing of new shares  should not be kept too low, otherwise the net assets book value  will not be fully shown.    The regulations also stress that the premium price should be  made higher in order to fully reflect the actual value of the  stake resulting from the conversion of state-owned assets into  shares.</p>

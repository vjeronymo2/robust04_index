			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report ZINC prices fell at the London Metal Exchange yesterday, although the tightening squeeze on supplies available for nearby delivery was reflected in the further widening of the backwardation (cash premium over forward metal). The cash price fell Dollars 8.50 to Dollars 1,379 a tonne, but with the three months position slipping another Dollars 17.50 to Dollars 1,273 a tonne the backwardation climbed to Dollars 106 a tonne. Traders said that, while zinc chart indicators were bearish, nervousness about the technical tightness might discourage fresh sales for the time being. ALUMINIUM staged an early rise, which traders thought might be linked to May option declarations, but quickly ran into resistance when the three months price moved above Dollars 1,321 a tonne. By the close three months metal was quoted at Dollars 1,317.50 a tonne, up Dollars 5 on the day, and the cash position was up Dollars 5.50 at Dollars 1,291.50 a tonne. TIN prices also rose in early trading. Gains were trimmed by profit-taking but three months metal closed Dollars 37.50 up at Dollars 5,937.50 a tonne and traders said the near-term target of Dollars 6,000 could reached soon.

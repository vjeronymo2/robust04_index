			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Arts: A fresh start THE OMENS were not good. On the lawn outside the Business Design Centre in Islington were 14 zinc baths riveted together in a sad circle (Legion by Gavin O'Curry). Fresh Art, the second annual show by graduates at UK arts colleges, looked like being as depressing and imitative as the original exhibition a year ago. But inside it is almost brightness and light. The students are in a much more optimistic and colourful mood this year. Of course, there is still the dear old-fashioned soul out to shock with an exhibit featuring a condom, but the armchair composed of tampons is well placed. The installation art, along with the videos, have been syphoned off into their own area, which helps the main floor display to blossom. So visitors need not get apoplectic about the future of British art. They might also find some good buys. The students are more reasonable in their pricing. The baths cost Pounds 2,500, but there are attractive wall decorations for Pounds 350. The London graduate colleges still stand aloof from the show, but this display is the equal of anything we have seen at the degree shows in the capital this summer.</p>

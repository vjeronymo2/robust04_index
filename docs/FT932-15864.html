			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Strong sales lift L'Oreal to FFr4bn L'OREAL, the largest cosmetics company, mustered a 16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to FFr4bn (Dollars 741m) in 1992 from FFr3.45bn in 1991. Mr Lindsay Owen-Jones, chairman and chief executive, said that the group had overcome difficult economic climate due to new products, notably the Lancome skin care range and Tresor, the fragrance, and a strong performance from the Synthelabo pharmaceuticals subsidiary. L'Oreal is subject to speculation about its ownership. The group is controlled by Mrs Liliane Bettencourt, the founder's daughter, who owns 51 per cent of Gesparal, the holding company that controls 55 per cent of L'Oreal's shares. Nestle, the Swiss food group, owns the remaining 49 per cent of Gesparal and hopes to secure control of L'Oreal. L'Oreal saw consolidated sales rise by 12.3 per cent to FFr37.57bn last year from FFr33.44bn in 1991, with net operating profits rising by 19.8 per cent to FFr2.59bn from FFr2.16bn. Earnings per share rose to FFr 39.50 from FFr34.70 The dividend increased to FFr9.60 from FFr8.40.</p>

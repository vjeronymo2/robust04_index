			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: RTZ shares rebound on 3% rise to Pounds 295m SHARES IN RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, yesterday rebounded by 22p to 514p after the group reported a 3 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1992 and said it would maintain its interim dividend at 6p. RTZ's shares fell 19p in heavy trading on Wednesday after investors became jittery because of unexpectedly poor results from English China Clays, the world's largest producer of china clay. RTZ's pre-tax profit rose from Pounds 286m to Pounds 295m. Net attributable earnings, which RTZ suggested is the most relevant measure of its performance, was also up by 3 per cent, from Pounds 154m, or 15.6p a share, to Pounds 158m, or 15.8p. Mr Bob Wilson, chief executive, said that, while the group's balance sheet remained very strong, it would have sent the wrong message if the dividend had been increased. No improvement in metals prices or trading conditions was expected in the second half-year, nor was there any indication that 1993 would be anything but flat. He said there would be no dividend increase until RTZ could see clearly the chance of a significant improvement in market conditions and earnings. The marginally better performance, in spite of lower metals prices, reflected Pounds 26m of extra volume, mainly from new projects coming into production, and tight cost control. Gearing was reduced from 27 per cent to 25 per cent but capital expenditure was down only slightly, from Pounds 149m to Pounds 147m. In the face of difficult economic conditions RTZ continued to press for efficiency improvements and there was a 3 per cent, or net 2,000, reduction in its world-wide workforce. The UK operations have been particularly badly hit with a reduction of 6,000 or 20 per cent of the workforce at RTZ Pillar since the begining of the recession in 1989. Group turnover was virtually unchanged at Pounds 2.28bn (Pounds 2.27bn). An extraordinary loss of Pounds 30m was recorded on the recent sale of a 51.5 per cent interest in Rio Algom of Canada.

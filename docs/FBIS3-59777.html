			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] A group led by professor Shiro Kobayashi and his  assistant Hiroshi Uyama, Department of Molecular and Chemical  Engineering, College of Engineering, Tohoku University, has  successfully synthesized polyester with lipase as a catalyst for  the first time ever. This is a new polymerization reaction  involving the opening of a &egr;-caprolactone ring, and the  reaction product has an alcohol on one terminus and a carboxylic  acid on the other. Its maximum molecular weight is 7700. The  group will attempt to make this into an optically active polymer  in the future by using group substitution. This polymerization  method, which forms polyester under gentle conditions and uses  simple substances abundant in nature as starting materials, is  noteworthy because it is such an environmentally friendly  process.    This achievement by Professor Kobayashi's group at Tohoku  University is a result of their research on a series of  enzyme-catalyzed polymerizations. More specifically, they  discovered that a polymerization reaction involving  &egr;-caprolactone occurs when the hydrolytic enzyme lipase is  used. In their experiments they carried out bulk polymerization  of &egr;-caprolactone using commercially available lipase P  derived from Pseudomonas fluorescens and lipase B  derived from Candida cylindracea [Candida  rugosa] as a catalyst without further purification. The  amount of lipase added was 50 mg per 1 millimole of monomer.    Polymerization results are shown in the accompanying table.  When the temperature was 30&deg;C, the conversion rate of the  monomer was only about 8&percnt; even when polymerization was  carried  out for ten days, and the molecular weight was only about 1100.  When the polymerization temperature was raised to 45&deg;C,  60&deg;C, and 75&deg;C, both the monomer conversion rate and the  molecular weight increased, and molecular weight increased with  longer polymerization times. The group also learned that the  molecular weight is reduced if carboxylic acids, alcohols, etc.,  are added.

It was also found that lipase  P yields a higher molecular weight product than lipase B.    The structure of the compound was analyzed by proton and &lt;sup&gt; 13&lt;/sup&gt;   C nuclear magnetic resonance. It was found that  the main chain of the polymer has polyester linkages, and it has  an alcohol group on one terminus and a carboxylic acid group on  the other. Based on the study of other lactone, cyclic  anhydride, and diol polymerizations, it appears that this  reaction mechanism is a new type of polymerization accompanied  by an opening of the ring. The group plans a more detailed study  of the mechanism in the future.    In any event, the group has confirmed for the first time  that  polyester can be synthesized under the mild conditions of  60&deg;-70&deg;C at normal atmospheric pressure from simple  compounds, including the necessary starting ingredients. Amid  increasing concern over environmental problems, biodegradable  polymers have attracted a lot of attention. However, this kind  of polymerization, which does not use reagents that require  special disposal after the reaction, is noteworthy from the  standpoint of energy efficiency as well. It appears to have a  promising future.</p>

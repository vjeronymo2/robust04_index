			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Yaohan International plans HKDollars 662m flotation YAOHAN International, holding company of the Hong Kong-based Japanese retail group, yesterday announced it is to raise HKDollars 662.5m (USDollars 85.7m) through a flotation on the Hong Kong stock market. The company has a disappointing track record on earnings from its core retail business, but profits have been boosted by property disposals. Investors are expected to subscribe because of the group's long-term China ambitions, and the impressive connections of its chairman, Mr Kazuo Wada. Yaohan's board of directors includes the former chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission, in addition to the chairmen of Citic Australia and China Resources. This demonstrates the level of business clout Mr Wada has achieved since he moved headquarters to Hong Kong in 1990. Yaohan International controls three listed companies in Hong Kong, which own local department stores, restaurants and food processing operations, but it will also be the primary vehicle for Mr Wada's push into China. The company has a 36 per cent stake in a joint-venture department store being constructed in Shanghai. The store will cost USDollars 100m to build, and when complete in late 1995 will be the largest store in Asia. The Chinese projects are all long-term, and the short-term outlook for Yaohan International is less dynamic. In the year to March 1993, property sales accounted for HKDollars 136m out of operating profit of HKDollars 264m. In the current fiscal year, property profits of HKDollars 170m are already locked in, and represent the bulk of earnings growth in a prospectus forecast of HKDollars 265m. Yaohan International is offering 247.2m new shares at HKDollars 2.68 a share, representing 25 per cent of the enlarged share capital of the company.</p>

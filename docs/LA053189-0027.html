			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'I DID ALL I COULD TO HELP MY SON';  </P> <P> MOTHER ARRESTED UNDER GANG LAW DENIES BLAME  </P> <P> Gloria Williams, the South Los Angeles mother who last month became the first  parent to be arrested under a new state law that holds adults partially  responsible for the gang-related crimes of their offspring, said that she tried  discipline and even took a parenting class but was unable to steer her teen-age  son away from gang involvement.  </P> <P> "I did all I could to help my son," Williams said in her first extensive  interview since her arrest in late April.  </P> <P> Williams has been accused by the Los Angeles city attorney's office of failing  to "exercise reasonable care, supervision and control" of her 15-year-old son,  who authorities said was a member of the Crips gang. The arrest was based in  part on snapshots found in Williams' home, pictures that allegedly depict  Williams posing with her son's fellow gang members and her other children  brandishing weapons.  </P> <P> In the interview conducted over the weekend, Williams called the prosecutors'  allegations "ridiculous."  </P> <P> "How could the police know about all the things I have done to try to help my  son?" asked the petite, soft-spoken woman who works as an assembly line  supervisor at an electronics plant. "All they see is a bunch of pictures of a  party and some writing on the wall. They don't see everything my family has  gone through."  </P> <P> Williams said the photographs from family albums that police claim show her  posing with teen-agers wearing gang colors do not prove that she condoned gang  activity. Williams repeated earlier statements that the weapons pictured in  other snapshots were not semiautomatics, but BB guns -- a contention under  investigation by police.  </P> <P> She said police spoke to her only on the telephone, and never made clear to her  that she was suspected of committing any crime. The questions, she said, were  all about the activities of her son, who is in custody, accused of  participating in the gang rape of a 12-year-old.  </P> <P> As a result, Williams said, she never thought to volunteer to police that she  had enrolled in a "skilled parenting" course that met each week at the  Community Youth Sports and Art Foundation in the Crenshaw District. She  received a certificate after completing 30 hours of course work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Participation Confirmed  </P> <P> School officials confirmed her participation in the course.  </P> <P> Arrested at her home April 29, Williams was charged formally two weeks ago with  violating the parental responsibility law, which was passed by the state  Legislature last year to combat gang-related crimes. If convicted, she could  face a year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500.  </P> <P> After her son's arrest, police searched the Williams home and allegedly found,  in addition to the photographs, one of her children's bedroom walls covered  with graffiti.  </P> <P> At a press conference after William's arrest, Deputy City Atty. Bruce Coplen  said the evidence "proves without any reasonable doubt that Williams failed as  a parent" because it showed that she knew about her son's gang affiliation,  condoned it and may have even participated in his gang.  </P> <P> Williams refused in the interview to discuss details of the charges against her  son for fear of incriminating her son.  </P> <P> But, wiping tears from her eyes, she insisted: "He is a good boy and we just  want him home."  </P> <P> Williams and her 20-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son live next door to her  mother in a working-class neighborhood just west of Crenshaw Boulevard. Her  15-year-old son, whose name has not been released because of his age, is being  held at the Eastlake juvenile detention facility awaiting trial.  </P> <P> A graduate of Dorsey High School, Williams said she moved into the small stucco  house five years ago after separating from her husband of 17 years. Since then,  Williams said, she has taken sole responsibility for raising the children.  </P> <P> She said that her teen-age son took the parental separation hard -- and his  troubles with the law began soon afterward. Police records indicate that over  the last two years he has been arrested for crimes ranging from burglary to  grand theft auto.  </P> <P> Each time he was arrested, Williams said, she would "put him on punishment" by  denying him telephone privileges and his house keys so that he could not leave  their three-bedroom home without her consent.  </P> <P> "I would ask him, 'What do you want to be? What do you want to do with your  life?' " she said. "I took away his telephone and did not let him have any  friends over."  </P> <P> Williams said she tried everything from scolding to spanking. "But when kids  make up their minds to do something, nothing can stop them," she said. With a  nervous pause, she added: "I hated to spank him because I was afraid that if I  left a mark on him, I'd be in trouble for child abuse."  </P> <P> Recognizing that her son needed stricter guidance, she enrolled him last fall  in a grass-roots alternative education program that provides classes for  students expelled from high school because of criminal or bad conduct.  </P> <P> Prosecutors identified it as the Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation,  the same facility where she took the parenting course.  </P> <P> Chilton Alphonse, executive director of the foundation, described Williams as a  naive mother who "did not know how to take control of her son so that he would  stay out of the gangs."  </P> <P> Williams said she volunteered to take the weekly skilled parenting course and  found it "helpful." She said when she heard "other parents talk about their  kids running away or being sent to jail for drugs . . . I was shocked. I  thought, 'Gee, my problems aren't that bad.' "  </P> <P> But in April, three months after joining the class and just as she was  preparing for a second marriage, Williams was stunned by successive shocks.  First came her son's April 27 gang-rape arrest. Police alleged that the  12-year-old victim was kidnaped from Williams' back yard and was raped by at  least a dozen gang members over a three-day period.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Whole Bunch of Police Cars'  </P> <P> Two days later, she was arrested. "It was about 4 (p.m.) and I was making out  some checks to pay bills, and getting ready to go pick up my wedding dress,"  Williams recalled. "My daughter yelled that a whole bunch of police cars were  parked down the street.  </P> <P> "When they came up to my house, I just thought they wanted to search the place  again," she said. "They put the handcuffs on me and I looked at my (8-year-old)  son. He just stared at me and I told my mother to take care of my kids."  </P> <P> Williams was charged under a provision of the 1988 Street Terrorism Enforcement  and Prevention Act. She spent four hours in jail at the Southwest Police  Station and was released on $20,000 bail.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Debra Gonzales said police had interviewed Williams about  her "failure to control" her son before her arrest, adding: "I know she was  asked whether she knew her son was in a gang and if she realized the  significance of the graffiti on the wall."  </P> <P> However, Gonzales said she was uncertain whether police explained to Williams  that they were looking for proof that she had tried to control her son. As a  result, Gonzales acknowledged, the mother may have been hesitant to answer  officers' questions, fearing that the information might be used against her  son.  </P> <P> "I don't know exactly how she was questioned, I wasn't there," Gonzales said.  If, in fact, "she has made efforts to curb his gang activity, that information  would certainly be relevant to this case," Gonzales added.  </P> <P> Ramona Ripston, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California, said it  appears that authorities failed to thoroughly investigate the facts before  Williams was charged with parental neglect.  </P> <P> Calling the parental responsibility law "vague and ridiculous," Ripston said  police and prosecutors "are desperate to try to make this law work, so they  went out looking for someone to prosecute. They want to show that they are  trying to do something about (the gang) problem, so they rushed to prosecute  someone."  </P> <P> Williams, who is to be tried on June 22, said she has considered "quitting my  job to keep closer watch on my kids, but we could have never made it on  welfare. . . . If they put me in jail, then what's going to happen to my kids?  Is that going to solve the problem?"  </P></p>

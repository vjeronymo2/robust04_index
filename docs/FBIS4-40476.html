			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Boris Yeltsin by A. Shkirando at </F> welcoming ceremony in Tuva; date not given; from the "Novosti"  newscast--recorded]    [Text] [Shkirando] Boris Nikolayevich, you have just  visited two very different regions of the country. How did this  visit help to convince you about the unity of Russia?    [Yeltsin] This is an interesting question. You see, the  unity of Russia does not mean a uniform way of living. It means  unity of spirit. It is the unity of people's attitudes toward  their motherland. I have seen confirmation of this in Amur  Oblast as well as here. In relation to the living conditions,  of course, there is a big difference. After all, when people  earn 300,000 rubles there while a shepherd here gets  100,000-120,000 rubles working in the hardest of conditions,  having to move his flock and his campside every 15 days--this is  not fair. This is a consequence of the mistake made on the  federal level in setting the price for wool, and this mistake  should be corrected.    [Shkirando] In the political sense, how close have these  regions become to you as president and head of state?    [Yeltsin] You should put this question to them.    [Shkirando] But what are your impressions?    [Yeltsin] I think that they did come closer.    [Sherig-Ool Oorzhak, president of Tuva] We think that the  subjects of the Russian Federation are getting closer day by  day, strenghtening our common Russian statehood.    [Kaadar-Ool Bicheldey, chairman of the Tuva parliament] The  visit of Boris Nikolayevich fulfills this task perfectly. We  will be doing everything to make sure our people understand and  appreciate this correctly. And we ourselves will be guided by  the attention with which we are honoured.</p>

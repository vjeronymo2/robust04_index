			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Electrocomponents improves 14% to Pounds 35m Electrocomponents, the electronic, electrical and mechanical components distribution group, yesterday announced a 14 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits, from Pounds 31.1m to Pounds 35.5m. Mr Roy Cotterill, chairman said: 'Our increased market presence coupled with the new marketing programmes and other initiatives introduced during the last 12 months continue to generate strong growth in both sales and profits.' Turnover from continuing operations grew by 18 per cent to Pounds 216.6m (Pounds 183.1m) in the six months to September 30; operating profits increased by 15 per cent to Pounds 34.3m (Pounds 29.7m). Earnings per share rose by 14 per cent to 11.2p (9.8p) and, as part of a rebalancing process, the interim dividend is lifted to 3.25p (2.5p). Turnover in the UK-based RS Components business rose by 13 per cent reflecting continuing sales initiatives and increased market share. As expected, RS's UK margins were slightly lower due to higher selling and marketing costs. New products, particularly mechanical products which are now featured in a dedicated catalogue for the mechanical engineer, were one reason for the sales growth. Mr Robert Lawson, chief executive, said the introduction of a CD-Rom catalogue in July had exceeded expectations, with more than 35,000 disks being issued to customers. RS International sales increased by 42 per cent, helped by the group's greater penetration of overseas markets, particularly those in continental Europe. Radiospares Components in France continued to show strong growth, while a significant advance was achieved in Germany. The Italian operations were trading ahead of budget and expected to achieve profitability as planned within 12 months. Meanwhile, Pact International increased its sales by 7 per cent and incurred a reduced loss in the seasonally weaker first half. The group ended the period with net cash of Pounds 65.5m (Pounds 57.4m at end-March). COMMENT Electrocomponents continues to produce the sound results expected of it. Net margins will remain under pressure in the second half as marketing costs continue to increase - but the group has proved itself adept at spotting and exploiting new domestic market opportunities ahead of the competition. Having developed and proved new concepts, such as the CD-Rom catalogue and trade counters in the UK, the group's strategy is to take them overseas and grow the international business. Pre-tax profits should reach about Pounds 83m this year, producing earnings of just over 26p. The shares, which gained 1p yesterday to 472p, are still trading well below their 12-month peak of 585p, reached in January. It deserves the premium rating represented by a prospective p/e of 18.</p>

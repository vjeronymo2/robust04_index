			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  staged a provocative mid-air refuelling exercise against the  North in the South Korean airspace day and night on June 23,  military sources said.    The exercise involved two overseas-based refuelling tankers  and scores of fighter-bombers and assault planes of the U.S.  Airforce in South Korea.    The reckless play with fire was aimed at increasing the  anti-North long-distance surprise attack capacity of the fighter  planes of the U.S. Seventh Airforce.    The U.S. imperialists deployed Japan-based pursuit-assault  planes and electronic jamming planes in U.S. Airforce bases in  South Korea on the same day.</p>

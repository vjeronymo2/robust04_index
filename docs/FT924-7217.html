			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Governor warns Indonesian banks BANK Summa, suspended from clearing operations last Friday with bad debts exceeding Rp1,000bn (Dollars 313m), had no immediate prospect of resuming normal activity, according to Dr Adrianus Mooy, governor of Bank Indonesia (BI), the central bank. Dr Mooy accepted that others among Indonesia's 215 banks faced problems of bad debt and poor management, although not on the scale of Bank Summa. The sector's bad and doubtful debts, excluding Bank Summa, amounted to about Rp7,400bn or 6.3 per cent of the sector's loans, according to BI officials. 'It's very important for the banks to look ahead and see whether they can still survive . . . given their capabilities so far as capital and management,' he said. 'Very soon all these banks will be screened . . . through the application of prudential regulations,' Dr Mooy added. Banks have been told to increase their capital to 7 per cent of risk-weighted assets, up from 5 per cent, by next March. He said that Bank Summa, the country's 10th largest private bank and owned by the Soeryadjaya family, had failed to keep to a plan agreed with BI for the injection of new capital. The first of three instalments, scheduled in three-month intervals beginning last September, had not been made. When suspended, Bank Summa owed Rp66bn to BI and Rp15bn in inter-bank lending. Dr Mooy said 17 private banks were negotiating to raise more than Rp150bn, in order to take over Bank Summa's small-scale depositors with performing loans. This would save depositors but make Bank Summa's restructuring even more difficult.</p>

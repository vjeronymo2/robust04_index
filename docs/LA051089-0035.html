			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COACHES TORN BETWEEN STRIKE, TEAM LOYALTY  </P> <P> City Section coaches wrestled with conflicting loyalties as they reacted  Tuesday to the Board of Education's directive that would allow them to  supervise their teams in playoff competition even if they participate in a  proposed teacher strike against the Los Angeles Unified School District.  </P> <P> The directive runs counter to previous district policy that forbade teachers  from extracurricular activity if they participated in a strike. The new  directive came in the wake of Monday's announcement by District Supt. Leonard  Britton, who ordered teachers to turn in final grade information Monday, more  than two weeks before the strike date set by the United Teachers-Los Angeles.  If teachers fail to comply, paychecks will be withheld, according to Britton.  </P> <P> In response, the union threatened to strike Monday instead of May 30. The new  strike date falls in the middle of the City Section playoff schedule.  </P> <P> Postseason competition has begun in track and starts this week in girls'  gymnastics, softball and volleyball. Also likely to be affected by a strike are  baseball, golf and tennis.  </P> <P> Coaches strained to interpret the implications of Tuesday's directive. Although  some viewed the move as an advantage for coaches, most criticized the action,  saying that it would force them to choose between supporting their teams or  their colleagues. Few had decided which action to take.  </P> <P> "The board is trying to throw the monkey on the coaches' backs," San Fernando  baseball Coach Steve Marden said. "This makes us the fall guy. They're trying  to wedge us between the union and the players. It's absolutely a no-win  situation."  </P> <P> Coaches also claimed that the directive was designed to shift parental concerns  if sporting events are canceled from the board to coaches and to undermine  union solidarity. Julie Korenstein, West San Fernando Valley board member,  rejected those charges.  </P> <P> "Our intention is not to undermine the union but to give teachers options," she  said. "It allows teachers to make the moral decision of whether to strike, and  then they still may participate in extracurricular activities."  </P> <P> But coaches feared that the strike may negate months of work toward possible  championships. Taft baseball Coach Rich McKeon has led his team to a playoff  berth for the first time since 1980 and considers abandonment of his team  nearly unthinkable.  </P> <P> "I want the playoffs to happen, and, if they do, I can't see me missing them,"  he said. "I hope other teachers understand the predicament we're in."  </P> <P> The City Section intends to conduct the playoffs as scheduled but has no  contingency plan in the event of a walkout. City Section Commissioner Hal  Harkness was busy Tuesday structuring playoff brackets and said that plans in  the event of a strike have yet to be discussed. He also said he was surprised  by the board's directive.  </P> <P> "That's a 180-degree turn from previous policy. I don't envy the coaches.  Whatever decision they make, they're going to have to live with. Nobody said it  was going to be easy."  </P> <P> Marden said that he feels as though he is living those words.  </P> <P> "All of us have great loyalty to the kids, who have invested countless hours,  and we also have a commitment to our profession. Supporting one is  counterproductive to the other," he said.  </P> <P> Marden and Chatsworth Coach Bob Lofrano plan to discuss options with other  baseball coaches whose teams have qualified for the playoffs. Many of those  coaches will attend a seeding meeting tonight at the City Section offices.  Baseball playoffs begin May 24.  </P> <P> Marden hopes to reach an understanding that would allow coaches to act in  concert.  </P> <P> Most coaches said they feared standing on the sidelines while their  counterparts participated in the playoffs.  </P> <P> "I want to see if we want to be unanimous and cohesive," Marden said. "I think  it will take the pressure off us individually if we act collectively.  </P> <P> "But I would feel awful foolish if everyone else is playing baseball and I'm  walking a picket line with Bob Lofrano."  </P> <P> Lofrano understands that reaction but seems willing to walk the picket line  alone.  </P> <P> "If I support the union and strike against the school district, does that  commitment change at 2:30 when it comes time for practice or a game? You have  to stand by your beliefs," he said.  </P> <P> Lofrano claims that the district could solve the dilemma by postponing the  playoffs. If the strike carried through the end of the school year and the  playoffs were canceled, those coaches are prepared to live with that outcome.  </P> <P> "The season is 95% over and the kids who were recruited have gotten the  exposure they needed," Lofrano said. "The playoffs are a fun time, but it's not  a lost season if we don't play them. And you're talking to a guy who has a shot  at winning the whole thing.  </P> <P> "Why won't the district shut everything down in the afternoon? I think their  priorities are off. Is the sports season that important to the district?"  </P> <P> Even though many agreed with Lofrano, they were left with a disquieting  feeling. What about the players?  </P> <P> Neils Ludlow's softball team at El Camino Real is scheduled to open defense of  its City 4-A Division softball title next week. He has yet to decide on a  strike stance but cannot see his team competing without him.  </P> <P> "In a strike situation, nobody wins," he said. "It leaves a bitter taste and  splits faculties. But my gut feeling is that I can't let my team down. I don't  know what that means yet, but I can't let them down."  </P></p>

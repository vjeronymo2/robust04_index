			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 25, BNS -- The first day of the Baltic  Sea states' foreign ministers meeting yesterday didn't bring  about an agreement in the Russian troop withdrawal deadline.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev after his meeting  with President Lennart Meri didn't give any definite assurances  that the troops will be pulled out from Estonia by Aug. 31,  1994, like Estonia and Western states insist.    Both Kozyrev and Meri, however, sounded optimistic. "I would  like to sound as promising as possible because it is our common  desire to open up a new page of relations," Kozyrev said after  the meeting.    The Estonian president, too, said he had a "friendly and  fruitful discussion" with Kozyrev about the still unsolved  questions that Russia and Estonia need to resolve.    The two parties seem to have come closer on the main  stumbling block, the issue of the 10,000 Russian military  pensioners in Estonia. Estonia insists that most of retired  servicemen should leave the country, whereas Russia has rejected  this demand and is seeking social guarantees for the military  retirees.    "I understand that the Estonian leadership is also  determined  and eager to look into the question of military pensioners in  order to solve this too," the Russian foreign minister told  reporters.    Meri said after the meeting both sides agreed that the  military pensioners issue isn't linked with troop withdrawal. "I  would like to add that we discussed in a very frank way the two  problems which are not interlinked with each other," he said.    Kozyrev didn't comment on this statement, although Russia  has  previously always maintained the opposite. Even before his  departure for Tallinn yesterday, the Russian foreign minister  said the military pensioners issue is a part of the troop  withdrawal question and that the two cannot be treated  separately.    Meri also claimed Kozyrev "fully agrees that we will  proceed"  according to the Estonian legislation and government decisions.  Yet it is those same laws and decisions that have earlier  invited Russian protests because they don't guarantee that all  retired servicemen may remain in Estonia.    Kozyrev said there are some difficulties in solving the  military retirees issue. "Some of them are probably related to  existing legislation and decisions," he said.    The Russian foreign minister wouldn't commit his country to  a  troop withdrawal deadline, but assured Russia wants to have the  troops out as soon as possible. The speed of pullout depends on  how quickly the problems can be ironed out, he said, and added  that "there is still time to meet this deadline."    The Estonian president, on the other hand, claimed he hasn't  the "slightest doubt" the troops will be withdrawn by the Aug.  31, 1994 deadline.    At those words, Kozyrev simply grinned.    On his way to the presidential palace Kozyrev made an  unscheduled stop on a Tallinn street corner where he spoke to  city residents. He asked a Russian woman if she was happy with  her life in Estonia.    "Life here is in some ways better than in Russia," she said,  but complained that Estonian citizenship laws were too tough.    Other Russians the foreign minister spoke to grumbled about  economic hardships caused by Estonia's radical free-market  reforms.    An Estonian said he was afraid that Moscow might restore the  former Soviet Union and reabsorb the Baltic states.    "Russia doesn't want to establish the old U.S.S.R. --  never,"  Kozyrev responded.    Some 2,500 Russian troops are still in Estonia, the only  Baltic state that hasn't reached agreement with Russia on troop  withdrawal. The 12,000 Russian military in Latvia will be pulled  out from that Baltic nation by Aug. 31 according to the  agreement signed April 30. Russian forces left Lithuania  already last year.    Kozyrev's visit to the former Soviet republic was his first  since Estonia regained its independence in 1991.</p>

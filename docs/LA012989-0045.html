			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCKIN' AND RACKIN' THE CRITIC  </P> <P> Will someone please inform Robert Hilburn that his feeble attempt at being the  weatherman of rock 'n' roll is not amusing ("Today's Stars: Tomorrow's  Legends," Jan. 15).  </P> <P> According to Hilburn, at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame there is a 60% chance  of scattered Los Lobos, followed by a 35% chance of Billy Idol. The high will  be 99% Michael Jackson and the low will be 1% Tiffany.  </P> <P> Tell us, Mr. Hilburn, should we take our umbrella?  </P> <P> RICK STEPHENSON  </P> <P> West Covina  </P></p>

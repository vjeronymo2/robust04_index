			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar production forecast to fall by 21% in 1992-93 INDIAN SUGAR production in the season ending September 1993 will be about 10.6m tonnes, compared with the 1991-92 record of 13.41m tonnes, according to the latest industry estimate. Except for the few factories in Tamil Nadu, the industry has completed cane crushing for 1992-93. The sharp setback in sugar production is attributed to the fall in cane crop to 230m tonnes from 249m tonnes in 1991-92. Indian sugar factories get to crush just about half the cane crop. The balance is used to produce gur and locally-consumed sweetener. Drought in many sugar growing areas and the industry's failure to clear cane bills in time led to a shrinkage in the area under cane by about 300,000 hectares (750,000 acres) to 3.5m hectares in 1992-93. According to industry officials the country's next cane crop will be around this year's level. Planting has been particularly disappointing in drought-hit Maharashtra, the second largest cane growing state in India. As sugar production will once again be low during 1993-94, India will not be left with export surpluses after meeting a domestic requirement of more than 12m tonnes. It may actually need to import sugar. The country resumed exporting sugar after a gap of six years in 1990-91 and the government has released 500,000 tonnes of sugar for export in stages during the current year. The 1993-94 season will be opening in October with much-reduced stocks of 2.7m tonnes, compared with 4.9m at the start of the current year. Alarmed by the prospects for the next year, the federal government has told sugar mills that for sugar to be produced between October 1 and November 15, they will be allowed to sell 72 per cent of production in the open market, compared with the normal 60 per cent. It has also offered a package of incentives to the industry to enable it to settle the cane bills quickly. The most important incentive is decontrol of the price and distribution of molasses, an important by-product of sugar mills. As a result, the industry's cane debts have fallen from Rs6bn last year to Rs1.5bn.</p>

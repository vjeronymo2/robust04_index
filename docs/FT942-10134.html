			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Ashdown rails at main parties over Europe referendum Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, last night accused the Conservatives and Labour of being 'afraid to consult the people' over Europe by refusing to offer a referendum on the next stage of integration. Launching his party's campaign in the west country for the June 9 European elections, Mr Ashdown said that his pledge of a referendum did not undercut the Liberal Democrats' fundamental commitment to Europe. He told a rally in Exeter that the people's assent to significant constitutional changes in Britain's relations with the European Union would reinforce its place in a strong, successful Europe. He added: 'Our message is simple. Europe matters because if we want a strong, successful Britain, we need a strong successful Europe.' But Mr Ashdown rejected what he called Conservative 'smears' that his party wanted a centralised European superstate. Instead it argued for a decentralised EU where decisions were taken at the lowest possible level of govern-ment. His speech came as Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, gave a fore-taste of what is expected to be a bitter election campaign by accusing Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, of lying. In a letter to Mr Hurd he said that the foreign secretary had used a speech yesterday to the Tory conference in Inverness to 'tell lies' about Labour's policy towards Europe. Rejecting the charge that the opposition would give up the national veto, Mr Cunningham said he totally supported Britain's right to maintain the veto on defence, foreign policy, taxation, and the European budget. In unusually vituperative language, Mr Cunningham added: 'You and your colleagues lied throughout the 1992 general election. We do not intend to let you get away with lying throughout the European elections.'</p>

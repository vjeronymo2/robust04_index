			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Banks marked down A welter of 'also-ran' recommendations in the banking sector was countered by the realisation that the sector index had closed above the FT-All share for the first time in 16 years. Rather than celebrate, marketmakers on the banking pitches took the moment as a perfect opportunity to take profits and most of the banks closed down on the day. The morning rise was partly prompted by BZW which issued a buy note saying banks had benefited from recession by being able to justify greater charges and cutting costs. Also, Mr John Aitken at UBS recommended NatWest and Lloyds after raising 1993 forecasts. NatWest was marked up 14 in early trading but sold down throughout the day to close 2 lower at 473p. Lloyds was 11 higher but closed a net 7 off at 541p and Barclays turned around from a high of 470p to end the day 3 lighter at 457p. The day's exceptions were Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland which rose 5 to 146p and 4 to 282p respectively. They benefited from a sharp rise in results announced by National Australia Bank.</p>

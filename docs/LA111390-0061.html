			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> DEVELOPER ASSAILS MAYOR'S COMMENTS  </P> <P> The lawyer for a development company that had its affordable-housing project  put on hold last week by the Ventura City Council accused the city's mayor  Monday of making "spurious allegations" against his client.  </P> <P> Attorney Mitchel B. Kahn of Oxnard said Ventura Mayor Richard Francis repeated  "false reports and accusations" against KNM Development Co. and its president,  Ernest T. Mansi, in public meetings and to the press.  </P> <P> These reports, Kahn said, were fabricated by opponents of a 147-unit KNM  affordable-housing project in east Ventura to discredit the developer and halt  the planned development.  </P> <P> Last week, the Ventura City Council voted unanimously to postpone voting on the  project, pending a city attorney's investigation into the status of at least 10  lawsuits allegedly involving development projects linked to Mansi.  </P> <P> The vote followed Francis' disclosure that he received information from unnamed  residents living near the proposed KNM project, alleging that Mansi and the  development companies he controls have been involved in significant litigation  in recent years.  </P> <P> "It is not . . . necessary to provide a point-by-point refutation to each of  the spurious allegations made about KNM Development Co. Inc. or Mr. Mansi since  we believe the city attorney will capably review each and every concern  expressed in the media and in the public meetings by the mayor and provide the  City Council with accurate information, which will reaffirm the good names of  Ernest T. Mansi and KNM Development Co. Inc.," Kahn said in a statement.  </P> <P> On Nov. 2, Francis said in an interview that a lawsuit linked Mansi to a  condominium project in Oxnard in which a roof collapsed. But Kahn said Mansi  was not involved in any such projects.  </P> <P> Francis was out of town Monday and could not be reached for comment. SANTIAGO  O'DONNELL  </P></p>

The full text follows:    Originally I did not intend to speak at the current standing  committee session. The chairmen's meeting yesterday decided  that it would be better if I gave a speech and suggested that I  address ways to properly convene the upcoming Second Session of  the CPPCC National Committee.    The upcoming Second Session of the CPPCC National Committee  is a very important meeting. Issues to be discussed at the  meeting are major issues affecting the overall situation and  concern China's reform, development, and stability. People  across China and all CPPCC members pay great attention to the  meeting and have expressed the hope that the meeting should be  convened properly. To properly convene the upcoming meeting,  the CPPCC National Committee has submitted a special report to  the CPC Central Committee, proposing guidelines to facilitate a  proper convening of the meeting. Under the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, the guidelines will promote democracy, realism,  unity, and motivational atmosphere. The CPC Central Committee  approved the report and the guidelines. I believe that to  properly convene the upcoming meeting, we must thoroughly  understand and earnestly implement the guidelines.    As I see it, the reasons why the guidelines stress  "democracy" are first, the CPPCC organizations' nature mandates  such decision. The CPPCC is an organizational format that  facilitates a basic system of multiparty cooperation and  political consultation under the CPC's leadership, and is an  important channel that promotes socialist democracy. Therefore,  a CPPCC meeting should certainly stress democracy. Second, the  meeting's contents require such a move. The upcoming meeting  will discuss many important issues. Only by thoroughly promoting  democracy and pooling the wisdom of the masses can the meeting  make correct decisions. Third, people across China hope for  such characteristics. The annual "sessions of the National  People's Congress [NPC] and CPPCC" have become a major political  event for the Chinese people and a hot public topic. The  Chinese people hope the "NPC and CPPCC sessions" will be  enthusiastically held and will yield substantial results. They  hope that the CPPCC session will strictly implement democratic  procedures, that the execution of democratic rights is earnestly  guaranteed, that a much more democratic atmosphere [nong hou de  min zhu qi fen 3426 0624 4104 3046 0031 3049 3050] will be  formed, and that the principle stressing the masses of people as  masters of their own destiny can be truly displayed.    The guidelines stress "realism" because our meeting is not a  formality merely for show; it aims to truly study and explore  issues. At present, we are striving to establish a new  socialist market economy. During the process, we are facing  many major, new, difficult, and complicated issues. We need to  comprehensively consider, carefully weigh, and repeatedly  compare these issues. While studying and deciding on the issues,  we should consider both the present and the long-term future,  both the overall and partial situation, both their advantages  and disadvantages, and both the current requirements and various  possibilities. Additionally, while listening to the majority's  views, we should also pay attention to the minority's ideas.  Therefore, during the upcoming meeting, we should adopt a  scientific attitude, and warmly, extensively, specifically,  comprehensively, and thoroughly conduct in-depth discussions in  an effort to fully demonstrate our strong sense of  responsibility and the extent of our involvement in  participating in and discussing government and political affairs.    We stress "unity" because we stress that democracy should  be promoted at the CPPCC session where participants should  freely express their views and study and discuss issues  conscientiously and in a responsible way. This being the case,  controversies over different opinions, criticism, and counter-  criticism will be difficult to avoid. We think this is  necessary and beneficial; at the same time, we must realize that  all these are for better results in studying and solving issues,  and are aimed at realism and achieving unity by proceeding from  the desire for unity. Unity concerns the overall interest, and  the overall interest is unity. The People's Political  Consultative Conference is a symbol of great unity. A CPPCC  session should embody and promote unity; and the result of such  a meeting should promote unity among the people of the whole  country. We hope that the participants to the session will  respect and learn from one another; they should show more  understanding and tolerance and reduce arguments. Through the  session, they should enhance understanding, eliminate  misunderstanding, promote consensus, and strengthen friendship.  In short, they should unite to make the session a success and  promote unity through the session.    The reason we stress "motivational atmosphere" is that since  the introduction of reform and opening to the outside world, the  achievements we have scored are universally recognized. Our  achievements last year were outstanding, and the current  situation in all fields of endeavor is good. However, in  embarking on undertakings which are unprecedentedly complex and  arduous in such a huge country with a large population as ours,  there are bound to be successes and failures; there will be  encouraging news and matters that concern people; there will be  a positive side and a negative side; and there will be a good  side and an ugly side. It is necessary for us to be soberly  aware of these objective phenomena in social life and to  thoroughly analyze, accurately judge, and properly handle them.  We allow criticism and exposure of all negative and evil  phenomena, but at the same time we also hope that in the act of  criticizing and exposing negative and evil phenomena, we should  not lose sight of the positive and correct aspect -- or the  mainstream. The purpose of criticism and exposure is study and  solution of problems. We should pay attention to social  effects, to the methods of solving problems, and to boosting  morale and enhancing aspirations. We should bring the drive of  the CPPCC members into full play during the entire process of  the session and, through our session, instill the motivational  atmosphere into the people of the whole country.    These eight characters -- "democracy, realism, unity, and  motivational atmosphere" -- are interconnected and supplement  each other, comprising an organic entity. They must be  thoroughly understood. To strengthen democracy and realism, we  must not neglect unity and motivational atmosphere; to stress  unity and hard work, we must not cast aside democracy and  realism. If we neglect unity and motivational atmosphere, we  cannot achieve good results in holding a meeting; but if we  abandon democracy and realism, it is meaningless to hold a  meeting; democracy and realism should help promote unity and  motivational atmosphere, while unity and the motivational  atmosphere should promote democracy and realism.    "Democracy, realism, unity, and motivational atmosphere" was  the principle adopted in 1990 for publicizing reports on the NPC  and CPPCC sessions. In publicizing reports on these two  sessions, we have applied this principle since 1990. In fact,  it has become a guiding principle for convening the two sessions  successfully. In recent years, these principles have been  applied when people's congresses and CPPCC committee meetings  were held by the provinces and cities. The implementation of  this principle in our current session is required by the  objective fact and also conforms to the desire of all CPPCC  members. It is hoped that all of you will thoroughly understand  it and conscientiously implement it. Under the leadership of  the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  core, let us conscientiously strive to make our session a  meeting for democracy, realism, unity and motivational  atmosphere.</p>

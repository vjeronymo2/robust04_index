			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Pikhovshek, Vybor, under the rubric </F> "Whom We Elect": "Ivan Stepanovich Versus Leonid Makarovich"]    [Text] Against the background of Leonid Kravchuk's  continuous statements regarding the "chaos in which the new  Ukrainian parliament will be elected," and the  "inappropriateness of holding presidential elections in the  environment of instability in society," the almost demonstrative  silence of Ivan Plyushch, the parliament speaker and Kravchuk's  main potential rival in the elections, looks quite telling. An  interesting trend is emerging: The more convincingly L.M.  maintains that "parliamentary elections" will not take place  (and the hypnotic persistence with which he keeps repeating it  begins to border on a call to boycott the elections), the more  Central Executive Committee Chairman Ivan Yemets and GOLOS  UKRAINY--both subordinate to Kravchuk--print documents on the  upcoming presidential elections.    It appears that Ivan Plyushch is indeed the obstacle,  against  which Kravchuk's hopes to ward off the new parliament's work ran  aground. The president's game plan is becoming increasingly  transparent by the day: to stall under any pretext--even, as  some people on Grushevskiy Street maintain, by resorting to  presidential rule--his own reelection; and it is only possible  to impose such rule by provoking the population to  nonparticipation in the elections on a massive scale. That  Kravchuk's contention regarding a "power vacuum in the state"  is, to put it mildly, somewhat exaggerated seems to be clear to  everyone but the president: The old Supreme Council, in  accordance with current legislation, retains its powers until  the first session of the new Supreme Council. Therefore, the  president's words may be interpreted in a purely human context,  as an awareness as to how much a person may not want successful  elections to the parliament, from which one may expect  anything--for instance, reaffirming the June elections or a  decision that Ukraine will be a parliamentary republic  altogether.    The conflict between the two parts of the nomenklatura has  reached its apogee. Ivan Stepanovich made an effort in advance  to ensure that Kravchuk would not have substantial influence on  the conduct of elections by, among other things, placing his own  people in charge of electoral commissions at all levels. "The  subsequent course of events," says a man who works on the  speaker's staff and is knowledgeable about the rules of  nomenklatura games, "was not difficult to foresee: Kravchuk's  people added a great number of candidates in the districts in  order to confuse the voters and thus get the elections  postponed." It appears that the only factor that works for  Kravchuk in carrying out his plan is the weather, since sunny  days may prompt practical Ukrainians to tend to more practical  matters than politics--for instance, vegetable gardens. There  are some signs, however, that Plyushch's people have considered  this possibility, too. "Ivan Stepanovich also is a skillful  apparatchik," says my interlocutor, "and some preparations have  been made in this respect, too" (meaning apparently the decision  to hold the elections on any day before 10 April of this  year--ed.). That is, as long as Plyushch can influence the  course of elections, there is still hope that they will take  place after all.    There is another substantial factor that now has been added  to the fight for parliament seats and possibly for the right to  be the president. The speaker's chances to claim the presidency  are currently higher than ever. It is quite possible that his  plans for the future presidency are the main reason why the  Supreme Council never adopted the package of laws defining the  functions and substantially limiting the rights of a "popularly  elected" one.    Undoubtedly, in today's Ukraine Ivan Plyushch is the man who  in real terms and to considerable degree shapes the political  situation. He has a phenomenal memory, incredible capacity for  work, and his skill in manipulating parliament is amazing: There  have been practically no instances of the Supreme Council  approving something contrary to the speaker's wish, or not  approving something when Ivan Plyushch wanted it approved. He is  very set in his views, and it is extraordinarily difficult to  convince him that the opposite point of view may be the correct  one. Only once did he admit openly at a presidium meeting that  giving L. Kuchma's government the right to issue legislative  acts had been a tremendous mistake on the part of himself, the  speaker. It was easy to see with the naked eye, however, how  hard it was for Ivan Plyushch to bring himself to admit this.    One can say almost with certainty that in the near future  the  determinant influence in Ukrainian political life will be that  of the relations, mutual counteraction, and tactical compromises  between the parliamentary and executive nomenklatura groups  headed by L. Kravchuk and I. Plyushch.    Comparing their chances, one observes first and foremost  that  the president is playing for "maintaining" the situation on the  current level, and as is known, he who stays in place loses more  often. Ivan Plyushch, however, is very interesting now in his  silent importance--the eloquent silence of a man who is  stubbornly climbing to the pinnacle of power.</p>

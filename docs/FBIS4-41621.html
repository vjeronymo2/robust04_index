			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Nekrasova] </F>   [Text] Lvov 24 June TASS - On the eve of the forthcoming  presidential elections in Ukraine, which are scheduled to be  held on 26 June, presidential candidate Leonid Kuchma has  appealed for support from residents of the south Ukraine, so as  to relieve him of accusations of taking a "pro-Moscow" stand.    He explains to electorates that Ukraine cannot survive  without close ccoperation with Russia. "One can hate the Russian  autocracy, Stalinstic terrorism, but what it has got to do with  contemporary economic cooperation with Russia," Leonid Kuchma  said. "I am against dictatorship of Moscow, but for equal and  mutually beneficial relations," he said.    It is difficult to say, how far effective this appeal will  be. West Ukrainian electorates sympathize with current president  Leonid Kravchuk. Three years ago at the first presidential  elections they had opposed Kravchuk, and had supported his only  adversary Vyacheslav Chernovil. Now there mood has taken a 180  degree turn.    Undoubtedly, West Ukrainian votes won't be decisive in  Sunday's presidential elections, but they can have a significant  effect on the fate of one or the other candidate.</p>

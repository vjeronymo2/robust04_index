Aizpeolea report: "Pujol Demands That Gonzalez </F> Accelerate Turnabout in Autonomy"]    [Text] Madrid -- Generalitat [Catalan autonomous  government] Premier Jordi Pujol stated yesterday that the time  has come for the development of autonomy, and that this cannot  be prolonged indefinitely, as happened with the transfer of 15  percent of personal income tax. Pujol made these statements  after meeting unexpectedly with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez  at Moncloa Palace for three and a quarter hours. This meeting  marks the official start of the negotiations on the turnabout in  autonomy that Jordi Pujol announced months ago. The meeting was  relaxed, and Pujol did not hesitate to describe it as  "positive." The Catalan head of government tried to minimize  the tension created following the publication of a document from  the Generalitat Premier's Office demanding, among other things,  a direct relationship with the throne. The report also demanded  protocol precedence in Catalonia for the Generalitat premier  over the central government's prime minister.    After reaching agreement with the Socialists on economic  policy -- which resulted in this year's budgets and the labor  reform -- Pujol is now making his continued support conditional  on an agreement on autonomy. Convergence and Union's 17 votes  in the Congress of Deputies are the key to the government's  securing a parliamentary majority.    Yesterday's meeting between Gonzalez and Pujol took the news  media completely by surprise, since the Generalitat premier  himself asserted on the previous day that it was not the time to  hold a meeting because of the tension created by the  controversial document's publication.    Pujol apologized for the deception. "We did not wish to find  ourselves subjected to news media pressure," he said, but the  meeting allowed no delay. Both Pujol and Gonzalez himself  needed to relax the political atmosphere, and the Generalitat  premier also admitted that this meeting should have been held a  month ago.    The Generalitat premier informed Felipe Gonzalez of the  contents of the turnabout in autonomy sought by the Generalitat.  He made five demands for areas of responsibility: Development  of the autonomous police force, regional planning, public health  funding, the reform of the peripheral administration, and some  other outstanding transfers. None of what he put forward goes  beyond the Catalan statute.    Pujol, whose visit to Moncloa Palace coincided with that of  Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, set no deadlines for  the negotiations on the development of autonomy, but made it  clear that they cannot be prolonged indefinitely. "There are no  deadlines, but they cannot be prolonged indefinitely, as  happened with the transfer of personal incomes tax," he said.  He also made it clear in a relaxed tone that what he is  demanding as autonomous powers for Catalonia is also valid for  other autonomous communities.  <H5>  "Now We Will See" </H5>   The Generalitat premier said that he did not demand replies  from Gonzalez. He confined himself to informing him of his  proposal for the development of autonomy and on that basis  issued the challenge: "Now we will see."    He only altered the moderate tone of his statements when he  answered a question about the reasons the autonomy process is  again at a crossroads by saying that "the Socialist government's  policy has been very reductionist and restrictive."    But Pujol tried to leave a trail of relaxation on his  passage  through Madrid, both during his meeting with Felipe Gonzalez and  at his appearance before the news media. For instance, he  played down the Generalitat Premier's Office document demanding  an agreement with the throne and precedence in protocol for the  Catalan premier over the central government's prime minister.    Pujol, after stating that he does not accept the document as  a whole, nor does he feel "guilty" about it, said that "the  Generalitat has never demanded an agreement with the throne."  With respect to protocol, he acknowledged that the Generalitat  proposed a modest reform in 1983 or 1984. "We wished to place  the Generalitat premier higher up, but never ahead of the prime  minister." In short, he said that the document was one of so  many ordered by the Generalitat in order to reflect. "We are  doing this in order to emerge from the circle of those of us  walking around Los Naranjos courtyard, reflecting and  reflecting."    The Generalitat premier tried to counter the impression that  Catalonia has won many advantages for its parliamentary support  for the Socialist government. He insisted that the only demands  met were the transfer of 15 percent of personal income tax, as  well as some economic measures for enterprises, from which  "other communities have also benefited." Pujol also tried to  relax the atmosphere by stressing that his conversation with  Felipe Gonzalez turned more on the issue of the economy than  that of autonomy.  <H5>  Five Points </H5>   Pujol tried to explain that the development of autonomy was  only one of five items at the meeting. The other four were the  European situation, the economic situation, the social and labor  situation, and structural problems of the economy.    In the economic field, Pujol revealed that Gonzalez forecast  an improvement for this year. Both in this issue and in the  European issue, the Generalitat premier showed his agreement  with the stances set out by Gonzalez.    In an effort at relaxation, Jordi Pujol even denied that he  raised with the prime minister the thorny issue of the  Generalitat's and the autonomous communities' representation in  the EC. He disagreed more in the case of social and labor  matters. "The government should have gone further in the reform  of the labor market. It must be made more flexible," he said.</p>

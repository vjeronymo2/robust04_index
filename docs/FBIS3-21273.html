			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-AHRAM in Arabic on 29 January  publishes on page 16 an approximately 3,500-word article by  Islamic scholar Dr. Mustafa Mahmud in which he attacks  secularists in Egypt as "enemies of religion" and "trumpets of a  foreign cultural invasion" of the country.    The writer maintains that the secularists' chief concern is  "to confront religion and slander Islamists." The secularists,  he says, "view terrorists and Islamists of all schools of  thought as one and the same thing. Categorizing them into  moderate Islamists, extremist Islamists, and criminal  terrorists, secularists say, is merely a distribution of roles  within the same trend, a backward and metaphysical trend hostile  to civilization."    Acknowledging anyone's right to choose his own thinking and  ideology, the writer contends that no one should go beyond this  freedom to attack religion and those who believe in it. "Those  in our country who adopt secularism as their ideology are free  to do so. If they use the sword of authority or the weapon of  the media to confront the other side, they will be dragging the  country to catastrophe. But they will achieve nothing. No  force, no matter how strong, can sow this bad seed in Egypt's  soil. Egypt can never suit the growth of this kind of thought;  it is the land of faith, religion, and prophets."    Commenting on the current debate on religion and secularism,  Mahmud says: "I don't think such debate could have started if  the stage had not been carefully prepared for it by the horrible  introduction of the so-called Islamic terrorism." The writer  adds sarcastically: "And because there is Islamic terrorism,  the secularist assembly must take the lead and rush to defend  our society, which is threatened with destruction."    The writer then cites a CNN report on CIA financial support  for Golboddin Hekmatyar, "who runs training camps for over  10,000 terrorists in Afghanistan," concluding that "Islamic  terrorism, which suddenly appeared on the scene to upset  balances in the region, is a creation, premeditated sedition."  He explains: "After the Islamists triumphed in Afghanistan, it  became a pressing American interest to divide their ranks and  create conflict among them to deprive them of the fruits of  victory and, more importantly, to turn Islamic rule into a  massacre so that no one would be tempted to establish such  rule." He adds: "If Hekmatyar is opening scores of camps to  train over 10,000 terrorists and then send them to particular  Arab countries for sabotage, this is his second mission. Through  its agents in Pakistan or any other agent Arab country, the CIA  will provide him with the millions he needs."    The writer states: "If they are sabotaging Egypt and  distorting its Islam so that it has no Islamic rule, then they  are mistaken. With the diversified composition of its people and  its position amid storms, Egypt will not choose `a professional  Islamist' to rule it. It will always prefer a civilian  government that respects Islam and preserves its traditions and  respects Christianity and preserves its values. No Egyptian  Islamist thinker plans to rule. The Islamists' greatest  ambition is to create an enlightened and influential Islamic  public to preserve religion's values and role in the social  arena."    "If they realized this," the writer adds, "they would feel  at  ease and let others rest; they would save those squandered  millions. But, most likely, they have a far-reaching objective:  Shaking the Islamic creed, breaking its backbone, and removing  it from hearts. But they, and all the money in the world, can  never achieve this."</p>

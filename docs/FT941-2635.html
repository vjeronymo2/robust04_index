			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / International Company News: Air clears around Bugatti - Cash call plans are forcing the carmaker into the open Bugatti International, which last year took over Group Lotus, the UK sports car maker and automotive engineering consultancy from General Motors, is seeking outside finance to fund the next stage of its ambitious expansion plan. Ownership of the Luxembourg-registered company has been a mystery since it was formed in the late-1980s to revive the famous pre-war racing marque. The veil of secrecy is being lifted, however, as it prepares to bring in outside investors. The company claims it is 100 per cent-owned by the Artioli family led by Mr Romano Artioli, a 61-year-old Italian entrepreneur, who for a decade held the distribution franchise for Ferrari in the lucrative regions of north-east Italy and southern Germany. This relationship ended in 1988. Mr Artioli holds the importer/distributorship for Suzuki vehicles in Italy, and controls a separate holding company, Fisico, with interests in vehicle retailing, import/distribution and components. Mr Mario Barbieri, vice-chairman of Bugatti Automobili, said the Artioli family had a combined annual turnover of more than L300bn (Dollars 179m). Fisico also held a 20 per cent stake in the Monfalcone car terminal, a port development near Trieste, which opened last autumn to develop car transport between southern Europe and east Asia. When Bugatti International emerged last summer as the buyer of Group Lotus it admitted only that Mr Artioli held an 18 per cent stake in Bugatti Automobili, the car division, which has built a factory at Campogalliano, near Modena, to assemble the Pounds 200,000 Bugatti EB110 supercar. The balance in the car operation was owned by Bugatti International. Some big French corporations - including Michelin, Elf Aquitaine and Aerospatiale - collaborated in the development of the 212mph EB110, and there was some indication they might have backed the venture financially. Officially, however, the shareholders remained anonymous. The company said this week Mr Artioli had been the majority shareholder in Bugatti International, the master company, from the outset in 1987. Artioli family holdings now had 100 per cent of the equity. Wild rumours have swirled around the European auto industry about the ownership of Bugatti since late-1991, when the EB110 was first unveiled. Reality was lost in talk about the sums of money being pumped into the development of the 550bhp supercar, built to outperform rivals from Ferrari, Jaguar and Lamborghini. The company is now trying to clear the air ahead of a partial public flotation or a private placement of shares. CS First Boston has been taken on board as financial adviser, and Price Waterhouse has been appointed auditor for both the Italian and UK businesses. Lotus, which was forced to stop production of its Elan sports car in 1992 because of heavy losses, is now working on an ambitious product development programme. Engineering contracts were being won from leading vehicle makers that had previously been unwilling to use Lotus under GM ownership because of fears over confidentiality, said Mr Barbieri. According to Bugatti, Group Lotus had a turnover of Dollars 53m last year. It suffered a loss of Dollars 6.4m in the first eight months under GM ownership.</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'CAREER' BURGLAR SENTENCED TO 34-YEAR TERM  </P> <P> A man with 12 previous burglary convictions, some dating as far back as 1973,  was sentenced Thursday to 34 years in state prison for attempting to burglarize  a Mission Hills home.  </P> <P> Danny Perry, 32, of Pacoima probably will serve about half that time, said San  Fernando Superior Court Judge Meredith C. Taylor.  </P> <P> Perry was arrested Dec. 16, 1987, after he broke into the home of Daniel  Rohrbach, a Cal State Northridge student, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Norman F.  Montrose.  </P> <P> According to court documents, Rohrbach arrived home while Perry was inside. He  grabbed a gun and ordered Perry into the bathroom, where he hoped to keep him  until police arrived, the documents said.  </P> <P> Perry tried to escape. The two men then wrestled over control of the gun, court  documents said.  </P> <P> "It is unusual for someone to get 34 years for one burglary, but he was a  career burglar," Montrose said.  </P> <P> Perry had 27 arrests and 12 convictions for burglarizing homes throughout the  San Fernando Valley, Montrose said.  </P> <P> Taylor said she believed that Perry should have spent more time in state prison  for some of his earlier convictions, which might have deterred him from  continuing to burglarize homes.  </P> <P> "You are articulate, you are intelligent and you have misapplied that," she  said. "You have a tremendous capacity for good and you have wasted 10 or 12  years of your life."  </P> <P> Perry jumped bail twice between his latest burglary arrest and June 7, when he  pleaded guilty to the burglary charge, Montrose said. Once, he was captured by  a police officer who stopped him for a traffic violation; the second time, he  was found by a bounty hunter working for a bail bondsman, Montrose said.  </P></p>

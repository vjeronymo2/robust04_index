			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / People: Clerical Medical, successor to Corley Some successions are smoother than others; the one soon happening at Clerical Medical, the UK's seventh largest mutual life company, with Pounds 11.5bn funds under management, is in a class of its own. For Roger Corley, who will retire in April 1995 as the company's managing director, has been with Clerical Medical since he left university. And he is handing over to another career-long Clerical Medical stalwart, Robert Walther, right, who has also been with the company since leaving university, in 1965. Walther will have the title group chief executive. Walther, 51, is a fellow of the Institute of Actuaries and an associate of the Institute of Investment Management &amp; Research. A former chairman of the Association of British Insurers Investment committee (1990-92), he joined Clerical Medical after graduating from Oxford university, where he studied mathematics. From 1967 he was responsible for managing the company's fixed interest investments, appointed deputy investment manager in 1972 and full manager in 1976 and assistant general manager (investments) in June 1980. He joined the board in April 1985. His current position with Clerical Medical is investment director.</p>

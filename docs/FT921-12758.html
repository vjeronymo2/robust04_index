			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Pollution monitoring increase is ordered SIX more government stations to monitor air pollution are to open this year at a cost of Pounds 3m, Della Bradshaw writes. The move, which will bring the number of stations to 16, follows wide concern about the quality of air in towns. The new stations will be in London, Cardiff, Birmingham, Newcastle upon Tyne, Edinburgh and Belfast. Friends Of The Earth, the environmental campaigning group, said the increase was inadequate. Ms Fiona Weir, the organisation's air pollution campaigner, said Germany had about 200 stations monitoring nitrogen dioxide, the vehicle exhaust gas known to aggravate respiratory conditions such as asthma. The six latest UK stations will monitor airborne fine dust and hydrocarbons, such as benzene, as well as nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone.</p>

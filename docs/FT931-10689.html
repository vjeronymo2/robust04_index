			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Books: The bible put to political use - The brilliance and charm of Christopher Hill's work THE ENGLISH BIBLE AND THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY REVOLUTION by Christopher Hill Viking Pounds 25, 466 pages TODAY IS Christopher Hill's 82nd birthday. Longevity seems appropriate in an historian, for although reading about interesting times is almost always better than living through them, it somehow seems that the historian who does both must profit thereby. Hill has certainly done so; a figure who inspires affection, admiration and controversy in equally generous parts, he is a colossus in his special field - the history of 17th-century England - and at the same time the only Communist ever to have been Master of Balliol College, Oxford. As if to mark his birthday with proof of sparklingly unimpaired powers, Hill here publishes another major study of the 17th century, this time on the influence of the English bible on those tumultuous times. Every characteristic of Hill's writing is on display: astonishingly wide reading, lucent prose, striking insight, compassion. And so too are the themes for which Hill has consistently argued, not least among them the conviction that the English Revolution set the pattern for revolutions to follow, in America, France and Russia, whose various makers looked back to the story of Charles I and Cromwell for their models and cautions. The 17th century is a battlefield of controversy among historians, and Hill is one of the leading figures in the debate. The controversy's background lies in the development, in recent decades, of a 'revisionist' response to the legacy of Whig history which long dominated theories about the English Revolution. Whig history is premissed on the idea that history is progress, consisting in the evolution of social and political institutions from less to more perfect forms. History is improvement; later, Whigs say, is better. Accordingly their judgment on the 17th century is that the increasing power of Parliament against the Crown represents progress, and explains the increasing liberty, wealth and influence of the English people. This, in a nutshell, is Hill's view. He has indeed been described as 'the last of the great neo-Whig historians'. In his celebrated book The Century of Revolution he invites us to compare England at the accession of James I (1603) with England at the accession of George I about a century later. James chose his ministers as he wished; Parliament sat at the king's discretion; Crown revenues still supplied most government finance. England was a small, poor country, with a one-crop economy and little international influence. In sharp contrast, Hanoverian England was the world's greatest power, its king owed his throne to Parliament, and Parliament completely controlled the nation's government and finances. And these, Hill argued, are only the bare bones of the story. James's leather-clad subjects became George's wearers of linen and silk. The former drank ale and dined off pewter and wood; the latter drank tea, coffee, port and gin, and furnished their dining tables with pottery and glass. By George's time knives and forks, looking-glasses and handkerchiefs were commonplace, and the Duke of Devonshire had an indoor bath with hot and cold running water. Such, palpably, is progress. But the 'revisionists' are not persuaded by the assumptions of this picture, in which the causes and consequences of the Civil War are seen in terms of Crown versus Parliament, with Puritanism providing the focus of opposition. For revisionists the picture is much more complex, with many local factors in play. The distinguished historian Conrad Russell argues that it was not a revolution that the 17th century saw, but a general breakdown prompted by three chief factors: it was no longer possible to enforce a single religion; war was no longer a private enterprise of monarchs but required funding through taxation, which fractured the financial system; and the problems of running a multiple kingdom (the Crowns of England and Scotland were united in 1603) proved as great as the very similar problems now faced by the European Community. So the Whig picture, revisionists argue, is insufficient. Although it is right to describe Hill as a neo-Whig, his chief intellectual debt is to Marxism. Marxist historiography's premiss is that change in societies is driven by contradictions inherent within them. In the 1930s, when Hill was at the beginning of his academic career and a new member of the Communist Party, the framework of Marxist theory offered a powerful counter to 'structuralist-functionalist' models in which societies are viewed as static devices for neutralising change and disorder. Although Hill left the Communist Party in 1957, his views continued to be influenced by Marxism, whose optimistic and teleological character is perfectly consistent with a Whiggish conception of history. In his new book Hill argues that the English versions of the bible which appeared in the 16th century, and especially the 'Geneva' Bible (so called because it was printed in the Protestant safety of that city, with politically radical marginal notes), had a wide impact on 17th-century society. It was put to political uses, chiefly on the side of opposition to kings and tyrants; it provided textual support for dissent; it hugely influenced literature; and finally it subverted its own authority by exposing difficulties over interpretation - for if each can read scripture his own way, its authority is no longer universal. The impact of this protean and revolutionary book was enormous and often unexpected. Hill's discussion of it is fascinating, and as usual sure to provoke debate. In paying warm tribute to Hill as historian and teacher, Conrad Russell this week remarked that however large the difference of opinion or robust the debate in which Hill is engaged, 'he always plays the ball, never the man'. That is a great virtue, and among all the praises that could be heaped on the head of this doyen of English history and letters, it is an apt one to single out, for it speaks of the courtesy of his brilliance, and its charm. Hill's new book displays both these qualities in abundance.</p>

Calculation of Adjusted Standardized Amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Standardization of Base-Year Costs or Target Amounts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1886(d)(2)(A) of the Act required the establishment of base-year cost data containing allowable operating costs per discharge of inpatient hospital services for each hospital. The preamble to the September 1, 1983 interim final rule (48 FR 39763) contains a detailed explanation of how base-year cost data were established in the initial development of standardized amounts for the prospective payment system and how they are used in computing the Federal rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1886(d)(9)(B)(i) of the Act required that Medicare target amounts be determined for each hospital located in Puerto Rico for its cost reporting period beginning in FY 1987. The September 1, 1987 final rule contains a detailed explanation of how the target amounts were determined and how they are used in computing the Puerto Rico rates (52 FR 33043, 33066).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standardized amounts are based on per discharge averages of adjusted hospital costs from a base period or, for Puerto Rico, adjusted target amounts from a base period, updated and otherwise adjusted in accordance with the provisions of section 1886(d) of the Act. Sections 1886(d)(2)(C) and (d)(9)(B)(ii) of the Act required that the updated base-year per discharge costs and, for Puerto Rico, the updated target amounts, respectively, be standardized in order to remove from the cost data the effects of certain sources of variation in cost among hospitals. These include case mix, differences in area wage levels, cost of living adjustments for Alaska and Hawaii, indirect medical education costs, and payments to hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the standardized amounts have already been adjusted for differences in case mix, wages, cost-of-living, indirect medical education costs, and payments to hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients, no additional adjustments for these factors for FY 1995 were made. That is, the standardization adjustments reflected in the FY 1995 standardized amounts are the same as those reflected in the FY 1994 standardized amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 1886(d)(2)(H) and (d)(3)(E) of the Act require that, in making payments under the prospective payment system, the Secretary adjust the proportion of payments that are wage-related (as estimated by the Secretary from time to time). Beginning with October 1, 1990, when the market basket was rebased, we have considered 71.40 percent of costs to be labor-related for purposes of the prospective payment system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Computing Urban and Other Averages Within Geographic Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Beginning in FY 1995, section 1886(d)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary to compute two average standardized amounts for discharges occurring in a fiscal year: one for hospitals located in large urban areas and one for hospitals located in other areas. In addition, under section 1886(d)(9)(B)(iii) of the Act, the average standardized amount per discharge must be determined for hospitals located in urban and other areas in Puerto Rico. Hospitals in Puerto Rico are paid a blend of 75 percent of the applicable Puerto Rico standardized amount and 25 percent of a national standardized payment amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1886(d)(2)(D) of the Act defines ``urban areas'' as those areas within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). A ``large urban area'' is defined as an urban area with a population of more than 1,000,000. In addition, section 4009(i) of Public Law 100&hyph;203 provides that a New England County Metropolitan Area (NECMA) with a population of more than 970,000 is classified as a large urban area. As required by section 1886(d)(2)(D) of the Act, population size is determined by the Secretary based on the latest population data published by the Bureau of the Census. Urban areas that do not meet the definition of a ``large urban area'' are referred to as ``other urban areas.'' Areas that are not included in MSAs are considered ``rural areas'' under section 1886(d)(2)(D). Payment for discharges from hospitals located in large urban areas will be based on the large urban standardized amount. Payment will be based on the other standardized amount for discharges from hospitals located in other urban and rural areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on 1991 population estimates published by the Bureau of the Census, 54 areas meet the criteria to be defined as large urban areas for FY 1995. These areas are identified by an asterisk in Table 4a.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 1a contains the two national standardized amounts that we are proposing be applicable to most hospitals. Under section 1886(d)(9)(A)(ii) of the Act, the national standardized payment amount applicable to hospitals in Puerto Rico consists of the discharge-weighted average of the national large urban standardized amount and the national other standardized amount (as set forth in Table 1a). The national average standardized amount for Puerto Rico is set forth in Table 1c. This table also includes the two standardized amounts that would be applicable to most hospitals in Puerto Rico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Updating the Average Standardized Amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act, we are proposing to update the large urban, other urban, and rural average standardized amounts for FY 1994 using the applicable percentage increases specified in section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act. As explained earlier, there are currently separate large urban, other urban and rural standardized payment amounts, and section 1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act provides for the elimination of separate other urban and rural payment amounts beginning in FY 1995. Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) of the Act, as amended by section 13501(a)(1) of Public Law 103&hyph;66, specifies the following update factors for the standardized amounts for FY 1995:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For hospitals located in large urban and other urban areas, the market basket percentage increase minus 2.5 percentage points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

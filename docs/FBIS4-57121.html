			<p>BFN     [Text] Passport issuance at the Federal Police building in  Sao Paulo has returned to normal, yet Army soldiers are still  guarding Federal Police buildings. The street on which the Sao  Paulo Federal Police Superintendency is located remains closed  to traffic. Some 50 Army troops armed with rifles have cordoned  off the sidewalks. No one has been allowed to pass without  declaring his destination.    Today, passport issuance returned to normal. Delegates and  officials of the Federal Police administrative area are serving  the public. Some 1,500 passports are expected to be issued  today.    This morning, federal policemen held a meeting and decided  to  reject a federal government proposal to maintain 30 percent of  policemen at work. The matter was not even voted on by the  policemen.    [Begin Federal Policemen Union President Lauro Trapp  recording] If the salary law is not complied with, we will not  return to work.

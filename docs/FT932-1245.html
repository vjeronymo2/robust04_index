			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Quicks pays Pounds 8.15m for Laidlaw QUICKS, the Manchester-based Ford dealer is expanding its network through the acquisition of Laidlaw, an offshoot of Goode Durrant, for Pounds 8.15m cash. Laidlaw operates five Ford dealerships in Scotland, Essex and Kent. The enlarged group will have 10 Ford outlets, two more than the manufacturer's current franchising policy allows. Quicks said, however, that 'Ford allow a reasonable period for compliance . . . any action required will only be taken following a detailed review of the Laidlaw business'. The purchase, which excludes Laidlaw's leasing side, is to be funded by a placing, through Noble Grossart, of 6.53m new shares, representing approximately 28.6 per cent of the enlarged equity, at 145p to raise Pounds 8.78m. Existing shareholders may participate on a 2-for-5 basis. Quicks shares rose 4p to 162p.</p>

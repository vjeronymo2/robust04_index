			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Growth puts Rinascente under the spotlight - Fiat-controlled Italian retailer is a possible acquisition target IMPROVED earnings and sales from La Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailer, could increase its appeal to potential acquirers. In spite of the deepening recession, sales last year grew by 9.7 per cent to L5,040bn (Dollars 3.16bn), while earnings for the Fiat-controlled group rose marginally to L102.2bn against L100.9bn in 1991. The improved profits, coming in spite of higher taxes, were accompanied by a L10-a-share dividend increase. Meanwhile, labour costs, a traditional weakness, rose only marginally due to lower wage rises and improved productivity. Though Rinascente's return on sales remains poor, the figures underline the view of Mr Giuseppe Tramontana, managing director, that the group represents 'the key' to Italian retailing. That role has pushed Rinascente into the spotlight since comments by Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, that Rinascente is not a core business. With Fiat facing plunging profits and heavy spending, the retailer is believed to be for sale. Fiat owns 51 per cent of the ordinary shares, with the remainder listed. The list of potential buyers should be long. Italy is one of western Europe's least developed retailing markets, with a excess of tiny, family-run shops and a dearth of the big department stores or out-of-town shopping centres familiar elsewhere. There are 82 people for each traditional small retail outlet, compared with 153 in France and 250 in the UK. In 1991, Italy had only 48 department stores and 124 hypermarkets nationwide, against 320 and 940 respectively in France and 340 and 610 respectively in the UK. Change is under way. Around 5,500 small food stores have been closing a year since 1988. Recently, the shrinkage has accelerated and affected the non-food sector. Mr Tramontana estimates between 20,000 and 25,000 small retailers went out of business last year. Meanwhile, the number of supermarkets has surged. However, Mr Tramontana denies that negotiations are under way to sell Rinascente. For many analysts, the obstacle is Fiat's demand for too high a price. Whatever the truth, Rinascente's appeal has grown thanks to its investments in new stores, which have depressed earnings but also made it a more attractive long-term prospect. Annual investments have been running at almost L300bn in the past four years. In 1992, spending rose to L420bn, although L130bn came from a sale-and-leaseback arrangement at one new shopping centre. In all, the group plans to invest L2,000bn in the 1992-96 period. Most of the money has gone into hypermarkets, which now total 18, and the SMA supermarkets subsidiary, which has grown to 119 units. Almost 60 new speciality stores for home furnishings, do-it-yourself and consumer electronics have also been developed. Turnover from hypermarkets surged 122 per cent in the period 1988-91; supermarket sales increased by 113 per cent; while sales at the do-it-yourself and home furnishing chains went up by 200 per cent and 104 per cent respectively. New openings have been combined with remodelling and closures at Rinascente's troubled Upim variety store chain. Modelled on the mid-to-lower segment all-purpose US stores of the 1950s, Upim failed to move with the times. Although often in prime sites, the chain of 157 directly-controlled outlets and 362 franchises has suffered from inadequate investment, leading to a tatty look and out-of-date image. Last year, 15 Upims were converted for other uses, while a further 21 were shut for conversion into franchise operations. 'We don't think the process is finished, with up to 20 more stores still to be changed in the next two years. But we think the remaining outlets can contribute well, especially at a time of economic difficulties, when this style of store can be popular with consumers,' says Mr Tramontana. Although restructuring and investment should make Rinascente a more attractive acquisition, some bankers question the conventional wisdom that it is just waiting to be plucked off the tree. Many say Rinascente's range of activities is too broad. Some purchasers might want the hypermarkets and supermarkets, but could be put off by the flagship La Rinascente department stores, which might appeal to a different buyer. And finding a taker for Upim, even after restructuring, may not be easy. Mr Tramontana denies that a break-up is the solution. 'It's not a business which can be divided, as all the pieces are interconnected,' he says. 'No one else is present in so many sectors. With retailing in Italy in ferment, any buyer will want to be present across the board.' That shrinks the list of possible acquirers to Europe's biggest retailers. Alternatively, Rinascente could appeal to a financial institution, either alone or in consortium, which would take it over pending an eventual sale or flotation, he thinks. In spite of rumours of behind-the-scenes talks, there are no clues as to a change of ownership. One of the market's favourite scenarios - a takeover by Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Standa group - is scotched by Mr Tramontana, who says that negotiations have never been held. Even the big French or German retailers, who have often been portrayed as the most likely buyers, have so far been cautious in Italy. Germany's Tengelmann bought a Tuscan supermarket chain in the late 1980s, but has done little since; France's Carrefour entered the Italian hypermarket scene enthusiastically, pulled out, and is now edging back. None seem over-enthusiastic about taking over Rinascente, making recent speculation in its shares, which have climbed by about 40 per cent since Mr Agnelli's hints last June, hard to justify.</p>

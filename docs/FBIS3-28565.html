			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii on Tuesday [8 February] evening voiced confidence that the  15.25 trillion stimulus package announced the same day will help  the Japanese economy shift to a stable growth track in fiscal  1995.    The largest-ever package reflects "the best possible effort"  by the government to turn around the long-ailing economy, Fujii  told a press conference.    Fujii said he can say "with confidence" that the package  will  have "great effects" in achieving a full-fledged economic  recovery in fiscal 1994 and sustainable growth in the following  year.    A combined tax cut of 5.85 trillion yen envisioned in the  package is likely to spur personal spending, Fujii said.    The Japanese economy is showing "steady" signs of recovery,  Fujii said, citing strong housing-related spending and brisk  investment in public projects.    The latest measures are likely to give further boost to the  recovery, he said.    Fujii said the package contains an administrative guideline  for the banking industry to solve the problem of bad loans which  is affecting many banks following the collapse of the "bubble"  economy.    The guideline is intended to reinforce a set of measures  contained in a preceding guideline which was adopted by the  Finance Ministry in August 1992, Fujii said.    The latest economic package, which is expected to bolster  not  only the Japanese economy but the global economy, will probably  be highly rated by the United States during the coming  Japan-U.S. summit, Fujii said.    He said his ministry has yet to decide on the scale of a  third supplementary budget to finance the package but it may be  agreed Thursday.</p>

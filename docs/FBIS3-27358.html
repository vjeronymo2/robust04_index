Chief Procurator of the Guangdong Provincial People's  Procuratorate, Mr. Wang Jun, speaking this morning at the  provincial people's congress being held here, said that some  4,246 economic cases including those of bribery and corruption  were filed in the procuratorial organs at various levels in the  province last year with 1,670 of them investigated and 1,249 of  these involving sums of RMB 10,000 [renminbi] or more, making up  74 percent of the total and 27.7 percent up over the year before.    From August to December last year, there were 905 such  economic cases in the province involving 1,036 persons and 677  cases involving sums of RMB 10,000 or more, 20 percent up over  that seen in the previous seven months while those involving RMB  one million or more were put at 29.    Of the cases discovered in the latter five months of last  year, 373 were committed by party and government officials  working in such departments as legislation, administrative  law-enforcement and economic management, involving 394 people of  which 19 were cadres of county or division ranks.    In a related development, according to the report by the  president of the provincial higher people's court, Mr. Mai  Chongkai, to the provincial people's congress, the people's  courts in the province last year handled 2,400 foreign-related  cases involving foreigners, overseas Chinese and people from  Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan with these cases covering civilian,  economic, marine and administrative affairs.    With the widening of opening to the outside world, the  foreign-related cases in the province have been increasing  annually with a 4.2 percent growth last year over that seen in  the year before.    According to Mr. Mai, the province last year handled over  900  cases regarding claims of returning housing property rights by  owners of overseas Chinese and compatriots in Hong Kong and  Macao with all these cases being properly handled in line with  relevant regulations and policies.    In order to meet the needs of opening to the outside world,  the provincial people's court last year set up an economic court  dealing with foreign-related cases while middle-level as well as  grass-roots people's courts which face a relatively greater  number of such cases also set up their corresponding organs to  deal with such cases.</p>

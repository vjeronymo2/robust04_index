			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> In reference to The Times' July 31 article on Orange County savings and loans'  first-quarter performance, your headline, "S&amp;Ls in County Post $92-Million  1st Quarter Loss," was very misleading and damaging to the healthy, privately  owned and operated institutions.  </P> <P> The government officially releases separate numbers for privately run savings  institutions and for those that are run by the government.  </P> <P> Your headline led the reader to conclude that, as a whole, the Orange County  S&amp;L industry is in dire shape. In fact, privately run S&amp;Ls -- 24 in  total -- in Orange County reported a $43-million profit for the quarter.  Government-run institutions -- four in total -- lost $135 million.  </P> <P> We are concerned that your headlines create a false and harmful impression  about the vast majority of savings institutions in Orange County.  </P> <P> W. DEAN CANNON  </P> <P> President, California League  </P> <P> of Savings Institutions  </P></p>

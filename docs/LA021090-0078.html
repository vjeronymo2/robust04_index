			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STUDY REJECTS BROWN FIELD AS NEW AIRPORT SITE;  </P> <P> AVIATION: FOCUS SHIFTS TO MIRAMAR NAVAL AIR STATION AS THE MOST PROMISING  ALTERNATIVE.  </P> <P> Brown Field could not be used as a major international airport because the  nearby San Ysidro Mountains would dictate much steeper takeoffs and landings  than normal, a new Sandag study obtained Friday by The Times concludes.  </P> <P> The study, commissioned by the city of San Diego, evaluated the possibility of  building a commercial airport at Brown Field.  </P> <P> Jack Koerper, San Diego Assn. of Governments special projects director, who has  been overseeing the search for a new international airport site, said Friday:  "It is our consultants' conclusion that it is not feasible to use Brown Field  as an airport."  </P> <P> That finding, however, clearly provides an answer to the airport dilemma,  according to Councilman Bob Filner.  </P> <P> "That's been the conclusion of every study over the last 20 years," Filner  said. "And this one just validated it once again. We're back to where we  started. . . . The only space available is Miramar (Naval Air Station).  </P> <P> "I realize that's a real problem with the Navy, but I think we have to enter  negotiations with the Navy at every level to get access to their facilities.  The Navy has more than just Miramar . . . they have five sites in San Diego  County. Surely, by looking at all those sites, somehow we can find some sort of  a solution."  </P> <P> Navy officials have repeatedly stated that they have no intention of leaving  Miramar, and that it is unfeasible to share it with commercial aircraft. Mixing  commercial and military operations would be dangerous, they contend.  </P> <P> Filner, however, said he is undeterred by the Navy's position. Meanwhile, he  called for the immediate implementation of the San Diego Unified Port  District's plans to make Lindbergh Field safer, yet capable of handling more  traffic.  </P> <P> "I realize that's not a great solution, but it will allow us to meet our needs  for the next two decades, until we can find another site or until Miramar  becomes available," Filner said.  </P> <P> The city of San Diego spent more than $400,000 for the Brown Field report and a  December, 1989, Sandag study that listed three sites -- Miramar, Miramar East  (West Sycamore Canyon) and Otay Mesa -- as possible sites for an international  airport if Lindbergh Field was close.  </P> <P> The search for a new site and plans to augment Lindbergh Field have been  debated for nearly two decades, yet no immediate solution is in sight.  </P> <P> Some City Council members have called for a "multiple airport" solution and  hoped that the study would show that Brown Field could handle commercial  aircraft and alleviate dangerous crowding at Lindbergh Field.  </P> <P> But the study ruled out such an option, eliminating yet another site for an  international airport -- which nearly all local officials agree is critically  needed. Local economists have stated that the lack of an adequate airport will  severely limit the economic growth of the region.  </P> <P> Filner's recommendation and the Sandag study's conclusion were not welcomed by  Councilman Ron Roberts, who has opposed any plans to expand Lindbergh Field.  </P> <P> "I've heard the conclusion, but I don't necessarily agree with it," said Paul  Grasso, chief of staff for Roberts. "We've had other consultants tell us  different, that they can develop an approach at Brown Field that's better than  what's available at Lindbergh.  </P> <P> "I think what Ron would like to do is find out what they're basing their  conclusions on and ask them questions about their conclusion. I think Ron will  have a lot of questions."  </P> <P> The study states that "the terrain would require either much  steeper-than-normal approach angles or much shorter-than-normal final  approaches into the runways from the east." The mountains would also require  "much steeper-than-normal departure climb gradients than would normally be  acceptable to air carriers."  </P> <P> Anticipating such a conclusion, County Supervisor Brian Bilbray, along with  Supervisor Leon Williams, led the board earlier this week to approve a motion  directing the county staff to work with Sandag and the Navy to find a way to  use Miramar for commercial and military aviation.  </P> <P> "We're at a situation now where there is no other option but to move Lindbergh  Field to Miramar," Bilbray said. "There have been people who have been trying  to figure a way to shove an airport into Brown Field. Right from the start,  because of the mountains, I could have told you that that's like trying to  stuff 10 pounds of wool into a 5-pound bag."  </P></p>

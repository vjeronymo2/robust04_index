Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 5 FIRES AT RUTGERS FRATERNITIES  </P> <P> Separate suspicious fires erupted within minutes of each other in five  buildings occupied by Rutgers University fraternities, fire officials said  today.  </P> <P> No one was injured, but 21 students were left homeless by the blazes, all of  which were reported between 10:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. Monday, said Deputy Fire  Chief James Riley.  </P> <P> "These were very suspicious fires," Riley said. "They were practically  simultaneous. We don't have any idea who lit them yet. . . . "  </P> <P> All the fires were out by 1 a.m. today, although campus authorities ordered the  fraternities to appoint students to stay up all night and guard the houses,  said Teresa Loser, dean of fraternity and sorority affairs at Rutgers.  </P></p>

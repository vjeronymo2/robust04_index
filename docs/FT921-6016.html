			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Beware the direct approach A NATIONAL television campaign is under way to persuade more people to use direct debit as a means of settling bills. The use of direct debiting as a form of payment has risen fivefold over the past 10 years with over 900m direct debits processed last year. They are now more popular than standing orders, which were used to pay 230m bills last year. A direct debit is an instruction to an 'originator' - a utility, insurance company and the like - or the customer's bank or building society to collect money automatically from their account. The system is handled electronically through BACS Limited, which is running the advertising campaign. Reduced administrative costs for banks, building societies and companies are behind the drive to get consumers to switch to direct debit. A standing order involves paperwork since the customer has to give an order to their account holder every time the amount paid changes. 'It is more economical to process a direct debit than to handle a cheque,' said Caryl Skelton of BACS. 'That takes administration, people and handling time. Using direct debit is much more cost effective.' Institutions are keen to win over the public by arguing that reduced costs are passed on. Norwich Union tried to wean its 600 or so policyholders who have standing orders to switch to direct debit, even offering a Pounds 50 bonus as an incentive. 'By doing this we will reduce our costs (which will directly benefit you); be able to allocate your contributions to your pension quickly and improve our overall administration service to you,' it said in its letter to policyholders in December. Consumers would do well to ask whether they benefit as much from direct debits as the institutions evidently do although they can be a useful and easy form of payment. The present campaign encourages the consumer to make 'bills easier to swallow' by spreading them over the year. This involves the utilities estimating what you are likely to use during the year and debiting the amount from your account in monthly instalments. In other words, you will be paying in advance for something you would normally settle after receiving it. For some people, usually those who dislike thinking about their finances or are disorganised, spreading payments in this way means that they will not get hit with large bills. They also do not have to keep remembering to renew a union subscription or pay regular bills such as the poll tax. However, direct debit does allow access to your account by others and it is as well to be aware of this. You are well protected in the case of a mistake since your bank or building society is responsible for making good the error (unfortunately, a lot of bank tellers still do not know this). If the monthly outgoing is variable, such as a mortgage, the originator has to inform you in writing two weeks in advance and if it does not and money is debited, the bank would have to reimburse you should a disagreement occur over the amount. But what of the case of a reader who suddenly found over Pounds 1,200 debited from his account when an insurance company decided (erroneously, in the event) that one year's premiums had not been collected? And you are forever in the position of reacting if mistakes are made rather than knowing they cannot happen. Most hiccoughs with the system occur when it comes to cancelling or altering your direct debit. If you change to or from a direct debit, you must remember to tell your bank. One reader found two payments of their mortgage had gone out of their account as a result of a changeover. While direct debits may seem a simpler more convenient form of payment, the onus is on you to check your statement to ensure mistakes have not been made. Those who fill in the direct debit form and forget, may be living in blissful ignorance of what is going on in their account.</p>

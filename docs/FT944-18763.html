			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Property: Two roofs over their heads - They make their living advising others on buying and selling homes. But where do the estate agents live themselves? Here five top names in the business reveal all to Gerald Cadogan YOLANDE BARNES, head of Savills' Residential Research, crops up constantly in conversation for her startlingly bullish forecast last December that house prices would rise across the country by 19 per cent in 1994, and by 25 per cent in prime central London. This year, she has been splitting her time between west London and the United States. From a lower ground-floor flat in Notting Hill (the Kensington end), bought presciently in April 1992 when prices were at their lowest, she has been spending alternate fortnights in Philadelphia, where her husband works as a molecular biologist. There, she carries on her research about the UK market from the 19th century stone house they rent in Chestnut Hill, a smart area on the north side of the city. While she is away, someone stays in the London flat to deter burglars and squatters. All this, of course, leaves 'no time for a cottage in the country. We go to other people's, or get out in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.' WILLIAM GETHING, who, with Charles Ellingworth, founded buying agent Property Vision, says: 'I have bought some of the most beautiful houses in England but I do not aspire to live in one myself. There is no nicer way to spend money, but I know what a drain they are.' Gething was married in 1991 and lives with his wife in a 'pretty, flat-fronted, 1840s-1850s worker's cottage' in Brook Green, west London: a typical and 'modest' piece of the London landscape - and only 10 minutes' walk to work. Before that, he was in Holland Park, where he could also walk to work. For eight years, too, he has been renting a farmhouse on the Dorset-Wiltshire border; it is part of an estate he bought for a US client. The house was semi-derelict but the landlord restored it. 'It is a lovely part of the world, head and shoulders above an awful lot of the south of England,' says Gething. JOHN HUNTER founded Northacre, a high-quality developer, in 1988 with architect Klaus Nilsson (after time in the army and with Savills in Sloane Street, west London). They began by converting what flats and houses they could find before moving on to 9 Tregunter Road, SW10, which the Thai government bought last year for its ambassador; and Observatory Gardens, W8, now in its last stages with 32 of its 62 units sold. The next project is to work on Earls Terrace, W8, the first terrace built in Kensington (1811-1815). 'We are very proud of selling everything within six months of finishing it,' says Hunter. 'And our bankers like that. During the recession, quality has been the key to selling.' Northacre's in-house architectural side makes business far easier, too. 'We pass drawings around and decide.' Hunter has just bought an end-of-terrace house on Clapham Common. Before that, he rented in Wandsworth for nine months (intending to be there six) after selling a mews in Kensington. 'We have moved five times in the past three years. It is the problem of being married to a property developer.' The house had been derelict for 10 years; the previous owners had been using it for bed-sits. He had to pay a premium price for its position but 'it was easy for me to assess how much work needed doing'. Most of all, he likes overlooking the open land of the common: 'It is better than looking over gardens.' Then again, as someone who grew up in Glasgow and took holidays in the Highlands, he is looking at an old shooting lodge beside a loch which he hopes his wife and two young sons will like enough to share with him. TONY PIDGLEY, co-founder (in 1976) and managing director of the Berkeley Group, is renowned in the property world for selling the firm's land stock when prices peaked in 1989, and buying plots again in the trough. The firm builds new homes in small developments under the Berkeley, Crosby and St George names. Many cost more than Pounds 400,000. Pidgley's own home is in a small village with a pub near Henley, Oxfordshire. He bought the old manor house, which was re-built in 1936 after a fire, for its 'views and tranquillity' - and its 14 acres. Recently, he has added a conservatory, which includes an oak floor scrapped by the British Museum. Pidgley has just sold a London flat in Lowndes Square SW1. In Spain, meanwhile, he has had a holiday home for many years at Puente Romano, outside Marbella on the Costa del Sol. 'My wife loves it,' he says. BILL YATES has been senior partner of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley for 2 1/2 years and in the firm for 30 years. Born in Wiltshire and christened in Salisbury cathedral, he regards himself as a 'moonraker' (a native of Wiltshire) and has a Queen Anne farmhouse in the beautiful Vale of Pewsey. 'We drew up a specification 15 years ago. It had to have enough rooms for five boys, be convenient for London by motorway and near a station, be in a village, and have a cottage with it.' Its chief asset, however, could be the garden. Yates and his wife, a family court magistrate in London, are serious gardeners. 'The owners two before us had two full-time gardeners, who did annuals and vegetables. The ones before us grassed over the borders; we put them back in different places.' Their London house is in Pimlico. His wife bought the lease in 1965 and they acquired the freehold from the Grosvenor Estate in 1979. 'We are lucky there, too. We have got a garden.' Yates notes that, provided things are kept where they are needed, 'it is a complete pleasure living in two houses'.</p>

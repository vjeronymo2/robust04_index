			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE: LOVE AND DEATH AND CLOROX  </P> <P> THE FILM: "Hamlet," directed by Franco Zeffirelli and written by . . . well,  you know.  </P> <P> THE CLIFF NOTES REMINDER: Hamlet (Mel Gibson), the great and melancholy Dane,  gets the word from the ghost of his father the king (Paul Scofield) that Uncle  Claudius (Alan Bates) murdered Dad and married Mom (Glenn Close). Paralyzed by  inaction -- this is not "Lethal Poignard II" -- his grip on love and self go  down the drain, and just about everybody dies.  </P> <P> THE LOOK: Nothing so trendy as to make you snatch up your credit card and head  for Melrose yelling, "I've got to have that.' Understandably. Someone or  other's been putting clothes on these people for almost 400 years. The costumes  are unobtrusive -- this isn't MTV style over substance -- yet are not lost in  the spaces they had to occupy. Italian designer Mauricio Millenotti has  costumed films, including the Zeffirelli/Shakespeare "Otello," opera,  television and ballets and has a command of the grand scale. Remember, "Hamlet"  as a story was 12th-Century ancient history when Shakespeare did it in the  17th, and he had some costuming anachronisms of his own, like a reference to  "chopines," platform shoes unknown in Denmark.  </P> <P> The Clorox factor is more than apparent. The principals' clothes tend to suffer  by their incredible Hollywood tidiness, less suggestive of the 12th or even  17th Century than a modern-day Maytag side-by-side. There is the antiseptic  sheen of a '40s MGM spectacular where even the horses' teeth looked like they  had been capped. Compare it to Kenneth Branagh's wonderfully grimy film version  of "Henry V," released here last fall. The tons of coal dust spread over  Hamlet's castle for authentic weathering never touched its big-name residents.  At least Ophelia (Helena Bonham-Carter) and Hamlet get more disordered-looking  as their minds do. (Look for Hamlet in the library, in a scruffy sweater and  throwing his boot.)  </P> <P> THE SUPERB: With the exception of one Gertrude (Close) headdress that looks  like a brain-stem injury surgical restraint, the jewelry and adornments are  marvelous, particularly the Celtic-looking wrought cloak clasps. The crowns,  rough and heavy jeweled bands, are absolutely on-11th-Century target, evoking  the oldest surviving crown in Europe, of the Empress Kunigunde of Luxembourg.  Gertrude's shoulder-duster earrings are pure Visigoth. Now you might see these  turn up on Melrose.  </P> <P> THE SILLY: Gertrude's blond Viking braids, which look like they were extruded  from a butterscotch Dairy Queen machine. And one unfortunate aqua surcoat that  looks exactly like my mother's chenille bedspread.  </P> <P> THE CREDIBLE: The authentic reliance on knits, embroidery and worked adornment  for ornamentation. Ophelia in simple, virginal cream-colored smocks is in  deliberate, unsubtle contrast to the bright colors of Gertrude's ardent  newlywed sexuality, turquoise and wine reds. And, of course, Hamlet's raiment  is a fixed point of almost unrelieved black, a color in great vogue among  Elizabethans. Gibson has a modern face, and there are moments when, in  leggings, boots, a leather jerkin whose big, loose stitches cry out "olde," he  could sit down front at a Madonna concert without turning too many heads.  </P> <P> THE SOURCES: Less likely to catch on as street-style than, say, "Dick Tracy,"  even if there were such a boutique as "Thor's Threads" to handle this line. But  it's like Mrs. Roten told us in 10th grade English -- you're supposed to listen  to this. PATT MORRISON  </P></p>

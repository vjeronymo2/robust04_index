Voronin, chief designer of nuclear </F> charges and munitions of the Russian Federal Nuclear Center, by  Aleksandr Nezhnyy, place and date not given: "The Bomb"]    [Text] In 1927 Soviet power sealed the Sarov monastery,  renowned for the spiritual deeds of the venerable Serafim, once  and for all. One year later an NKVD child labor colony was  housed in the monastery buildings. In 1933 the colony was  replaced by a camp where not only criminals but also Article 58  victims served their time. In 1938 a small plant was built  there which produced iron bedsteads, kitchen utensils, and  skates, and it was from this latter product that the plant  derived its nickname. During the war the "skate" plant  manufactured howitzer shells and later produced Katyusha  rockets. On 8 April 1946 a three-man commission arrived at  Sarov: One member of that commission was Yu.B. Khariton, now a  successful academician and three times a Hero. Within a year a  special secrecy regime was introduced here and the city  disappeared from the maps.    In present-day Arzamas-16 little remains of the Sarov  Monastery. Only the bell tower and the guest buildings escaped  destruction.... In addition to the municipal museum and the  "Sarov Monastery" museum, founded by local history enthusiasts,  the city also has a most unique museum of nuclear weapons. Here  you can touch the first Soviet atomic bomb with your own hands,  reel in horror at the appalling dimensions of the thermonuclear  bomb, see fragments of once top-secret films on atomic and  hydrogen bomb tests, and hear the stern but, at the same time,  exultant voice of the announcer saying: "A blinding flash! The  raging elements destroy all the test installations within a  radius of 4 km." When describing the super-bomb tests a kindly  woman says, not without a note of pride, that the explosion  produced a shock wave of such force that it would have gone  round the globe three times. There used to be a monastery here  -- it became a vast workshop producing weapons of awesome force.  That is one image of the 20th century.    [Nezhnyy] Stanislav Nikolayevich, a man in your post is  something of an unknown quantity in a society like ours. So  would you be so kind as to tell us a little about yourself.    [Voronin] With pleasure. I am 63 years old, I was born in  Yaroslavl, and in 1942 my brother and I were left without a  father, our mother without a husband. It was wartime. After  secondary school in Yaroslavl I studied at the weapons  department of the Leningrad shipbuilding institute, where I  received my diploma in 1954, specializing in torpedoes. I came  to Arzamas-16 right away in order to make the bomb. As you can  see, I am still here. I got married here and our children were  born here... I have met and worked with some very interesting  people here and learned a lot from them. Let me mention two  names: Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov and Yuliy Borisovich  Khariton. Yuliy Borisovich is 90 years old but he is still  working hard; you can find him at the institute on weekends and  late in the evening.    [Nezhnyy] What does it mean to create a nuclear weapon?    [Voronin] First of all it is a very complex process. We are  dealing with the very small segments of time in which the high  precision mechanism of the charge and the munition operates,  very high temperatures and very high pressures, which do not  exist in practice in laboratory conditions. That is why  experiments are very important for us....    [Nezhnyy] Nuclear tests?    [Voronin] Yes. The magnitudes which we work in can only be  calibrated by experiment.    [Nezhnyy] Otherwise, the result is failure?    [Voronin] We may not achieve the expected result. There  were quite a few instances of that kind, and this makes us come  back to the question of nuclear tests. Without them we cannot  improve our weaponry. We can make minor improvements but there  will be no major progress.    [Nezhnyy] You say that tests are necessary, but the  overwhelming majority of the inhabitants of our planet would say  if asked: To hell with you and all your explosions! Isn't that  so?    [Voronin] Do not portray us as some kind of monsters burning  with a desire to carry out one test after another, ad infintum.  No! Nevertheless, since life has forced the country to equip  itself with its own nuclear weapons and since we have had to  constantly improve them, they must be under reliable control.  Control is all the more necessary in the conditions of our  industry today, with its severed production ties and changes of  suppliers and materials. After all, the replacement of  materials could influence the characteristics of our product.  Meanwhile we give a guarantee for the whole sequence of  operations, as it were. That is why we simply have to check the  condition that the products are in, whether they are still in a  high state of readiness and reliability, and so forth.  Otherwise they could become a threat to their owners. It is  not only our specialists who adhere to that view but the  Americans, too. We believe that as long as nuclear weapons  exist they must be tested. In limited quantities and with very  rigorous conditions regarding ecological cleanliness and safety  -- but they must be tested. There is no other way.    [Nezhnyy] So the aim is, on the one hand, to guarantee the  reliability of the existing nuclear weapons arsenals and, on the  other, to make progress in improving them. Is that why tests  are necessary?    [Voronin] Yes.    [Nezhnyy] You have undoubtedly been present at nuclear  tests?    [Voronin] I went to Novaya Zemlya virtually every year from  1969 through 1989. Since 1963, as you know, testing has taken  place exclusively underground. This costs more than testing in  the atmosphere, of course, but it is ecologically cleaner and  safer. They drill a well or, in mountainous locations, they cut  a gallery, lower the charge into it...    [Nezhnyy] Deep down?    [Voronin] That depends on the yield. But as a rule it is  usually deeper than 500 meters -- to prevent any discharges.    [Nezhnyy] How do you feel during all this?    [Voronin] Please do not think that I am saying this for  effect, but you await an explosion with a tension which is  really hard to describe. And then.... Then the ground begins  to move under your feet -- and we are 10 km from the site of the  explosion, sometimes closer. A roar begins. It is probably  somewhat like an earthquake.    [Nezhnyy] Does your institute conduct tests here around  Arzamas-16?    [Voronin] Yes. At sites a long way from the city. This is  essential. Then you need a conventional explosive. We do not  work with fissile materials here.    [Nezhnyy] So the talk that everything here in this district  is contaminated with radiation is....    [Voronin] Nonsense. We have a special service which  monitors the air and the water. They are cleaner here than in  Moscow.    [Nezhnyy] That is fine. But then what you call a new  product is created here. How long does that take?    [Voronin] From conception to the completion of research work  -- 5-8 years. The product contains the achievements of  virtually all sectors of science and technology. Our institute  is a multidisciplinary scientific center where all the spheres  of physics, mechanics, mathematics, physical metallurgy,  chemistry, and electronics are represented... It has one of the  most powerful computer centers in the country.    [Nezhnyy] Is the quantity determined by the state order?    [Voronin] We have nothing to do with that. The client  orders as much as he needs. For our part we monitor every  product from beginning to end: manufacture, operation,  dismantling, and recycling.    [Nezhnyy] What is the perfection that you are striving to  achieve? Does it consist in increasing the destructive force of  a nuclear weapon? Or is it something else?    [Voronin] We resolved different tasks at different periods.  The main thing now is safety. The world has changed. Whereas  previously we aimed for order and the strict observance of  technological discipline, now, in my opinion, top priority has  been given to freedom as it is commonly understood. Freedom as  meaning total license. For example, how many people are there  with weapons nowadays?! And if a bullet were by chance or  design to hit our product -- what would be the consequences  then?! Previously we did not give much thought to that, but now  we take it seriously. But once again, security measures  envisage fairly major changes to the design itself. And it must  be tested.    [Nezhnyy] How do Russia's present nuclear weapons compare  with those that the United States has?    [Voronin] I would answer that question this way: Until the  early eighties our products were no worse and, in some respects,  even better than theirs. But since then there has effectively  been a moratorium every year. Just isolated explosions -- the  last almost 5 years ago. However, the Americans paid no  attention to our moratorium until recently, they carried out six  to eight blasts a year and of course they got ahead of us.  Specifically as regards safety.    [Nezhnyy] But as regards weapon effectiveness?    [Voronin] As regards effectiveness -- no. In that sense we  are still as good as they are. But, as you know, we do not have  the same work opportunities as they have. Unfortunately...the  financing conditions are now such that it is very difficult to  organize normal work. Understand me: It is the state alone  which needs us. So it all comes down to the budget, without  which we cannot survive.    [Nezhnyy] Pardon me for interrupting you, Stanislav  Nikolayevich, but what about conversion? Can the nuclear center  not use conversion to earn its own living and pay for science  and production?    [Voronin] We are already carrying out research work in the  interests of the national economy. Our technologies can be used  successfully in the nuclear power industry, in medicine,  particularly in eye surgery, and in the oil and gas extraction  industry, where explosive devices produce a considerable  increase in the yield of wells, for example. But, no matter  what revenue the federal nuclear center earns from conversion  projects, we will never earn enough that way to finance our main  area of work. I repeat that without the budget we cannot  survive. But the budget has been playing some fairly nasty  tricks on us -- until recently at any rate. It is in the order  of things to keep the nuclear center waiting two months for its  pay. The average wage here is 80,000 rubles [R]. True, they  are promising to raise it to R140,000 in the near future and to  R160,000 for the average on the designer's pay scale.    [Nezhnyy] I am not even going to ask precisely how much a  bomb designer and builder earns in the United States...  Incidentally, have you ever been over there?    [Voronin] I recently visited their nuclear centers at  Albuquerque and Los Alamos for the first time. The Americans  had organized a symposium on safety questions. This includes  the problems of waste products, the risk involved in shipment by  different means of transport, and the means of testing storage  containers for fissile materials and munitions.    [Nezhnyy] Stanislav Nikolayevich, you acquainted me with an  "Appeal" signed by a group of scientists and specialists from  the federal nuclear center and addressed to the citizens and  governments of Ukraine, Russia, and other countries of the world  in connection with the intolerable situation with nuclear  weapons in Ukraine. (Our conversation with S.N. Voronin took  place before the signing of the agreement between Russia,  Ukraine, and the United States. Unfortunately recent reports  from Kiev inspire alarm rather than confidence that the accords  which have been reached will be fulfilled unconditionally --  A.N. note) How do you explain Ukraine's stance?    [Voronin] What we have here, in my opinion, are political  aims, a desire to get something from the United States, and the  fear that if Ukraine becomes a non-nuclear state it will lose  its international prestige. It is hard for me to discuss all  this because I am not a politician. But one thing is beyond  doubt for me -- nationalistic feelings are clearly being  inflamed. I went to Ukraine, to the missile division base at  Pervomaysk, and there I read Ukrainian Army journals and books  and, you know, I was simply appalled at the distorted way in  which they portray Russia. The number one enemy -- nothing more  or less than that! Everything is presented in such a way as to  make it seem that Ukrainians fought Russians even before the  christianization of Rus, that they have been fighting ever  since, and that they will go on fighting in the future.    [Nezhnyy] The combination of an ideology like that with  nuclear weapons is dangerous, is it not?    [Voronin] It is more loathsome than dangerous. After all,  they cannot use their weapons. The danger -- and this is the  reason for our "Appeal" -- is that they treat them in a barbaric  way. It could end badly. What is more, they are making life  difficult for us at the nuclear center. Because of the  incorrect treatment of the weapons, processes are taking place  in them which increase the level of danger when it comes to  dismantling them. And we are the ones who have to dismantle  them. The later these products reach us, the greater the number  of problems that we encounter. That is the trouble. True, some  people on the Ukrainian side do say: We will dismantle them  ourselves. But they will not. They will cause trouble -- and  that is all.    [Nezhnyy] What could happen in an extreme case, for example?    [Voronin] There could be an explosion.    [Nezhnyy] A nuclear explosion?    [Voronin] No, it would not be a nuclear explosion. It would  be a conventional explosion, but the plutonium contained in the  warhead would spread over a fairly large area. Furthermore, if  all this happened at an arms dump the consequences would be a  second Chernobyl. One explosion is enough to render a city like  ours uninhabitable...    [Nezhnyy] Stanislav Nikolayevich, you are one of the  creators of the weapon which, if used, and God forbid that,  would take so many lives that it is horrible to even  contemplate...    [Voronin] You want to ask me what my feelings are?    [Nezhnyy] Yes.    [Voronin] I always tell my colleagues: We make our weapons  so as not to go to war with them. I do not think that  intelligent people can ever use them. My whole life I have  worked to ensure that this weapon makes it impossible even to  contemplate the idea of beginning a war! In 1945 the Americans  were able to drop "Little Boy" and "Fat Boy," but very soon even  they had to think about the possibility of a retaliatory strike.  Since then the task has been to preserve a balance of forces  which makes it impossible to use nuclear weapons under any  conditions. In this regard, admittedly, we and the United  States overdid it and stockpiled vast nuclear arsenals. Now it  is time to sort things out. Living alongside yields of this  magnitude is inconceivable! Reduction is a noble cause.  Nevertheless I do not think that the 20th century will see a  final end to these weapons. Our children will still have to  rack their brains to decide how to get rid of these weapons once  and for all.    [Nezhnyy] Stanislav Nikolayevich, what is the average age of  staff at the All-Russia Experimental Physics Scientific Research  Institute?    [Voronin] Forty-two.    [Nezhnyy] Is that high?    [Voronin] Yes. But the average age of workers in science is  46. That is really high. The problem is that now we have  virtually no young specialists coming through to replace them.  In the past our work had prestige, and here at Arzamas-16 the  young specialist could enjoy a series of social benefits that  were difficult to obtain back in European Russia, such as  apartments, good medical services, recreation -- but now things  are not only no better here than elsewhere, they are even worse.  So no one comes out here to join us.    [Nezhnyy] Yet the Federal Nuclear Center is Russia's  national asset. Does the government really not understand that,  does the president not realize it?    [Voronin] Destroying a center is easy, creating one is  incredibly difficult and nowadays I think that it is simply  impossible. Just recently, it is true, things do seem to have  happened. I told you that it takes us eight years to create a  new product. That means that it needs a program. We proposed  such programs long ago but they were ignored. Now interest has  been shown in them, the government is creating the corresponding  structures, and I am confident that in the end everything will  work out right, these political games will end, and people will  get down to work.    [Nezhnyy] Does the brain drain not worry you any more?    [Voronin] There are people who worked with us and who left  for other republics of the CIS. They number just a few. No  one, as far as I am aware, has yet gone further afield than  that. In the main this brain drain is toward commercial  structures, and these are good people who are leaving.  Generally speaking if the economic situation gets worse the  danger of the proliferation of nuclear technologies will  increase. The state's duty and paramount obligation is to do  everything it can to prevent this.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STREET SMART: AIRPORT OFF-RAMP THEORY WON'T FLY;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC: SOUTH COUNTY RESIDENTS HAVE ONLY SINGLE-LANE ACCESS FROM THE SAN DIEGO  FREEWAY TO JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT. COULD IT BE RETRIBUTION?  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart: On July 7, you discussed improvements to provide better  access to the Orange County Airport from the north -- and how nice they will  be.  </P> <P> Now how about those you missed? Everyone who comes from the south won't see any  improvement. There is only one lane off the interstate, even though it looks  like there could be two with some restriping. Or is this "punishment" inflicted  because those in the south are fighting an airport in the area?  </P> <P> Nancy Wilson  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P> <P> Hmmmm. Conspiracy theories are always intriguing, but it sure would be picayune  of the powers who control our roads to pound on all those southerners just  because they don't want commercial jets buzzing their red clay-tile roofs.  </P> <P> Officials at the California Department of Transportation in Orange County say  the MacArthur Boulevard off-ramp, the major conduit to the airport for folks  headed north, has not had problems funneling traffic off the San Diego Freeway,  something that couldn't always be said for the southbound off-ramp.  </P> <P> Typically, if the number of cars using an off-ramp exceeds 1,500 an hour, the  agency will add an additional lane to funnel traffic off the freeway, Caltrans  officials said. The northbound off-ramp to MacArthur Boulevard just doesn't top  that threshold, they maintain.  </P> <P> The off-ramp is most heavily used during the morning rush hour. Between 6 and 7  a.m., nearly 1,000 cars exit there, but that total rises to about 1,400 for  each of the subsequent hours, Caltrans said.  </P> <P> Moreover, a majority of those cars are actually turning right, heading toward  the office parks straddling MacArthur Boulevard and away from the airport.  During the peak hours between 6 and 8 a.m., about 1,500 cars turn left toward  the airport, while about 2,250 typically turn right, according to Caltrans.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, most residents of South County would probably love an exit similar  to the new transition road off the southbound Costa Mesa Freeway, which ferries  motorists right to the new airport terminal. The Costa Mesa Freeway was  selected for that special exit because studies showed that far more drivers  traveling to the airport were coming from the central county, authorities said.  </P> <P> So South County motorists will have to contend with the MacArthur Boulevard  exit as it is -- and feel pleased that there's not an airport in the back yard  yet.  </P> <P> It's always been the sort of sage advice that Grandpa passed on: Buy a big car  because the small ones aren't as safe in an accident. Now there's some proof.  </P> <P> An analysis conducted by the Highway Loss Data Institute found that small cars  were three times more likely to be declared a total loss after an accident than  were large cars. The rate of total loss for mid-size cars was twice that of the  large models, according to the study.  </P> <P> The Yugo had the highest percentage of total losses for 1988 model cars, with  one out of every five collisions involving a total loss, the study reported.  Others with high rates of total losses include the Ford Festiva and Chevrolet  Sprint. The lowest rate was recorded by the Lincoln Town Car, with fewer than  one out of 50 collisions resulting in a total loss.  </P> <P> Before you run off and trade in your Toyota for a Cadillac, remember that small  cars have their advantages aside from being a bit flimsy in a crash. They  typically deliver far better gas mileage and, in some cases, performance.  </P></p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / As they say in Europe: British time, gentlemen, please THE ONE area where the British seem prepared to sell out to 'Europe' is the one where there is no external pressure for them to do so. Tonight, the clocks go back in Britain, returning it to the lap of Greenwich Mean Time. There are, however, many voices demanding that daylight saving time should become standard time despite the failure of an experiment on those lines 25 years ago. Last weekend, the Mail on Sunday ran a poll which, it said, showed that 'a clear majority favours keeping our time in line with Europe, which has summer time the year round.' So, we are reminded of those long, balmy January evenings in Hamburg where the sun does not set until about 1600 hours while poor Londoners have to put up with it disappearing at 4 pm. The Mail's dream of permanent summer time is not the only argument deployed in favour of 'moving an hour ahead.' There is the usual dreary thesis about 'giving a boost to tourism' - code for a vested interest wanting more of my money. Then, there are the Policy Studies Institute and something called Daylight Extra, which say more than 100 lives would be saved by the change. But the number killed on British roads actually rose, compared with the previous three-year period, during the last experiment with continental time in 1969-71. Road deaths started to fall soon after GMT was restored and have dropped steadily ever since. And, finally, there is the argument of the Confederation of British Industry: its members need frantic commercial intercourse with their continental counterparts for eight hours a day. Seven are not enough. The Japanese are seven hours ahead of Europe and 11 from the Atlantic coast of North America; we all know of the failure of their commercial forays in those areas. When time zones first were agreed, Greenwich was fixed as the mid-point of its zone, which meant that its eastern border was on the river Rhine. But the French today are on central European time because of a last act of collaboration. The Germans imposed l'heure allemande during the second world war occupation and the French failed to change back when they left. As a result, the morning rush hour in Paris is even more hellish than usual. In December, darkness reigns until well after the offices fill and shadowy figures in bars fortify themselves with extra glasses of cognac before they are steeled for the so-called day. Road deaths are twice the level of London. What it is like on the western edge of Brittany, I can only imagine. The pressure to move the clock forward reflects the familiar vanity that reality is ours to change. But the earth turns on its axis, and Belfast is in a different time zone from Belgrade because it is in a different place. If Britain were to change, would the republic of Ireland, on the western edge of GMT, also change? If not (and why should it?), there would be a north-south time zone across the island, so that the Londonderry sun would not rise until nearly 11. But perhaps the north would stay with the republic, thereby creating two time zones within the United Kingdom - and handing a propaganda victory to the IRA. The clock jugglers reflect a traditional British belief that fundamental improvements can be gained through apparently painless institutional change. A poll tax can distribute the cost of local government fairly; summer time can be achieved by sleight-of-clock hand. One hour saves a hundred lives. So, why not move forward two hours and save 200? Then, move a mere three hours more to Pakistan time: the dead would doubtless rise from their graves, it would never get dark until nine in the evening, and tourism would flourish. There remains a rule which, however, has stood me in good stead on my travels over the years. The sun rises in Berlin one hour before it is seen in London. Yet, strangely, there is no organisation like Daylight Extra in Berlin. No German minister is plagued with calls to move the clock forward so as to cut the accident rate, reduce energy costs and achieve 'summer time all year round just like they have in Lithuania.' Think, though, what would happen if the Germans indulged in such fads. Suppose Britain were to move an hour ahead and the Germans did the same at the behest of Tageslicht Extra. The Confederation of British Industry would then demand that Britain move again - just 'to keep up with the continent.' When the Baltic states regained their independence, their first act was to move their clocks one hour back from Moscow time. Single time zones across huge areas are totalitarian phenomena - the Nazis imposed them, China has them today. The diverse European Community covers three time zones. But one of London's greatest strengths is that it is not anywhere else - so let us not pretend it is. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COAST PANEL STAFF BACKS MOLA PLAN  </P> <P> The staff of the California Coastal Commission is recommending approval of a  developer's restoration plan for 41.4 acres of wetlands in northwest Seal  Beach. The commission is scheduled to vote on the plan today.  </P> <P> Mola Development Corp. is financing and coordinating the $4-million, five-year  program in exchange for approval of the company's planned development by the  commission and city. Mola wants to build a $300-million, 329-unit residential  development on the Hellman Ranch property, adjacent to the wetlands.  </P> <P> The commission conditionally approved the development earlier this year and  asked Mola to revise and resubmit the restoration plan.  </P> <P> Commission staff had asked Mola to obtain an endorsement of the plan from  California Department of Fish and Game and to modify the plan to include an  additional two acres of low marsh habitat.  </P> <P> Mola has complied with the requests and should have no problem getting approval  for the plan, staff analyst Larry Simon said.  </P> <P> The 41.4-acre wetlands will include nine acres of open water and 31 of high and  low marsh habitat.  </P> <P> "This is a very exciting restoration project," said Mola project director Kirk  Evans.  </P></p>

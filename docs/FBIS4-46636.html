			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine </F> Colonel-General Ivan Vasylovych Bizhan by NARODNA ARMIYA  correspondents Colonel Viktor Shvyrov and Lieutenant-Colonel  Oleh Vachayev: "Everything Begins With Order"]    [Text] The troops of the 38th Army Corps (Carpathian  Military District), as NARODNA ARMIYA has already reported, are  conducting a performance evaluation for the winter training  period. The center of the final drills was moved to the field,  where the personnel report on weapons training, the driving of  vehicles, tactics...    [I. Bizhan] The overall preliminary evaluation could be as  follows. On the one hand, the diligence of the enlisted men and  NCOs everywhere they were during these days--in the barracks, in  the field, at the motor pool--was noticeable.    On the other, the low level of professional proficiency of  the personnel when passing the disciplines that required the  expenditures of large quantities of fuels and lubricants during  the winter training period was noticeable as well. And we  understand that. There were objective reasons for this, after  all, that were connected first and foremost with the shortage of  fuels.    There is, however, no justification for those commanders who  are trying to use those reasons to cover their own passivity. We  were present at firing exercises by a mechanized battalion  yesterday where the organization of the exercises was far from  normal. What do I have in mind? The instruction areas and target  range proper had not been prepared, and the equipment of the  gunnery range operated erratically. There were, for instance,  disruptions in providing routine supplies for the troops in the  field and informing them of the results, which ultimately led to  an overall unsatisfactory evaluation of the subunit for day and  night firing. There could have been no other evaluation.    I would like to emphasize once again--and I have reported  this to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine--that many of the  commanders and senior officers who were complaining about the  lack of money and fuels and lubricants are carelessly fulfilling  their duties in the resolution of rudimentary tasks.    For example, the performance of a group exercise with the  commanders of platoons of two subunits was rated unsatisfactory  in the same mechanized battalion (regiment). Neither fuel nor  money were required to conduct it, after all. All that was  needed was systematic classes with the officers.    Take even the rudimentary questions of setting up the daily  routine, organizing classes, maintaining stipulated forms of  dress and the internal duty roster... Tell me, what funds are  required for a regiment to have order, for a firefighting team  to operate well in the motor pool? But it was clearly not  working in harmony.    The time for the final evaluations has obviously not yet  come. But I have serious complaints today toward the command  personnel of the UPO for the organization of the final drills  and the upholding of stipulated procedure.    [NARODNA ARMIYA] Ivan Vasylovych, the headquarters officers  of a mechanized division and regiment and the personnel of one  of the subunits were called out in a practice alert during the  training session today. How do you rate their actions?    [I. Bizhan] We performed an evaluation of mobilization  readiness with a regard for the situation that exists in the  formation, and we checked out the system for notifying  headquarters officers of the division and regiment.    It is still too early to be talking about final results. But  there is quite a bit left to be done here. The written  confirmation of the alert signal from the higher staff was  received too late by the operations duty officer in particular.  These are also rudimentary matters that people must learn that  do not require any particular expenditures.    I would like to emphasize again that organizational  conclusions will undoubtedly be drawn based on the results of  the performance evaluation with a particular regard for the  subjective factor that we were talking about before.    The question of how the problem of fully manning the  mechanized division, especially at the platoon and company  (battery) levels, with officer personnel is of particular  attention in this regard.    The inspectorate includes representatives of the Main  Personnel Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, who are  studying this issue in detail. Everything possible has already  been done on the part of the Ministry not only on this problem,  but also on many of the other "sore spots" that exist in the  division.    Work must also be done with the officers in the field,  however. Their aspirations and needs must be studied more  deeply, and their problems must not be brushed aside. I am sure  that we will have fewer transfer or discharge requests from the  young officers in that case.    [NARODNA ARMIYA] We have heard complaints more than once  that  bad things continue to happen in the determination of the  optimal standard organizational structures of the formation.  This has a negative impact on the proficiency and mood of  people...    [I. Bizhan] This is, first of all, in the sphere of aimless  discussions again. Take the mechanized battalion that I was  talking about earlier. What reforms were made in it, say, that  impeded the fulfillment of the weapons training program? There  were none, but they are trying to use it to cover themselves. Is  that good?    Second, everything that is being done is proceeding in  accordance with the plan for the organizational development of  the armed forces. I agree with the fact that everything is not  being done as one would like here. Life itself makes  corrections, and you cannot get away from that. One need not,  however, put the problem of growth at the center.    We are not reforming the armed forces, we are building them,  as has been emphasized repeatedly by Minister of Defense of  Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy. That  is quite true. Everything is effectively being created anew, and  you cannot avoid mistakes.    A large portion of the work lies ahead for us, and I am sure  that the results of that will provide us with the opportunity of  assessing, in objective and comprehensive fashion, the state of  affairs in the formations and units of the corps being evaluated.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> I have eradicated the Medflies from my navel orange tree in my back yard simply  by using a fly swatter. A Medfly first appeared on my orange tree about three  months ago.  </P> <P> I called the Department of Agriculture about them. They said they had traps in  my area.  </P> <P> I then discovered that the Medfly is not as quick as a housefly. You could  practically place your hand over the orange before they would fly away.  </P> <P> So each day I would go out and swat the flies. I must have killed about 50 to  100 or more and finally I got the last one. This took about two weeks. No more  Medflies have appeared in the last three weeks.  </P> <P> ROBERT J.

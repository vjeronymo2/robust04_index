			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Porsche expects profit this year Porsche, the luxury sports car maker, will return to profit by Christmas after three years of heavy losses, according to Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, chief executive. Announcing a deficit of DM115m (Dollars 67.6m) for the six months to the end of January, he said the full-year short-fall would be about DM150m. The company, which lost more than DM300m in the past two years combined, would start making decent profits by 1997 at the latest, Mr Wiedeking claimed. By then its new models, the Boxster two-seater and the 996, successor to the 911, will be on the market. The company, which will launch a capital-raising exercise shortly, said consolidated group equity fell to DM386m last year from DM634m in 1991-92 as a result of the DM240m net loss. Net liquid assets declined to DM344m from DM614m. The Porsche and Piech families which own the group will subscribe to half the planned DM20m issue in the form of common stock, maintaining their absolute control, while the balance will come in the form of preferred stock for other investors. US, Swiss and UK investors held an 'amazing volume' of preference shares, according to Mr Walter Gnauert, finance director. Mr Wiedeking based his optimistic forecasts on cost-cutting measures, and an increase in orders for the new 911 Carrera. Production would rise in the current year to 16,000 Porsche cars compared with 12,500 last year and more than 32,000 in 1989-90. The company would build a further 2,000 vehicles on contract for Mercedes-Benz and Audi. More than 4,000 orders had been booked for the Carrera since its launch last autumn. The Stuttgart plant was making 55 a day by the turn of the year and output would reach the target of 72 a day by March, Mr Wiedeking said. However, he said production of the four-cylinder 968, popular in the US and the UK, was 'not in line with our plans' at 12 cars a day, while output of the eight-cylinder 928 GTS was down to three a day. In the last full year, to the end of July 1993, the group workforce had been cut by 15 per cent to 7,100 people, reducing personnel costs by some DM130m.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading TRADING IN the futures market remained in familiar territory yesterday as dealers tried, in good two-way business, to anticipate the outcome of today's Bundesbank meeting, writes Christopher Price. After a weak opening, the September Footsie contract moved slowly forward in what were described as squeezy conditions, with some eyes fixed on next week's expiry date. There was more evidence of investors rolling positions into the December contract, where volume yesterday reached more than 3,000 contracts. The Treasury report and firm gilts and short sterling, together with some continued optimism that good news may be forthcoming from Germany today, helped to sustain the rally, and September led the cash market higher in the morning session, although the good two-way business saw some volatile swings. A high for the day of 3,049 was reached shortly after midday, after which September drifted back slightly, eventually closing at 3,036, around three points ahead of the underlying cash market. Volume was a steady 11,474 contracts. The options market recorded a strong 40,000 contracts, with the FT-SE 100 option accounting for 15,000. BTR, which reports results today, saw 5,500 contracts traded. Amstrad was also busy, with 1,795 lots dealt, as were BT, British Gas, Glaxo and National Westminster Bank.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Books: Confessions of an author - Patrimony: A True Story by Philip Roth Jonathan Cape Pounds 13.99, 238 pages THE THINGS that wear you down are also the things that nurture your talent. For Philip Roth, those things are family matters. With Patrimony, he squares up to his father in an uncomfortable display of candour. This confessional writing follows Joseph Heller, William Styron and John Updike into the rediscovered country of one's past. It represents a new and growing American genre: established novelists deliver the psychic truth about themselves. Roth's story, however, is a piece of self-therapy too poignant to dismiss and too blatant to be endured. The family is not new Roth territory: he has been writing about Jewish families ever since his first novel, Goodbye, Columbus (1960). His characters have always, like Portnoy and Zuckerman, lived life not so much with their heart on the sleeve as in the full glare of open-heart surgery. But the intimacy they imposed made you feel prurient for being there. The same force works in Patrimony and in his previous confession, The Facts (1988). That feisty autobiography recorded the New Jersey upbringing, the college days at Bucknell and Chicago, and the relentless accumulation of material for his books. Here in Patrimony Roth brings his belief in Jewish family indivisibility to its natural term. He is confronted by an elderly father with a malignant brain tumour. The unstinting surgical detail, leavened only by sporadic wit, periodically gives way to a series of emotional encounters. Gradually the entropy of age and the inexorable tumour bring them closer; even false teeth: 'By taking the dentures, slimy saliva and all, and dumping them in my pocket, I had, quite inadvertently, stepped across the divide of physical estrangement that, not so unnaturally, had opened up between us once I had stopped being a boy.' His father had typified his time: a second- generation immigrant who lost money in shoes and frozen food before becoming an insurance clerk with Metropolitan Life. He was not only a family man, but president of an association of 80 Jewish families in Newark and 70 in Boston; the association Happy Day Fund took care of its sick, while its Education Fund helped with college tuition. In a bluff, point-blank way, he was immensely proud of his son. He defended Roth's books against Jewish charges of anti-Semitism and self-hate. And while his life was not spectacular, Roth's love for him makes it unique. The story moves to its inevitable end in Herman's death. But while father and son discuss the medical options presented by the growing tumour, the son suddenly finds himself in the theatre with a quintuple bypass operation. He tries to keep it from his father, and ends up in a tender family row. He recovers, relieved to think that his father will not have to bury a son. The book drips foreboding from every page. This is a grim, harrowing read. When the final hospital and mortuary scenes arrive, they are as depressing as Roth is elsewhere uplifting. He remarks coolly that with the unseemliness of his profession, he had been writing this book while his father lay ill and dying.</p>

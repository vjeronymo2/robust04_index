			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Sponsorship spending comes under the microscope: Companies want their arts expenditure to work harder for them BUSINESSES are taking a long, hard look at one area of expenditure that could be seen as less than essential in a recession: corporate sponsorship. Royal Insurance set the tone this week when it decided to end its Pounds 700,000-a-year sponsorship of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Mr Roy Randall of Royal Insurance said: 'We certainly got a lot out of our association with the RSC but in a recession, if dividends are not increasing, you can expect that some shareholders may not be as keen on it as we are.' Others are also reviewing the benefits of having their name on a programme when set against the cost. Mr Robert Pennant-Jones, head of communications at British Petroleum, the UK oil group, said: 'We're beginning to come to the conclusion that big national sponsor-ships are not as good for some of our operating companies as smaller local efforts.' BP spends about Pounds 600,000 a year on the arts and has a fairly extensive spread of sponsorship inherited from Mr Robert Horton, its former chairman, who was ousted last year. The company remains committed to its present programme but it is not planning to take on any more sponsorships. BP will also be looking very hard at its existing commitments when they come up for renewal. These include the National Portrait Gallery in London and Cardiff's Singer of the Year competition, Few companies appear to be looking for new events to sponsor while profits remain under pressure. Ms Ross Frost, sponsorship manager at Barclays Bank, said: 'It simply means we can't expand.' The bank spends about Pounds 1m a year on the arts, including sponsorship of fringe theatre. Corporate sponsorship can be crucial in creating an image for a company. BP, for example, sponsored a high-profile ecology exhibition at the Natural History Museum in London as a way of making a statement about its concern for the environment. Sponsored events also provide a venue for corporate entertainment, where customers can go backstage and meet the cast of a play. Privatised companies such as British Gas, which spends Pounds 10m a year on sponsorship, and British Telecom stress how sponsorship meets the need to put something back into the community. Mr Bob Raggett at British Telecom, which spends Pounds 16m a year on sponsorship, said: 'It is important for us to sponsor events which get the arts out to the people.' For example, the company sponsored a tour of the Scottish islands by the Scottish Symphony Orchestra - the first time such a tour had been organised. Even British Gas and British Telecom, with their deep pockets, are scrutinising their commitments. British Gas is reassessing its approach to sponsorship and charitable giving in the light of regulatory constraints, while British Telecom is responding to the cold economic climate by trying to get greater benefit from its sponsorship.</p>

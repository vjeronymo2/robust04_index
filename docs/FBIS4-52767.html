			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Answer to Lord's Prayer"] </F>   [Text] By Objecting to Singapore's offer to host the first  meeting of the World Trade Organisation [WTO], United States  Trade Representative Mickey Kantor seems to confirm the  misgivings that the US government's senior-most Asia expert,  Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord, recently expressed in  a presumably confidential communication to his boss, Mr. Warren  Christopher. Mr. Lord's complaint was old hat, of course, to  Asian countries which are at the receiving end of Washington's  increasingly capricious foreign policy. They are already aware  that "the sense of optimism and partnership forged in Seattle",  when President Bill Clinton seemed genuinely to be moved by the  conviction that his country's destiny was linked with the future  growth of the Asia-Pacific region, is in danger of being eroded  because of the unnecessary squabbles and hamhanded bullying that  the US tries to pass off as diplomacy.    The intriguing feature is what provoked Mr. Lord to give  vent  to his frustration at this juncture, and how the letter came to  be printed in a Washington newspaper. Leaks are a way of life  in Washington, it has been so since the Watergate hearings,  useful both as an instrument of vendetta and a means of floating  constructive ideas. The trouble with such a weapon for all  seasons is that it is not always easy to identify the precise  purpose. But it can be assumed that most readers will see Mr.  Lord's letter not as a product of the departmental rivalries and  personal animosities that are probably rampant in a virtually  rudderless administration, but as a plea for clarity and  coherence so that Asian nations are not forced into a united  front against the US.    What this underlines is that US policy has been lacking in  purpose and direction in a part of the world that is so vital  for American economic regeneration. The State Department  spokesman's bland assertion of "excellent" ties with Asian  countries, and attempt to blame the press for distorting Mr.  Lord's letter, merely avoided the evidence of consistent  inconsistency. The most charitable explanation for vacillation  is that Mr. Clinton is so consumed by domestic preoccupations  and electoral compulsions that he has little time for foreign  affairs. Such astounding disinterest at the top may have  emboldened certain members of his administration to grind their  personal axes at the cost of long-term American interests, as  well as global harmony. But the possibility of calculated  blow-hot-blow-cold tactics, with trade department militants or  crusaders for human rights roped in to do their acts cannot be  ruled out, either.    Whether the strategy is naive or devious, the end product is  the same: instead of winning friends and influencing people,  the Clinton administration seems to be alienating one nation  after another. Asian countries that value their close economic  and security ties with the US find such drift disconcerting. If  business is the business of the US, then Asia is its major  business partner, today and, even more, tomorrow. The  statistics for American trade and investment speak for  themselves. Picking quarrels with Asian countries will  eventually hurt both sides destroying whatever remains of the  spirit of Seattle.    It is a worrying thought that the world's only superpower  should act so irresponsibly. The "malaise" that Mr. Lord  complained of is not confined to relations with Asian countries.  Evidence of disoriented initiatives in respect of Somalia,  Haiti and Bosnia only compounds concern. The most effective  answer to Mr. Lord's indictment would be a firm and coherent  policy framework based on a clear vision of America's  international role and permanent relationships. Global security  demands such an enunciation. If Mr. Clinton fails to respond,  he fails the world.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Test case opens against Abta A schoolgirl and her teacher yesterday started a High Court test case against the Association of British Travel Agents over a Pounds 10 holiday insurance premium that was not repaid when one of its members went out of business. Their counsel, Mr Robert Webb QC, told Mr Justice Mitchell that there were about 25,000 cases, with a value of Pounds 250,000, resting on the outcome, which would have implications for the travel industry. Mr Stephen Wallace, the teacher, and Miss Emma Bowerman, the pupil, are bringing the claim on behalf of 54 other pupils at Nower Hill School, Pinner, north London. Mr Webb said Mr Wallace booked the April 1991 trip to the French resort of Alps D'Huez, near Grenoble, with Adventure Express Travel Services, a member of Abta. When the company became insolvent in March 1991 Abta refunded the money paid except for the compulsory Pounds 10 insurance premium. Mr Wallace wanted the money from Abta to pay his debt to Skibound, the operator which took over the trip and had invoiced him for the Pounds 550 due in insurance premiums for all 55 pupils. The school is asking the judge for a declaration that Abta is obliged under the terms of its scheme of protection either to reimburse the cost of the insurance cover for the holiday with Adventure Express Travel Services or to provide alternative insurance cover. Abta denies liability. The hearing was adjourned until today. Big tour operators are to ask the government to start the new airport departure tax a month later than planned so as not to interfere with next summer's holiday programme. The departure tax of Pounds 5 for flights in the European Union and Pounds 10 for trips elsewhere was announced in last week's Budget. It is due to start on October 1 next year.</p>

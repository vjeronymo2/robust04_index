			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Strong Asian demand for IADB Dollars 500m paper THE Inter-American Development Bank yesterday launched a Dollars 500m offering in the Eurobond market which relied on strong demand from Asian investors to achieve an aggressive pricing. The deal was priced to yield just 18 basis points above the five-year US Treasury, a level which London-based dealers agreed was very tight compared with paper in the secondary market. For example, a five-year deal launched by the same borrower at the start of the year was quoted at a spread of 23 basis points over the curve, while Oesterreichische Kontrollbank's recent five-year issue was trading at a spread of 21 basis points. The tight spread proved a deterrent to European investors, but strong demand from south-east Asia, particularly Hong Kong, proved sufficient to ensure a strong performance. Dealers reported particular interest from a number of Asian central banks. Asian investors have become very bullish on the US dollar, and favour the five-year area of the yield curve, according to traders. As a result, they appeared less concerned about spread valuations than their European counterparts. In the D-Mark sector, the European Investment Bank launched a DM300m issue of floating-rate notes. The issue was targetted at Italian investors, for whom EIB paper is tax exempt. Lead-manager Dresdner Bank said some sales were also made in Austria, where the EIB has the same tax-exempt status. Strong Italian demand for tax-exempt floating-rate paper created an extremely attractive funding opportunity for the EIB, which is paying interest of 85 basis points below the six-month D-Mark London interbank offered rate. Dealers said that, if the borrower had launched a fixed-rate D-Mark deal, the post-swap funding costs would have been about 50 basis points higher. Elsewhere, more European banks took advantage of Swiss demand for floating-rate notes offering a minimum coupon level above current money market rates. ABN Amro Bank and Bank Austria each raised Dollars 100m of subordinated debt, which counts as lower tier 2 capital under Basle capital adequacy guidelines. Germany's LKB added a further Dollars 100m to its Dollars 150m issue of floating-rate notes launched last week via JP Morgan. Two Swedish banks suffered further blows to their credit quality yesterday. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, had its long-term debt rating lowered from AA- to A+ by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency. Yesterday's move by S&amp;P follows a downgrade by Moody's, the other leading agency, in May from Aa2 to Aa3. S&amp;P said that its decision reflected the deterioration of the banks' asset quality and increased pressure on earnings caused by non-performing loans, especially in the Swedish real estate sector. Meanwhile, Sweden's third-largest commercial bank, Nordbanken, had its debt rating cut from AA- to A+ by IBCA, the London-based credit rating agency, citing similar causes. A double-A credit rating is a crucial threshold for some investors and counterparties, who do not accept credits below that level.</p>

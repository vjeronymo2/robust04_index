			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["C.G."-initialled report: "FDP Rejects Alliances With PDS"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- The FDP [Free Democratic Party] has rejected  local alliance with the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]  following their successes in the local elections in eastern  Germany. Responding to an announcement by SDP Deputy Chairman  Thierse that the SPD was ready to form coalitions with the PDS  at the municipal level, FDP Bundestag Group Chairman Solms said  in Bonn on Wednesday [15 June]: "That would be out of the  question for the FDP." The FDP will not cooperate with the PDS  at the local or any other level, just as it will not cooperate  with the Republikaner. FDP General Secretary Hoyer accused the  SPD of evidently wanting to assist the SED [Socialist Unity  Party of Germany] successor party to achieve respectability with  its "tendency toward expressions of friendship."    On Tuesday evening, the FDP Bundestag Group debated for  hours  about its poor performance in the European elections, but there  were no demands for personnel changes or changes of directions.  However, like the party's federal board, the group also  expressed concern that the FDP's image as "an independent force"  is only perceived in a blurred way as a result of numerous  compromises with the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]/CSU  [Christian Social Union] coalition partners in Bonn. The FDP  must place more emphasis on its independent character in the  election campaign. On Wednesday, Solms justified the agreements  within the coalition: "It would have been much worse to reject  compromise and thus be unable to make any decisions in German  politics."    As a result of the "inevitable" Bonn compromise, supporters  of the FDP voted for the CDU, said Solms. "The FDP lent votes  to the CDU/CSU" and the FDP will get them back. The FDP will  make it clear that the coalition cannot be continued if the FDP  is not strengthened. The FDP will hold discussions with the  Greens and show that the FDP still represents views based on the  rule of law state, even if those views are not currently the  focus of attention. The Greens cannot pretend to be a modern FDP.    Speaking to this newspaper, board member Baum said: "What  we, essentially, have once again is a debate about direction."  The CDU/CSU has "shifted to the right." That has affected the  FDP's politicians specializing in economics. Left-wing liberals  have not gone to the CDU/CSU, but to the Greens, and they must  be won over again. The FDP must ask itself: "Where are the  voters -- are they to the right or left of the center?" The  only answer can be to seek lost territory to the left of the  center. That is something that economic liberals, out of  concern for their seats, have recognized: "Many would most of  all like to carry Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  like a monstrance in front of them and immediately drop her  after the Bundestag elections."</p>

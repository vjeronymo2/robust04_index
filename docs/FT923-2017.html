			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Return to ERM not imminent, PM says MR JOHN MAJOR last night gave notice that there would be no 'imminent' return of Britain into the European exchange rate mechanism. Breaking his two-day silence on the UK's abandonment of the ERM in a series of broadcast interviews, the prime minister said that the system had revealed 'fault lines' over the past few days that provoked extraordinary movements of currencies. 'What we have decided to do is to stand aside from the mechanism for the time being,' he said. Mr Major added that when Britain joined the ERM it was not a particular fetish of the Conservative government  - it was the view of the Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress, the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats and most economic opinion. In two years, membership of the ERM had meant a drop in inflation from near 11 per cent to '3.7 per cent and falling'. He added: 'What we have seen in the last few days in the exceptional circumstances of the market, there are fault lines in the existing working of the ERM. We must correct those fault lines.' Asked when Britain would return to the ERM, he replied: 'We have to address those fault lines in the ERM before we can return. Clearly, it is not imminent.' He emphasised that it was 'not necessarily the case' that Britain would re-enter at a lower rate. On the Maastricht bill, Mr Major said it would not come back to the Commons until the Danes had made clear what they would do. 'There is a great deal in the Maastricht Treaty very much in the interests of British policy,' he said. 'The treaty provides for the development of European policies outside the Treaty of Rome, outside the European court and outside the authority of the European Commission. We have sought that British policy for years.' Questioned again about resignations, Mr Major said: 'There are circumstances when ministers should resign. I do not think these circumstances apply when an external, unforeseen event overthrows a policy which in principle is right. 'The principle Norman Lamont was following to bring down inflation and build prosperity was right. That was overwhelmed by circumstances that neither he nor anybody else foresaw or could have dealt with. It was quite right for him to stay in position. I believe he is doing a good job. I wish him to continue to do so.' Asked if he would therefore 'sink or swim' with the chancellor, Mr Major replied: 'The chancellor's policy is my policy, and it is the cabinet's policy.' He added: 'I do not think it is the chancellor's fault. I think it is quite unreasonable to blame the chancellor for a market movement of the sort we have not seen for over a quarter of a century.' He said the sensible thing for the chancellor to do was to 'stand aside from the mayhem for a time', adding: 'And that is precisely what the chancellor did.' The prime minister said the policy objective was to continue to bring down inflation. 'The ERM is one means of achieving that policy. When it works properly, it is the best policy to achieve that objective.'</p>

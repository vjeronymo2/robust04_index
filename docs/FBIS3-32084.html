			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on  Havana radio and television in Spanish between 27 January and 1  February.    Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 27 January reports that Isle of  Youth investors have drafted their main investment goals for  1994. Maintaining the current construction projects and  completing projects under way are among the main objectives.  Food production, tourism, and defense programs are among those  with greater impact on the economic and social development of  the island. Basic services to the people will also be improved.    Radio Reloj at 2054 GMT on 27 Jan reports that approximately  2,600 housing units were completed in Pinar del Rio in 1993. Of  the 14 municipalities, 13 built more housing than in 1992. The  province has a 600-house plan for 1994, and is seeking to build  in materials-efficient ways.    Cuba Vision Network at 0100 GMT on 28 January reports that  miners in Moa received a donation from British miners of shoes,  shirts, and gloves valued at $15,000.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 28 January reports that the  Bio-  Alimentos research center in Moron, Ciego de Avila, has  developed a new high protein feed for pigs and chickens;  production will begin soon at the 1 January center in Moron  Municipality.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 29 January reports that  Valencia  and Havana City have signed an agreement for a supply of Pegasus  buses as a cooperative gesture of solidarity to improve  transport in Havana. Garbage collectors, street cleaners,  containers, spare parts, and specific tools for the repair of  these vehicles will also be provided. Pedro Chavez, president of  the Provincial Assembly of the People's Government, stressed the  importance of the agreement and announced that 30 garbage  collectors, 10 street cleaners, and some 4,000 containers will  begin arriving in February.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 on 29 January adds that the Carisol  and  Los Corales hotels were officially dedicated this morning in  Santiago de Cuba and Varadero. The exploitation of these hotels,  considered symbols of Cuban tourism development, will be shared  by Cubanacan and the German chain LTD.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 31  January report that the Che Guevara Plant in Moa, Holguin  Province, has saved more than 1.7 million pesos since September  by burning oil instead of coal. This was achieved through the  research carried out by Engineer Hector Agotis de Ansana, who  has been conducting oil- burning tests since 1992. Fifteen kg of  oil replaces a ton of coal.    Radio Reloj at 1506 GMT on 31 January reports that an  experiment in minifarms is being expanded in Cienfuegos Province  because results have been good. There are 180 such farms in  Cienfuegos for tending cattle. Each farm has two workers only --  and sometimes their families -- who are responsible for 30 cows.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 31 January announces that an  eight- week master class in business law and its economic and  international implications began on 31 January in Havana, under  the joint auspices of the Autonomous University of Madrid and  the University of Havana, sponsored by the Guitart hotel chain.  Gabriel Garcia, legal director of the university, explained that  "the main objective of the course is so Spain and Cuba can  exchange legal experience and cooperate in the process of  legislative change that could eventually take place in Cuba as a  result of an increase in certain kinds of businesses, such as  the tourist business." The course targets lawyers responsible  for negotiating foreign investments in Cuba. Garcia explains  that such a course is timely because of the "large Spanish  investment in Cuba," and also because of the many other foreign  investments, since there are "probably" ongoing negotiations  with foreign firms that intend to set up branches in Cuba.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 31 January reports that Las  Tunas is attempting to increase the 300 mini-dairy farms in the  province to 1,000 in 1994 to increase milk production. Las Tunas  Province produced approximately 33 million liters of milk in  1993.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 31 January reports that Pedro  Ross said in a meeting with workers from the 14 de Julio Sugar  Mill in Cienfuegos Province that only 1,000 of the 7,000  caballerias of sugarcane scheduled for planting nationwide  between January and April have been planted to date.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 31 January reports that AIDS  patients at the sanatorium in the city of Cienfuegos will be  trained to make articles of leather and fabric. "This activity  joins the efforts by the Ministry of Public Health and other  Cienfuegos Province institutions and organizations to  incorporate these patients into a socially useful life and  contribute to their personal fulfilment. The AIDS patients will,  through this work, cooperate in making the sanatorium  self-financing."    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 1 Februrary reports that  Ernesto  Melendez, minister president of the State Committee for Economic  Cooperation, upon opening the fifth meeting of the regional  committee for the development of subcontracting in Latin  America, said that in the past three years, Cuba's trade with  the region rose from 7 to 30 percent.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 1 February reports the  following:    Dominica Coconut Production has donated five tons of laundry  and toilet soaps to Cuba. The firm's representative called the  donation "another gesture of solidarity with the Cuban people  and government, which are struggling to get through the complex  moment of the special period and repercussions from the weather."    A new France-Cuba flight has been inaugurated. The first  joint flight by the companies (OM) and Cubana de Aviacion took  place on 31 January. (Michel Taillant), the French airline's  marketing director, explains that an increase in the number of  flights between France and Cuba over the past few months led the  two companies to schedule joint flights to supplement the  regular flights of each. He adds, "This is probably a prelude to  additional regular flights....This new airline, with a weekly  Havana-Paris-Havana flight, will develop and expand French-Cuban  tourism relations...." Flights will leave Havana for Paris on  Sunday and return on Monday.    Pinar del Rio Province expects to harvest over 0.5 million  quintals of tomatoes from the 150 caballerias that have been  planted. Eighty percent of these tomatoes will be earmarked for  consumption in Havana and Pinar del Rio, the rest for industry  and for seeds. Workers from Pinar del Rio and from the  Revolutionary Armed Forces "35th Anniversary of the Triumph of  the Revolution" group are responsible for harvesting these  tomatoes.    A report from Camaguey says Cuba has begun producing hog  cholera vaccine with which to vaccinate all the nation's  livestock. Camaguey Province is a priority, under the existing  program.</p>

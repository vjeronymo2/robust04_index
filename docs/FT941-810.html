			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Leuna oil refinery to go ahead: Elf board approves accord with Treuhand over reducing stake The main construction work of the Leuna 2000 oil refinery, one of the largest industrial projects in eastern Germany, should start next month. This follows the resolution of a dispute between Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group, and the Treuhand privatisation agency, Mr Philippe Jaffre, Elf's chairman, said yesterday. Mr Jaffre said Elf's board had approved the draft accord with the Treuhand yesterday but said certain areas still needed clarifying. He believed, however, that a final agreement could be signed by the end of the month. Under the terms of the agreement, Elf will reduce its stake in the DM4.5bn (Pounds 1.75bn) project from 67 per cent to 43 per cent, following the acquisition of a 24 per cent stake by Rosneft, the Russian state-owned oil group. It will also be relieved of a requirement to retain an additional 33 per cent stake from Thyssen Handels-union, a subsidiary of the German steel group, should Thyssen sell the stake after the refinery is built. The areas of clarification requested by Elf's board include the terms by which the 33 per cent stake would be transferred from Thyssen to Buna, the German state-owned chemicals company. Mr Jaffre said Elf wanted to be sure that the terms of the transactions were fair. He said his decision to reduce Elf's stake in the project, which prompted an angry reaction from the Treuhand, was based on concerns about its viability under the terms of the original agreement. 'The project was too big for Elf to undertake alone. We needed the backing of a solid German partner,' he said. According to Mr Jaffre, the future of the project could not have been guaranteed without a partner committed to the refinery after the construction phase. He said that Elf would have pulled out of the project if partners had not been found. 'I would have preferred to cut off my finger than my hand,' he said. Mr Jaffre, who took over as Elf chairman last August, said he was satisfied with the participation of Rosneft and denied that this involved risks. He said the Russians were to pay for their stake in crude oil, which they needed to export. A similar agreement had been negotiated with Rosneft under the previous Elf chairman, Mr Loik le Floch-Prigent. According to Mr Jaffre, the compromise agreement does not include the surrender of any Minol service stations which were acquired as part of the oil refinery deal. Buna may take a 33 per cent stake in Minol, but Elf says it would still be left with a controlling 66 per cent share.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Fed wins respite for ailing dollar ahead of jobs report The US Federal Reserve yesterday intervened in the currency markets for the second day running to support the ailing dollar. Analysts said intervention had gained the dollar a short-term respite, without arresting the predominantly bearish sentiment towards the currency. Thin market conditions allowed the Fed to push the dollar higher. However, the US currency faces an important test today with the publication of the monthly employment report. Financial markets regard the report as an inflationary indicator, and concern about rising inflation in the US is a main factor behind dollar weakness. The Fed's action follows repeated intervention on Wednesday after the dollar fell to a low of Y96.05. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, warned on Wednesday: 'Continuation of recent foreign exchange trends would be counterproductive for the US and the world economy.' Earlier in the year the administration came under fire for pursuing a policy of benign neglect towards the dollar. Critics said the US was using a cheap dollar to win greater access to Japanese markets. Mr Bentsen and the administration have since sought to stress that the administration favours a stronger dollar. The Fed first intervened yesterday towards the close of European trading, buying dollars at Y97.90 and DM1.5155, and then continued to buy at regular intervals. The intervention lifted the dollar to Y98 and DM1.5225 in afternoon trading in New York. The US central bank appeared to be following a familiar pattern of buying dollars in waves through about 15 separate banks, in lots of about Dollars 10m per bank. Traders estimated that the Fed spent Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn buying dollars in Wednesday's intervention. There is fairly widespread scepticism about the benefits of intervention without supportive monetary policy changes. Many believe the dollar will fall lower if not supported by higher US interest rates. Many analysts expect the Fed to tighten monetary policy, lifting short-term interest rates by at least 50 basis points, if today's employment report shows continued strong economic growth. Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan in London, noted that 'Dollars 25bn of Bank of Japan intervention through the year has massively exceeded Fed intervention, without turning the dollar trend'. Two reasons cited for the intervention were the US Treasury's desire not to have the dollar at record lows next week when US mid-term congressional elections, and the quarterly treasury refunding, take place.</p>

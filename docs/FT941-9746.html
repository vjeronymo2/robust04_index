			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Maverick that made good - Debbie Harrison charts National Mutual's progress from the days when Keynes was boss / Insurance for Life National Mutual's reputation as an investment maverick goes back a long way. The chairman from 1921-38 was John Maynard Keynes, the man who helped shape post-second world war economic policy. He took National Mutual into equities at a time when the sector was shunned by most life offices. More recently, the company re-shaped its core business structure, moving in the mid-1980s from endowment policies - which it felt were unsuitable to repay mortgages - and into pensions. Once this decision was made, the transition period was almost indecently quick. During the October 1987 stock market upheaval, National Mutual pulled out of the mortgage market overnight and has never looked back. The company's investment aim is to be in the top quartile (top 25 per cent) of returns on a rolling three-year basis when compared with similar funds. Its unit-linked personal pension funds have achieved this target easily (with the exception of the index-linked fund), while the managed fund was one of only five recommended by actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow in its annual surveys of the market in 1993 and 1992*. But returns on the managed and UK equities funds tailed off in 1993, partly because the investment team did not take part in the boom in smaller company shares. Apart from performance, one of the most important features for which to look in a financial product is the level and flexibility of charges. Although abandoned in 1989, the Maximum Commission Agreement (MCA) is still used as a benchmark by life offices. It was devised by the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) to impose a ceiling on the level of commission life offices could pay an independent adviser. National Mutual's maximum payment - 133 per cent of the MCA - is the industry average. Commission paid depends on the term of the policy. On a 20-year monthly-premium personal pension plan, for instance, the MCA up-front commission rate would have been just under 45 per cent of the first year's premiums. At 133 per cent, the commission would be about 59.5 per cent of the first year's premiums. National Mutual's annual investment management charge is low at 0.36 per cent, compared with 0.5-1 per cent charged by most competitors. Elsewhere, its charging structure is relatively clear compared with rival products. Where you opt to pay fees to an independent adviser, so that the cost of commission is removed from your policy, there are no early termination penalties. If commission is paid on the unit-linked policy, this is recouped from the early premiums which are allocated to initial units. Premiums continue to buy these lower-value units for the first 12 months. If the policy is cancelled during this period, there will be a penalty. The with-profits personal pension does carry a market value adjuster - a discretionary penalty on withdrawing funds during, say, a stock market crash. To date, however, the company has not used this mechanism. National Mutual's expense ratio, at 22.64 per cent in 1992, is higher than the industry average (19.3 per cent in 1991), but Gavin Hill, managing director, says this does not reflect the true impact of its charges. The most widely used indicator is the 'reduction in yield' figure, which shows the equivalent annual percentage charge over the life of a contract. On the society's 25-year, unit-linked personal pension, the RIY was 1.3 per cent in 1993. This is below the industry average of 1.6 per cent, according to the Financial Times Personal Pensions 1994 handbook. The worst scandal to hit the personal pensions sector since the product was launched in 1988 has been the widespread mis-selling of transfer plans to employees with company pensions. But National Mutual has a strict policy on transfer business. Hill says: 'A transfer value analysis must accompany all transfer applications. If the analysis does not support the transfer, the case will not be accepted unless some other justification can be produced.' The society sells exclusively through independent advisers but Hill warns that people must check an IFA's credentials thoroughly before accepting advice. 'If you are seeking advice from an independent adviser, make sure that person or firm has proven expertise on the pensions market,' he says. Hill is neutral in the debate over fees versus commissions. 'Advice has to be paid for. The most important point is that the consumer should come to a clear agreement with the adviser on the level of remuneration. It is then a matter of choice whether this is paid-for by fees or by a commission. 'Moreover, it is no good comparing projected returns on commission-based products with nil-commission plans. The comparison is only fair if the cost of the fees is compounded over the term of the contract and added in to the final total.' Continuity of investment staff at National Mutual is good. So is the society's 'persistency ratio' of 94.7 per cent; this indicates the number of policies that continue to maturity rather than being terminated early. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, awards NM an 'average' financial strength assessment. This denotes 'adequate financial strength' but cautions that 'this strength may be affected by adverse economic or underwriting conditions'. National Mutual has won several industry awards for service and administration. *Bacon &amp; Woodrow Personal Pension Survey 1993, Bacon &amp; Woodrow, Private Client Department, Ivy House, 107 St Peter's Street, St Albans, Herts.

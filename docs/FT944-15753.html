			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Nissan UK chairman paid Pounds 1.94m last year: 514% rise as company records loss of Pounds 11m Mr Octav Botnar, the chairman of Nissan UK, for whom an arrest warrant has been outstanding for more than two-and-a-half years, was paid Pounds 1.94m last year in his role as chairman of Nissan UK Holdings (NUKH) and its subsidiary Nissan UK (NUK). His emoluments, excluding any pension contributions, increased by 514 per cent from Pounds 316,000 in the previous year, according to the latest annual reports filed by NUKH and NUK for the year ended July 1993. Mr Botnar is also chairman of Automotive Financial Group Holdings, which owns AFG, one of the biggest UK motor dealer groups and a sister company of NUKH. According to annual reports now filed for both holding companies, Mr Botnar increased his total pay from the two groups to Pounds 5.75m in the year to the end of July 1993, a 1,189 per cent increase from Pounds 446,000 in the previous year. NUKH, which had a turnover of Pounds 15.55m in the year to the end of July 1993, made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 11.34m and paid its directors Pounds 5.6m in total emoluments. The company, whose ultimate parent undertaking, according to the annual report, is the Panama-incorporated European Motor Vehicles Corporation, now has only two directors, Mr Botnar and Mr Manfred Weder, a Swiss national and company director, according to NUKH filings at Companies House. Payments were made to a total of seven directors during the financial year, but five of the seven are no longer directors. The annual report says that Pounds 1.028m was paid in 'compensation for loss of office to former directors' as part of the Pounds 5.6m in total emoluments. The second highest-paid director after Mr Botnar received between Pounds 1.86m and Pounds 1.865m. The report says that Mr Michael Hunt resigned as a director on June 28 1993. Mr Hunt was sentenced last year to eight years in prison for his part in Britain's largest-ever tax fraud, in which he was convicted for conspiring to defraud the Inland Revenue of Pounds 55m in corporation tax. Mr Hunt's appeal against conviction and sentence were rejected on all counts by the Appeal Court in May. In July he was given leave to appeal to the House of Lords, when the Court of Appeal certified that the case raised a point of law of general public importance. An arrest warrant was issued in January 1992 for Mr Botnar who is living in Switzerland. Nissan UK fights suit, Page 11</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Leading Article: Opening letters THE LATEST idea being floated on Post Office privatisation looks a fairly transparent dodge. On the one hand, the government is naturally anxious not to be seen to be privatising another monopoly. On the other, it is publicly committed to maintaining universal delivery. These criteria are difficult to marry. If Royal Mail is exposed to competition in lucrative areas such as central London, while still obliged to deliver at the same rate to Caithness or Land's End, it cannot thrive as a commercial entity. Its sister operation Parcelforce, which works under just such a regime, loses money. One answer would be to set up a formal duopoly, with a commercial operator such as TNT or DHL working alongside Royal Mail on the same terms and obligations. But this presents the government with a familiar dilemma. The more real the competition, the less attractive the business to the investing public. The suggested solution is ingenious: that anyone should be free to set up in competition to Royal Mail, provided there is the same commitment to universal service. In formal terms, there would thus be no question of a monopoly. But since the cost of setting up such a service nationally would be very heavy, the prospect of a free-for-all might well deter competitors entirely. This is a fact which the stock market, when weighing the attractions of Royal Mail shares, would doubtless work out for itself. On closer inspection, the whole idea is a non-starter. A regulator would have to be appointed, whose job it would be to assess competition in real rather than formal terms. To lure competitors in, it would be necessary to restrict the number of licences and allow a period of transition, as with telecommunications. The parallel can be taken further. In practice, competition in telecoms has not meant half a dozen land lines running down each street alongside BT's. It would be no more sensible to have half a dozen postmen delivering alongside Royal Mail's. As with telecoms, there are numerous points in the system at which competition can be introduced. Duplicating the basic distribution system would be wasteful and unnecessary. Nor is it strictly necessary that competitors should carry a universal service obligation at all. They could compete in more lucrative areas, provided they paid Royal Mail a fee to reflect the social cost it carries in serving remoter regions. But these are perhaps matters of detail. The main point is that there is much work to be done before the nature of a privatised Post Office has been properly thought through. As it happens, it may now be too late to include the sale in the next parliamentary session. If so, the time can usefully be employed in returning to basics. It remains the case that there is no objection to a privatised Post Office as a matter of principle: rather the reverse. A sensible step would be for the government to publish a green paper setting out the options.</p>

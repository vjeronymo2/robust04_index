			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Afternoon data help consolidate bourse recovery Lower than expected US retail growth figures, the reaction in US and European bond markets and better news from Swiss pharmaceuticals were all influential as bourses rose for the second day in succession, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's experience was a measure of the day, the Dax index rising just 1.62 to 2,055.62 in official floor trading, as turnover eased from DM5.4bn to DM5.5bn, but spurting in the afternoon on the Ibis, screen-based system to end the day at 2,070.71. Bund futures led the way up, the September contract breaking through resistance at 93.50 to register a gain of 70 basis points near the end the day. There was some response in senior blue chip prices, Allianz ending the afternoon at DM2,470, up DM50, and Daimler adding DM11.20 at DM737.20; but the big three chemicals, near their highs for the day, were still subdued following Wednesday's sell-off. Dealers said that there was more interest in second-rank blue chips. Schering, the pharmaceuticals group, rose DM14 on the session to DM921 after relative weakness recently, and Continental, the tyremaker, put on DM8 at DM244.50. ZURICH recovered its confidence in a rebound led by pharmaceuticals after first half figures from Sandoz. The SMI index rose 53.1 or 2.2 per cent to 2,528.3, with the firmer dollar and the latest US economic data enhancing the mood. Sandoz registered rose SFr11 to SFr659 after it reported first half sales growth of 2 per cent in Swiss franc terms. While this was at the lower end of expectations, analysts noted that the market was relieved that the statement contained no negative surprises. Ciba registered rose SFr11 to SFr732 as it forecast that 1994 group net profit would rise, in spite of the weak dollar. Roche certificates recouped SFr100 to SFr5,500. The shares had fallen by 10 per cent over the previous two sessions after Roche unveiled its own six month sales figures on Tuesday. Nestle rose SFr42 to SFr1,112 but analysts said there was no specific news to account for the 3.9 per cent rise. MILAN climbed 2 per cent, content that preliminary indications of the government's economic plan were in line with expectations and boosted by short covering ahead of the end of the July account today. The Comit index rose 13.86 to 701.21. Trading picked up, with stronger demand by funds and institutional investors prompting hopes of an imminent return by retail investors. Ras led insurers higher, rising L1,650 or 6.8 per cent to L25,650, on the view that the sector was oversold in preparation for the Ina privatisation and that it will benefit from a government reform of pensions. Banks were also strong with Credito Italiano rising L100 or 4.9 per cent to L2,130. BCI also put on L100 to L2,130: earlier this week, James Capel commented that the shares were cheap and that, in terms of earnings recovery potential, BCI looked interesting. Telecoms continued to recover from recent losses with Sip up L125 to L4,360 and Stet L165 higher at L5,540. The sector's strength spilled over to Olivetti, L70 higher at L2,510, and Pirelli which added L45 to L2,685. Falck, the steel group, picked up from a 5.5 per cent fall to finish L100 lower at L5,002 on news that its chairman had been arrested in connection with investigations into alleged bribes paid to fraud squad officials. Rinascente, the retail group was L194 higher at L9,722 as its managing director was arrested as part of the same investigation. About 50 arrest warrants were said to have been issued for businessmen and fraud squad officers. AMSTERDAM rose modestly with volatility still present ahead of today's expiry of options. The AEX index gained 2.53 to 388.84. Firm prices were was seen all round, although investor interest was tamed by the lack of corporate news. Elsevier impressed with a Fl 3.00 rise to Fl 157.40 while the chemical groups, Akzo and DSM, also featured, rising respectively by Fl 1.60 and Fl 1.40 to Fl 196.60 and Fl 131.80. DSM was recommended by James Capel even although the second quarter results, due early next month, may not repeat their good first quarter performance, owing to restructuring charges. Nevertheless, Capel suggested that after losses in 1993, the company could report earnings per share of around Fl 20 by 1996. MADRID offered a relatively moderate reaction to its own bond market gains, the general index closing 1.26 higher at 302.66 in turnover of Pta26.8bn after a rise of 123 basis points to 90.85 in the September bund future. Banesto offered some comfort to stale bulls of the rescued banking stock, recovering Pta80 to Pta980 as BCH rose Pta50 to Pta2,625 and Santander Pta105 to Pta4,920. However, Repsol refused to react further to crude oil prices after its gains on the Nigerian oil workers strike, losing Pta50 at Pta3,960; while Sarrio, the paper group, fined by the European Commission for alleged cartel practices, lost Pta22 at Pta528. TEL AVIV resumed its recovery from a 1994 low of 148.01 last week after a fall of 2.7 per cent on Wednesday, the Mishtanim index recovering 6.59, or 3.9 per cent to 174.76. WARSAW tumbled on profit-taking after seven consecutive gains, the Wig index closing 655.8, or 5.9 per cent lower at 10,407.1 in turnover down 25 per cent at 1,000bn zlotys. Some brokers said that the market had advanced by more than 40 per cent over the previous two weeks, that a correction was long overdue and that it was likely to deepen early next week.

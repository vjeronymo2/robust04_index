			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Tate &amp; Lyle issues profits warning: Tate shares fall SHARES in Tate &amp; Lyle fell 25p to 375p yesterday after the sugar and sweeteners group said profits for the year to September 25 would 'fall short of the 1991 level'. Analysts cut profit forecasts from around Pounds 235m to about Pounds 220m pre-tax following the announcement. Some also cut forecasts for 1994. Tate said this year's results would still show 'a marked improvement over those achieved last year', when it suffered its first trading reverse for 14 years. In 1992 pre-tax profits dropped to Pounds 189.5m from Pounds 230.8m in 1991. Analysts had expected a rebound above the 1991 figure in the current year, a view reinforced by interim pre-tax profits up 20 per cent to Pounds 107.6m. Tate said trading in its North American sweeteners businesses had been less buoyant than expected in the second half of the year. In North America, Western Sugar, which processes sugar beet, had difficulties at a new molasses desugarisation plant. US government quotas, introduced to reduce the amount of sugar on the market, had forced it to hold higher stocks. Low sugar prices hit margins at Tate's Domino sugar subsidiary, which refines sugar cane. AE Staley, which makes high fructose sweetener from corn, had recovered some of the volume it lost in 1992, but prices had not risen as hoped, Tate said, and margins fell. The industrial dispute at Staley was yet to be resolved but would not have a material effect on profits. Floods in the mid-west had cut production from some rivals but this was too late to benefit the 1993 figures. Mr Paul Lewis, finance director, said the announcement had been made because the group was seeing analysts later this week before annual results are published in November. Tate thought market forecasts were too high and decided to make a public statement, following the London Stock Exchange's censure of London International Group after it guided analysts to cut profit forecasts without making a formal announcement. Mr Lewis, who appeared surprised by the London stock market reaction, said the statement represented a 'slight modification' to expectations, which would not affect dividend policy. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Federated Department Stores cuts net deficit FEDERATED Department Stores, the large US department store group which recently emerged from bankruptcy, made a reduced Dollars 29.4m loss after tax in the second quarter to August 1 and an operating profit of Dollars 27.3m. In the same period a year earlier, the net loss was Dollars 143.8m, while operating profit totalled just Dollars 8.5m. Sales fell year-on-year to Dollars 1.46bn, compared with Dollars 1.49bn, but this partly reflects the reduction in stores operated. Federated said that same-store sales increased by 1.7 per cent. The results take the first half loss after tax to Dollars 17.6m, compared with Dollars 208m a year earlier. Yesterday, Mr Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman, said the figures were better than anticipated, and he expected a 'modest improvement' for the rest of the year, with business strengthening the key fourth quarter. The group takes in over 220 department stores, including the Bloomingdale's outlets, The Bon Marche, Jordan Marsh and Abraham &amp; Straus. Federated shares were unchanged at Dollars 13 7/8 yesterday.</p>

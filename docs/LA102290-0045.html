			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW ;  </P> <P> AN UNSETTLING BLAIR BROWN BUOYS 'EXTREME CLOSE-UP' ON NBC  </P> <P> The era of the flashback in movies may be coming to an end. Characters need no  longer retreat within themselves and silently reminisce; instead, for better or  worse, directors can now sit them down in front of a VCR and show them watching  their own old home videos.  </P> <P> "Extreme Close-Up" (tonight at 9 on Channels 4, 36 and 39) operates out of a  potentially gimmicky premise -- that its troubled 17-year-old protagonist, who  is almost Oedipally obsessed with his recently deceased mother, will learn  something startling about both her life and his from wading through the stacks  of family videotapes he shot in happier times. The mother, played by Blair  Brown, is already dead as the film begins and is seen only as the boy  worshipfully studies her VHS image. It has the potential to turn into an  unwitting pilot for "America's Most Maudlin Home Videos."  </P> <P> This riveting film, though -- created by several members of the  "thirtysomething" team -- transcends its novelty with almost shocking emotional  clarity and believable revelations both big and small. As the teen-aged  would-be documentarian sticks another tape in the deck and "Close-Up" shifts  from the glossiness of film stock to the immediacy of videotape, it's as  chilling for us as it is for him to watch these past events unfold so  texturally close yet so far away.  </P> <P> At first, Brown is seen only as preternaturally vibrant, the world's most hip  and cheerful mom. Soon, though, in these flashbacks we see the intimations of  an unbalanced personality that the children bore witness to but were usually  encouraged to deny by Dad, Craig T. Nelson. The boy, Morgan Weisser, is  expected to have worked through his grief, but he's increasingly haunted by the  idea that he might be all too much like his mother -- whose tortured psyche he  hasn't begun to understand.  </P> <P> Part of what makes "Extreme Close-Up" so unusually perceptive is the way that  characters come to understand how each other ticks in small and meaningful ways  well before the climax, but then go on to behave selfishly or protectively for  a while yet anyway, just like in life.  </P> <P> Brown's performance is a brilliantly unsettling anchor, as she goes from  supermom into some mostly suggested scary shifts. Weisser and Samantha Mathis,  as a girl he befriends at school, make for two of the most credible teens  you're likely to see adults dream up. Director Peter Horton (co-star and  occasional director on "thirtysomething") and scenarist/executive producers Ed  Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz (of the same show) have done TV proud again with  the kind of close-up that could only work on the small screen.

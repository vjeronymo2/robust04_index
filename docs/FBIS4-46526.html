			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with A. Savenkov, director of the Russian Federal </F> Employment Service's "Intellectual Resources" interregional  center, by Inna Rozanova; date and place of interview not  stated: "If You Have No Job You Cannot Lose It" -- first  paragraph is introduction; passages between slantlines are  Rozanova insertions]    [Text] The clan of defense monsters accustomed to a  comfortable existence at the state's expense has found itself in  the clutches of conversion. The panic over the absence of  orders for research and development and production reigns not  only in the top echelons of the military-industrial complex  leadership. Highly qualified cadres -- society's intellectual  elite and virtuoso workers -- have found themselves unemployed.  A. Savenkov, director of the Russian Federal Employment Service  "Intellectual Resources" interregional center, tells the tale.    [Rozanova] Aleksandr Valentinovich, in periods of social  upheavals the Russian intelligentsia traditionally asks age-old  questions: "Who is to blame?" and "what is to be done?" How  would you answer the first question?    [Savenkov] It is not the government, not any parties or  legislative organs, but solely the leaders of the  military-industrial complex enterprises who are to blame for the  situation which has taken shape. The economic situation  dictates its own laws. And, of course, one can name dozens of  enterprises where the leaders perform miracles of heroism,  saving the unique formations entrusted to them. A fine example  is the capital's steel scientific research institute, which has  now become a joint-stock company and continues to work for the  defense industry. The collective headed by director Vladimir  Shashkin has been able to face up to the market.    [Rozanova] The concept of conversion has been in existence  for a long time now....    [Savenkov] There are conceptual documents. But a concept is  something unsteady, a subjective view of objective processes.  It is not even a program, not a plan of measures, still less a  law. What is needed is a law, a clear law down to the trivial  details, so that when it is implemented the features of the  country's sectors and regions can be considered. I myself am a  supporter of swift, resolute actions and am entirely in favor of  the transformations initiated by Yegor Gaydar. But the most  complex thing is that each person, whether he is unemployed, a  scientist or a millionaire, is a person, not a machine. So the  law on conversion should first of all consider the realities of  the person and only second should it consider the economic  aspect of the problem.    [Rozanova] Last year alone about 1.5 million people were  laid off from defense production facilities. Are the  unemployment growth rates in the defense industry high now?    [Savenkov] By the end of last year the rate in the defense  complex was lower. People are being misled into thinking that  all financing problems will soon be resolved and state orders  and credits will be issued. But that faith is leaving people.  Another layoff of manpower from military-industrial complex  enterprises is forecast.    /From the newspaper's files    According to the figures of the Russian Federal Employment  Service as of early 1994:    -- in "closed" cities every second unemployed person is aged  18-29 while throughout Russia as a whole young people make up  one-third of the total number of unemployed;    -- the unemployed who have been unable to find work for 12  months or more comprise 17.9 percent of the total number of  unemployed in the "closed" cities. Throughout Russia as a whole  this figure is considerably lower, to wit 12.9 percent./    [Rozanova] Well, is there any concealed unemployment --  switching to a part-time working day or week?    [Savenkov] Yes, and this is now one way of preserving the  cadres potential. The military-industrial complex knows that  usually there are no more than five high-class specialists in a  particular avenue of scientific research at the defense  industry's enterprises and scientific research institutes and it  is enough for two of them to "fall out of the nest" for the  remaining three to be unable to do anything to ensure that the  enterprise is not reduced to chaos and is not faced with the  need to change its technological orientation, its sectorial  direction, and its products list.    But in general terms, relying on salvation with the aid of  concealed unemployment is to hope that a soap bubble will last  an eternity.    [Rozanova] One of the main cadres problems of conversion is  the loss of the level of skill of defense production workers.  But there is also the opinion that, on the contrary, workers  from military plants will have to improve their qualifications  in order to learn to make teapots instead of missiles -- after  all, these people were used to fulfilling orders on supermodern  equipment while workers in civilian industry are literally  working miracles on antiquated machine tools.    [Savenkov] Paradoxical though it may seem, those deprived of  their ultramodern equipment will have to be retrained: They  will be unable to compete with workers on obsolete machine  tools. And these people will have to summon up the courage to  realize that nothing terrible has happened.    The demands of the day -- to be prepared to change your  profession and undergo retraining -- will enable people to  survive in the most difficult situation. Another characteristic  of the current period is the education of the population in the  spirit of professional mobility. So they do not try to chain  themselves to the city or settlement where their nearest and  dearest are buried, where they have developed friendships with  colleagues, or even where they have family. People must be  taught to move around in search of work -- in order to save  their families, their friendships, and even their cities or  settlements.    [Rozanova] Outstanding specialists, once preoccupied with  defense topics, are now free to think and work. Many of them  have decided to change their lifestyle, setting up small  businesses, for example, based on their departments or design  bureaus, and without demanding massive credits from the state.  But can you say that small businesses are a solution?    [Savenkov] They are one of the most effective and honest  ways out of the present grim situation. They are a way of  helping people not lose their skills, but retain them for better  days. But some leaders are finding it difficult to take such  steps, because it deprives them of their power monopoly. They  are clinging to power to the bitter end and are even refusing to  lease premises and equipment to their own people and are not  registering small businesses, and this is a bad policy by bad  leaders.    What would I recommend? Under the guidance of the  administration, conclude articles of association with small  businesses based on departments or design bureaus, so that when  the "light at the end of the tunnel" appears, all this potential  will work for the benefit of the mother enterprise. Not  allowing premises and equipment to be privatized, but leasing  them out.    /From the newspaper's files    According to the figures of the Russian Federal Employment  Service, as of 1 January 1994 in the "closed" cities the  proportion of unemployed people with higher and secondary  specialized education was 53.2 percent of the total number of  unemployed, while for Russia as a whole this indicator was much  lower -- 37.9 percent./    [Rozanova] The mono-cities are literally on the brink of  extinction now....    [Savenkov] The mono-cities are the result of the GULAG  principle in the building of our society. There are two  diametrically opposed options for resolving the problem. The  first is a dead city which all the people have left and where  all the windows are broken, which, incidentally, is not uncommon  abroad. The second option is that the state shrugs aside all  principles and market laws and simply provides the money to feed  these people.    The best option of all is that of compromise. I think the  first thing the administration should do in each city is to make  an inventory of manpower resources in conjunction with the  employment service. Usually, the employment service's team of  experts consists of leading specialists in the sphere of  economics, law, business, sociology, and psychology, and as a  rule the group is able to make a diagnosis within a week. Then,  with the active participation of the local trade union and  administration, the working people should be briefed on the  situation the enterprise is in and on what could happen if this  or that path is taken. They should be asked what other jobs  they could do. What other speciality are they prepared to be  retrained in?    [Rozanova] And what is your view of the problem of the  "nuclear brain drain" abroad?    [Savenkov] If you think about it, what exactly are we trying  to ban? The spread of knowledge on the most efficient and  ecologically clean form of energy, which resembles in its  parameters the energy of the sun, wind, and tides? If it is a  question of weapons, that is a problem for the politicians. But  let us not drag into political battles scientists who can find a  solution to practically any problem if the finance is available.  If there is a financially advantageous order to be had, even if  it is directed against humanity, people will always be found who  will carry it out. The fight should be against the "clients for  death," not the engineers and workers.    And what if you look at the "brain drain" the other way  round? If the transplantation of specialists to other countries  is regarded as aid to neighbors, as a friendly act? This will  help our country's science too. After working for a given  period, our specialists will come home rich and happy.    [Rozanova] Judging by your answers to my questions, the  "Intellectual Resources" center has done good theoretical work.  But has it yielded a practical return?    [Savenkov] Of course. We are testing our theory at about 10  settlements in Moscow Oblast -- in the cities of Zhukovskiy,  Odintsovo, Fryazino, Balashikha, Kaliningrad, Pushkino,  Pavlovo-Posada, and Dubna, and the settlement of Kurovskoye in  Orekhovo-Zuyevskiy Rayon. For instance, at the "Istok"  enterprise which is undergoing conversion in the science city  of Fryazino, in less than six weeks this year, with active  financial and organizational assistance from Viktor Ponomarev,  director of the Moscow Oblast Employment Center, more than 50  new jobs for women were created, for the "Istok" employees who  had been subject to cuts and for the unemployed people of the  city of Fryazino. A line was installed and production started  up for the production of Russian-designed hearing aids at  "Istok" in record time.    /From the newspaper's files    According to the figures of the Russian Federal Employment  Service:    -- In the first quarter of 1994 in Russia as a whole the  number of unemployed increased 29.7 percent, whereas in the  "closed" cities it increased 22.8 percent.    -- As of 1 April 1994 in Russia as a whole there were 4.7  unemployed citizens for every vacancy registered with the  employment service. In the "closed" cities this indicator was,  on average, 4.1./    [Rozanova] All the same, can we end our conversation today  on an optimistic note?    [Savenkov] We not only can, but should. Because Russia is  still here, whether people like it or not. Russia is an  unsinkable cruiser, and no storms will make it sink to the  bottom of history.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / International Press Review: Indonesia - Jitters over foreign investors The widely-used derogatory Indonesian term for westerners is bule - which translates as albino - and over the past week, the prospect of bule capital entering Indonesia's media sector has been a hotly-debated topic in the national press. It was sparked off by a foreign investment deregulation package from the government which promised to abolish restrictions on foreign equity and open up sectors such as media, seaports, telecommunications, nuclear power, railways and civil aviation, all of which had previously been barred to foreign ownership. Most newspaper editorials have indicated that, while they can tolerate foreign ownership in most sectors, the media are off limits. Television stations and newspapers, they argue, are the 'tools of national struggle'. Leading that line of argument are the dailies Republika and Kompas, widely regarded as pro-establishment newspapers. 'If foreign capital is allowed to enter the press world in Indonesia many things can happen,' warned an editorial in Republika last week. 'The spirit of nationalism may be given second class status by the capital owners.' In a country where political labels such as 'nationalist' or 'reformist' are more appropriate than left-wing or right-wing, foreign investment deregulation treads on sensitive ground. Nationalists argue that keeping the national spirit alive and well is paramount because Indonesia's 180m people are made up of hundreds of ethnic groupings. Ironically, foreign investors have expressed little interest in placing money in the Indonesian media because of the arbitrary restrictions imposed on public debate. An editorial in the widely-read English language daily, the Jakarta Post, which usually takes a reformist line, asked, 'Which foreign media baron would be willing to invest millions of dollars in a business that runs the risk of having its licence revoked at any moment for publishing the wrong kind of information?' In fact, deregulation of the media sector flies in the face of a law dating from 1982 which stipulates that foreigners are not allowed to own newspapers or broadcasting stations. Newspapers and government ministers fighting the new regulation have not failed to point this out. But in a country where the rule of law has yet to find its grip, all that has resulted is confusion. The deregulation package appears to have been slapped together in a hurry in order to counter falling foreign investment at a time when other Asian countries are attracting strong inflows. This point was not lost on the weekly Economic &amp; Business Review Indonesia, which noted that because of the rush 'the impression that has been created - intentionally or otherwise - is that there was a lack of co-ordination among government agencies whose domains were to be reformed.' The likelihood is that ministries did not bother to consult one another at all. Foreign investors, used to this state of affairs, barely raised an eyebrow when President Suharto was reported to have said that the media would remain closed to foreigners only four days after the deregulation package was announced by senior ministers. Mr Suharto reacted to pressure from Mr Harmoko, information minister, who teamed up with local journalists and publishers, arguing that foreign capital in the media sector threatened Indonesia's national integrity and exposed it to foreign influence. It was a humiliation for the cabinet's economic team. Mr Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, chairman of the Investment Co-ordinating Board, was quick to tell local reporters that people should give the reform team enough time to review the whole package. Attempts are being made to boost the role of parliament in policy formation, instead of ministerial decree, but no one yet really knows how to go about implementing new policies. 'There has yet to be a method of establishing such vital policies as economic reforms which are then willingly accepted by parliament, the executive branch of government and the people in general,' said Business &amp; Economic Review Indonesia. The latest foreign investment deregulation package differs from other deregulation measures in that it introduces drastic changes in one go. As a result, even the most reformist of newspapers have joined up with the more nationalist ones in calling for caution from the government. 'A note of caution is still in order,' an editorial in the Jakarta Post said. 'Extra care is needed because the government should see to it that the entry of foreign ventures will not harm the public interest.' Phrases such as 'national interest' and 'public interest' have been used repeatedly in discussing the deregulation package, although few editorials have ventured to define them. Only Kompas tried to be more precise by commenting that 'the government must remain in control of the economy so that economic activities are truly aimed at bringing about prosperity for the people as a whole.' Although the government has become more tolerant of criticism over the last year, perusing Indonesian newspapers is often an exercise in reading between the lines. Kompas' comment on government control of the economy may have been made with reference to foreign ownership of businesses but it is also a reflection of growing concern throughout the country that gradual deregulation of the economy over the past 25 years has done little to improve the distribution of wealth.</p>

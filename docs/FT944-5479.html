			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: The right sort of weather for Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Good summer weather gave a fourth-quarter fillip to Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries and helped it lift pre-tax profits for the year by 5 per cent from Pounds 36.5m to Pounds 38.3m. Volumes rose 2.3 per cent in the quarter, leaving volumes for the year down 0.5 per cent in a Midlands market off about 5 per cent. The group's lager volumes grew well, indicating that it suffered a fall in ale, but it declined to give a breakdown. The latest trading period ended October 2 covered 52 weeks, against 53 weeks a year earlier. Adjusted profits were up 8 per cent. Turnover was up 3.6 per cent (or an adjusted 5.6 per cent) to Pounds 231m (Pounds 224m). The results were also helped by lower production costs, a higher contribution from Camerons, the north-east brewery it acquired in 1992, and improved performance from restaurants and hotels. Food sales across the group rose by 23 per cent. Beer benefited from the group's first sales in draught cans and new products such as Zamek, an imported Czech lager. Sales through supermarkets and the free trade were also ahead. 'We have plenty of scope for growth in our own areas,' said Mr David Thompson, managing director. Trading in the first two months of this year were good in comparison with a weaker period a year earlier, but it was too early to extrapolate for the year, he added. Pre-tax profits included Pounds 608,000 in property profits against Pounds 1.02m last time as the group continued to sell poorer properties and add new ones. A final dividend of 8.8p is proposed for a total of 13.9p, up 10.3 per cent. Earnings per share were 39p (38.6p) after property profits and 38.5p (37.2p) before. COMMENT A new mood of optimism from management, particularly about consumers' intentions, prompted analysts to nudge up their forecasts for this year. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 41m for earnings of 41.5p puts the shares on a pros-pective multiple of 12.5. This is a fraction behind a couple of other regional brewers such as Greene King. The shares are fully valued but offer steady growth to long-term holders. Do not expect fizz. The manage-ment, one of the most consistent and competent among the regionals, believes in working existing assets harder rather buying new businesses.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: Housing associations see threat to their future from government plans to make cuts in grant rates Sir, Your editorial, 'Housing policy' (February 5) was most welcome. The government's success in expanding housing associations' development capacity to meet the UK's acute housing needs by combining public grant and private sector loans has been an important breakthrough. Making the grant go further is one success story in the dismal 1980s housing record of the Conservative government. Housing associations now read the Financial Times to make sure they understand the context in which they arrange private sector lending. The mission remains the same -  to house those in greatest need -  but the way it is carried out has changed. You rightly point out that this success story is in danger of being destroyed by the potential cuts in the grant rates available to associations. We shall be caught in the same poverty trap our new tenants are increasingly in. Higher rents equal more housing benefit dependence for not just our tenants but also associations themselves. Lenders will not fail to notice this. Housing associations have illustrated their ability to respond to the 1988 Housing Act's new pressures on them. All associations, not just the smaller or specialist ones, must be concerned about their ability to deliver new rented homes at affordable rents if those cuts grant rates are carried through. The House of Commons select committee on the environment's forthcoming examination of the housing association funding system provides an opportunity for these issues to be addressed. Let us hope it will. Sacrificing the affordability, or indeed quality, of the homes we provide to ensure quantity is not a route which my own association would wish to embark on.

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> The black rap group Public Enemy has disbanded after anti-Semitic statements by  one of its entourage provoked accusations of racism. In a recent interview with  the Washington Times, the band's "Minister of Information" who calls himself  Professor Griff declared that Jews were responsible for "the majority of  wickedness that goes on across the globe," that Jews "have a grip on America"  and had "a history of killing black men." The group fired Griff last week and  subsequently apologized. But late Tuesday, Russell Simmons, president of Def  Jam, the group's record label, said in a statement that "Public Enemy is  disbanding for an indefinite period of time. We fully denounce any and all  anti-Semitic statements by Professor Griff." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the influential Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said, "overall, the budget  plan attaches importance to the need to stimulate the economy  and improve social infrastructure."    Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, said the budget is well balanced. "Although austere  in general, it allows for more than 4.0 percent growth in  expenses for public works projects," he said.    Inaba said, however, that the outlay for public works should  have been weighted toward projects that improve citizens'  livelihood.    "The administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  should have exercized more political leadership if it wanted to  achieve the reforms it has pledged," he said.    Inaba called for early implementation of the budget, and  said  the government should also be prepared to respond to any  volatile movement of the yen on foreign exchange markets or a  slide in stock prices.    Hiraiwa also stressed that it is important for the  government  to introduce appropriate measures in a timely fashion.    He expressed concern that the sharp appreciation of the yen  against the U.S. dollar in recent days may weaken the intended  effects of the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and  the budget for fiscal 1994.</p>

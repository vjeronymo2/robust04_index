			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: David Packard leaves HP chair MR David Packard, who co-founded Hewlett-Packard in 1939, yesterday announced his retirement as chairman of the electronics group at the age of 81, writes Martin Dickson. He will be succeeded by Mr Lewis Platt, the 52-year-old president and chief executive, who will retain his existing titles. Mr Packard will become a director emeritus of the company, as is his co-founder, Mr William Hewlett. The two, pioneers in the early life of the US electronics industry, built HP into what is now the 24th largest industrial company in the US. Mr Platt, a 26-year veteran at HP, replaced Mr John Young as chief executive in July last year.</p>

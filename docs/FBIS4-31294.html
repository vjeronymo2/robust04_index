			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan by </F> correspondent Zuzana Stukovska; date and place not  given--recorded]    [Text] [Stukovska] To attain a political compromise,  European Union [EU] experts have recommended to Slovakia an  increase in the average inflow into the old Danube River bed at  the Gabcikovo Dam to 800 cubic meters a second. Is this  proposal acceptable to the Slovak Government?    [Kukan] The EU commission's recommendation to increase the  inflow in the old Danube River bed to 800 cubic meters a second  is a proposal for a political solution that is not acceptable to  the Slovak Government. We think there are a sufficient number  of other technical measures to attain the aim put forward by  Hungary; we are also interested in achieving an agreement on  this. We are presenting these technical proposals and would  like to discuss them.    We would like to explain to the EU that our approach to this  issue is serious. However, its expert group's recommendation--it  gave us a number of proposals and all were acceptable to us  except this one, which seems to us to be a political  solution--we reject, and we reject any political pressure to  have it accepted.    [Stukovska] Obviously there will be talks with Hungary. At  which level should they be conducted?    [Kukan] We are interested in continuing the talks on  temporary water management with Hungary. You, however, know the  current situation in Hungary: A new government is being  constituted, a new parliament has been elected. We have certain  positive signs that the Hungarian position might be changing. I  am a realist and will wait and see what happens. We are having  continuous diplomatic correspondence with the Hungarian Foreign  Ministry. To answer your question, These talks will be  technical talks between experts dealing with the issues linked  to temporary water management.    [Stukovska] Can you tell us, at least approximately, when  they might be held?    [Kukan] It depends on when a new government is formed in  Hungary.</p>

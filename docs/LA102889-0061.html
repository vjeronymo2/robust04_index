			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> PRESSURE IS ON 'WITNESS' FROM KILLERS AND THE LAW  </P> <P> The Manhattan meat market district is an apt metaphor for the decent working  stiff who becomes hamburger patty for hungry U.S. Feds in tonight's "Perfect  Witness" (HBO, 8 p.m.).  </P> <P> In this case, the quintessential little guy (blue-collar Aidan Quinn) witnesses  a contract killing in a bar (a brutal but effective scene featuring a grinning  hit man played by David Cumming). Unlike the other patrons, our reluctant hero  does the right thing and identifies the killer.  </P> <P> But when Quinn's family is threatened, that's it for public duty. He changes  his mind and refuses to cooperate with a federal grand jury investigating  extortion in the butcher business. And the outraged, media-conscious U.S.  attorney (a blustery, solid performance by Brian Dennehy) throws him in the  slammer for contempt. His fellow attorney (a blond Stockard Channing, who looks  uncomfortable in the role) objects to no avail.  </P> <P> The story is allegedly based on a newspaper series in Gotham about perfect  eyewitnesses who pay dearly for their noble deeds. The moral is disheartening:  Keep your mouth shut.  </P> <P> The writers, Terry Curtis Fox and Ron Hutchinson, strive to play both ends of  the moral dilemma with a courtroom conclusion that mixes individual valor with  legal deception and cynicism. The government comes off little better than the  mob.  </P> <P> At one point, Dennehy's federal attorney protests that "government is force!  It's not reason. It's not laws. It's force -- George Washington said that."  Imagine hearing those lines in a movie during the old blacklist days. The  writers' careers would be over.  </P> <P> Robert Mandel's direction doesn't always clearly negotiate the plot  convolutions. This 2-hour movie would race better with 30 minutes lopped off.  But the point about pressure on the hero to overlook corruption because, as the  killer's father tells the perfect eyewitness, "it's neighborhood," is tellingly  made. RAY LOYND  </P></p>

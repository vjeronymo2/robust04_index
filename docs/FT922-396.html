			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Chaos for Eurotunnel shareholders Double vision: Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's chief executive, made use of a video screen when briefing shareholders yesterday on the progress of the Channel link project, Andrew Taylor writes. Earlier there was chaos, angry scenes and standing room only as an army of shareholders trekked to Folkestone, Kent. About 900 had registered to attend the briefing before visiting the tunnel construction site. In the event, 1,500 people turned up, causing frayed tempers at London's Charing Cross station, where trains had been booked to take shareholders to Folkestone. Mr Derek Foster, a 52-year-old retired local-government officer from York, said: 'If this is how they organised transporting shareholders to the tunnel then God help us when it opens to the general public.' Eurotunnel apologised for any inconvenience but said people had been asked to register by telephone before attending. 'Many people either did not notice or ignored this request.' The meeting, however, was good-humoured. British shareholders in the main have been loyal and criticism of Eurotunnel management was sparse in spite of the recent slide in the share price. Mr Matthew Kemp, a systems programmer for Commercial Union from Surrey, said: 'Obviously I would prefer the share prices to be higher but I am pleased with the progress that construction is making and I am sure it will be a success in the long term.'</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Rugby up 17% but sentiment clouded by trading warning UK cement sales rose by 8 per cent in the first six months of this year, according to Rugby Group which yesterday announced a 17 per cent rise in first-half profits to Pounds 35.6m, against Pounds 30.5m. The building materials group, which now generates higher worldwide sales and profits from joinery than cement, increased its interim dividend from 1.425p to 1.5p. Its share price fell 5p to 139p, however, on warnings from Mr Peter Carr, managing director, that trading conditions in the UK joinery business were becoming increasingly competitive. UK cement profits rose by 11.4 per cent to Pounds 9.8m with turnover increased by 11 per cent to Pounds 64.5m. Cement sales were helped by increased housebuilding, a rise in infrastructure construction, and greater industrial building. UK joinery sales increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 75.1m while operating profits rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 8.6m. This reflected sharp rises in raw material timber prices, which have risen by some 13 per cent during the past 12 months. Mr Carr warned that profits could come under pressure if UK manufacturers continued to battle to increase market share. UK metals profits increased by 55 per cent to Pounds 3.1m, on a sales increase of just 16 per cent to Pounds 67m. UK profits over the three divisions rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 21.5m. Overseas profits increased by 21 per cent to Pounds 14.5m. Australian cement and lime profits, which rose 25 per cent to Pounds 7.4m, would have been almost flat but for Pounds 1.2m raised from land sales. US joinery profits fell by a third to Pounds 1m due mainly to poor weather while European joinery profits increased to Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 2.6m) helped by new acquisitions. COMMENT The cloud hanging over Rugby's share price yesterday was the prospect of further skirmishing between UK joinery manufacturers just as their raw material costs have soared. The pace of recovery in UK cement demand is also likely to slacken next year. The acquisition of Bunzl's US distribution business is rightly well regarded, but prospects elsewhere look a little dull compared with others in the sector. Annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 80m followed by Pounds 95m next time would put the group on a prospective p/e of 14 on 1995 earnings, which is dear enough.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev received today  Kyrgyzstan's Prime Minister Apas Dzhumagulov, who is on a  working visit in Kazakhstan. Government delegations of  Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, led by Prime Ministers Tereshchenko  and Dzumagulov had a meeting later. They discussed implementing  the agreement on trade and economic cooperation between the two  countries. They also discussed the issue of paying our  republic's debt of $55 million to the neighboring state for  power supplies. The meeting discussed prospects for cooperation  in the joint construction of the Kumbartinskiy GES and the  possibility of power supplies to the southern parts of  Kazakhstan, the volume of this year's supplies of Kazakhstan's  chemical compounds with a trace of uranium to the Karabaltinskiy  ore mining combine. The initiative for a joint  Kazakhstan-Kyrgyzstan venture for processing and refining raw  materials containing uranium was supported. It was decided that  profits from selling uranium protoxide and oxide will be split  in the following way: Kazakhstan's works will get 71 percent and  Kyrgyzstan's 29 percent.    An intergovernmental protocol on the implementation of  agreements on trade and economic cooperation between the two  republics for 1994 and an agreement on supplying Kyrgyzstan with  raw materials containing uranium starting from this year up to  the year 2,000 were signed. Tereshchenko and Dzhumagulov told  journalists that the working visit has given a new impetus to  trade and economic cooperation between the two countries.</p>

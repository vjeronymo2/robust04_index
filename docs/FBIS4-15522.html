			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 9/4/1994 -- "We made a big  mistake to believe in the summer of 1992 that the new 14th  [Russian] Army commander [General Aleksandr Lebed] is a man who  realizes the situation in the Republic," stated to magazine  KOMMERSANT MOLDOVIY (BUSINESSMAN OF MOLDOVA) Vadim Shevtsov,  chairman of the Dniester Republic's Security Committee.  According to Shevtsov, Lebed is carrying out a task assigned to  him by certain Russian political groups. He mentioned that  Lebed did not stop the military conflict, but rather kept the  14th Army in barracks in a moment when he was most likely to  take the Dniester side. "At first we had good relations with  Lebed," stated Shevtsov, "but I gave them up when he proposed to  me to take part in the dismissal of the [Dniester] government."  He did not consider the Lebed-Bergman opposition to be a  serious threat, but he called it destructive. In connection  with the 14th Army's withdrawal Shevtsov said that if it takes  place then "merely the army's general staff will leave the  Dniester region taking its flag." Shevtsov also stated that  after the PDAM [Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova -- ruling  party] won the elections "the reunification of the [Dniester  River] right and left banks" is likely to occur. "The  proclamation of our Republic was not a goal in itself, but  rather a strong need. In case it loses its actuality there will  be no longer need for it. Life itself will make us be  together." Moldova should provide strong guarantees established  by the Constitution, said Shevtsov.</p>

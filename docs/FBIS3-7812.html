Our  correspondent David Stahlavsky reports:    [Stahlavsky] The Polish guest regards the visit as a further  step in the process of strengthening goodneighborly relations  between our two countries. Jozef Oleksy visited Bratislava last  week.    The agenda of his talks with the prime minister, the foreign  minister, and President Vaclav Havel later in the afternoon  included European issues and other issues important for both  Poland and the Czech Republic.    At a joint news conference, the speaker of the Polish Sejm  described his talks with Klaus as businesslike and interesting.  They were talks that brought a pragmatic contribution to  relations between Poland and the Czech Republic. He focused, in  particular, on reforms in both states. Welcoming the outcome of  the talks, Oleksy said:    [Begin Oleksy recording, in Polish with superimposed Czech  translation] The prime minister's statement that relations with  Poland are an absolute priority for the Czech Republic was of  enormous importance for me. I fully share the prime minister's  view that Western Europe has much to learn from our two  countries. We said that Europe needed a broad and fresh  dialogue and that no institutions could substitute for this  dialogue. [end recording]    Speaking about the visit of the Polish Sejm speaker, Klaus  said the following:    [Begin Klaus recording] I would like to say, in fact, that I  am very glad that this visit is taking place because we need to  overcome certain misunderstandings that exist with regard to  Czech-Polish relations. For me, personally, it is not just a  phrase to say that relations between the Czech Republic and  Poland take a high priority in our policy. I am convinced that  they must be perpetuated not only on government and parliament  levels but on all other levels. [end recording]    [Stahlavsky] Klaus and Oleksy discussed the strengthening of  economic relations, the increase of mutual investments, and the  use of Polish debt to the former Czechoslovakia. After the  division of the federation, the Czech Republic share of claims  is $68 million. Klaus rejected the initial proposal that this  balance should be offset by deliveries of Polish coal because  the Czech Republic has a surplus of coal.    The speaker of the Polish Sejm recalled the current concept  according to which the debt should be used to improve the  infrastructure along the common border and on ecology-related  projects.</p>

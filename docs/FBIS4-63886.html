			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report by V. Tarasov, A. </F> Vozhzhov, and A. Lebedev, identified by caption]    [Text] [Tarasov] Four days of work out on the high seas  have seen the ships of the Black Sea Fleet running through  various combat training exercises to fend off underwater,  surface, and air attacks from any likely adversary. The  exercises were led by Vice Admiral Vitaliy Laryenov, first  deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet. In his judgment, the  sailors coped well with the tasks set. But in general the  results of the exercises would have been far better but for the  regular disruption of drills and combat training due to  shortages of financial and material resources. It is indicative  that these latest exercise, completed without any hiccups,  involved inducted personnel. As we know, nowadays warship crews  are made up equally of citizens drafted both from Russia and  Ukraine. Nevertheless, according to the sailors themselves, the  long promised carve-up of the Black Sea Fleet is inevitable. So  what is required now is the most vigorous action on the part of  top Ukrainian and Russian officials.</p>

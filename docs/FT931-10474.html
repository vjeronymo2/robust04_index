			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Zurich offshoot in new stop-loss scheme THE PARTICIPATION of Centre Re, the financial reinsurance subsidiary of Zurich Insurance, in a new stop-loss insurance scheme could herald the broader participation of international reinsurers in the market, according to Mr John Harrison, a specialist stop loss insurance broker with SBJ Harrison Stuart, a subsidiary of Steel Burrill Jones. SBJ announced on Friday that Centre Re and a group of Lloyd's underwriters would support a stop-loss arrangement for 1993 covering some 3,000 of Lloyd's 19,700 Names. Centre Re will provide 80 per cent of the reinsurance cover. The deal has helped to shore up the stop-loss market at Lloyd's, which has been badly hit by heavy losses in recent years. One of the founders of the stop loss market, Mr Michael Wade, recently left brokers Holman Wade after a dispute with the company's owners, Horace Clarkson, about the cost of servicing old claims. Under the SBJ scheme Names, the individuals whose assets support Lloyd's, would pay about 1 per cent of their stamp capacity (the amount of premium they are allowed to underwrite) to buy stop loss policies which would cover all losses above 25 per cent and up to 80 per cent of their stamp over a four year period. Premiums - which would typically average about Pounds 4,200 a year - are paid into a new mutual club, known as Integer, which will then reinsure with the Bermuda-based Centre Re. Names' losses above an amount equal to 80 per cent of capacity (again over a four year period) are paid from a special Lloyd's fund, following reforms that were introduced last year. Mr Harrison said that under the 'primary aggregate reinsurance policy' reinsurers would pay 100 per cent of all claims suffered by Integer up to an amount equal to 15 per cent of the total exposure of Integer's Names. Any claims above this amount would be met by Integer, with the proportions paid of each claim depending on funds available. Integer would pay three quarters of its net premium income (after 5 per cent management fees and 5 per cent brokerage commission) to Centre Re, an amount which Mr Harrison expects to equal Pounds 10m in 1993.</p>

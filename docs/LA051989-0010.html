			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AMERICANS WORKING IN PANAMA TESTIFY TO NORIEGA HARASSMENT  </P> <P> American and Panamanian citizens have been beaten, threatened and held captive  by Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega's government forces, witnesses told a  House Foreign Affairs subcommittee Thursday.  </P> <P> A parade of witnesses told of a mounting campaign of harassment against  American employees of the Panama Canal Commission as political conditions in  Panama have worsened.  </P> <P> Chairman Roy Dyson of the subcommittee on the Panama Canal noted that Noriega  has become more abusive toward commission employees since the United States  imposed sanctions on Panama last year after Noriega was indicted in Florida for  drug trafficking.  </P> <P> Karl Marohl, president of the international union of operating engineers, told  the subcommittee that he was held for 14 hours in March and kicked and beaten  repeatedly.  </P> <P> Marohl said that while more U.S. troops have been sent to Panama, this did not  offer much reassurance to commission employees since the soldiers remain in  barracks.  </P> <P> Panamanian forces have police jurisdiction in U.S. housing areas, and the  committee was told that they harass commission employees going to work, school  or shopping by stopping their cars.  </P></p>

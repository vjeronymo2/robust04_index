			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE HITS ROCK BOTTOM IN 75-69 LOSS  </P> <P> Coach Bill Mulligan stood, hands on hips, in front of the UC Irvine bench  trying to make sense of what was happening on the Bren Center court Thursday  night.  </P> <P> Ten minutes after watching San Jose State pull away for its first Big West  Conference victory in 18 games, Mulligan still couldn't believe it.  </P> <P> Irvine hit rock bottom with a 75-69 loss to San Jose before 2,017.  </P> <P> Indeed, this was a new low in a season chock full of lows.  </P> <P> "Right now we're the weakest team in the league, no question about it,"  Mulligan said. "We gotta make some adjustments. It's the same old story."  </P> <P> It was an ugly story again Thursday.  </P> <P> The Anteaters shot a season-low 36.9% from the field, 53.8% from the free-throw  line and had 20 turnovers, which figured prominently in their fourth  consecutive loss.  </P> <P> Irvine fell to 2-9 overall, 0-2 in the Big West. San Jose is 4-7, 1-1.  </P> <P> "My stomach is going crazy," Mulligan said. "I know I look real cool. I don't  understand the shooting. We free-lanced a little too much."  </P> <P> San Jose didn't exactly bring the sport to new heights either.  </P> <P> The Spartans shot 46% from the field and blew an eight-point lead late in the  game before getting the victory.  </P> <P> "That was beautiful," San Jose Coach Stan Morrison said, tongue planted firmly  in cheek. "That was one of the most artistic things I've ever seen."  </P> <P> Then, taking a more serious tone, he added, "I'm glad we won. The kids deserve  to have something to keep their heads up."  </P> <P> Andre Brooks had a game-high 22 points to lead Morrison's rebuilding project.  </P> <P> Morrison, who coached USC from 1980-86, had to start from scratch when he took  the San Jose job last April. A player boycott midway through last season to  protest then-coach Bill Berry had left the Spartans' ranks depleted.  </P> <P> He had just three players left from last season's 5-23 team and had to bring in  15 newcomers.  </P> <P> Brooks, one of the new faces, had 11 of his 22 in the first seven minutes of  the second half to push San Jose into the lead, 48-44.  </P> <P> The lead had changed hands until then. Irvine led, 34-33, at halftime, only the  third time this season they had the lead after 20 minutes.  </P> <P> Irvine made one late run at San Jose, erasing an eight-point lead but couldn't  pull ahead after tying the score, 59-59, with 4:17 left.  </P> <P> The Anteaters suddenly went cold, failing to score for the next 3:09. Craig  Marshall's free throw finally broke the streak, but Irvine trailed, 67-60.  </P> <P> San Jose guard Tom Desiano kept Irvine behind by making six free throws in the  final 1:05. Desiano, who played at Mission Viejo High School, had 12 points and  seven assists.  </P> <P> Center Ricky Butler led Irvine with 17 points. Forwards Justin Anderson and  Jeff Herdman each had 12.  </P> <P> "I think we're headed for the cellar this year," Butler said. "Everyone's  looking at us as a win."  </P> <P> It's not difficult to see why.  </P> <P> The Anteaters shot less than 40% for the third consecutive game, were three  above their turnover average and generally made a mess of things when they had  a chance to overtake San Jose late.  </P> <P> Dwain Daniels made two free throws to give San Jose the lead, 61-59. Desiano  added two more, then swiped the ball from Herdman and drove in for a layup and  a 65-59 lead with 2:31 left.  </P> <P> Troy Batiste added two more free throws with 1:23 left and the Spartans held a  secure, 67-59, lead.  </P> <P> "I don't know what it is," Butler said. "We can't put it in the hole. It's  like, 'Wow, we're down again.' We play good for a while, then play bad and the  guys get down."  </P> <P> So now Irvine travels to Fresno State on Sunday, where the Anteaters ended an 0  for 12 losing streak at Selland Arena with an 82-79 victory last season.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, we'll get a win on the road," Butler said. "It's not going to be  too good at Fresno."  </P> <P> Indeed, the schedule only gets more difficult for Irvine.  </P> <P> "Don't you think I know that," Mulligan said softly when reminded. "I know  that."  </P> <P> Anteater Notes  </P> <P> How big of a victory was it for San Jose State? Not only did it break a 17-game  conference losing streak, it also broke a two-year conference losing streak.  The victory also was the first for the Spartans at Irvine since a 73-59 victory  over the Anteaters in Crawford Hall in 1983. . . . Irvine's woes continue at  home. The loss was the Anteaters' 10th in the past 12 games dating back to last  season.  </P></p>

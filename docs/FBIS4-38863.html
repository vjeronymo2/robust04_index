			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Khlopkin, director of a Kurchatov </F> Institute department, by Mikhail Rebrov; place and date not  given: "Nuclear-Powered Ships Are Sending Out an SOS, But There  Will Continue To Be a Nuclear-Powered Fleet"]    [Text] From KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Files    Nikolay Sidorovich Khlopkin. Born in 1923. Served during  the Great Patriotic War, wrote his name on the Reichstag, and  was badly wounded. Has devoted his working life to  nuclear-powered ships. Has been at the Kurchatov Institute since  1949, starting as a laboratory assistant with diploma and now  director of a department. He is a professor, an academician,  Hero of Socialist Labor, and winner of Lenin and State Prizes.  His colleagues say: "From day one through today in  nuclear-powered ships -- surface and submarine, civilian and  military." He himself says: "It is interesting work, a long  and difficult quest whose purpose is to arrive at reliable  simplicity having mastered the incomparably complex."    [Rebrov] Nikolay Sidorovich, the first nuclear-powered  submarine went on alert status three and a half decades ago, and  a year later the first nuclear-powered icebreaker was put into  service. Nowadays the attitude to these events is contradictory  and sometimes even negative....    [Khlopkin] Our time is full of contradictions generally.  Anything and everything is criticized without sufficient  argumentation. It would be naive to claim that nuclear energy  does not have its dark aspects. But how can the tasks facing  the Navy be resolved without it? Only nuclear-powered  submarines are able resolve the tasks facing them without  surfacing during an entire autonomous patrol. Without  nuclear-powered ships, how can the northern sea route be turned  into a permanently operating highway?    The logical development of naval nuclear power engineering  depends to a considerable extent on the country's financial  resources, which must be used intelligently.    [Rebrov] Sadly we have still not learned how to count money.  Or more precisely how to weigh up the options in order to see a  realistic prospect. But to go back to submarines: What was  done during those years?    [Khlopkin] Many things. Although even for the first craft  it was possible to develop a totally unorthodox construction --  I mean the scaled-down large unit. This was done under the  guidance of Academician A.P. Aleksandrov. Many solutions found  here proved extremely successful and were utilized in subsequent  projects....    Thanks to the powerful compact units, as a rule our craft  now  have higher speeds than foreign equivalents, although inferior  to them in terms of undetectability. As early as 1970 we had  nuclear-powered ships with an underwater speed of over 40 knots.  A further reduction in the noise generated by warships is  expected, which will ensure that their actions are undetected.  Comprehensive acoustic design will become an essential integral  part during the development of new submarines, whereby design  decisions are aimed at reducing acoustic emissions as much as  possible. In other words, a submarine must be a kind of  acoustic "black hole" in the sea which cannot be detected by any  means.    I am giving only my personal opinion. Quiet craft with  powerful fourth-generation units have been developed. Concepts  for fifth-generation units are being developed....    This is no easy task. There are prospects of replacing the  propeller with a water jet and switching to full electric  propulsion, similar to that used in diesel submarines. It is  worth mentioning another type of electric propulsion -- without  a propeller or water jet. The ship's motile thrust is created  by passing a current through sea water in strong magnetic  fields. Such an engine needs superconductor cables, ultrahigh  magnetic fields....    [Rebrov] Nikolay Sidorovich, what main directions can now be  seen for science here?    [Khlopkin] There are several such directions. Safety in  naval power engineering is out in front. Increasing the  reliability of units and auto-protection of their reactors by  creating negative feedback in the core, eliminating coolant  losses, creating additional barriers to prevent the emission of  radioactivity.... This are only some of the measures aimed at  eliminating both accidents themselves and their effects.    Safety at sea has its own specific characteristics. Because  a reactor on a ship is not only a source of danger but also a  means of saving the ship in an emergency.    After that comes the search for new fields in which to use  and improve nuclear power. There is a multitude of interesting  prospects here. To some people they might seem unrealistic.  But in the late forties a nuclear-powered submarine was  considered a fantastic idea.    We should make special mention of the controls. Anatoliy  Petrovich Aleksandrov demanded that it be as simple as a car's  -- you step on the gas, take your foot off the gas.... And such  a reactor was constructed. If the flow of feed water is  increased the reactor's capacity increases, if it is reduced the  capacity falls. This is without any adjustment to the absorbers  which govern reactivity.    [Rebrov] You have mentioned technical measures. But there  is also the human factor....    [Khlopkin] Yes, and it is of very great importance. Here I  am referring not only to errors by the operator at the control  panel in a stressful situation. The question is broader. The  entire system of controlling safety is being examined in order  to eliminate the possibility of making incorrect decisions at  the planning stage and to prevent a low quality of equipment  production and unsatisfactory operation. This is a very complex  problem, but it is soluble.    Questions which need to be solved by the scientists include  ecological questions. Not only in the operating process but  also when reactors are taken out of operation.... The strictest  control is important here. We have developed highly sensitive  equipment to research sea water radioactivity. It was used to  inspect the sunken Komsomolets submarine. This is the result:  The discharge is less than 0.1 curie per year. A few meters  away from the boat's hull the level is so low that it is  undetectable.    [Rebrov] The nuclear-powered ships are sending out an SOS,  equipment is getting old, appropriations are being reduced,  shipyards are idle. The same thing is heard all over:  conversion, conversion.... But words and deeds do not always  coincide. How do matters stand as far as you are concerned?    [Khlopkin] There is much that is contradictory here. Not in  the idea itself -- it is indisputable. Conversion is not only a  consequence of disarmament but also something that stimulates  it. There is a multitude of questions here: scales, deadlines,  state support, the consistency and considered nature of  programs.... Conversion.... Back then we did not even know such  a word, but we started to get involved in it around 40 years  ago. Nine civilian nuclear-powered ships have been built, a  tenth has been launched. Incidentally, if we are talking about  sensible approaches, it makes sense to replace today's diesel  icebreakers with nuclear-powered ships as they exhaust their  service life,. This will be cheaper for Russia. For a number  of reasons shipyards are empty, but apparently if they are  filled with orders we give these orders for icebreakers to  foreign firms. I can illustrate the correlation of prices with  this example: The Taymyr, with a single-reactor unit, was  constructed jointly with Finland at a cost of 140 million  dollars. The Sibir, with a more powerful two-reactor unit, was  constructed here at a cost of 120 million -- rubles!    Another example is floating AES's [nuclear electric power  stations] to supply heat and electricity to northern coastal  cities and mineral mines. In this case the extent to which the  construction site has to be developed is far less, and the area  of confiscated land is less. These AES's can be relocated at  any time....    We have developed unique small power units which are  without equal in the world. They have no moving parts, and the  current is generated without turbines -- by a thermoelectric  generator which works off the nuclear reactor. Self-regulating  thermoelectric stations with minimal maintenance have been  designed to supply electricity to small settlements and military  compounds. A heat capacity of up to 5 megawatts and an electric  capacity of up to 150 kilowatts can be delivered, and the  service life is up to 25 years.    Another example. The "Rosshelf" joint-stock company has been  set up. It proposes to use defense sectors' potential to carry  out oil and gas extraction on the continental shelf. The  initial development of workings in areas with icy conditions,  where vast reserves of hydrocarbons have already been  discovered, could be carried out with the aid of nuclear-powered  icebreakers. They will provide the workings with electricity  and protect them from ice. Surveying deposits, mapping the  bottom, and choosing pipe-laying routes can be done by  submarines.    Nuclear units are successfully solving the problem of  desalinating water, their use in space is extremely promising,  and they are being eagerly bought abroad. In short, the  peaceful atom is not just a phrase but a fact.    [Rebrov] Currently the following question is being heard  increasingly frequently: Is it necessary, when disarmament is  in progress, to improve warships and their power units? Because  the country is becoming poor....    [Khlopkin] Yes, a considerable reduction in the Navy is now  under way. Orders for new nuclear-powered ships are being  sharply reduced. Some of them, unfinished, are being turned  into scrap metal. This is happening not only in Russia but in  other countries too. But let us once again proceed from  realities: War, as the last means of resolving conflict  situations, has not been excluded from consideration by a single  state. Russia is a maritime power, and its Navy is 300 hundred  years old this year. It was Russia's glory, guaranteeing its  security, and it must remain so now. It is another matter that  a sea power's naval might is determined not so much by the  number of ships as by their combat qualities. Admiral Makarov's  motto "Remember the War" still holds well.    [Rebrov] A last question, Nikolay Sidorovich. You were at  the front. What was the most memorable thing in those years?    [Khlopkin] The war itself. With its horrors, its losses,  and blighted fates, but also the joy of victory.... The war  ruthlessly displaced customary concepts, turning people's lives  into another dimension, sometimes inconceivable in its tragedy.  The last terrible battle was 1 May 1945, when our division was  holding back the avalanche of German divisions going into Berlin  from the east. We hung on.... Then there was the meeting with  the Americans, but that was over the Elbe.... I took off my  greatcoat with a captain's shoulder boards in 1945; since when I  have been a civilian and have been greatly involved in civil  matters. But Russia's military interests are dear to me, which  is why I say: There will continue to be a nuclear-powered fleet!  At the moment there is simply no alternative to nuclear power  for the ocean submarine fleet.</p>

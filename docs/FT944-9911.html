			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Delors plan for public agencies to oversee projects The European Commission is drawing up proposals for public agencies to co-ordinate trans-European networks, the multi-billion-dollar rail, road and telecommunications projects expected to span Europe in the 21st century. The proposals signal a new approach to meeting the challenge of funding, building and regulating cross-border infrastructure projects. But they may prove controversial among sovereignty-conscious member states, especially if the planned agencies are given borrowing powers. Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission, intends to present the proposals at the European summit in Essen next month. His goal is to revitalise private-sector interest in the networks. Mr Delors has already calculated that the total cost of the projects would be Ecu400bn (Pounds 311bn), much of it drawn from national budgets. Of that, Ecu220bn would be for transport projects, Ecu150bn for telecoms, and Ecu30bn for energy. The idea of creating Euro-agencies to co-ordinate the financing, operation and regulation of the networks is based on the conclusions of a report from a task force of top officials from EU member states. Possible models include the New York Port Authority, which is responsible for the operation and regulation of all bridges, tunnels and airports in the New York-New Jersey area, including JFK airport. Their regulatory powers could be modelled on the UK agencies which supervise the privatised utilities. The draft report blames network delays on technical and administrative hurdles rather than lack of capital. Obstacles include incompatible national standards, a lack of co-operation among member states, and a reluctance in some quarters to abandon national monopolies. Other officials said the immediate issue was lack of co-ordination on 11 priority projects approved in principle by heads of government at the European summit in Corfu last June. They include the planned high-speed train between Paris-Brussels-Cologne-Amsterdam-London which risks being delayed because Belgian railways is short of finance. In another example, France is moving fast on the Paris-Strasbourg link in the High Speed Train East, instead of the southern link favoured by Spain. Mr Henning Christophersen, the Danish economics commissioner who chaired the trans-European networks task force, believes that new partnerships between the public and private sector would help to overcome those obstacles. He is seeking a more predictable trans-European regulatory framework in order to minimise risk. EU fraud inquiry, Page 18</p>

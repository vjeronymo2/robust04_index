			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah: "Yemeni `Military' </F> Establishment Moves Its Office From Moscow to Warsaw"]    [Excerpts] London -- Colonel Muhammad al-Shahari,  representative of the Yemeni Economic Establishment in East  Europe, is preparing to open a new office in the Polish capital,  Warsaw, within days, to continue his task of concluding and  implementing the deals relating to arms purchased by the Yemeni  leadership in Sanaa. That is, in the context of deploying and  arming its military forces in anticipation of any military  action between the northern General People's Congress forces and  the southern forces belonging to the Socialist Party, as a  result of the current crisis threatening Yemen's unity.    This development in the Yemeni Economic Establishment comes  after the decision to change its name, removing the word  "military," and after the closure of its office in Moscow as a  result of the state of political openness which Russia is  currently witnessing and in the light of the Russian military  attache's participation in the proceedings of the joint military  committee and his direct acquaintance with the true conditions  there, as a result of which he regularly informs his government  of the details of what is happening. While Russia is working to  join the Western states' community and hence is forced to take  account of numerous considerations in its foreign policy,  prompting it to sacrifice some arms sales in states experiencing  a certain crisis, East European states where communism has  collapsed continue to look for markets, even for a "few dollars"  to solve their economic problems, even if it is at others'  expense. The Economic "Military" Establishment's approach has  not been affected by the clamor provoked by the Polish press and  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's report about the arms deals concluded with  the two Polish companies Cenzin and Cenrex to supply the  northern armed forces with various types of weapons, after this  was revealed by Muhammad Sharaf, Yemeni charge d'affaires in  Warsaw, during his contacts with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim  Basindwah in Sanaa and later in a telephone conversation with  Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas in Aden -- because these  deals conflict with the stipulations of the "Pledge and Accord  Document," seeking to avoid military aggravation of the Yemeni  crisis.    The Polish arms trade with Yemen actually began on 18  November 1993, namely when Col. 'Abdallah al-Hadrami, director  general of the Economic (formerly Military) Establishment, paid  a 24-hour visit to Warsaw. The visit was a surprise to many  people. Al-Hadrami rejected the charge d'affaires' request to  attend his meeting with the chairman of Cenzin responsible for  war production, so as to prevent him from learning details of  what was going to be discussed, thus doing away with his efforts  as official representative of the united Republic of Yemen to  follow up any action concerning the country. It was decided  that contacts should be made directly with the Yemeni  establishment, namely through Col. Muhammad al-Shahari, director  of its Moscow office. [passage omitted]    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT cooperated with a number of Polish  journalists to uncover details of the deal and managed to obtain  copies of the letters sent by the companies Cenzin and Cenrex  and companies of the visa applications. Polish Economic  Cooperation Ministry and Foreign Ministry sources approved the  signing and implementation of the military deals, whose value  ranges between tens of millions and hundreds of millions of  dollars.

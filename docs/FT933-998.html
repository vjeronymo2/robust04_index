			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Sport: Sydney's strategy - Keith Wheatley was in Monaco to watch the intrigue behind the final Olympic vote / Olympics BEER bottles made impromptu batons as the victorious Sydney team conducted a roaring chorus of Advance Australia Fair, the national anthem. Elsewhere in Monte Carlo, the defeated licked their wounds. 'There is no bronze medal in this Olympic race,' said Walther Troeger, a German member of the International Olympic Committee and supporter of Berlin's campaign to host the 2000 Olympics. Whether the Beijing team, beaten at the final hurdle, were so phlegmatic is doubtful. 'This whole process was so unlike the Chinese. They were virtually begging to be given something they desperately wanted,' said one Hong Kong-based observer. 'One can't calculate how they will handle the loss of face.' Sino-British relations, already at a low ebb over the Hong Kong issue, will now be seen from a new perspective by China. With just three candidates left Manchester won 11 votes, Sydney 37 and Beijing 40, so Manchester was removed from the final ballot. Its supporters split 8-3 in favour of Sydney in the fourth and final vote to give Sydney a 45-43 victory. 'I think we gave the Australians more than just our votes,' said Bob Scott, the Manchester bid chairman. 'The emphasis and agenda of their bid followed very closely what we had learned and formulated during our campaign for the '96 Games.' Coincidentally, the two presentations to the IOC were consecutive and offered a highly traditional, athlete-centred view of the Games. The IOC's technical evaluation commission had already given Sydney's plans the highest-rating of the five cities. Beijing, in contrast, made no claims in its 55-minute presentation to offer the best Games for 2000. The 'pitch' was a simple proposition that the time had come to let the world's most populous nation emerge from the shadows of troubled modernisation and take centre stage. The speech of Zhenliang He, a vice-president of the IOC and much-respected within Olympism, was a masterly encapsulation of the Chinese proposition. 'My destiny is tightly entwined with my country. As a child and an adolescent I saw bitter times,' said He who is 64. 'As an older man, I have seen China's reform and open-door policy provide my country and myself with new horizons. 'We believe that the Olympic Games are for all nations, not just for those that are highly sophisticated. Awarding this honour to a developing nation like ours would not only expand the horizon of the Olympics, but also assist us in our development process.' There seemed to be a certain melancholy abroad that the dream of a simpler, more frugal Games had drifted further out of reach. China's strong support from the 16 African IOC members had this element - as well as straightforward gratitude for an intense sports aid programme that had brought massive stadia to Kenya and Zaire, for example. 'There is now so much technology necessary, so much investment, that although one cannot speak of China being Third World, there is an understanding,' said General Zein Gadir, the Sudanese IOC member. Certainly the IOC as an organisation is unashamedly delighted with the choice of Sydney. It provides a host city without political or economic risk and will stage a spectacular Games. Just as important from the IOC's perspective is that Sydney showed it possible to win the nomination with a scrupulously fair campaign. 'They played it 100 per cent straight from the outset. There was never the slightest complaint against them,' said IOC information director Andrew Napier. Beijing, in contrast, played hardball. Government-to-government pressure, relayed to the individual IOC member, was the most frequent manifestation. However, the IOC is thought to have warned the Beijing campaigners over the number of 'facility trips' to China that some members were offered. Under recent rules forbidding excessive generosity, each member is rationed to one free inspection trip. Already 70 per cent of the Sydney sports facilities are in place. Most of the catamaran ferries which will ply the harbour between the Homebush Park site of the Games and the city centre are in service. 'We said to the IOC this week that if, for any reason, Atlanta fell down we could probably be ready in '96,' said John Fahey, the premier of New South Wales.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 19 May (XINHUA) -- At the news conference  held at the International Club this afternoon, Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Wu Jianmin issued a statement in connection with  Taiwan's attempt to accept dual recognition by South Africa of  the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. He also answered reporters'  questions.    Wu Jianmin said: On 17 May, Qian Fu [Chien Fu] claimed in  Taiwan's Legislative Yuan that Taiwan was prepared to accept  South Africa's dual recognition of the two sides across the  Taiwan Strait. This is yet another plot of the Taiwan  authorities aimed at creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one  Taiwan" in disregard of the overall interests of the Chinese  nation.    He said: There is only one China in the world. The  government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal  government representing the whole of China. Taiwan is an  inalienable part of Chinese territory. This is a fact  universally recognized by the United Nations and the  international community at large. It is precisely on this basis  that China has established diplomatic relations with 158  countries in the world.    He pointed out: It is futile for the Taiwan authorities to  try to end Taiwan's isolation in the world by way of "dual  recognition." The only right choice is for them to go along with  historical tide by helping bring about national reunification at  an early date.    Wu Jianmin said: The Chinese Government appreciates the  position of South African President Mandela and the African  National Congress to pursue a one-China policy and their pledge  to [Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 1552 GMT on 19  May transmits a correction changing "their pledge to" to "will"]  address their relations with China in accordance with the  practice of the United Nations and other international  organizations. We believe that relations between China and the  new South Africa will develop in an all-round way on the basis  of the five principles of peaceful coexistence.    Following are Wu Jianmin's answers to reporters' questions:    A reporter asked: According to a report, the Organization  for Economic Cooperation and Development is ready to strengthen  its relations with China. What is China's attitude toward the  organization? Is China willing to join the organization?    The spokesman answered: We have taken note of the relevant  report. We are maintaining good cooperative relations with many  members of the organization, and we are also ready to join the  organization in exploring ways to expand cooperative relations.  We believe developing cooperative relations on the basis of  equality and mutual benefit is beneficial to both sides.    Question [Q]: King Sihanouk has once again proposed a round  table meeting in Pyongyang, and invited Chea Sim, Ranariddh, Hun  Sen, and Khieu Samphan to attend the proposed meeting. What is  your comment on this?    Answer [A]: We highly appreciate and support King Sihanouk's  efforts in realizing national reconciliation and maintaining  peace and stability in Cambodia. We sincerely hope that setting  store by their national interests, the Cambodian leaders of  various parties will, with the spirit of mutual understanding  and mutual accommodation, make joint efforts for national  reconciliation.    Q: According to a report, on 18 May U.S. Congressman Smith  and others asserted that China is continuing to export prison  labor products to the United States. What is your comment on  this?    A: This is sheer fabrication. Regarding the export of  prison labor products, China and the U.S. have signed a  memorandum of understanding on prohibiting import and export  trade in prison labor products. China has acted in strict  compliance with the memorandum. Not long ago, China and the  United States also signed a statement on cooperation for the  implementation of the memorandum. Both the Chinese and U.S.  sides share the view that the two documents are being  implemented smoothly. Ulterior motives motivate some people to  spread lies and vicious slander on this issue.    Q: A meeting of the Sino-British Hong Kong Airport Committee  will be held on 20 May in Hong Kong. What are the Chinese  side's expectations for this meeting? Is there a hope for the  two sides to reach an agreement on financial arrangements for  the new airport?    A: The Sino-British Airport Committee will hold a meeting in  Hong Kong on 20 May. The Chinese side, as always, in accordance  with the memorandum of understanding on the new airport, will  make continuous efforts so that the two sides can reach an  agreement on financial arrangements for the new airport at an  early date.</p>

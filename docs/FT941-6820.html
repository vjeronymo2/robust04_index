			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Aluminium producers face more cuts The aluminium industry faces a trade war that will last for years if the unprecedented international deal between the main aluminium-producing countries to cut global output does not succeed, according to Mr Bernard Legrand, head of aluminium activities at Pechiney, Europe's biggest producer. He delivered this message as representatives of producer governments met in Ottawa, Canada, to assess progress made since January when they decided in Brussels to bring the market back into balance. They agreed to cut about 10 per cent, or between 1.5m and 2m tonnes, from the world's aluminium annual production for 18 months to two years. Mr Legrand said that conditions had deteriorated since the targets were first set in November and the industry now needed annual cuts of at least 2m tonnes for two years. That would be almost impossible without a contribution from the three big producing regions not represented at Brussels: Brazil, the Gulf States and Venezuela. Between them these account for about 2.7m tonnes or 16 per cent of capacity outside the Commonwealth of Independent States. 'Cuts of 2m tonnes mean that everyone in the industry must contribute, there is no room for any producer to stand back and watch others make the running,' said Mr Legrand. The Ottawa meeting could make formal moves to draw these regions into the scheme, which at present encompasses Australia, Canada, the 12-nation European Union negotiating as one, Norway, Russia and the US. Since the Brussels meeting, producers in the west have announced about 850,000 tonnes of annual production cuts. Russia has offered to cut 300,000 tonnes by the end of April and another 200,000 in the following three months. Mr Legrand said: 'I am pretty confident Russia will keep its word.' Producers have been rewarded by seeing the price of aluminium on the London Metal Exchange moving up by nearly a third, from under Dollars 1,000 a tonne in December to more than Dollars 1,300.</p>

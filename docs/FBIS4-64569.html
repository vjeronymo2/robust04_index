			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, May 4 (YONHAP) -- Visiting South Korean  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae conferred with his German  counterpart, Minister Volker Ruehe, here Wednesday [4 May] and  they agreed on stepped-up military exchanges and cooperation  between their countries.    The two ministers in particular shared the view that the  North Korean nuclear question is the factor of major threat to  stability in Northeast Asia let alone the Korean peninsula and  that Pyongyang's nuclear development should be thwarted by all  means.    During the meeting held at the German Defense Ministry, the  two ministers adopted a joint statement on the promotion of  defense and military exchanges and cooperation.    The statement called for the diversification of bilateral  policy and strategic dialogues and expansion of mutual  cooperation in easing tension in disputed areas.    Defense sources said the statement was significant in that  it  is the first document Germany adopted with a non-NATO member  country for expanded cooperation in the defense area.    The statement specifically featured mutual consultations on  basic defense and military policies, exchanges of information  and personnel, and stepped-up cooperation in defense industry,  education and training.    Minister Yi is expected to visit the German Eastern Corps  Headquarters and Berlin on Thursday before leaving for Seoul.</p>

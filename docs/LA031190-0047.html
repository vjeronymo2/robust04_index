			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> FRIENDS FORCED TO PAPER OVER THEIR DIFFERENCES WHEN DECIDING ON DIAPERS  </P> <P> Even friends disagree about disposable diapers, especially if they are mothers.  </P> <P> Sandie Lange of St. Paul, Minn., an environmentally conscious new mother,  lasted about three weeks using cloth diapers when her first child, a daughter  named Kristen, was born.  </P> <P> "It was just too much," said Lange, 23. "I'll recycle all of my newspapers,  wash out all of my cans and bottles, but I'm not going back to the '50s."  </P> <P> Lange says that when her former supervisor, herself the mother of two, picks up  little Kristen, she often frowns and says: "Oh, no, she's in Pampers again."  </P> <P> "We get into little arguments but they're not serious," Lange said. "You know,  she's a save-the-whales kind of person. She uses cloth diapers on both of her  children. It just didn't work out for us."  </P></p>

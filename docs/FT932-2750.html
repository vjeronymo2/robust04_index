			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Granada in expansion mode as profits rise to Pounds 68m GRANADA, the leisure, television and computer services group, made it clear it was in expansionist mood yesterday as it unveiled pre-tax profits of Pounds 68.1m for the 26 weeks to the end of March. The profit figure on a near static turnover of Pounds 640m represented an underlying rise of 28 per cent - 72 per cent as restated under new accountancy rules. Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, said that after the Pounds 360m acquisition of Sutcliffe, the catering and laundry business, the company wanted to be a strong contender for running the UK's planned National Lottery. The company said it would bid in a consortium to run the lottery. Mr Robinson also said that if the government relaxed the rules preventing the nine largest ITV companies taking each other over, Granada would be in the market. 'There is absolutely no way we will sell Granada Television. Granada TV is absolutely at the heart of our business,' said Mr Robinson, who on Monday represented the group at the National Heritage department when ownership rules were considered. All the main Granada businesses improved their operating profits without what Mr Alex Bernstein, the Granada chairman, described as 'any apparent improvement in consumer spending'. Granada's rental business had operating profits of Pounds 50m, an increase of 6 per cent, and television profits rose from Pounds 18m to Pounds 21m. Mr Robinson said leisure, influenced mainly by improvements to products offered by motorway service stations, raised profits from Pounds 3m to Pounds 8m. Computer services was largely unchanged - Pounds 4m compared with Pounds 3.7m last time. Underlying earnings per share grew to 9.8p, an increase of 40 per cent and there was a 10 per cent rise in the dividend, from 2.75p last time to 3.025p. 'We have a long way to go. We will see these kind of improvements continuing into the second half,' Mr Robinson said. Mr Bruce Jones, leisure analyst at stockbrokers Smith New Court, yesterday increased his forecast for the full year from around Pounds 165m to Pounds 173. He believes Granada can move on to pre-tax profits of Pounds 210m next year. 'Granada is hardly a recovery stock, but they do what they say they are going to do. There are no nasty surprises,' he said. Granada said yesterday it expected gearing to be around 80 per cent by the year-end and that borrowings should fall substantially next year. The share price gained 6p to close at 415p. Lex, Page 22</p>

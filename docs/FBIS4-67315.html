			<p>Bucharest   <F P=102>   AU1905172894 Bucharest ADEVARUL in Romanian 17 May 94 p 10 </F> <F P=103> AU1905172894 </F> <F P=104>  Bucharest ADEVARUL </F> <F P=105>  Romanian </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Patru Musat note: "Big Heroin Haul in Bucharest"] </F>   [Text] In the last few days, the Balkan routes of the drug  traffickers have received a new blow from the Romanian police,  which discovered and confiscated 112 kg of pure heroin from  Turkey, whose final destination was an address in Germany. The  112 kg of heroin is the largest such bust on the territory of  our country. The drug was contained in one kg bags hidden in a  special container inside a bus driving on the Turkey-Germany  route. In order to find the hiding place, the whole bus had to  be taken apart piece by piece. It appears that the head of the  network of traffickers was a known figure in the Spanish  underworld. It is worth mentioning that the bus with the 112 kg  of heroin managed to cross the border; the drugs were discovered  and seized in Bucharest.</p>

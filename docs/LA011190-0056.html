			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SIERRA MADRE;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT PLAN OKD  </P> <P> A group of preservationists have withdrawn their objection to the development  of a three-acre foothill parcel on Santa Anita Avenue owned by Lawson and  Annette Martin.  </P> <P> The Martins, who own another 11.2 acres on Santa Anita Avenue, originally  sought to build four houses on the smaller parcel, then reduced the number to  two.  </P> <P> The director of public works approved the smaller proposed development,  including a condition that would have allowed the Martins to install an  electronic gate on the road to Chantry Flats in order to reach the property.  </P> <P> The electronic gate would replace a gate on Santa Anita Avenue that is now  chained and locked from 10 p.m. to 6 p.m. However, the electronic gate would  have to be approved by other agencies, including the U.S. Forest Service.  </P> <P> The preservationists had planned to appeal the approval, but withdrew their  objection after the Martins signed a deed restriction permanently limiting  construction to two houses on the entire acreage.  </P></p>

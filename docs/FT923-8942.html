			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Inchcape insurance arm buys into French broker BAIN Clarkson, the insurance broking subsidiary of Inchcape, is expanding its activities in continental Europe through the purchase of a minority stake in France's third largest broker for Pounds 15.2m. The deal involves Bain Clarkson initially taking a 25 per cent holding in Compagnie Europeenne de Courtage d'Assurances et de Reassurances (Cecar). It also entails Bain's French subsidiary, Rouge Clarkson, being sold to Cecar for loan stock. The conversion of this stock to equity in 1996 will take Bain's holding in Cecar up to 34 per cent. Cecar's gross brokerage income was FFr 370m (Pounds 39m) last year. Mr Simon Arnold, chairman of Bain, said its contribution would be substantially more than current French earnings, although less than 10 per cent of all the group's insurance activities. Last year insurance services - mostly under the Bain Clarkson name - made an operating profit of Pounds 18.6m out of a total of Pounds 222.2m (before central costs) for the whole of the Inchcape motors and business services group.</p>

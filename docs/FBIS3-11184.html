			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 27 February Mexico City daily  REFORMA cites a "high-level military officer assigned to  Chiapas" who states that satellites and other means are being  used to plan for a possible offensive against the Zapatist  National Liberation Army (EZLN), should peace negotiations break  down. The officer, who asked that his name be withheld, says:  "Military Intelligence continues to work, even during the  cease-fire period and the peace dialogue,...to discover access  routes into the mountains and the forest. Satellites are being  used to identify Zapatist assembly areas, new entry routes for  infantry units, and drop zones for Mexican Army parchutists." He  also notes that "we have found new exit routes, and the more we  look the more we find; this is ongoing because we have got to be  ready for any eventuality, in case there is no [peace] accord."</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Editor of Daily Mirror is sacked the second newspaper editor to be removed from Mirror Group Newspapers in under a week. MGN said his successor, Mr David Banks, was joining the company 'without any of the Maxwell experience that still infects the operation'. MGN also said the Daily Mirror would stick to its line of trying to help the election of a Labour government. But there would be a 'more modern approach' to political coverage. One executive said there would be less 'ranting propaganda'. The paper would also seek to recapture its crusading spirit 'on issues of real concern to readers, like mortgages and other consumer issues'. Mr Stott, who edited both the Daily Mirror and the People twice and had worked for MGN for 24 years, left as Mr Banks flew in from Australia. Mr Banks, 44, was editor of the Telegraph Mirror in Sydney. He has also been deputy editor of The Australian and night editor of The Sun in London. Mr Banks said: 'Today we finally bury Maxwell at the Daily Mirror. This is a new beginning.' Last week Mr Bill Hagerty was removed as editor of The People. MGN said yesterday his successor would be Ms Bridget Rowe, editor of the Sunday Mirror. Ms Rowe will be succeeded by her deputy, Mr Colin Myler - a former news editor at Today under the editorship of Mr David Montgomery. The changes follow last month's appointment of Mr Montgomery, former editor of the News of the World as well as Today, as MGN chief executive. Daily Mirror journalists last night described the events as 'the beginning of the end'. A statement said: 'Three weeks after he promised editorial independence and assured us that editorial jobs were safe, David Montgomery has sacked two out of three editors.' Observer, Page 13</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULVER CITY BATTLES INCREASE IN GRAFFITI  </P> <P> In the first 4 1/2 years of a city program to remove graffiti from public and  private property, Culver City spent about $105,000 to paint over more than  1,600 spray-painted scribblings.  </P> <P> But in the first 10 months of this fiscal year, more than 1,000 markings have  had to be covered, and by the end of this month when the fiscal year ends, the  city expects to have spent $96,000.  </P> <P> "It's appalling to every resident of Culver City," Mayor Jozelle Smith said.  "But it's happening everywhere."  </P> <P> The increase in graffiti caught city officials by surprise. At the beginning of  the fiscal year, $14,000 was allocated for graffiti removal. But the amount was  increased to $38,000 in November, and last week, the City Council increased it  again to $51,000.  </P> <P> In addition, about $45,000 has been allocated for graffiti removal by the  Redevelopment Agency on property administered by the agency, and by the  Municipal Services Department in city parks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increased Workload  </P> <P> "It just has increased so dramatically," said Phyllis Baboolal, manager of the  city's housing programs office, which oversees the graffiti program. "There  seems to be more people doing more graffiti on more properties."  </P> <P> Culver City is not the only place where graffiti has increased. Tim Sullivan,  president of Graffiti Removal Co., which contracts with 20 cities in Los  Angeles and Orange counties, including Culver City, said his company's workload  has increased about 20% over last year.  </P> <P> "It's not just gangs any more, it's punk rockers, skate-boarders and just  regular kids," Sullivan said.  </P> <P> In addition to providing more money, Culver City officials are hoping to  control the graffiti problem by getting more property owners involved. Graffiti  at commercial and residential sites is removed by a contractor at no cost to  the property owner. Property owners report graffiti to a city hot line, (213)  280-5929.  </P> <P> Baboolal said that when graffiti are painted over, extra paint will be left  with the property owner to encourage property owners to remove new scribblings  themselves and free contractors to concentrate on new graffiti.  </P> <P> She said she also hopes Neighborhood Watch programs will become involved by  getting consent forms in advance to allow the contractor onto private property,  and to watch for and report new graffiti.  </P> <P> "We are trying to stress to residents that it is their responsibility to get it  removed immediately," Smith said. "People have to take a certain amount pride  in their neighborhoods to get rid of the graffiti."  </P> <P> Police Lt. Ellis Smith said some of the graffiti are from a local gang, but he  attributed the increase to a growing fad among teen-agers called "tagging." He  said this is a term applied to graffiti by non-gang members. It usually  involves more artistic scribblings and drawings than the gang generated  variety, he said.  </P> <P> Smith said most of the graffiti are in the city's east and west sides, the  parts of the city that are nearly surrounded by Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warning to Offenders  </P> <P> "We've caught some of the kids, and we have a good idea who some of the others  might be," Smith said. "We're going to talk to their parents and warn them that  they may liable for the cost of removing the graffiti. We're hoping that will  stop some of it."  </P> <P> Smith said sentencing some of the offenders to paint over their graffiti will  also be a deterrent.  </P> <P> "We are encouraging the courts to assign the offenders to community service to  remove the graffiti themselves," she said.  </P> <P> But not everyone has been surprised by the rise of graffiti in the city.  </P> <P> "It doesn't surprise me," said Jackie McCain, president of the Culver City  Homeowners Assn., which has about 150 members. "We don't have a wall around our  city."  </P></p>

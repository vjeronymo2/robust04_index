			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Maintaining the coal export momentum - Guerrilla threats and investment costs in Colombia's mining country COLOMBIA has become one of the world's top suppliers of steam coal within six years of joining the export business. Between 1984 and 1990, exports rose from 1m tonnes to 14m tonnes, and Colombia secured nearly 8 per cent of the international market. But retaining this means expanding coal production rapidly at a time when guerrilla armies are waging an economic war and costly investments in transport are overdue. Some 85 per cent of Colombia's steam coal exports are mined in the northern zone of El Cerrejon by the Colombian state coal company (Carbocol) and the Exxon subsidiary, Intercor. The mine is already producing nearly 13m tonnes a year, close to the 15m tonne goal set for 1995. Experts say it would be possible to increase El Cerrejon's output by a further 5m tonnes without substantial expense. However, coal is still not profitable enough to justify large investments in infrastructure for new projects, especially as Colombia's two main guerrilla armies - the ELN and the FARC - have united to inflict maximum damage on the oil and mining sectors. The targets are not only the multinationals - Carbones del Caribe, a small scale operator, had more than a dozen heavy vehicles burned and two hired river tugs destroyed by guerrillas in the first two months of this year. The location of El Cerrejon, away from guerrilla-invested areas, is one of the mine's big advantages. Coal supplies are stable, particularly now that early production difficulties have been cleared up. But a sizeable part of Colombia's most important and accessible steam coal reserves at La Loma, La Jagua and El Descanso in the department of Cesar, and San Jorge in Cordoba, lie well within guerrilla range, and at least some of these deposits will have to be developed over the next few years, if, as Carbocol plans, exports are to rise to 26m tonnes by 1995 and 40m tonnes by the end of the century. Carbocol has a USDollars 1.6bn debt, and is not undertaking any big new ventures. Although El Cerrejon's operating accounts have been in the black for two years, Carbocol's financial costs are such that the state company continues to make a loss. Large-scale development of the coal basins which have already been explored - Carbocol estimates reserves at 21bn tonnes in eight regions - depends mainly on attracting foreign capital. As part of the policy to build an 'energy axis' between Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico, the Colombian government had hoped to draw Mexican investment to mine the deposits at El Descanso, with the output fuelling Mexican power stations. Carbocol calculates that El Descanso could produce up to 10m tonnes a year, but Mexico's demand for coal is not growing as fast as expected, and the future of the project is uncertain. More than two years ago, the US company, Drummond, announced plans to invest nearly USDollars 600m in the development of La Loma, and the construction of a rail link and shipping facilities. Exports are due to begin in 1993, with annual production eventually rising to 10m tonnes. But though La Loma's steam coal is good quality and cheap to mine, the risks for a multinational working in guerrilla territory may prove too daunting. The company has not built any camp or other installations at La Loma as yet, according to a recent visitor to the area. Thus, the extra coal for the mid-1990s may have to be supplied by El Cerrejon and Colombia's private sector companies. Carbones del Caribe exported about 1m tonnes last year, and, in spite of guerrilla damage and threats to installations in both Cesar and Cordoba, aims to produce 1.5m tonnes in 1991. However, Carbones del Caribe has had to patch together awkward and vulnerable shipping arrangements by rail and river to the Caribbean ports. The expansion of the central mining zone of El Cerrejon, which has proven reserves of 600m tonnes to a depth of 150 metres, has also been held up by access problems. The trucking system used until now is inefficient. Producing several million tonnes of coal a year would require a more integrated solution, such as the purpose-built railway and port in the northern zone. The Prodeco port near Santa Marta is the nearest, but has a limited capacity, and Prodeco plans to produce some 3m tonnes a year in the Calenturitas zone of La Loma. The construction of special coal ports close to beauty spots and tourist centres has triggered environmental protests. The main cities of Barranquilla, Cartagena and Santa Marta are controversial sites and coal shipments have already been disrupted because of alleged contamination. These sudden hold-ups are not only costly, but affect a company's reputation for reliable deliveries. Pollution difficulties are aggravated by strong winds along the Caribbean coast, which raise dust even when the coal is well-watered. The industry argues that, with properly built facilities and effective controls, there is little danger of contamination. But, as one Colombian ecologist pointed out, most companies are simply not prepared to exercise the discipline or meet the extra cost. At present, possible sites for coal ports include Barranquilla and Cienaga, while existing installations could also be upgraded. Coal has become Colombia's third export earner, after coffee and oil. Last year's sales, mainly to European countries, brought in more than USDollars 500m, with the UK, Holland, Denmark and France as Colombia's most important European customers. Smaller amounts of coal go to the US, the Far East, and local Caribbean and Latin American countries. Marketing experts believe Colombia's high quality coal will continue to be very competitive in Europe, particularly as demand in the Far East strengthens and absorbs more Australian coal, and as European production and pricing policies are shaken up by changes after 1992.</p>

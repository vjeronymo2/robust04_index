			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Prudential chief gets 43% pay increase MR MICK NEWMARCH, the chief executive of Prudential Corporation, received a salary almost twice that of the average for other insurance industry chiefs in 1990. According to Prudential's latest annual report, he received Pounds 543,673 in 1990, a 43 per cent increase on the previous year's Pounds 379,651. The pay rise was decided by a committee of non-executive directors and includes bonus payments based on the company's performance in 1989, when profits rose by 9 per cent. The increase makes Mr Newmarch, who also has more than 600,000 share options and receives other benefits, one of the best paid insurance managers in the country. The heads of most leading composite, life companies and brokers received between Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 300,000 in 1990. See Lex</p>

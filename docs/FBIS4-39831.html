			<p>BFN     [Text] Tighina (Bender), BASAPRESS, 8/6/1994 -- Today, the  Joint Control Commission for overseeing the implementation of  the Snegur-Yeltsin Convention in Dniester held today a session  in Tighina (Bender). According to the report presented by the  joint military command, the situation of the controlled zone was  stable last week. There were cases when the control performed  by military experts failed but this was not their fault.  According to the report, the Dniester presidential  representative Tom Zenovich impedes the military observers from  controlling the Tighina fortress, where a Dniester motorized  infantry battalion is located, thus breaching the Convention of  21 July 1992. The joint military command obliged the observers  to signal the cases when the agreements are violated and assure  the removal of obstacles. The session pointed out that the  sides reduced the number of peace-keeping forces. To solve this  problem, Moldovan, Russian and Dniester military departments  were proposed to hold consultations regarding the number of  peace-keeping soldiers and the weapons they should carry.</p>

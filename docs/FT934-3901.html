			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Levitt case shows rules have failed Sir, I hope that your newspaper will take every step to publicise the lunacy of the outcome of the Levitt trial. What faith can anybody have in a regulatory system that appears to disregard the need to ensure that cases of this nature are examined thoroughly and fully. Plea bargaining should not have been allowed for several reasons: l. To ensure that the widest publicity was given to this case. 2. To ensure that all the regulatory systems could learn from the experience and understand what had gone on and how it could be avoided in the future. 3. To ensure that the people who are supposed to be protected by the regulatory system can have confidence and faith in that system. This apparent failure by the Serious Fraud Office brings forward the day for government legislation as self-regulation is clearly not working.

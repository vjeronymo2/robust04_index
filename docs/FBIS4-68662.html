			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Georgiy Sitnyanskiy, Institute of Ethnology and </F> Anthropology of the Russian Academy of Sciences: "If a Tatar  Robs a Tatar, Why Should the Center Intervene? Personal Autonomy  and the Buildup of Russia"]    [Text] More than a half century ago the Russian philosopher  I.A. Ilin predicted that the dismemberment and weakening of  Russia would lead to very dire consequences for the entire world  and reduce it to chaos. And the President of the United States  is already admitting that in the new world, which was formed  after the destruction of the communist system, there is less  order. In the work of that same Ilin we find a precedent: Having  been convinced that the weak Germany after 1945 became the gates  for Soviet expansion to the West, the latter overcame its fear  of the revival of a strong Germany and helped it to become a  strong power again.    In brief, we are gradually gaining the understanding that on  the territory of the former USSR we must create some kind of  unified state formation based on the principles of democracy and  a market economy, one that is economically, socially, and  politically strong and stable.    The question arises: What about the numerous peoples who  populate this space?    One must assume that the principle of national-territorial  autonomy has not justified itself. Under the communists these  autonomous entities were an utter fiction and as soon as they  began to be filled with real content, blood was shed. To  preserve them in the posttotalitarian society would mean endless  conflicts because of disputed territories, endless Karabakhs.  And, moreover, "since all the modern ethnic groups have been  dispersed, national statehood does not fully satisfy the  aspirations of those peoples that are actively striving for it.  What, for example, can be granted to the Tatar ethnic group as a  whole by Tatarstan's acquisition of independence, if only  one-fourth of all the Tatars of the former USSR live on this  territory? Who will represent and provide for the national  interests of the 75 percent of the Tatars who live outside  Tatarstan? Otto Bauer, one of the creators of the idea of  personal autonomy, wrote at the beginning of the 20th century:  "The purely territorial principle everywhere places the minority  in the hands of the majority...to implement the territorial  principle in its pure form means that each nation will swallow  up the minorities of other nations taken into its body, but at  the same time it sacrifices its own minorities who are scattered  throughout other national areas."    All sober-minded political forces in Russia today are coming  out in favor of restoring a unified state, admitting that the  current principle for construction of the state, which was  realized in the USSR--according to the ethnic principle, of  course--will lead nowhere.    At the same time we must be aware that we will not be able  to  restore the province-oblast system in the same form in which it  existed before 1917. The peoples have become accustomed to  sovereignty and national states, and with the elimination of the  national-territorial autonomous entities the question of what  will replace them will inevitably arise.    What is the alternative?    The way out, in our view, consists in separating the entire  sphere of interethnic relations from the notion of territory and  providing ethnic-personal autonomy, whereby the bearer of ethnic  sovereignty is not the territory but representatives of a given  ethnic group regardless of where they may live within the  boundaries of the "large" state. And the right to personal  autonomy may be exercised not only by individual peoples but  also ethnic groups (for example, among Russians-Kazakhs).    The idea of personal autonomy appeared approximately 100  years ago in Austro-Hungary. In Russia by the beginning of the  20th century it enjoyed support from all liberal and left-wing  parties except for the Bolsheviks.    Under the tsar the right to personal autonomy was actually  enjoyed by many "nomadic foreigners," particularly Kazakhs and  Kyrgyz. They had their own self-government, elected their own  bolushes (district leaders), biys (judges) and had their own law  (adat) by which they judged their fellow tribesmen, etc. The  tsarist administration did not intervene in their internal  affairs; it simply collected taxes. Naturally, the European  population residing on these territories were not subject to the  local "foreign" authority.    After February 1917 attempts were made to realize principles  of personal autonomy in other regions of Russia--in the Muslim  Volga region, Siberia, Ukraine, and in Estonia, which had  seceded, this principle was established right up until 1940. But  as soon as the Bolsheviks came to power, promising all peoples  "the right to self-determination right up to secession," and  then turned their "sovereignty" into a fiction, no further  attempts were made to realize the principle of personal autonomy.    What should be the real content of the idea of personal  autonomy for the peoples of modern Russia?    In the first place, every nation should have the right to  the  external attributes of statehood--a president, a parliament, a  flag, a seal, an anthem, etc. It is no secret that for 99  percent of any people sovereignty is needed for the sake of  sovereignty itself. This must be taken into account.    Let us consider the Tatar ethnic group as a concrete  example.  The president of Tataria should become the president of the  Tatars, and all Tatars living in Russia should be under his  rule, but representatives of other nationalities living in the  Kazan Province would not be subject to him. Naturally, the  question of whom to obey--their own personal-autonomous  president or the Russian state--would have to be decided by  every adult citizen for himself. Nobody would force a Tatar to  be subject to the president of the Tatars if he did not wish  this himself.    Each ethnic group, exercising the right to personal  autonomy,  should have its own press, radio, television, and also system of  education in its native language right up to higher education;  the forms and ways of organizing this--to create their own  educational institutions or ethnic courses, departments, and  faculties in general Russian ones (for example, Tatar at Kazan  University)--these, naturally, must be decided by the peoples  themselves. It goes without saying that they must be permitted  to create private educational institutions where the language of  the training, naturally, would be determined by the owners  themselves.    The peoples must also be given the right to have their own  legislation and courts. If a Tatar, for example, has killed or  robbed another Tatar, why should the center intervene here? We  must give them the right to judge the accused for themselves  (the places for incarceration, incidentally, would most likely  be common). The people should decide for themselves what kind of  local legislation to have.    The center would intervene only when the criminal and the  victim did not belong to the same personal autonomous entity.    It goes without saying that the center should retain the  right to correct local laws in cases where they allow violations  of the basic human rights or the integrity of the state.    The principle of personal autonomy of peoples should be  combined with provincial (oblast) division of Russia. The oblast  (province) should have a certain contingent of bureaucrats  headed by the governor who would be responsible for resolving  statewide issues on the territory of the oblast: the deployment  of military units, the collection of statewide taxes, the  functioning of strategically important highways and railroads,  etc.    The personal autonomous entities might also be granted the  right to issue their own money while, of course, all citizens  and organizations of Russia would necessarily have to accept the  Russian ruble as well. There is a precedent for this--in the  Russian empire many national districts have the right to print  their own money.    It would be more complicated with the so-called municipal  services--public transportation, water, sewerage, street  cleaning, etc.--everything that should be under the jurisdiction  of the local authorities (we will call them zemstvos). How would  the zemstvos (provincial-oblast, district-regional, etc.) relate  to the organs of power of the personally autonomous peoples? The  experience of the Russian empire cannot help us here since in  those oblasts and provinces where peoples with something like  personal autonomy lived there were no zemstvos.    Here is one of the ways of solving this problem:  proportional  representation. Let us say that in Kazan Province 50 percent of  the population are citizens directly under the jurisdiction of  the Russian state and the other 50 percent are representatives  of the Tatar personal autonomous entity. In this case both would  form up to half of the deputies of the province zemstvo. Whom  the Tatars would delegate--elected, appointed, or if the  deputies of the personal autonomous Tatar parliament residing  permanently in Kazan Province would combine this deputy work  with that in the zemstvo--they would decide for themselves.    This, in my view, is briefly the content of the idea of  personal autonomy as it applies to Russian reality today.    In conclusion I shall mention the most widespread objections  we have heard and try to respond to them.    1. This kind of organization of the state would be  aimed at dividing the peoples.    Excuse me, but why would there be division if the people  belonging to various personal autonomous entities were living in  one state, constantly communicating with each other, and  learning from one another; if, for instance, a Bashkir saw that  a Tatar living in Ufa had greater rights, he could suggest to  his personal autonomous organs of power that it would not be a  bad idea for the Bashkirs to learn from the Tatars. And if it  comes to that, are the sovereign national-territorial formations  not proceeding more toward separation, especially if you look at  who is calling for "sovereignization" now (see above)? The  "ideal" national-territorial sovereignty would entail separation  and placement of peoples in various autonomous quarters. This is  shifting the blame, as they say!    2. Such a policy is apartheid since there would be  different laws for different nationalities.    No. Apartheid is when one people or another have forced upon  them a way of life that is different from the others. But no one  will be forcing those Tatars to have their own legislation that  is different from the Russian. They will be given the right to  have it, and if they want to they will take advantage of their  right--that is their business. And to be frank,  national-territorial autonomous entities are similar to  Bantustans. Every resident, for example, of Kazan, regardless of  nationality, must obey the laws of Tataria whether he wants to  or not. So again it is shifting the blame.    3. A very significant objection: The idea is not bad  but the peoples who have developed a taste for territorial  sovereignty will not go for it. I have also heard this:  "Territorial-national autonomous entities are now hundreds of  years old or maybe even thousands" (!).    And this in our dynamic age when everything is changing  almost every day, to speak about hundreds and thousands of  years?! Whether or not the people will go for this will be shown  in the near future. At the beginning of the article I already  said that two years of sovereign life have affected the  awareness of many peoples.</p>

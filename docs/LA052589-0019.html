			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> A MIGHTY BLOW FOR FRIENDLY PERSUASION  </P> <P> Will China's protesters produce a Madison -- a constitutionalist, a codifier of  liberty -- before there emerges a Napoleon whose riposte to philosophy is  artillery? Probably not. But a 20th-Century Chinese thinker said when asked the  significance of the French Revolution, "Too soon to tell."  </P> <P> Looking back on 1989 from, say 2005, as Wordsworth looked back on 1789 from  1805, many Chinese, young no more, will surely think, "Bliss was it in that  dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven!" However, many may then feel  as Wordsworth did about the long gone "hour of universal ferment" when "the  soil of common life (was) too hot to tread upon." They may say as he did, "Now  do I feel how I have been deceived."  </P></p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Corporate recovery supports NZ equities  -The economic outlook also looks good ahead of the election Soaring confidence in the economic outlook and unexpectedly strong corporate profits have led to a rally in New Zealand equities. The NZSE-40 capital index is bubbling around the 2,000 to 2,030 level that it last achieved in January 1990. However, it is still well below the 3,800 mark set in 1987, and for much of the current year, until June when the present rally began, traded within 100 points of its January low of 1,495. Since Monday, when the index registered a 3 1/2 -year high of 2,027.37, it has fluctuated, closing yesterday at 1,993.58. Earlier this year the main activity on the market was being generated from overseas, with steady buying in the larger companies, particularly Brierley Investments, and Fletcher Challenge, the forestry and energy group. As a result an estimated 40 per cent of the shares in these companies are now held offshore. At the same time, locally based institutions tended to be aggressive sellers of local stocks as they deliberately sought to increase their overseas exposure. However, sentiment changed sharply from June following a series of economic stories which showed unexpectedly strong growth in the domestic economy and good export growth leading to a continuing strong balance of payments surplus. Sharp falls in interest rates saw local investors seeking alternative investments, and higher yielding equities began to look underpriced. Manufacturers, which had been strong critics of government reform policies over the past eight years, reported that, because of low inflation - currently around 2 per cent - and falling debt and wage costs, they were finding it possible to cope with the rising strength of the New Zealand dollar. Opinion polls also showed a strong rise in support for the pro-business National government, which now expects confidently to win the November general election on the promise of offering consistent policies. Ms Ruth Richardson, the finance minister, was able to portray the July budget, with its forecast reductions in the deficit and continuing economic growth, as a vindication of her determination to stick with often unpopular measures in the national interest. In August, she introduced a new tax regime to encourage overseas equity investment which, brokers say, has spurred US interest in New Zealand. US investment has risen sharply following publicity there about the successes New Zealand has had in implementing policies favoured by the so-called Chicago monetarist school of economists. Bell Atlantic and Ameritech now control Telecom Corporation, International Paper manages Carter Holt Harvey, the largest forestry company, Wisconsin Central owns the national railway, New Zealand Rail, and other US companies have substantial investments in plantation forestry, and manufacturing. Brokers have reported the return of many investors who had sworn that they would never touch a share again after the 1987 crash. Those returning have found that the stock exchange has reformed itself, with prompt settlement procedures and tougher listing requirements. Returning investors have also found most companies in strong financial shape. Many have low debt and strong cash flows, such as Telecom, or no debt at all, such as Ceramco and Steel and Tube, and are reporting strong profits rises. Telecom's surprisingly strong profits recovery has seen it add NZDollars 1.20 in under a month, closing yesterday at NZDollars 3.98. The drive to cut debt extended to Fletcher Challenge, which has been the second major stock to lead the rally, the first being Telecom. Fletcher Challenge's apparent reluctance to sell assets saw its price marked back last year from NZDollars 3.80 to below NZDollars 1.60 by October. The group has since worked hard to re-establish itself, and cut its debt. Last week it reported better than expected results. This saw its shares bounce back to above NZDollars 3.83, although it has eased back recently on profit-taking, to close yesterday at NZDollars 3.68.</p>

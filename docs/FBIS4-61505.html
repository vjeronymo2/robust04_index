			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lev Rumyantsev] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg May 5 TASS--"The Baltic region can  and should become a dynamically developing and stable area. Our  country will do everything it can to make that a reality",  Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt told St. Petersburg Mayor  Anatoliy Sobchak on Thursday.    Not everything is going smoothly as concerns the creation of  a favorable economic and political climate between the Baltic  states, the Swedish premier said, but progress has been noted.  Mutual understanding has increased and fewer sharp attacks are  being made on each other.    Bildt and Sobchak agreed that Swedish businessmen would be  more active on the St. Petersburg economic scene if the criminal  situation in that city was not so dangerous. They both were of  the opinion that Sweden and St. Petersburg must coordinate the  efforts of their law-enforcement bodies.    Bildt even proposed that the leaders of all the Baltic  countries discuss the idea of creating a regional coordination  centre for the fight against crime. "We are very worried by the  growing influx of narcotics into our country from abroad and by  the appearance of illegal immigrants, which encourage the growth  of crime", he announced.    The Swedish premier also appealed for more political  cooperation. "all kinds of different party and public  organisations should take part in the political dialogue,  including communists and nationalists, which we have as well",  he said.</p>

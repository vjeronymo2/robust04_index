			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Efim figures show rapid downturn THE FINANCIAL health of Efim, the Italian state industrial holding, was deteriorating faster than publicly admitted before the government's decision in July to place the group in voluntary liquidation. This has emerged from the release of Efim's accounts for 1991 and estimates for this year up to the time the liquidator was called in. Meanwhile, the government yesterday agreed to foreign bankers' demands for full repayment of their Efim debt. Until now the government has insisted on paying in lira or ecu denominated bonds at lower than market rates. But yesterday the government agreed to pay the banks interest at those rates in force when the debts were contracted. Foreign bankers have fought hard for full repayment and to insist on the principle that Efim debt be treated as sovereign debt. Losses for 1991 were L1,181bn (Dollars 1bn) against the previous year's loss of L374.2bn, while estimates up to mid-July suggest losses running at L900bn. Most of these were generated by Alumix, its aluminium company, and Augusta, the aerospace group centred on helicopters. Efim at one stage had talked of the 1991 results holding losses down to L271bn and returning to a modest profit of L99bn in 1994. In the spring, when press reports suggested the 1991 loss would be around L800bn, Mr Gaetano Mancini, the then president, said the figure would be nearer L600bn. Overall turnover was also down in 1991 from L5,088bn to L4,532bn. The accounts show total net debts of L7,654bn at the year-end. But total debt at the time of the liquidation move was L8,500bn of which L3,500bn was owed to foreign banks. The Efim accounts should have been completed by the end of August. No explanation was given for their not being signed by the outgoing board until Tuesday. According to the July liquidation decree, Mr Alberto Predieri, the liquidator, has 60 days from the formal approval of the accounts to draw up a plan to settle the group's affairs.</p>

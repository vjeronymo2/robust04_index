			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Agatha Ngai] </F>   [Text] The internationally-acclaimed director Zhang  Yimou's banned movie Huozhuo should not be shown in Hong Kong  unless local distributors obtain clearance from the Chinese  authorities, a local Chinese official warned yesterday.    Speaking at a function to promote next year's film festival  in Shanghai, Cui Songming, the deputy head of the cultural and  sports department of the Xinhua (New China News Agency) office  in Hong Kong, said approval from China's Ministry of Radio, Film  and Television was needed before the movie could be shown.    "There was always a clear requirement in China that any  movies, including those whose post-production was done in the  mainland, should be censored by the Ministry of Radio, Film and  Television."    He said Hong Kong movie-makers should respect China's system  and follow the procedures when they went to the mainland to make  movies as a realisation of the "one country, two systems"  principle.    "If the related parties decide to film the movie (without  passing the censorship in China) arbitrarily, it will no doubt  cause disturbances between two places," he said.    The deputy head also used the movie, Farewell, My Concubine,  as an example of how local producers had taken advantage of the  "confusion" in China and screened the movie in Hong Kong without  Beijing's approval.    When asked about director Zhang's absence from the Cannes  film festival as a protest against the censorship of his film,  Mr Cui said: "You may say the Government is tightening its  policy on film. But, I think, it's necessary to rectify the  discipline in the cultural industry.    "It's usual for a country to have some internal regulations.  I don't think the move will discourage film-makers from coming  to China."    He said artists should not feel concerned by the controls.  Mr Cui said each movie's script should be censored before the  actual production began, and artists would not run into any  problems if directors followed the censored copy.    Huozhou, a top contender at the Cannes film festival, tells  the story of three generations of a family living through the  China of the 1940s, 50s and 60s, including the Great Leap  Forward and the Cultural Revolution.    Sources said although the film itself carried no political  message, the authorities were not happy with its depiction of  the various political campaigns in China.    A local artist who has expressed an interest in the local  distribution of Huozhuo said yesterday a copy of the movie would  be submitted to local censors and he hoped permission to screen  the movie would soon be obtained.    But the artist did not want to comment on the Xinhua  official's statement, saying the whole process was at a  "preliminary stage".    Speaking at the same promotion yesterday, mainland director  Xie Jin said the recent tightening of China's art policy had had  little effect on his works.    The president of the Shanghai School of Performance said it  was normal practice for a mainland production to apply for a  censor visa from the Government.    "I don't think the procedures will affect film-makers'  creativity."</p>

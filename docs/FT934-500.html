			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Waterglade debt restructuring Waterglade International Holdings, the property developer, yesterday said that terms had been agreed with certain of its bankers and main creditors for a restructuring of the group's debt. However, because all the banks and creditors have made their agreement conditional on new equity finance being raised, the deal has not yet been signed. The company said it intended to send shareholders a rights issue circular in the new year which would contain full details of these agreements.</p>

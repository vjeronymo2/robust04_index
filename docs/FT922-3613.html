			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Water complaints up 130% COMPLAINTS from customers against the monopoly water companies, which are now reporting increased profits, more than doubled last year, Ofwat, the industry's regulator, reported yesterday. It said it received 10,635 complaints about water companies in England and Wales last year, a jump of 130 per cent on the 4,613 registered in 1990. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, said he was concerned about the increase, although a rise had been expected as more people became aware of Ofwat's watchdog role. He said there was no evidence that the sharp rise was caused by a decline in standards, but added: 'Many customers have criticised the profits made by water companies and complain about the large price increases.' The report illustrates the water companies' difficulties in explaining the price increases - which are averaging 5 percentage points above inflation each year - in the light of their increased profits. Mr Byatt, an interventionist regulator determined to protect the customer, said at a London press conference that it was important for the companies to be profitable, otherwise investors would not provide the funds essential for completion of the Pounds 28bn capital investment programme. He said shareholders also needed a return on their investment, but that should not be excessive, given the low-risk nature of the industry. At present, more than 70 per cent of profits are reinvested in the water business to improve quality. Complaints about charges represented about 38 per cent of the total. Billing made up 25 per cent of complaints, and water supply matters 12 per cent. The report shows that 15 per cent of complaints were resolved by compensation and rebates, and a total of Pounds 841,000 was returned in compensation for poor service. The largest number of complaints about increased charges was in the south-west. South West Water has been given permission by Ofwat to raise charges by 16 per cent this year to pay for improvements to beach quality. Ofwat Annual Report. HMSO.

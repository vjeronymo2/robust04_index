			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Ali al-Qulaybi: "Palestinian Ambassador </F> to Jordan Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Palestinian Authority Council  To Be Completed After 'Id al-Adha; Differences Between 'Arafat  and Qaddumi Regarding the Return"]    [Text] Tunis -- Al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, Palestinian  ambassador to Jordan and Fatah Central Committee member, has  stated that formation of the Palestinian Authority Council for  Gaza and Jericho will be completed after the blessed 'Id al-Adha  and will hold its first meeting in Cairo and subsequent meetings  inside the occupied territory.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Tunis, 'Abd-al-Rahim  said that Fatah's Revolutionary Council approved the autonomy  agreement signed by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on Wednesday 4 May in Cairo.    He added that the Council unanimously decided to return to  Gaza and Jericho and to form committees to pass instructions and  duties to the cadres to enter the homeland as soon as possible  in accordance with a preconceived plan.    'Abd-al-Rahim denied divisions and differences of opinion  between members of the Revolutionary Council which, he said, is  a framework within which views and ideas interact, issues are  discussed, and decisions are made on the basis of agreement and  reconciliation.    He pointed out that there were two trends in the Council:  One  led by Faruq Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf), head of the Political  Department, who wants the return to be gradual at all levels  from the command to the lowest organization level. The other  trend, led by President Yasir 'Arafat, believes that the entry  of Fatah and PLO cadres into Gaza and Jericho should be done in  full strength and weight because the situation is ripe for that  and because the process of building the autonomy authority in  Gaza and Jericho requires the pooling of all efforts and  resources to ensure success of that experiment and, therefore,  pave the way for PLO success in future steps aimed at setting up  an independent Palestinian state with holy Jerusalem as its  capital.    Al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, who is also a member of Fatah's  Revolutionary Council, confirmed that all the Council's members  have expressed support for the decision to return to Gaza and  Jericho in accordance with a specific plan and instructions for  all cadres, and that 10 special committees have started their  task of placing the cadres in their appropriate place within the  national authority. These committees represent all the  political, economic, security, educational, and other sectors  under national authority powers.    The Fatah Central Committee member said that all Palestinian  qualified patriots would participate in the process of building  the Palestinian entity, and that the process would not be  confined to qualified people from the factions because "the  Palestinian authority belongs to all the Palestinian people and  not just one group."    'Abd-al-Rahim said that he might be assigned the duties of  the presidency's general secretariat.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SUES POLICE OFFICER WHO SAVED WOMAN  </P> <P> Last November, a young waitress named Margaret Parkinson was run down by a  drunk driver as she helped a friend unload a bicycle from a car on a  fog-shrouded street in Torrance.  </P> <P> Parkinson, 24, lost her lower right leg and nearly bled to death before two  Torrance police officers saved her life by applying a makeshift tourniquet they  fashioned from a rope and a buck knife.  </P> <P> Since the accident on Redondo Beach Boulevard, Parkinson has emerged from a  coma and is slowly recuperating at a rehabilitation center in San Diego County.  </P> <P> The Torrance police officers have been lauded for their efforts: Parkinson's  father wrote a letter saying he was "terribly grateful" to Officer Devin Chase  for saving his daughter's life. And the South Bay Police and Fire Medal of  Valor Committee presented Chase and fellow officer Jerry Wallace with the  Distinguished Service Award for their "courage and self-control" in rescuing  Parkinson.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $6-Million Suit  </P> <P> But lawyers for Parkinson, who was left partially paralyzed and brain-damaged  by the accident, delivered a strikingly different message this month: a  $6-million negligence claim that blames Chase and the city for the accident.  </P> <P> "It's a tragic irony," conceded Parkinson's mother, Nancy.  </P> <P> Chase said he was floored when he learned of the claim.  </P> <P> "You save someone's life," said Chase, 27, "and you are trying to do the job  the best you can. . . . Down the road all these people come up, and  unfortunately they are mostly attorneys, and they say how you are supposed to  have done things differently."  </P> <P> The claim centers on Chase's actions before the accident, not afterward, said  Parkinson's father, Lucius (Jim) Parkinson. It alleges that Chase drove past  Maggie Parkinson before the collision but failed to warn her not to stand  behind her double-parked car on the fog-blanketed thoroughfare.  </P> <P> "If my daughter is going to be crippled for the rest of her life and I can find  compensation, I'm going to look for it," Parkinson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Just Finished Work  </P> <P> On Nov. 5, 1988, Maggie Parkinson and Ella Schwartz had just finished working  their Friday night shifts as waitresses at the Cheesecake Factory in Redondo  Beach.  </P> <P> It was past 2 a.m. on Saturday morning when Parkinson, who had moved from her  hometown of Carlsbad to Torrance two months before, stopped to drop Schwartz  off at her apartment at 3920 W. Redondo Beach Blvd.  </P> <P> The women double-parked on the four-lane boulevard to unload the bicycle  Schwartz had ridden to work, Nancy Parkinson said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Chase was driving west. A California Highway Patrol report on the  incident says Chase recognized the danger of the two women standing, shrouded  in fog, in the roadway.  </P> <P> Chase stopped to make a U-turn to warn them but, before he could turn, a car  driven by Eduardo Banda Hernandez passed in the opposite direction, said CHP  spokesman Richard Richards. Just seconds later, Hernandez's swerving car missed  Schwartz but slammed into Parkinson, Richards said.  </P> <P> Parkinson's leg was nearly severed and she stopped breathing. Chase could not  find a pulse. But with the assistance of Wallace, Chase stopped the bleeding  and kept Parkinson alive with CPR until paramedics took her to county  Hrbor-UCLA Medical Center.  </P> <P> Jim Parkinson wrote to Torrance Police Chief Donald Nash in March to say,  "Maggie's life was unquestionably saved by (Officer) Devin Chase's competence  after the accident and for that we are most terribly grateful."  </P> <P> But attorney Robert Kennedy, hired by Jim Parkinson, said he questions what  happened before the accident.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Indications From Report  </P> <P> CHP reports seem to indicate that Chase could have turned more quickly, and  perhaps turned on his warning lights to alert the two women, Kennedy said.  </P> <P> Chase denied that, saying passing cars prevented him from turning. "They  basically say, 'You didn't have a crystal ball, so you screwed up,' " he said.  </P> <P> The claim against the city also says trees lining the boulevard had not been  trimmed, blocking a street light that would have illuminated the road.  </P> <P> Jim Parkinson, a retired petroleum geologist, said he had "some sense of  misgiving" about filing the claim. "But my primary interest is my daughter's  well-being, and she is never going to function like she did before," he said.  </P> <P> Nearly $300,000 of a $1-million health insurance policy for his daughter has  been used up, he said.  </P> <P> Hernandez pleaded no contest to a drunk-driving charge in February. He faced up  to three years in prison, but he failed to appear at his sentencing in March,  and authorities said they believe he has fled to Mexico.  </P> <P> Jim Parkinson said Hernandez had no insurance and that the family does not  think it will be able to collect damages from him. He wonders how he will pay  his daughter's bills when the $1-million coverage runs out.  </P> <P> Nancy Parkinson said she has left her job as an art teacher at Carlsbad High  School to tend to her daughter, who lives at an Escondido rehabilitation  center.  </P></p>

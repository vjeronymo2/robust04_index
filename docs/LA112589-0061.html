			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES: SLAP-HAPPY KIND OF GUY  </P> <P> Did you, actor Larry Romano, repeatedly slap the face of pop sensation Madonna  last Oct. 28?  </P> <P> Romano is guilty as charged, and this offense is documented in "Oh, Father,"  the Platinum One's newest video. He portrays Madonna's whiskey-breath boyfriend  in the clip.  </P> <P> "It took about 10 or 11 takes," says the 25-year-old actor, who was most  recently seen in Sly Stallone's latest flop "Lock Up."  </P> <P> "It took awhile," Romano says, his voice big with the cadence of the Bronx. "I  didn't want to (really whack her), but she told me to, so I ended up doing it  anyhow."  </P> <P> Madonna had spotted Romano in the Stallone film, then again in Interview  magazine and mentioned her interest to a mutual friend. When word got back to  Romano that the Material Girl had expressed admiration, he jumped into his game  plan. All-around player Romano, who is currently working on a screenplay that's  been optioned, also composes the occasional tune.  </P> <P> "Let me get in touch with her because I've got a song," Romano told the friend  they shared.  </P> <P> "So I sent the tape over there to her, and she said, 'Listen, you might be  right for this video. Do you want to do it?' " A few meetings with her, and he  was cast.  </P> <P> Romano was required to time the face-slap with a cymbal hit, and being an  ex-musician evidently helped him.  </P> <P> "Good thing I was a drummer," he says, "it made it a little easier to hit her  on the crash. You know what I'm saying?" DAVID PECCHIA  </P></p>

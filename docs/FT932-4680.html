			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Eastern boost as Oriflame rises 34% A STRONG performance in eastern Europe helped Oriflame International, the direct sales cosmetics group, increase pre-tax profits by 34 per cent to Pounds 11.9m. Sales rose by 29 per cent to Pounds 83.6m in the year to March 31, although the group said trading conditions had been difficult in its traditional Scandinavian and UK markets. However, there were some signs that these economies would improve over the next 12 months, Although earnings per share rose by 30 per cent to 20.4p (15.7p), the final dividend is held at 8p, giving an unchanged gross total of 12p. The group said it had not increased the dividend because it spent Pounds 3.2m on its Dublin production facilities, increased working capital and invested in Norway and Portugal. It was confident that this investment would increase earnings and that dividend growth would resume next year. Mr Robert af Jochnick , chairman, said: 'This has been a highly successful year for Oriflame in most of our markets and in eastern Europe in particular. We have increased our investment in our production facilities and this, coupled with our geographic spread, gives us great potential for further successes in the future.' The group said its manufacturing operations had begun to experience the anticipated economies of scale as a result of the integration of ACO, the Swedish skin care brand which it bought for about Pounds 10m at the end of 1991. ACO products added Pounds 12.1m to sales and made a strong contribution to group profits. The group's 25 per cent stake in Oriflame Eastern Europe and position as primary supplier to that associate continued to bear fruit. Sales to eastern Europe more than doubled to Pounds 6.4m and Oriflame Eastern Europe more than doubled its contribution to pre-tax profits to Pounds 3m. Mail order sales of the Oriflame and Vevay brands in Denmark rose. But after consideration of the contributions from Vevay in France and the UK, the group decided to cease trading in these markets.</p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY LIFE: TODAY'S CHILDREN SHOULD BE SEEN -- AND AT THE VERY LEAST, HEARD  FROM  </P> <P> I hate to sound old-fashioned, but I like to know where my kid is -- all the  time.  </P> <P> I say old-fashioned because, judging by my 12-year-old's friends, it's a pretty  outdated notion.  </P> <P> I'm not sure their parents ever know where they are, how long they're staying  or, indeed, if they plan to come home at all.  </P> <P> Several weeks ago, for example, my son asked if So-and-So (not his real name)  could spend a couple of days with us because his mother was going to be out of  town.  </P> <P> I had no problem with that and expected I would hear from the mother, whom I've  never met, before the date to get whatever particulars were necessary.  </P> <P> This past Friday, So-and-So showed up on his bicycle with a few changes of  clothing in his book bag. His mother had left that morning and would be back  late Sunday, he said.  </P> <P> And, no, he did not know where she was going, other than somewhere out of  state. He was sure she didn't have my phone number because he didn't know it  himself.  </P> <P> Now, I would never leave my son with anyone I didn't know pretty well. And I  certainly would leave a number where I could be reached in an emergency, along  with the name and number of our family doctor and mention of the fact that I  have emergency treatment authorizations on file at two local hospitals.  </P> <P> And at some point during the weekend I would call to make sure everything was  OK.  </P> <P> Well, we never heard a word and I took our guest home Sunday evening to a dark  house, where I reluctantly left him with a promise to call if he needed  anything or if his mother didn't get back.  </P> <P> To be sure, this is an extreme case of the kind of apparent lack of interest I  see all the time, in my neighborhood and elsewhere.  </P> <P> I couldn't count the number of times kids have told me it wasn't necessary to  call their folks to get permission to stay for any reason, from having dinner  to going to a movie.  </P> <P> They're always right, but I make them check anyway, although I'm not sure why.  </P> <P> If you doubt there's any basis for my concern or my belief that the problem is  growing, ask any teacher at just about any grade level about parent  participation -- in anything other than voting against school bonds, that is.  </P> <P> If 20% of the parents come to a school open house, it's considered a good  crowd. And the overwhelming majority of invitations for parent-teacher  conferences go ignored.  </P> <P> "Even warning notes threatening a failing grade -- or even expulsion -- are  often unanswered," one teacher told me. "It terrifies me that these kids are  just being cut loose.  </P> <P> "The simple fact is that many of them are on their own at this age (12) and  sometimes even earlier."  </P> <P> The whole matter reminds me of a shocking discovery made by the late historian  Barbara Tuchman while she was researching what was to become her award-winning  book on the 14th Century.  </P> <P> It struck her at some point that, other than the Christ child, she found  virtually no mention of children in any of the period's art and literature --  other than heirs to a throne -- no portraits, no histories.  </P> <P> One reason, she decided, was that so few children lived to adulthood (which,  incidentally was at about the age of 9) that parents were afraid to get  attached to them.  </P> <P> Another was that the parents were so involved in self-survival that they didn't  pay much attention to children, especially if they weren't directly  contributing to the family larder.  </P> <P> For the most part, kids simply didn't count.  </P> <P> And the point of the book was how closely our society today matches that of the  14th Century -- hence the title, "A Distant Mirror."  </P> <P> When I first read the book several years ago, I found Mrs. Tuchman's thesis a  little far-fetched.  </P> <P> Now I'm not so sure.  </P></p>

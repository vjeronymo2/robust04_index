This reform  must have the objective of giving more flexibility to the wage  formation process in order to reduce labor costs and preserve  competitiveness without large job losses and to proceed with  overdue structural reforms in social security to put fiscal  consolidation permanently back on course. After noting that  Belgium's short-term economic prospects are bleak and that the  country is faced with difficult choices, the OECD observes that  one of the overriding priorities of public authorities must be  to redress public finance. Additional corrective measures are  necessary to reassure investors, eliminate the "snowball effect"  (i.e. the self-sustaining increase in the debt/GDP ratio as a  result of interest payments), put fiscal consolidation back on a  path consistent with the Maastricht targets and start making  room for the increase in social expenditure that population  ageing will likely cause.    These corrective measures will have to center on the social  security system and its growing deficit and all social security  schemes should be reassessed along these lines. The OECD also  recommends:     -  In the context of the federalization of the  country, a reorganization of the public sector to avoid  duplication of work between the different levels of  administration, leading to a reduction in the overall number of  civil servants;    -  Preparation for the pressure on social spending  that demographic trends are likely to cause as the population  ages;    -  More flexibility in wage indexation;    -  Given the extent of  unemployment, positive actions in the form of retraining and job  placement programs, especially for persons over 46 or unemployed  for less than nine months who are not covered by the present  "personal" plan. The OECD notes that the Belgian economy has  entered into a cyclical downturn: Real GDP is likely to fall by  around 1.25 percent this year, more than the EC average. This  downturn in activity is due to external developments, high real  EMS [European Monetary System] interest rates and a  deterioration in international competitiveness as a result of  exchange rate changes in Europe.    Regarding the economic situation in Luxembourg, the OECD  concludes that the outlook is mediocre. Economic growth is  likely to decelerate in 1994 and labor costs are expected to  increase more rapidly than in partner countries. Although the  public finance situation compares extremely well with that of  other European countries, its recent sharp deterioration  illustrates the risks of a continued buoyant expenditure growth  policy in the medium term. The high expenditure growth  reflected the government's ambitious investment programs and the  rapidly growing government wage bill and transfers to the  business and household sector. The 1993 and 1994 budgets  maintain this policy stance. The OECD nevertheless notes that  the cyclical downturn in 1992 and 1993 and the only modest  rebound projected for 1994 could have a sharper negative impact  on revenues than foreseen in the budget, resulting in a serious  downward risk on the government balance for 1994. Lastly, the  OECD recommends building in more flexibility in public  expenditure and gaining better control over it.</p>

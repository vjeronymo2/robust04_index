			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Channel tunnel safety queried Renewed doubts about the safety of the Channel tunnel are raised in the latest edition of the Consumers' Association magazine Which?, out today, Charles Batchelor writes. The study, published on the eve of the official opening of the Pounds 10bn project, questions the failure to separate passengers from their vehicles on the shuttle trains and the failure to use enclosed wagons to carry lorries. It also points out that the increase in distance between cross-passages linking train tunnels with the service tunnel would mean passengers would have to walk further to safety - the original recommendation of 250m was sub-sequently revised to 375m. When the magazine went to press, Eurotunnel, which will run train services through the tunnel, had not yet published details of its safety procedures. On Tuesday Eurotunnel outlined the basis of its risk calculations and measures it has adopted to reduce the dangers of fire, collision and derailment. 'Until we are shown the evidence we cannot be certain that safety is being put before commercial considerations,' the magazine says. Eurotunnel said it had repeatedly given the association the opportunity to inspect its safety procedures but its offer had not been taken up.</p>

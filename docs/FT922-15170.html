			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Shopping for votes The elderly man in the supermarket looked up with a glint in his eye. He nudged his wife, nearly tripping over the shopping trolley. 'Here,' he said, 'come and shake hands with a millionaire.' Obliging as ever, Mr Michael Heseltine marched up, arm outstretched. 'Please support your local candidate, Mr Francis Maude,' said he, whirling on to scour the aisles for another customer. The financial secretary to the Treasury shuffled behind the secretary of state for the environment, barely able to keep pace as the taller man loped ahead, walking yet seeming to run. There is no certain evidence of the trends in public opinion to be gained from such forays into the suburban streets and shopping malls of middle England. The opinion polls do a more comprehensive job than any single individual can. Yet the few titbits I picked up in Nuneaton and Warwickshire North yesterday do suggest two common-sense reasons why the Conservatives appear to be losing the election. First, Labour's resurgence since 1987 is no fluke. The party's modernisation of policies has been accompanied by a modernisation of its vote-getting machinery. Second, Conservatives are fed up with their own party. Stockingford Labour Club, headquarters of the Nuneaton campaign, looks efficient and well-equipped. Its computer link with national HQ in London, actually works: yesterday someone was retrieving policy statements on the economy, industry, and education. Failing that there is always the fax. Canvassers reported in briskly; their story is that the Tories on whose doors they knock register 'disillusionment' with the negative campaign emanating from Conservative Central Office. The Nuneaton Conservative Club feels downtrodden and bedraggled by comparison. It has no computer links; if you want to send a fax, said Mr Lewis Stevens, the candidate, it must go straight to his home. I sat down for a cup of tea. Two strangers came in, anxious to do their bit. They were worried about how things were going and could not bear to watch the TV news because the BBC was so biased against the government. What could they do? Posters were thrust upon them and they were asked: 'Do you think you could find half a dozen people to form a ward committee in your area? We can't' Mr Stevens is the sitting Conservative MP. He has a majority of 5,655, once comfortable enough but now vulnerable. A swing to Labour of 5 1/2 per cent would wipe him out. The national polls say that will happen; so does the local evidence. I walked up the high street with the Labour challenger, Mr Bill Olner. A former Rolls-Royce machinist and ex-mayor, he seemed to be liked by everyone we passed. He led a troika of conservatively dressed middle-aged men in suits, all smiling and handing out leaflets. One of them was his AEU engineering union minder, discreet and patently longing for invisibility. Down the road Mr Maude was canvassing in scruffy corduroy trousers, a Barbour jacket, and worn-out suede shoes. He looked like Labour 1983, a curiosity for a Conservative defending a majority of merely 2,829. 'I feel more comfortable like this,' he explained. Locals spoke about how they expected their MP to be formally or at least neatly attired, as is the modern Labour party. A police constable guarding the approaches while Mr Heseltine was in town unburdened himself. 'Crime has increased fivefold,' he complained, 'but our pay has not. 'The police supported Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1979, but we'll vote against this government now. Do you realise what their flexible rostering will mean . . . ?' An Alf Garnett in a cheap cafe wanted the birch and national service brought back, but said he would vote Labour. His evocation of reactionary wisdom constitutes classic evidence of the way in which long incumbency has trapped the Conservatives. They cannot convincingly attack Labour for being soft on crime, since they have no good explanation of why the rate has risen at so apparently alarming a pace during their own 13 years in office. It is no good trying to explain the unreliability of criminal statistics to people who see their town centre close down at dusk, only to be threatened after dark by gangs of frightening-looking youths. Mr Heseltine was kind enough to give me a lift. His scouring of the country for Tory votes is carried out with little fanfare and no support staff. Only his driver and his wife are in attendance. He will contemplate nothing other than victory. What comfort could I give FT readers who feared the advent of a Labour government? Tell them, the eternal campaigner replied between taking calls on his carphone, that when disaffected Tories among the Liberal Democrats realise they are voting for Labour, they will place their crosses beside Conservative candidates. 'This message will be shouted from the housetops.' I did not need to travel to the West Midlands to hear it, but it sounded almost credible, coming from him.</p>

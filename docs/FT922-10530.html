			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Rise in construction orders played down UK CONSTRUCTION orders rose sharply during the three months to the end of February, according to figures published yesterday by the Environment Department. Construction industry leaders were swift to deny that this indicated that a recovery may have begun. The department said public and private orders placed with contractors rose by 2 per cent compared with the previous quarter and by 12 per cent compared with the corresponding period a year earlier. The Building Employers Confederation, representing 7,000 companies with a combined annual turnover of more than Pounds 30bn, said: 'The increase in new orders is due almost entirely to an exceptional rise in public, non-residential orders in February - which could be due to just one very large contract. 'We see no sign of recovery at this stage and are forecasting a further sharp fall in construction output this year.' According to the department, the value of public non-residential orders, at constant 1985 prices, was 6 per cent higher than in the previous three months and 45 per cent higher than in December, January and February 12 months ago. Public housing orders, including orders placed by housing associations, were 51 per cent and 80 per cent higher respectively. Private commercial orders and private housing orders remained sharply lower than during the corresponding period a year earlier. REDLAND, a building materials group, announced the closure of six brickworks and the loss of some 260 jobs in its first rationalisation move since it took over Steetley earlier this year. Three former Steetley and three Redland British plants will cease production later this year. Five works mothballed by Redland in 1989 will be closed permanently. Travis Perkins falls, Page 25</p>

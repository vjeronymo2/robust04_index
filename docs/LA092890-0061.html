			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Construction Contracts Off: The value of new construction contracts fell 3% in  August from the previous month, reflecting a steep drop in the office building  sector and continued weakness in housing, the F. W. Dodge division of  McGraw-Hill said. The Dodge index, which uses 1982 as its base of 100, fell to  146 in August, compared to July's 150 level. The seasonally adjusted indicator  of future construction activity represents the value of newly started projects  of all kinds.  </P></p>

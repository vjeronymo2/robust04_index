			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Storms paralyse airports in US BIG US airports along the east coast were closed for more than 24 hours by the brutal weekend storm, stranding thousands and creating a nightmare for national and international travel, Reuter reports from New York. The New York area's three main airports - LaGuardia, John F Kennedy and Newark - closed for more than 24 hours on Saturday and yesterday after the worst winter storm of the century pounded the region with hurricane-force winds and up to three feet of snow. Thousands of airline ticket holders, trapped at the airports because of cancelled flights, spent the night sleeping in plastic airport chairs and on carpeted floors. 'The staff was very co-operative, they brought blankets and pillows,' said one stranded passenger at Kennedy airport. 'But that floor has concrete underneath it.' The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airports, said more than 3,400 people were stranded by the storm. 'It was not a good day to be a ticketholder for a flight out of New York City,' said spokeswoman Lynn Tierney. The airports were expected to reopen late yesterday after thousands of connecting flights all over the country and the world were disrupted. Boston's Logan Airport reopened early yesterday but in Washington, Dulles and National airports both remained closed. Philadelphia International Airport reopened early yesterday. In Atlanta, Delta Air Lines said it resumed limited flights yesterday morning from the city's international airport after cancelling 1,000 flights nationwide on Saturday. A spokesman for President Bill Clinton said assessment teams were already calculating the damage and would have a rough national figure in 24 to 48 hours. Presidential spokesman George Stephanopoulos said Florida, hit by some 50 separate tornadoes, was the only state so far to request federal disaster assistance.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / US presses for Pakistan nuclear deal Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state, is due today to start a three-day mission to India and Pakistan aimed mainly at promoting regional nuclear non-proliferation. Mr Talbott, the most senior Clinton administration official to visit south Asia, will be seeking to persuade Pakistan to accept a controversial offer from Washington of 38 F-16 fighters in return for a 'verifiable cap' on its nuclear weapons programme. Mr Talbott will also try to convince Indian officials to drop opposition to the deal, arguing that the threat to India posed by the new jets would be more than outweighed by the benefits of a cap on Pakistan's nuclear programme. Mr Talbott intends to offer India as yet unspecified incentives to cap its own nuclear weapons programme. In each case this would involve halting weapons development and ensuring that work on nuclear power would not benefit a nuclear arms programme. Washington's eventual goal is to arrange international nuclear security talks, possibly including Britain, France, Russia and China, as well as Pakistan, India and the US. But deep mutual hostility between India and Pakistan, combined with suspicion about US motives, could undermine Mr Talbott's prospects. There is also opposition in the US Congress to tying arms sales to nuclear non-proliferation. The administration insists the offer of warplanes in return for a verifiable cap on Pakistan's nuclear programme is a 'one-off deal', born of Pakistan's special circumstances and not the forerunner of other 'guns-for-nukes' transactions. The 38 F-16s were ordered by Pakistan in the late 1980s and paid for. But before they could be delivered, Congress in mid-1990 imposed an arms export ban on Pakistan because of its refusal to abandon its nuclear weapons programme. Washington had had for some time evidence of Pakistan's nuclear capacity, but had refrained from taking action because it saw Pakistan as an ally in the Afghanistan war. Until earlier this year, Washington insisted Pakistan should not only halt its nuclear programme but roll it back, meaning it should dismantle existing bombs. Now the US seems ready to permit Islamabad to keep the bombs it already has. But Pakistani officials still have grave doubts, saying Pakistan will not cap its programme unless India also does and the dispute between the two countries over the troubled region of Kashmir is settled. Islamabad also wants delivery of a further 34 F-16s it has ordered though not yet paid for, plus assurances about future weapons supplies. Meanwhile, India insists nuclear non-proliferation is a global rather than a bilateral issue with Pakistan. Officials point out that Washington sold Pakistan arms in the mid-1980s in return for pledges to refrain from making nuclear bombs and Pakistan made the bombs anyway. They believe the same would happen again. In Washington, Senator Larry Pressler, the main congressional architect of the arms export ban to nuclear-capable countries, said recently he could not understand how supplying aircraft capable of delivering bombs to a country which had nuclear bombs helped slow the arms race.

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee and cocoa futures push higher - Market Report London Commodity Exchange COFFEE and COCOA futures strode higher yesterday afternoon after wavering in the morning. Short-covering helped the May coffee price to a fresh high of Dollars 1,425 a tonne before closing Dollars 30 up at Dollars 1,414. 'With no coffee coming onto the market at the moment, perhaps someone has just decided to buy,' suggested one trader. Cocoa prices were also stronger, but in routine volume. The May position gained Pounds 12 to Pounds 881 while near July rose Pounds 11 to 900 stg. Traders said it was 'trying to consolidate'. Compiled from Reuter</p>

(a) How should the Secretary specify a passing score?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At three of the regional meetings, it was recommended that tests be normed by different populations for students in different educational programs. At two of the regional meetings, it was recommended that test scores be those recommended by test publishers. At one of the regional meetings, it was recommended that test scores should be based on persistence data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) How should ATB test validity for schools with testing centers located on campus be addressed?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This issue was not addressed at any of the regional meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) What criteria should be adopted to determine whether an ATB test is independently administered?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision was only addressed at one of the regional meetings where the consensus was that the current provisions as outlined in the December 12, 1989  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  notice are sufficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. (a) How should the Secretary determine whether a test is independently administered?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The consensus at all four of the regional meetings was that the Secretary should (1) continue to require the test examiner to certify that the test was independently administered, and (2) continue to permit testing centers at a school to administer tests provided that the testing center is separate from the admissions and financial aid process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) What standards should be established for the development, administration, and scoring of examinations?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This issue was only addressed at two of the regional meetings. The consensus at one of the regional meetings was that a test should determine both a student's quantitative and verbal skill levels. The consensus at the other regional meeting was that tests should be reviewed for test biases, such as ethnicity, native language, and disability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. How often must a state submit ATB plans?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At three of the regional meetings, the consensus was that a state should only have to submit a plan once and then be required to resubmit it if the process changed. The consensus at the other regional meeting was that a state should have to submit its plan every 5 years at a minimum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. What factors should the Secretary use to evaluate the effectiveness of a state plan?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The consensus in all of the regional meetings was that the Secretary should consider such factors as retention, graduation and placement rates, and other relevant measures in evaluating the effectiveness of a state plan.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20138 Filed 8&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4000&hyph;01&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Offshore Centres (6): In search of fiscal nomads - The attractions of Andorra, Cyprus, Madeira, Malta, Monaco, San Marino and Trieste investigated by Paul Ham ISLANDS and enclaves on the periphery of Europe are falling over themselves to declare to the world their fiscal neutrality. Madeira, Malta, Cyprus and even - on the edge of a battlefield - Trieste, have declared themselves 'open for offshore business'. These tax havens, or 'offshore financial centres', to use the preferred euphemism, are especially keen on attracting the wallets of the growing numbers of 'high net worth' tax exiles, otherwise known as Perpetual Tourists or Fiscal Nomads. With the exception of Trieste, which wants to use tax shelters as a way of providing cheap finance to eastern Europe, and Campione, which is more a casino, the peripheral havens are targeting their tax-incentives and fiscal holidays primarily at wealthier investors in Europe. So far, they have succeeded mainly in luring expatriates from countries on their doorstep: hence Italian expatriate investors are especially prevalent in Malta, Portuguese and Spanish in Madeira, and Greek investors in Cyprus, for the same reasons that British expatriates comprise a large portion of accountholders in the Channel Islands. But the smaller offshore centres resent the notion that they may be categorised merely as 'pet havens' to a particular European country. Like the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, they want to be 'all things to all tax avoiders'. They want to appeal to the American, South-East Asian as well as to the European investor. The smaller havens want to be seen as finance centres on the grand, international scale. Revenue from offshore finance is expected greatly to increase their public coffers where the sale of Madeira wine, Cypriot olives or Maltese religious icons have failed to do so. On the eve of Europe's 'Single Market', which is expected to introduce 'tax sharing' arrangements between member countries, such offshore centres want to present a saleable service to Europeans burdened by onerous EC taxes: a highly confidential, tax-free environment for investment. Madeira is trying to release itself from the hegemony of Portugal by pushing for new laws giving it greater autonomy. Indeed, Lisbon is expected to approve in the next six months a new law granting Madeira the right to allow the subsidiaries of foreign banks, insurance companies and fund managers to set up on the island. At present, only branches of foreign companies are allowed to operate in Madeira. The change would, according to Leonel Silva, a manager at the Madeira Development Company, greatly increase Madeira's capacity to accept and manage offshore investments. Already, fund managers from the UK and Portugal are 'queuing up' to benefit from the new rule, Mr Silva said. One is Lloyds Fund Management, which wants to launch a new Latin American fund from Madeira. Others include Credit Lyonnais and the leading Portuguese banks, which already have branches on the island but want to launch fund management operations there. Companies outside Madeira are chasing the island's indigenous wealth. Recently, Banco Internacional de Funchal (BANIF) and Midland Montagu reached a joint agreement to distribute a Luxembourg-based umbrella fund, the Midland International Circuit Fund, in Portugal and Madeira. The new ruling will also allow captive insurance companies to set up in Madeira. The island hopes to become a fresh force in the captive market, hitherto dominated by Bermuda and Guernsey. Madeira has four main areas of offshore activity: an offshore financial centre, primarily for corporate clients (such as banks and insurers); a free trade zone; an international financial services centre, for services to wealthy private investors; and an international shipping register. In the Mediterranean, the two fiercest rivals for the offshore investors' pocket are Malta and Cyprus. These 'older' fiscal paradises have a keen eye on European investors and offshore companies, particularly in the UK, Italy, Germany and Scandinavia. Malta has been known to pursue marketing strategies to attract a specific clientele; one such campaign succeeded for several weeks last year in luring two planeloads of Icelandic investors every fortnight. Cyprus and Malta strive to outdo each other in providing an offshore environment which, in fiscal and regulatory terms, balances a laissez-faire attitude to business behaviour with strict confidentiality and virtual tax-freedom. Cypriot tax incentives include: a 4.25 per cent tax on the income of offshore companies (such 'companies' are more often than not receptacles for an individual's private assets); total exemption from income tax for local branches of foreign companies; no withholding tax on dividends; the taxing of foreign employees in Cyprus at half the standard rate; no capital gains tax on the sale or transfer of shares in an offshore company; no estate duty payable on the inheritance of shares in an offshore company; and no import duty on the purchase of cars, office or household equipment for foreign employees. Ralph Shipley, a director of Wardley Cyprus, described Cyprus as 'Europe's best-kept secret . . . Cyprus always promoted itself as a complete offshore centre and not as a tax haven.' The Cyprus parliament is due to introduce two bills this year, the International Trust Bill, which updates existing legislation on trusts arranged by non-resident investors in Cyprus; and a Financial Services Bill, which will give Cyprus the authority to license and supervise financial services companies. The trust legislation has been described by the Central Bank of Cyprus as a copy of UK Trustee Law, where incentives depend on the beneficiary's country of domicile. The Financial Services Bill will seek to maintain ethical standards of business practice and outlaw fraudulent operators. The Cypriots are at pains to emphasise the high standards they are applying. Independent financial advisers have not been admitted since 1987 without a 'Letter of Comfort' from an outside guarantor, prepared to underwrite the firm's operations to protect investors. After 15 years of wooing foreign investors, Cyprus has attracted 20 offshore banking units entitled to tax breaks and customer benefits. Banks, too, are subject to careful vetting; they must be branches or subsidiaries of 'reputable' firms already in existence in another jurisdiction, as must any financial company wanting to set up. Malta, meanwhile, is moving quickly to lure foreign investors away from the traditional expatriate financial centres. After the return to power of Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami's government at the general elections on February 22, the island is resuming the task of forging the biggest offshore financial services centre in the southern Mediterranean. This will involve consolidating its offshore company law and introducing a new law authorising the practice of investment business on the island. The latter means allowing Ucits (undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities - European mutual funds, in short) to be set up in Malta. According to a recently published book, Maltese offshore companies (most of which are individual holding companies) pay no tax if they are 'non-trading'; pay 5 per cent tax if they are 'trading'; pay no death duties on the inheritance of shares; pay no tax on loan interest or dividends; and pay reduced income taxes on earnings of non-Maltese employees in Malta. Malta has regulations: the Offshore Trust Act and the International Business Activities Act, both of 1988, laid down the basic ground rules of the offshore centre. They did this by exempting offshore entities from most of the Common Law domestic tax regime. Malta also has a regulator: the semi-autonomous Malta International Business Authority (MIBA) seeks to ensure the smooth running of the offshore centre. It has moral qualms: again and again Malta's politicians have insisted that keeping the Catholic island clean and respectable is a primary consideration. Edwin Vella, a Maltese tax expert working for the local branch of Price Waterhouse, said that MIBA in conjunction with the financial services sector had the obligation of investigating businesses: 'We must know who they are and why they're setting up here; we have to make sure they're not involved in drugs and the mafia,' he said. What Malta greatly wants is more banks. It has only four local operations: the Mid-Med, the Lombard, the Bank of Valetta and the Investment Finance Bank. For some years now Malta has been advertising itself to the international banking community. A recent 'Executive Summary,'produced by MIBA, promotes Malta with the unquestionable simplicity necessary to appeal to top international bankers: 'Wanted] Banking Institutions'. More than half of Malta's investors are from Italy; the rest are sprinkled around the world, from the US, Asia, west and east Europe, Scandinavia and Australia. 'In common they have a desire to keep their affairs secret,' said Mr Vella, adding cheerfully that a common reason they may put their money into Malta was 'to avoid tax in their home country - that's the reason for the 700-800 holding companies'. Many of these companies hold royalty payments tax-free for companies with industrial patents, wealthy artists, writers and sports stars. Unlike Malta, Cyprus and Madeira, enclaves such as Andorra, Campione and San Marino are not trying to promote themselves as fully-fledged offshore financial centres. They offer 'niche' services, such as property and residence - or exist purely for leisure sports and gambling. Monaco is in a slightly different league, offering banking and investment services to a wealthier clientele of tax exiles; the Monagasque financial centre is less dependent on fiscal nomads and expatriates than on the international untaxed ranks of the supremely rich. * The Use of Offshore Jurisdictions by Nigel Harris &amp; Partners (Longman).</p>

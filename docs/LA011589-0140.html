			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SHOT FIRED ON FREEWAY; DRIVER UNHURT  </P> <P> A tailgating incident between two motorists on the Antelope Valley Freeway  erupted into gunfire Friday night when a motorist shot out the window of  another pickup truck, authorities said.  </P> <P> The targeted driver, Charles Chiaramonte, 27, of Lancaster, was not injured in  the shooting, sheriff's Deputy Chris Wahla said.  </P> <P> Chiaramonte told deputies he was driving north on the Antelope Valley Freeway  near Red Rover Mine Road in the unincorporated Acton area shortly before 8  p.m., when another pickup began tailgating his truck.  </P> <P> When Chiaramonte braked, the driver pulled in front of him and braked sharply,  he said. Chiaramonte eventually tried to pass the pickup, saw the driver raise  his hand and then saw a flash as his door window on the driver's side  shattered, Wahla said.  </P> <P> Deputies traced the license to an address in the Canyon Country area of Santa  Clarita where they arrested William McLaughlin, 19, Wahla said. Deputies failed  to find the gun used in the incident, he said.  </P> <P> McLaughlin was booked at the Antelope Valley sheriff's station on suspicion of  assault with a deadly weapon and released on $12,000 bail.  </P></p>

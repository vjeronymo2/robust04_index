			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Arms export effort defies Scott probe THE PUBLIC scrutiny to which Whitehall officials have been subjected by the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry appears to have little impact on the way the Ministry of Defence promotes British arms exports. Yesterday senior MoD officials promoting a British army and navy equipment exhibition which starts in Aldershot on Monday defended aggressive defence sales promotion in militarily sensitive areas on economic grounds. One official said: 'Defence exports don't make wars, they prevent them.' Civil servants emphasised the need to promote defence exports which accounted for an estimated 110,000 British jobs and defended the need to observe client confidentiality. It was also clear that they remain highly critical of what they perceive is the unjustifiably negative image of government emanating from the Scott inquiry. One senior official said: 'What I resent is the suggestion that the British are conspiratorial, slightly dirty, and underhand.' He added that the French continued to be far more unscrupulous in bending rules. Since the arms-for-Iraq inquiry several MoD officials have been subjected to detailed questioning by Lord Justice Scott and his counsel Miss Presiley Baxendale QC about the extent to which government departments may have circumvented guidelines restricting arms sales. But their careers appear to have remained largely untarnished. One early witness at the Scott inquiry, Mr Christopher Sandars, who helped oversee defence sales in the 1980s, has recently been promoted from a post in the cabinet office to under-secretary of state responsible for defence export policy at the MoD. The Scott inquiry resumes its public hearings after the summer recess on September 13 with evidence being taken from Mr David Gore-Booth, the UK's current ambassador to Saudi Arabia, who was previously under-secretary of state responsible for the Middle East at the Foreign Office. Three former Foreign Office ministers, Mr Timothy Renton, Mr David Mellor and Mr William Waldegrave, are to give evidence in the following week. Lady Thatcher is scheduled for December, prior to Mr John Major's appearance in January.</p>

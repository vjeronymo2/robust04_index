			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Former Israel diplomat and cabinet minister Abba Eban begins work this week on  a four-segment, 4 1/2-hour PBS miniseries called "Israel 1947 to 1988: A  Personal Witness." Presented by New York's WNET, it will begin where Eban's  nine-part series, "Heritage: Civilization and the Jews," ended, with the events  leading to Israeli independence in 1948. "Heritage" was broadcast by PBS three  times and was shown in more than a dozen countries. In Tel Aviv on Monday, Eban  said he will draw on his personal experience to provide commentary on Israel's  political and military history. The first 90-minute segment is slated for  completion by fall. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Pounds 65,000 bonus for Lloyd's chief executive Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's of London, was paid a bonus of Pounds 65,000 last year, partially reflecting his success in bringing down overall costs at the insurance market. Mr Middleton's overall package of Pounds 324,000 was still about Pounds 150,000 less than that paid to Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's. He received Pounds 472,000 according to Lloyd's annual report and accounts, to be published today. Despite pay increases for other senior executives, overall spending on employment costs fell to Pounds 55.29m compared with Pounds 61.93m, with salary and wage costs down to Pounds 42.75m (Pounds 46.72m). Mr Middleton says in the report, however, that Lloyd's has revised its plans to reduce staff numbers from 2,200. They would be cut to 1,800 instead of 1,600 because several initiatives linked to its business plan had not been envisaged when budgets were originally set. Overall spending by the Corporation of Lloyd's, which provides administrative and regulatory services to the market, was reduced by 21.7 per cent to Pounds 119m - Pounds 4m more than the budgeted target. The business plan to increase efficiency and reduce costs was launched a year ago.</p>

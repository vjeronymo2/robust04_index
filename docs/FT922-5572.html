			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Fiat signs Dollars 2bn deal for Polish car plant FIAT Auto yesterday signed a final agreement with Poland which will give the Italian carmaker a 90 per cent share in the Fabryka Samochodow Malolltrazowych (FSM) car plant. The deal, worth some USDollars 2bn, represents the largest foreign investment in the country to date. Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat chairman, flew to Poland for a signing ceremony which closed over a year of negotiations. The deal commits the Italian carmaker to Poland for well into the next century. 'Fiat also becomes a Polish company today after 70 years of co-operation,' said Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the interim finance minister, who signed the agreement for the Polish government. FSM, at Bielsko Biala in southern Poland, was built in the 1970s to produce the Fiat 126 small car under licence from the Italians. Last year Fiat's new Cinquecento model came on stream at the plant's Tychy works. The agreement marks Poland's first investment deal with a big company from the European Community. Poland has an association agreement with the community, under which barriers to trade in industrial goods are to be dismantled by the year 2,000. Yesterday Mr Paolo Cantarella, the head of Fiat Auto, signed an agreement which envisages the formation of Newco in place of FSM, which is to be capitalised at Dollars 200m. Of this, Dollars 180m will come from Fiat. This gives the Italian carmaker 90 per cent of the shares, with 10 per cent retained by the Polish government. Fiat has also agreed to cover Dollars 500m of FSM's foreign currency debts, raised to finance the Cinquecento development. It will also cover Dollars 200m of the plant's obligations to Polish banks and suppliers. Fiat will also have to cover the losses the plant is expected to incur up till 1996.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Francs under pressure THE Belgian and French francs suffered renewed attacks yesterday as financial markets became convinced that the two countries will have to abandon their strong currency policies and cut interest rates, writes Peter John. Both currencies recovered levels towards the end of European trading but this reflected dealers balancing their books ahead of the weekend and pressure is expected to re-emerge next week. Mr Neil Mackinnon, currency analyst with Citibank, said: 'There is an increasing feeling that these economies will have to forget about strong franc policies.' Once again, the Belgian National Bank intervened to support the currency, but this made little impact on strong investor concern over Belgium's forthcoming social pact on wages and employment and the effect that short-term rates of around 10 per cent are having on the economy. The D-Mark was consistently above BFr22 yesterday. It closed at BFr21.99, little changed on its previous close of BFr21.97. French francs were also sold heavily against the D-Mark and hit a new low of FFr3.5480 yesterday.</p>

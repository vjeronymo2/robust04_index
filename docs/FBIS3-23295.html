Four pro-'Arafat  personnel were injured in the clashes, including Major Abu-'Ali,  deputy to the official in charge of military affairs in the  camp, and his wife. The casualties were taken to a hospital in  the camp.    Meanwhile, an explosion was heard in the Khirbat Silm  village  last night when unidentified men hurled a bundle of dynamite  sticks in front of a small mosque. Tension prevailed in the  village in the past two days in the wake of clashes between Amal  Movement members and Hizballah militants after two cars and a  home belonging to Amal members were bombed.</p>

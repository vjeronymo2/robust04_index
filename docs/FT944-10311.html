			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Food lobby welcomes healthy diet guidelines: Report urges eating changes to cut heart disease Food manufacturers broadly welcomed yesterday a report recommending changes in diet to help reduce the UK's level of coronary heart disease, which is among the highest in Europe. Leaks about the report during the summer prompted heavy lobbying by the Food and Drink Federation and some of its members such as Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drink maker, Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar refiner, and United Biscuits. They believed that the report by the cardiovascular review group of the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (Coma) would make detailed dietary recommendations suggesting, for example, cuts in consumption of sweets and biscuits. Yesterday, however, Dr Kenneth Calman, the government's chief medical officer, distanced the government from some of the report's recommendations such as a reduction in salt consumption. He also stressed that the committee's recommendations were only broad guidelines from which people could pick and chose and that the government's own nutrition targets remained unchanged. Mr Michael Mackenzie, director-general of the federation, said: 'We are very pleased that Dr Calman put the Coma report in its proper context. It is up to individual tastes, and you can't have a prescribed diet. We are consumer-led companies and you will see companies adapting to changing demands.' Coma's most controversial recommendation was a one-third reduction in salt consumption. The Salt Manufacturers' Association was 'appalled' by the proposal. Mr William Cortazzi, association chairman, said, 'scientists are extremely polarised' over whether a reduction in salt intake reduces blood pressure, 'you can't live without salt and products taste revolting if they don't have salt'. Dr Calman said salt reduction was not a target of government policy and 'we respect the differences' in scientific opinion. He and other health professionals welcomed, however, the report as a first effort to turn nutritional information into dietary guidelines the public could more easily understand. Dr Mac Armstrong, secretary of the British Medical Association, said: 'What the public really needs is clear, simple guidelines to cut through all the claims and counter claims of the food advertising industry and tell them what they really need to know. The Coma report does exactly that.' A healthier diet would reduce the incidence of heart disease in Britain, said Prof Michael Marmot, Coma chairman. It remained higher than all European countries except Finland, the Republic of Ireland and the countries of central and eastern Europe.</p>

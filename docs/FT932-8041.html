			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Golden opportunities go begging  -Minorco's plans for expansion are thwarted MR Hank Slack does not try to hide his disappointment. As chief executive of Minorco, he was ready to spend about Dollars 1bn cash on two acquisitions aimed at turning his businesses into one of the world's biggest mining groups. But both tantalising prospects slipped from Minorco's grasp. Mr Slack's goal was to transform Minorco, until 1988 a sleepy offshore investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation-De Beers group of South Africa, by reorganising its portfolio, shaking-up or turfing out existing operations and buying new ones. Many analysts suggest, however, that until recently the process has been painfully slow and not particularly impressive. Minorco's market rating said it all: its share price has languished at a 30 to 40 per cent discount to asset values. The two big opportunities would certainly have changed market perceptions. Minorco was offered the chance to join the world-class copper producers when British Petroleum agreed to sell it 49 per cent of the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia for Dollars 240m, plus Dollars 190m to repay loans. But Western Mining, the Australian group which had the majority stake in Olympic Dam, had pre-emptive rights to the BP stake. It kept Minorco in suspense for four months before deciding to exercise those rights. All might not be lost, however. Mr Hugh Morgan, managing director of Western, has invited the Minorco chief to bring a team to look over Olympic Dam. Although Mr Slack says he does not know what Mr Morgan has in mind, analysts jump to the obvious conclusion: that Western might offer Minorco some of the action at Olympic Dam. Minorco's other disappointment was never made public. The group hoped to buy Gold Fields Mining Corporation, which has two gold mines - Chimney Creek in Nevada and Mesquite in California - from Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate. GFMC would have been merged with Minorco's Independence Mining subsidiary, which also operates in Nevada, to become one of North America's top 10 gold producers. Hanson opted instead for an asset swap, handing over GFMC to Santa Fe Pacific in exchange for the US group's coal and aggregate operations. Each set of assets were estimated to be worth about Dollars 500m. Mr Slack says Minorco is still looking for more gold opportunities, but that 'the prices being asked are still very fancy'. Most analysts suggest Minorco paid a 'fancy' price indeed for Independence Mining, which it bought for Dollars 705m from Freeport McMoRan of the US in 1990. There was, however, an important reason. Minorco started down its new strategic road in 1988 by making a Dollars 3.5bn hostile bid for Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK. Minorco owned 29.9 per cent of Gold Fields and acceptances took its holding to more than 50 per cent. However, a New York judge blocked the takeover, citing Minorco's South African ownership and Anglo's liking for cartels. Minorco gave up the Gold Fields battle, leaving the way clear for Hanson. Minorco collected Dollars 1.6bn cash for its Gold Fields shares. However, because of the New York ruling, it apparently had no way of spending it in the US. This proved not to be the case when Minorco was given the go-ahead to buy Independence. Mr Slack admits Independence's financial performance has been disappointing, but cost-cutting is under way. This includes dismantling the Independence board and the consequent streamlining of Minorco's cumbersome US management structure. There has also been a wider management shake-up at Minorco, which effectively had three managing directors: the original 'Young Turks' who persuaded Anglo that Minorco should change its style and mount the offensive against Gold Fields. Now Mr Tony Lea is being recalled to Anglo's headquarters in Johannesburg and Mr Roger Phillimore resigned because he lost the contest for the chief executive's job. These changes, however, have not diminished Minorco's appetite for acquisitions. In the past seven months it has spent about Dollars 337m on four deals: jointly with Anglo it paid Dollars 190m for one-third of the Collahuasi copper project in Chile; on its own account it paid Dollars 66m for a half-share in the Lisheen zinc deposit in Ireland; it paid Pounds 55m (Dollars 84.7m) to buy Steetley Iberia from Redland, and Dollars 90.6m to swap an indirect interest in Johnson Matthey, the UK platinum marketing group, for a 10 per cent direct stake. Steetley, which operates 14 quarries and gravel pits as well as 21 ready-mixed concrete plants in Spain, is being absorbed into Minorco's industrial minerals division, built up in the past two years entirely by Dollars 340m-worth of acquisitions. Minorco bought the Johnson Matthey shareholding from Charter Consolidated, the UK industrial group over which Minorco - and therefore Anglo - has considerable influence via a 36 per cent shareholding. Minorco's (and Anglo's) main interest was always Johnson Matthey. Now that Minorco has a direct shareholding in JM, it has no reason to retain the Charter stake. Some analysts expect Charter to buy its own shares back from Minorco and thus break free from the Anglo-Minorco influence. Mr Slack says it is up to Mr Jeff Herbert, Charter's managing director, to make the running. Minorco will sell Terra, a non-core US subsidiary which produces and distributes agricultural products, but not while today's depressed market persists. Terra, along with the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting company in Canada, was part of the inaptly-named Inspiration Resources, and already in Minorco's pre-1988 portfolio. The Hudbay copper-zinc-nickel business is not world-class and Minorco is having trouble getting it into shape. Minorco now has direct interests in two of the world's three big platinum marketing companies. Apart from 10 per cent of Johnson Matthey it owns 30 per cent of Engelhard in the US. Mr Slack says an important aspect of the deal with Charter is that Minorco now has more flexibility if at any time it wanted to increase its interest in either of these groups. He says Anglo-De Beers still wants to reduce its combined 60 per cent holding in Minorco to more like 50 per cent in the longer term. But not while Minorco's shares are at such a substantial discount to its assets.</p>

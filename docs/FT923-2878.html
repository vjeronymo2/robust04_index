			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: United Friendly advances 23% UNITED FRIENDLY Group, the life and general assurance underwriter, bucked the trend in the insurance sector with pre-tax profits up 23 per cent to Pounds 9.51m in the six months to June 30. Mr George Mack, assistant managing director and financial director, said: 'We are relatively pleased with the results. This is a satisfactory out-turn for the half year.' He attributed the rise in profits to the company's focus on family and individual policies, without exposure to large claims and mortgage indemnities. He said lower life profits were more than compensated for by general business underwriting improvements, mainly as a result of a fall in property claims. General branch underwriting losses were Pounds 1.69m, against Pounds 4.21m, while investment income rose to Pounds 4.52m (Pounds 4.41m). Life business profits fell 3 per cent to Pounds 3.94m, which excludes any profits from special 'reversionary bonuses'. Life and general premiums were up 15 per cent to Pounds 140.1m. That included total life premium income up 15 per cent to Pounds 98.7m and general premiums up 16 per cent to Pounds 41.4m. Motor premiums written rose 75 per cent as a result of higher business volumes and increases in premium rates. The interim dividend is raised to 4.9p (4.2p), payable from earnings of 9.14p (7.22p).</p>

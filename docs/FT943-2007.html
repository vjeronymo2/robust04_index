			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Swissair trims halfway deficit Swissair, the Swiss international airline group, suffered a SFr48m (Dollars 37m) net loss in the first half of 1994, compared with a SFr65m loss in the same period of last year. Fare wars in many markets combined with the strength of the Swiss franc to undermine 'better than expected' growth in traffic and continuing progress in cutting costs. Nevertheless, the group said it was confident of achieving 'a considerably better' net income in the full year. In 1993, net profit tumbled 48 per cent to SFr59m and the group passed its dividend. Revenues were down 3.9 per cent to SFr3bn in the first half and operating profit reached only SFr10m, compared with a SFr1m loss, in spite of a 4.3 per cent cut in operating costs. Operating revenues included SFr47m in gains from aircraft sales compared with SFr85m from this source a year earlier. The group said it had suffered from the high Swiss franc, particularly in Europe where much more of its costs than its revenues are in its home currency. Overall, currency effects knocked more than SFr100m off revenues and SFr50m off operating profits. The Swissair airline itself achieved a 10.3 per cent advance in traffic volume, and its total load factor improved 3.8 points to 66.3 per cent. The airline said its strongest growing markets were Africa and the Asia Pacific region. However, revenues were down 1 per cent. Among subsidiaries, the Balair/CTA charter airline saw a 23 per cent rise in demand but only a 7 per cent gain in revenues.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSINESSMAN WEINBERG DIES, LEAVES $900 MILLION FOR CHARITY  </P> <P> Harry Weinberg, a reclusive millionaire who made a fortune in Baltimore and  Hawaii, has died at age 82, leaving a $900-million charitable trust, one of the  biggest in the country.  </P> <P> Weinberg died Sunday at the Queen's Medical Center after an eight-year battle  with bone cancer.  </P> <P> Last month, Forbes magazine estimated Weinberg's worth at $950 million, ranking  him 70th on its list of the 400 richest Americans.  </P> <P> His family immigrated to Baltimore in 1912 from what was the Austro-Hungarian  empire. Weinberg quit school at 12, worked in his father's auto shop, sold  newspapers on the side and eventually parlayed a series of remarkably  successful business deals into enormous wealth.  </P> <P> He began acquiring land during the Depression, buying 47 properties in downtown  Baltimore alone.  </P> <P> A millionaire by the end of World War II, Weinberg began buying money-losing  private transit companies in Baltimore, Scranton, Pa., Dallas, New York and  Honolulu. He later sold them at enormous profit.  </P> <P> After visiting Honolulu in the early 1950s, he recognized that jet travel would  make Hawaii's tropical islands accessible to middle-class tourists.  </P> <P> He acquired Oahu and Maui properties that form the bulk of the estate and are  now worth hundreds of millions of dollars in one of the nation's hottest real  estate markets.  </P> <P> Weinberg moved from Baltimore to Honolulu in 1968, but had already set up a  Baltimore-based foundation for the poor that bears his name and that of his  wife, who died in 1989.  </P> <P> The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation -- which will receive most of his  estate -- will be among the nation's 12 largest, worth at least $900 million  and obligated to spend as much as $45 million a year.  </P> <P> Weinberg left nothing to his son, Morton, according to Shale Stiller, attorney  for the foundation.  </P></p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Media Futures: I've read the future and it spins - Reference works are blooming on CD-Rom but not yet the novel The secondhand bookshop Marks &amp; Co at 84 Charing Cross Road, made famous by a play about its correspondence with the American writer Helene Hanff, is now the Compact Disc Centre. Inside, a sign over a staircase and a glass cabinet with paperbacks of Ms Hanff's works are the only traces of its former occupancy. TV screens showing Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex (Laser Disc version) and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (CD-i version) compete for the browser's attention in that distracting environment common to electronic emporia everywhere. The former bookshop symbolises the fate which jeremiahs insist has overtaken paper-based publishing: classical literary values overrun by barbaric commercialism, battered by a tsunami of electronic products. Changes in sales patterns, new marketplace relationships, and cost-cutting technologies are transforming publishing as the Gatling gun transformed warfare. Computer, telephone, TV, and video appear to be interacting so quickly that even manufacturers are unsure what to produce next. Against this background, the home computer - thanks to Sonic the Hedgehog, the Brooklyn plumber Super Mario, and others - is vying for television's crown as primary home entertainment format. Publishers seeking to broaden their media base have to board the computer bandwagon. CD-Rom is tipped to be tomorrow's dominant publishing medium: compact discs that can store video images, text, and stereo sound. Reference works, atlases, cookbooks, and family health manuals have been quickly adapted during the past few years, becoming staple CD-Rom fare. The 'reader', by clicking a mouse, can explore a vast network of text and moving images. Sales figures suggest that more encyclopedias are now sold on CD-Rom than in book form. Yet the fact is that the wider creative possibilities are so poorly understood that unprecedented creative alliances of artists and technicians will have to be forged before the medium can come of age. A few pioneering entertainment CD-Roms already exist. Peter Gabriel's interactive music CD-Rom Xplora1 led the way, and David Bowie has followed suit recently with Jump, a disc incorporating interview clips, music video, point-and-click elements galore, and even the option to remix a song. The way forward for literature and popular fiction (or hyperfiction) on CD-Rom is much harder to see. Andromeda Interactive's Classic Library contains the complete works of Shakespeare, Chaucer, Jane Austen, Dickens, Poe and Melville, and W. B. Yeats, but such a disc full of words is useful chiefly as a study tool which allows swifter word-searches than paper versions. Real multimedia products are much rarer than text-dumped-to-CD offerings. A notable exception which may be a premonition of future products is HarperCollins-Nimbus' The Bronte Sisters. This CD-Rom includes sketches, poems, essays, diary entries and biographies of the sisters, alongside photos of 60 Bronte museum treasures from the Howarth Parsonage. The reader can summon an image of the desk the sisters wrote at or the bridal veil worn by Charlotte next to diary entries or passages from the novels which relate to those items. A chief obstacle to the CD-Rom and multimedia revolution is that, as an Anglo-American wit has observed, 'Before I can get on to the information superhighway I need to get off my driveway.' Youngsters adapt to the new media at primary school, but many adults are technophobes. The jungle of products and lack of standardisation are bewildering and discouraging. Kanwal Sharma, marketing manager for new media for Apple Computer UK, admits that while CD-Rom and multimedia have been around for two or three years 'the information flow seems to have stopped with the technology producers.' Too few people in local markets own CD-Rom equipment at the moment to make such publishing viable unless on a global scale. The London market's darling, Dorling Kindersley, proves the point. A publisher of high quality illustrated books, with an extensive information-based backlist, Dorling Kindersley has a foreign co-editions network already in place. Without such a network, the market for this technology is too small at present in the UK, or in any single country, for publishers to make a sizeable profit, although consumer adoption of CD-Rom is strongest in North America. It is hard nevertheless to escape the conclusion that if Shakespeare were alive today, he'd be looking for ways to work on CD-Rom. Another point in CD-Rom's favour is that discs can be mass-produced very cheaply. Paper-based production costs are astronomical by comparison. Yet books remain the favoured currency in 1990s publishing, defying their electronic rivals. Here too, there have been enormous changes. Paperback sales now routinely take precedence over hardcover, while wholesalers and retailers increasingly influence what finds its way into print. W. H. Smith, whose stores account for one third of UK fiction sales, is so confident in its knowledge of its consumers' tastes that it has taken the driving seat to steer the publishing process in the direction the company chooses with its Fresh Talent programme, now in its second year. 'The object,' says Graham Edmonds, product manager for paperback fiction, 'is to bring a good deal for new writers'. W. H. Smith asks the main paperback publishers for recommendations, a team of seven people reads manuscripts from suggested authors, and if they are unanimously enthusiastic, the work appears under the Fresh Talent banner. Penguin, Black Swan, Signet, Corgi and Hodder Headline are the participating publishers for 1994. Reports of the death of the book, in brief, are much exaggerated. Paper-based reading may not be the chief hallmark of an intellectually active person much longer, and CD-Rom will find its Shakespeare sooner or later, but it is certainly too soon to be consigning the work of Helene Hanff to glass cabinets.</p>

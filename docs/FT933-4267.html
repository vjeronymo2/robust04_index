			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: European spice units in plan for new venture THE European herb and spice businesses of two US food processing companies and a German herb and spice concern are being combined to create a venture with sales of around Dollars 200m a year. Rabobank, the Dutch bank, will finance the venture, known as European Spice Partners, and take a 25 per cent stake. The deal brings together the European herb and spice operations of McCormick, a Maryland-based specialist in spices and seasonings, and the larger CPC International, a corn refiner and maker of grocery products based in New Jersey whose products include Knorr soups, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Mazola corn oil. Each will own 37.5 per cent of the new joint venture, with the remaining shares held by Rabobank. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. The new company would account for around 15 per cent of the Dollars 1.4bn European market for retail and catering herbs, the companies said. The two US companies' other European operations, including those in 'industrial' herbs and spices (those sold to food processors or to fast-food companies), will remain separate, although both companies said further co-operation in Europe may follow. CPC, which last year generated Dollars 2.6bn of its Dollars 6.6bn sales in Europe, said: 'We are bringing the infrastructure and the experience of operating in Europe; McCormick is bringing its experience in the herb and spice business.' The new venture will be based around McCormick's retail and catering herb and spice operations in the UK, Switzerland and Germany. The company also has licensing operations in Finland and Spain. CPC will contribute its own herb and spice business in Germany and Ireland and an unspecified amount of cash. The transaction is subject to approval from the European Commission.</p>

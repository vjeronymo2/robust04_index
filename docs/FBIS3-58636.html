			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Ulrich </F> Rosenbaum; place and date not given: "Scharping: There Will Be  No Cooperation With SED Successor Party"]    [Text] [Rosenbaum] In Lower Saxony, you have just opened  the election campaign for the super election year. Will it be a  year of punches and jabs?    [Scharping] No. The Social Democrats are interested in  advocating their factual positions and in seeking a  confrontation with the government when it arises from the  factual positions.    [Rosenbaum] What are the main topics?    [Scharping] Combating unemployment, new economic growth that  is compatible with the environment, modernizing the economy,  relieving labor of the costs that have nothing to do with  employees, reconstructing the east -- this is the business of  the community as a whole -- the housing shortage, and  eliminating other social injustices.    [Rosenbaum] In view of the new threats from the East --  keyword Zhirinovskiy -- might the voters not finally prefer to  leave the present Federal Government in office?    [Scharping] Why? The Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] is currently the only party that can present a consistent  foreign policy concept, which is completely in the tradition of  the foreign policies of Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt. The  key words are European integration, development of a new  Ostpolitik that also has economic and employment policy  prospects, and, now as before, close friendly relations with the  United States of America. In the field of European integration,  the chancellor's basic policies are supported by the SPD. But  he is becoming increasingly lonely in his own party. By the  way, however, I cannot imagine that the Bundestag elections will  be very strongly influenced by foreign politics. U.S. President  Bush, who was voted out of office shortly afterward, also  indulged in this illusion.    [Rosenbaum] The CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union] has now agreed on Roman Herzog as  candidate for the president's office. Do you still proceed on  the assumption that the majority of the Free Democratic Party of  Germany [FDP] electors will vote for Rau?    [Scharping] I proceed on the assumption that in the Federal  Assembly there are, independent of party membership, enough  autonomous women and men who will make their decision for  Germany's best benefit. And the best for this office is clearly  Johannes Rau.    [Rosenbaum] Are you pleased that the FDP has postponed a  statement on a coalition to September and will possibly not make  one at all?    [Scharping] At any rate, this shows that the coalition is no  longer internally consistent and the FDP is thinking. However,  my concern for the partners in the coalition is limited and the  FDP has to make its decision itself. I will watch this with  interest.    [Rosenbaum] What about the secret agreement with Joschka  Fischer that a Red-Green coalition is to be formed?    [Scharping] Journalists never report things that are  incorrect. At most, they sometimes make mistakes. As far as  this matter is concerned, I am interested in gaining voters for  the SPD from all other parties.    [Rosenbaum] The CDU/CSU called on you to clearly dissociate  yourself from the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. What  about it?    [Scharping] There will be no cooperation between the SPD and  the PDS. For the Social Democrats, the PDS is not just a normal  political opponent, but the direct successor organization of the  Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED], from which we totally  dissociated ourselves. By the way, the reproach from the ranks  of the CDU/CSU is an absurd reversal of the situation. In  eastern Germany there are several examples of the CDU hoisting  PDS people into public office and, on the other hand, availing  itself of the PDS support to deny public office to the Social  Democratic winners of the Brandenburg election to the advantage  of members of the old bloc parties and old friendships between  the CDU and the PDS. If the exhortations addressed to the  Social Democrats are to be even slightly credible, the CDU would  have to expel people who make common cause with the PDS.    [Rosenbaum] These days its own past is, once again, catching  up with the SPD. I mean the accusations against Wehner [former  chairman of the SPD Bundestag Group]. You could simply say:  Why should this affect me? All that happened long before my  time....    [Scharping] I specifically do not say this. Someone who  bears responsibility for a party does not dissociate himself  from the history of this party. I do not see any reason at all  to rewrite history in any way. Herbert Wehner intensively  advocated the growing together of the Germans, decent  humanitarian conditions, and concrete help. This is of lasting  value. The historians are to examine the rest. However, it is  not a topical political question.    [Rosenbaum] The parties have come to an agreement on the  question of the move of the capital. Will there be peace now  and will the decision in the major round be final?    [Scharping] Yes. I am personally satisfied with the result,  as far as the German Bundestag and compensation for the Bonn  region are concerned. However, I add the following: From my  point of view, the Federal Government can move earlier. It will  take a relatively long time and it absolutely has to be  connected both with the question of costs and the modernization  of the government work itself.    [Rosenbaum] If you were chancellor, would you raise these  questions anew?    [Scharping] Yes, then I would be able to do so because all  these are questions whose organization is controlled by the  Federal Government and the chancellor.</p>

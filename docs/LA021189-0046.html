			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC MIGHT CONSIDER DROPPING BASKETBALL  </P> <P> USC basketball has sunk to the absolute bottom, and no one seems to care. The  fans, students and even the administration all apparently have long ago given  up on the sport. Despite the dismal record this season, only the coach has  questioned the coaching, and everyone seems content to let the team fade into  oblivion.  </P> <P> But the team's lack of success goes beyond coaching, poor talent and fan  support. There has been something fundamentally wrong with the basketball  program at USC for years. Maybe it's something as basic as not having a  legitimate home arena, but if the school's attitude toward the sport is going  to continue, USC should seriously consider dropping intercollegiate basketball  and using the money elsewhere.  </P> <P> WAYNE PETERS  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Also serving as a basis for determining requirements in this rule are the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;3619), title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act, and Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of this rule is to: (1) Promote citizen participation and the development of local priority needs and objectives by providing comprehensive information on the jurisdiction that is easy to understand; (2) coordinate these statutory requirements in such a manner as to minimize the federal intrusion into State and local planning activities and to simplify the process of requesting and obtaining federal funds available to the jurisdictions on a formula basis; (3) promote the development of an action plan that provides a basis for assessing performance; and (4) encourage consultation with public and private agencies, including those outside a single jurisdiction, to identify shared needs and solutions to intra-jurisdictional problems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a jurisdiction qualifies for one formula program but not another, its submission need only satisfy the requirements for the formula program for which it qualifies, as well as the planning requirements based on the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy statute (Cranston-Gonzalez National Housing Affordability Act, or ``NAHA'') to cover other competitively funded programs. If a jurisdiction does not qualify for any of the formula programs but competes for funding under a program that is subject to the CHAS planning requirements of NAHA, it must follow the general provisions of this part, but not those that apply only to other programs. If a jurisdiction does not qualify for the HOPWA formula program but intends to apply for a competitively awarded HOPWA grant, it should satisfy the HOPWA planning requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule is organized into several parts. First, there are the proposed revisions to part 91, which encompasses the new planning/application and reporting submissions. Second, since many of the requirements that are common to the formula programs are combined into part 91, there are proposed revisions to remove those requirements from the individual program regulations. In addition, since this new document is different from the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy, the references to the CHAS found in the program regulations are proposed to be removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 91 is organized into seven subparts. With the exception of jurisdictions that submit an abbreviated consolidated plan, the first two subparts (General, and Citizen Participation and Consultation) and the last subpart (Other General Requirements) apply to all jurisdictions. Local governments that are not part of a HOME consortium are covered by their own subpart (subpart C). States also are covered by their own subpart (D). Local governments that are part of a consortium are covered by both the local government subpart and the consortium subpart (E). The subpart for insular areas has been reserved. Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and Palau are eligible to receive program funds. However, only Palau is required by NAHA to submit a CHAS because it is included in the definition of ``jurisdiction.'' The other entities are defined by NAHA as ``insular areas'' and are not required to prepare or submit a CHAS. The Department specifically invites comments on whether to consolidate the program submission requirements (and in the case of Palau, abbreviated CHAS requirements) for Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and Palau. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Department recognizes that there is a need for regulatory provisions dealing with the transition from the current application system to the new consolidated rule. The Department intends to grant an extension of the current CHAS to cover the time period between the end of fiscal year 1994 and the beginning of the jurisdiction's consolidated program year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Findings and Certifications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. Any changes made to the rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file, which is available for public inspection in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh St., SW, Washington, DC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

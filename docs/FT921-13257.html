			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Brooke in talks offer as Major scorns pact - Northern Ireland MR Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, last night revived his political initiative for the province by writing to leaders of the four main parties inviting them to round-table talks. Mr Brooke is believed to have decided that the conditions are right for a fresh attempt at removing the obstacles to formal negotiations on the political future of the province after discussions with all Northern Ireland's leading politicians in recent days. A close ally of Mr Brooke said last night that the upsurge in terrorist violence and hints of a new readiness for talks within the province's political circles meant there was no case for postponing discussions until after a general election. However, it was acknowledged that Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour Party leader, might still have reservations about resuming talks with a general election imminent. The Northern Ireland Office said that no date or venue had been fixed for any meeting with Mr Hume, Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party, Rev Ian Paisley of the Democratic Unionists and Mr James Molyneaux of the Ulster Unionists. Mr Molyneaux and Mr Alderdice have already indicated a readiness to resume discussions. Earlier yesterday Mr John Major, the prime minister, fuelled speculation that he was contemplating a deal with Unionist MPs in a hung parliament when he scorned calls for a pact among the main British parties on preserving the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. Labour and Liberal Democrats expressed fears that the prime minister was prepared to jeopardise progress towards a political settlement. Nevertheless, Downing Street officials rejected such an interpretation of the prime minister's comments, while Tories and the Unionist party have denied that any discussions have taken place. Mr Major was asked by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, if he would support a 'a cross-party approach to Northern Ireland affairs during the election and unequivocally reject any partisan trading with the Anglo-Irish Agreement'. Liberal Democrats, many of whom believe a hung parliament will be the most likely outcome of the forthcoming contest, want to force the other main parties to set out more clearly what post-election deals they might contemplate. Mr Major's reply did not mention the agreement and said only: 'This party stands four-square against terrorism and we have set out our policies clearly . . . on many occasions. I do not see any imminent change.'</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE LIVES: BACKFIRE OF THE VANITIES;  </P> <P> A PRETTY FACE CAN COST AN ARM AND A LEG  </P> <P> NOBODY'S perfect," proclaims a recent cover of Harper's Bazaar. Hope springs  eternal, I think, eager to discover "what to wear if you are too tall, short or  heavy." Ever the slave to beauty, I quell my suspicions that this is another  ruse to sell me something and turn to Page 82, where Aphrodite's secrets will  be revealed.  </P> <P> Fooled again! The imperfections under consideration are those of such  disfigured wretches as Paulina Porizkova (sharply defined bone structure), Kim  Alexis (a thin top lip) and Cheryl Tiegs (too tall). Suddenly, I'm depressed.  If these are flaws, I'm a walking disaster.  </P> <P> But not to worry. A beauty addict can always find some new, revolutionary  beauty fix on the horizon, especially if she's willing to fork over a couple of  months' salary. Women (and men) are no longer paying even lip service to the  concept that beauty comes from within. They now know that beauty comes from  investments in French manicures, shiatsu pedicures, herbal body wraps,  custom-blended makeup in a personalized seasonal palette, $2,500 Chanel suits,  daily workouts with a personal trainer and a few nips and tucks by a plastic  surgeon.  </P> <P> Still, whatever you do is never enough. Recently, for example, I invested the  equivalent of a week's groceries in a facial. For 20 minutes, I lay sweating in  a thick cloud of steam, my skin encrusted with gritty, lime-green pore  cleanser. Then the cosmetician smothered me with a wet towel, covered my eyes  with tea-soaked cotton and began assaulting my cheek with a sharp instrument.  Finally, I lay motionless for half an hour while an enzyme masque removed a  layer of skin.  </P> <P> Afterward, I basked in the satisfaction that one part of my body was under  beauty control -- for a glorious second. Then my beauty policewoman scowled.  "You really should be using our revitalizing neck cream," she warned me.  </P> <P> Neck cream? This was new. So far this year, people have tried to sell me eye  cream, lip cream, day cream, night cream, foot cream, hand cream and breast  cream. Will ear cream be next?  </P> <P> "You can't win," says my sister, Laurie. "You could spend 24 hours a day, seven  days a week on your appearance, and you would still miss some critical beauty  maintenance."  </P> <P> Laurie is right. I religiously go to the gym three times a week. Surrounded by  grunting would-be Mr. Universe manques, I lie upside down on a slant board and  pump ridiculous amounts of weight with my feet. Then I ride the LifeCycle for  half an hour and finish with 20 minutes of stretching.  </P> <P> And I still feel as if I'm shirking. After all, there are people who go from  the LifeRower to the StairMaster to the treadmill to the Versa Climber to the  free weights, and that's not even counting the classes that feature muscle  conditioning with huge rubber bands, six different "impacts" of aerobics,  Aerobic Slimnastics, Jazzercise and yoga.  </P> <P> "I don't do gyms," scoffs Laurie, who believes that I'm beauty-obsessed. "I  don't need a personal trainer. I have a dog. I pick her up occasionally. She  weighs 42 pounds; that's as close as I get to Nautilus. I run her around the  block a few times. She goes one way; I go another. It's resistance."  </P> <P> Sometimes, I can't believe that we were raised by the same mother. My beauty  addiction began in the womb. "When I went to the hospital to have you, I wore  an exquisite nightgown and a matching peignoir," my mother recalls. "And I had  beautiful white mules with high heels and little bows, and, of course, my hair  was all fixed. I looked like I had stepped out of a magazine. I went into the  labor room, and the nurse said, 'Where do you think you're going in that? It's  see-through.' "  </P> <P> "When Mom had me, she went into labor at the Dairy Queen," Laurie says. "That's  the difference."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, my sister recently jumped at a chance to be the model for a  beauty makeover for a women's magazine. "It was a nightmare," she says. "I went  in looking about as bad as I could. I rolled out of bed. I didn't brush my  hair, which is not that unusual. I hadn't slept in a week. I thought I looked  plenty bad enough, but they wanted to make sure that the circles under my eyes  really showed, so they darkened them in for the 'before' picture."  </P> <P> Next, they photographed her in the same complexion-dissolving light that's  usually found in department-store dressing rooms. As for the "after" picture:  "I spent an entire day having people fuss over me so I looked perfect," Laurie  laments. "I was in the beauty shop for five hours."  </P> <P> The bottom line? "I did find out that, with enough makeup, I could look like an  anchorwoman," she says. She estimates that it would cost her $300 a month, plus  an additional 10 hours a week, to duplicate this look. "Of course, if I were an  anchorwoman, it would be worth it," Laurie says. "And I could afford it."  </P> <P> Curiously, many people believe that they can't afford not to look like an  anchorperson. More curiously, not all of these people are women. The other day,  I ran into my friend Jeff at the hairdresser's. He was smocking up for a  conditioning shampoo and trim. "Your looks are something you have to maintain  in this society," says Jeff, who spends his working day locked in an editing  room with a Moviola. "I have an advantage over people who are less  good-looking, so I work to keep the advantage."  </P> <P> Where does he draw the line? "I know guys who go to a tanning salon, and I  think that's over the top," he says. "I don't get my nails done or get facials.  I don't see the need. That seems more like a luxury than a requirement for  beauty. If I was on vacation in a spa or a resort and that service was offered,  I might indulge. But I think plastic surgery is obscene."  </P> <P> My friend Doug disagrees. "I'd have a face lift in a minute," he says. "If my  jowls were sinking, I'd go to Beverly Hills and have it taken care of." Why? "I  feel that I look better when I look younger," he says. "And when I feel better  about myself, I'm more creative. I don't want to turn it into a business  decision, but it's that important."  </P> <P> "I think I'd try just about anything," says my friend Katie, who is about to  give up on her regimen of mail-order cactus moisturizers and drive to Tijuana  to buy Retin-A over the counter. "I don't draw any lines. The object is to get  rid of the lines." Katie does confess that she prefers to avoid anything that  causes pain, unless she is knocked out.  </P> <P> Speaking of being knocked out . . . A few months ago, my beauty bibles reported  that au courant eyes would be shadowed and lined in rich shades of purple. So I  made my semiannual pilgrimage to the cosmetics counter. There, a lacquered  makeup artist expertly smudged my eyelids with a palette of dusty, smoky and  downright dirty plums.  </P> <P> "See how natural this looks," she gushed, as she coated my lashes with navy  blue mascara. "It really brings out your eyes." It also brought out my  checkbook. Forty-five dollars later, clutching a small bag filled with two tiny  boxes (I didn't spend enough to rate the free gift), I left the store. Shortly  thereafter, I ran into a friend. "Are you and your husband getting along?" my  friend asked.  </P> <P> "Of course," I said, widening my perfectly shadowed eyes. She seemed  unconvinced. So did the next person I ran into. And the next. I couldn't  understand why everyone kept asking about the state of my marriage. Then I  returned home.  </P> <P> "Were you in an accident?" my husband asked. I shook my head. "Don't tell me  you got into a fight," Duke said. I shook my head again. "Then where did you  get the black eye?"  </P> <P> Fooled again!  </P></p>

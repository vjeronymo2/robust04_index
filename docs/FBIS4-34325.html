			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Raquel Pineda] </F>   [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican private  sector will purchase Cuba's debt with Mexico through the  issuance of "swaps," Enrique Vilatela, director of the National  Foreign Trade Bank (Bancomext), said here today.    In an interview, Vilatela explained that the negotiation  would take place through the issuance of swaps (debt bonds) so  that Mexican businessmen can purchase Cuban enterprises' assets.  The Bancomext director, who is accompanying Mexican President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari during his state visit, said the  solution to the island's debt with Mexico will be through  refinancing the debt. He pointed out that the appropriate  institutions in both countries must reach an agreement on  refinancing the debt and bond issuance.    Up until the end of 1993, Cuba's debt with Mexico was $313.4  million, of which $192.7 million was already overdue. The Cuban  debt was refinanced in 1982, 1986, 1989, and 1991, which was the  last time. The last refinancing of the debt was declared  unfulfilled six months later because of Cuba's economic problems  and because the mechanism that was established refinanced the  debt for only four years.    Luis German Carcoba, president of the Mexican Business  Coordinating Council, confirmed the decision to invest in Cuba  and added that textile and soft drink projects, among others,  are already being implemented. Carcoba, who is also  accompanying the Mexican president on his six-hour tour to this  nation, said, however, that in the meeting held by the  presidents and the trade delegations of Mexico and Cuba, no  specific agreements are expected.    The Mexican businesses that plan to make investments in Cuba  are Grupo Infra de Gases y Equipos, Industrias Unidas de  Telefonia de Larga Distancia, and Buffete Industrial, with  modernization projects for 20 hotels in this city.    Also participating were Cemex, which has a cement plant  here;  Domeq, which will negotiate the importation of Cuban rum to  Mexico; Telecomunicaciones Internacionales de Mexico, founder of  Cubacel; Incorporacion Internacional Comercial, which exports  Mexican beer; and Grupo Dsc, which is a hotel business.</p>

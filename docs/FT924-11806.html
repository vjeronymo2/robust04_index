			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Dyno Industrier down as explosive sales decline DYNO INDUSTRIER, the Norwegian chemicals group, suffered a decline in nine-month pre-tax profits to NKr133m (Dollars 13m) from NKr173m last year. The group also announced the transfer of Scandinavian dynamite production to Norway, which means it will cut 100 jobs from Nitro Nobel 650-strong Swedish workforce. Dyno said local dynamite sales had fallen sharply in the past five years. Nine-month sales fell by NKr259m to NKr5.57bn as operating profit slipped to NKr315m from NKr320m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, April 24 (XINHUA) -- Jordanian Prime Minister  Abd al-Salam al-Majali today met with Wang Zhaoguo, vice  chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (CPPCC) on the ongoing Middle East peace process.    Wang, who arrived here today with a 10-member CPPCC  delegation on a four-day visit to the Kingdom, reiterated  China's support for Jordan's position for a peaceful solution to  the Middle East problem.    "The Chinese Government has consistently advocated a  peaceful  solution to the Middle East issue on the basis of relevant U.N.  Resolutions," he said.    Wang said that as one of the U.N. Security Council members,  China will continue to make efforts for a peaceful solution to  the Arab- Israeli conflict so as to realize peace in the region  as early as possible.    For the difficulties Jordan is facing, Wang said, China  expressed its understanding and sympathy. China supports  Jordan's rational demands, he added.    Wang, who came here at the invitation of Ahmed al-Lawzi,  speaker of Jordan's senate, also introduced to the hosts the  achievements China has gained in the reform and economic  construction over the past 15 years.    On his part, al-Majali said Jordan has suffered a great deal  in its effort to realize peace in the Middle East.    The prime minister asked China to exert its influence for a  peaceful solution to the Middle East problem. He also called on  the U.N. to shoulder the responsibility of implementing relevant  U.N. resolutions, especially Resolutions 242 and 338, on the  Middle East issue.    Earlier today, Wang met with al-Lawzi and discussed with him  the Middle East peace process and bilateral relations.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not bottom of league Sir, Your report, 'Fifth of UK companies expecting to relocate' (August 30), stated that a recent survey by Black Horse Relocation placed Sunderland second bottom in a league table of 40 best cities for relocation. We are, of course, all aware of the limitations of statistics - I could produce a survey by an equally reputable organisation which places this area at the top of the league for attracting inward investors. Perhaps the difference between the two surveys is that Black Horse spoke only to UK companies. Could it be that UK businessmen are stuck with out-of-date preconceptions about the north east? Foreign investors come to the north east with an open mind and what they find is ideal sites, superb workers and substantial help and encouragement from a range of regional agencies and local authorities. In the last decade Sunderland has attracted one of the UK's largest concentrations of Japanese and US companies and, as 'seals of approval' go, I don't think you can say fairer than that. In the last 15 months TRW, the American components company, Lucas, the British electronics company, and Goldstar, the South Korean electronics giant, have all voted with their feet by moving into the city - creating more than 1,200 jobs between them. The Bristol-based company, The Insurance Service, has also just chosen to open in Sunderland and it plans to create another 300 jobs over the next three years (ironically Bristol was top of the Black Horse survey). I hope it is now clear for all to see that Sunderland is the choice of several of the world's leading companies who are capable of judging for themselves without the burden of outdated prejudices.

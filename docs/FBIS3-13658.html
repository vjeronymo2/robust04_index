			<p>Language: <F P=105>Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mr. Mohammadi, spokesman of our country's Foreign  Ministry, has expressed profound dismay about remarks made by an  official of the Saudi Arabian Government, adding that the  official's remarks were hypocritical and in contravention of  Islamic customs.    Mr. Mohammadi has stressed: The Islamic Republic of Iran is  cohesively supporting the expansion of good relations and  peaceful coexistence with Islamic countries such as Saudi  Arabia. However, this trend cannot be one-sided. What must be  viewed as a reality is the presence of contradictions and  ambiguities in the behavior of the Saudi statesmen; a behaviour  for which one cannot find any justification except the  intervention of the foreigners.    The Islamic Reublic of Iran fully supports the  implementation  of the agreement between the foreign ministers of both countries  reached in Oman after the conclusion of the 17th session of the  meeting between the Islamic countries' foreign ministers. On  the basis of the same agreement, the Islamic Republic of Iran  has proposed negotiations between high-ranking delegations from  both countries, with the aim of making the implementation of the  agreement possible during this year's Hajj. So far, however,  Iran has unfortunately faced contradictory postures and  procrastinations from the other side. This constitutes a fact  which is denied in the remarks made by the Saudi official.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT STING USED AGAINST WASHINGTON'S MAYOR BARRY  </P> <P> As a former journalist for The Guardian (Manchester, England) I am taken aback  by the cheapening of traditional media standards in this country. I refer in  particular to the nationwide publication of the Barry videotape, surely a porno  show free to everyone including the school kiddies.  </P> <P> Even The Times' editorial "Can't Do Business Without Customers" (July 2) didn't  really need an accompanying replay picture of the mayor smoking crack in his  shirt sleeves.  </P> <P> This kind of journalism raises the question, "Isn't it in violation of the law  when a case is before the court to allow all this public comment with  illustrations?"  </P> <P> If the FBI needs evidence to prove Barry's guilt, they've got it. They don't  need to flaunt it and make it a press handout.  </P> <P> SOPHIA WYATT  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

At a dinner in honor in Ankara,  Weizman also sent condolences to al-Asad on the death of his son.    [Begin Weizman recording, broadcast in progress] ....to send  my condolences to President al-Asad for the loss of his son. I  hope that he will continue to lead his country on the road to  peace. I believe that President al-Asad, when he says Syria  made a strategic decision for peace, I believe in his sincerity  and integrity. He is a man of honor, but he has to understand  that in peace, like in war, one has to recognize the mentality  of one's counterpart. It seems to me that in Geneva, he failed  to understand the expectations of public opinion in Israel. I  do hope that in the near future he will make a bold decision and  meet Israelis, meet the prime minister, meet the foreign  minister, talk to them, understand them, and know the spirit of  the country.

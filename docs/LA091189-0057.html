			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 5 ARRESTED IN MELEE AT GAY FESTIVAL IN SANTA ANA  </P> <P> Five people were arrested Sunday when a fist-swinging brawl broke out among  more than 50 militant gays and fundamentalist Christians at Orange County's  first gay pride festival in Santa Ana's Centennial Regional Park.  </P> <P> About 75 riot-equipped police from four different departments were called in to  quell the disturbance, but no serious injuries were reported as the two-day  festival concluded Sunday evening. The five people arrested -- all believed to  be members of gay rights groups -- were taken to the Santa Ana police station  where they were to be cited for interfering with police and released. Their  names were not released.  </P> <P> Wearing riot helmets and swinging batons, police had to keep separating the two  sides, which continued to taunt each other for nearly an hour, until enough  officers arrived to maintain control.  </P> <P> Police ordered organizers of the Orange County Cultural Pride Festival to lock  the gates to the festival grounds for a half hour after the brawl and  considered shutting the event down early. Police finally decided to let it  continue as scheduled for the rest of the day.  </P> <P> About 10,000 people were on the festival grounds Sunday and were watching and  applauding a gay pride parade when the violence broke out.  </P> <P> Several witnesses said about 75 gays, some of them members of the militant gay  groups Act Up Los Angeles and the Orange County Visibility League, encircled  about 20 to 25 fundamentalists about 1:30 p.m. on a grassy knoll at an entrance  to the park.  </P> <P> The gays began chanting, "Kiss, kiss, kiss," and several pairs began kissing  each other. Several of the fundamentalists, clearly outnumbered, tried to  retreat as they yelled, "Repent! Repent!"  </P> <P> "It was scary. All of a sudden the homosexuals surrounded us and began doing  stuff to provoke us," said Forrest Ricker, a 60-year-old fundamentalist from  Orange. "I held up my two Bibles and asked God to forgive them."  </P> <P> A moment later, Ricker said, police wrestled two of the gays to the ground,  pinning them to the asphalt with their batons.  </P> <P> "For several minutes, chaos broke out," he said. "I just turned and hustled out  of there."  </P> <P> Robert F. Gentry, mayor of Laguna Beach and one of Orange County's most visible  gay politicians, said the clash resulted when "emotions boiled over" on the  part of gays tired of what he called constant verbal harassment.  </P> <P> "And when you constantly hear voices calling you names, calling you a sinner  and worse, you reach a breaking point," said Gentry, who was watching the  parade and estimated that he was several hundred feet from the violence.  </P> <P> Soon after the initial clash, witnesses said, other gays standing nearby in a  growing crowd of about 200 people began pushing the fundamentalists out of the  park. The two sides called one another names and swung at each other with  fists, prompting police to rush back in again. Two men were arrested, witnesses  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fundamentalists Regroup  </P> <P> The fundamentalists at that point left the park, regrouping in a residential  neighborhood, witnesses said. Police reinforcements, meanwhile, began arriving  from surrounding jurisdictions, including Costa Mesa, Irvine, Newport Beach and  Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> The police, about 75 by this time and wearing helmets and rubber gloves, formed  a line along one side of the park and began moving in with billy clubs, forcing  a crowd that had grown to about 500 people back toward the gay festival  entrance in the middle of the park, witnesses said. Police made three more  arrests.  </P> <P> Many of the bystanders ran back inside the festival, some crying. With emotions  running high and some gays shouting at police, "You're taking away our civil  rights," Janet Avery, president of Orange County Cultural Pride, took the stage  and pleaded for calm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Our Day in the Sun'  </P> <P> "We came here to celebrate," Avery said, as the crowd quieted. "If you have a  friend who is not here to celebrate, please get them in the mood. This is our  day in the sun."  </P> <P> Glenn Benjamin, a north Orange County fundamentalist who carried a sign that  read, "Jesus Saves," blamed the gays for the confrontation.  </P> <P> "Why did they have to go that far?" an angry Benjamin asked. "They have the  park. They got their way. We were within our rights. I hope they burn in hell."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Steven R. Churm and Times photographer Gail Fisher  contributed to this report.  </P></p>

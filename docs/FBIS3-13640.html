			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Faruq Amin, commander of the Palestinian police  force designated to operate in the territories, said that the  decision to deploy Palestinian policemen in Hebron must have the  PLO's agreement, and calls for a separate agreement on that with  Israel.    This view is shared by (Umayah) Tahbub, Hebron's former  deputy police commander. Our correspondent Moti Amir notes that  the two served in the Israel Police in the territories and  resigned early in the intifadah, and now guard Faysal  al-Husayni. They said that the proposal has not yet reached the  PLO leadership in Tunis and that the Palestinians will not agree  to deploy the policemen if they remain under Israeli command.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 17 March  carries  a live telephone interview with Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, a member of  the Palestinian advisory council, by Itay Engel and Mikhal  Gazit, on the same issue. Abu-Zayyad thinks "the proposal can  serve as a basis for trying to reach a wording acceptable to  both sides, but to deploy the Palestinian police force which  existed prior to the intifadah and say that it means the  Palestinians are responsible for their own defense will not  work."]    Hebron's Jewish settlers are furious about the reports that  the government will consider the deployment of Palestinian  policemen in Hebron. They said such a move would lead to  continued bloodshed in the area. A member of the Mate Binyamin  Regional Council told our correspondent Gil Litman that the  names of many officers and soldiers in the military reserve are  listed in their offices and if Palestinian policemen come to  Hebron they will be recruited to defend Hebron against these  policemen.</p>

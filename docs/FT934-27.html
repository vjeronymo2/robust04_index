			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The Christmas and New Year holidays are having their usual effect on the market. No wool sales are held, and at the same time most firms in the main wool using countries are closed not only for production but also for trading purposes, with only skeleton staffs nominally available. Since the market itself closed before Christmas with prices either barely steady or only hesitantly firmer, buying incentives are in any case limited. Only with certain British wool categories was there a definite price rise, and this was due to a very small number of firms competing to fill special needs. As for the market, when it does revive after the holiday, wait and see seems to be the general approach.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special Report"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai is currently on the  second day of his official visit to Cambodia, scheduled for  12-14 January. At the beginning of the visit, certain senior  Cambodian officials, during separate interviews, spoke on  Thai-Cambodian relations in a negative way. In the latest  incident, the spokesman of the Cambodian Information Ministry,  Sieng Lapresse, made an observation to the media on the support  by some Thai military officials for the Khmer Rouge.    On this issue, Rawi Hongpraphat, the deputy director of the  Foreign Ministry's Information Department and deputy ministry  spokesman, said that he did not wish to make a rebuttal, adding  that the prime minister's visit clearly demonstrated Thailand's  stand: that is, Thailand wanted Cambodia to be confident in the  former's attitude toward it, and it wanted to further strengthen  relations with the Cambodian Government.    To date Thailand has displayed its sincerity, Rawi said.  Therefore, he could not understand the reason for the repeated  negative news. If there was anything Cambodia had wanted to  know, it could have made inquiries through the Thai Embassy, as  agreed upon by both sides concerning the dissemination of  information and news conferences.    In any event, the deputy foreign ministry spokesman is  confident that the prime minister's visit will promote a good  climate and provide direction for Thai-Cambodian relations.  This is because support for the Khmer Rouge is not the policy  of the Thai Government or a basis of operations of the Thai  armed forces. If there are allegations about any involvement by  Thai military officials without the knowledge of the armed  forces, it is the duty of the armed forces to investigate.</p>

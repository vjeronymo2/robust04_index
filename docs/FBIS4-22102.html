			<p>BFN     [Text] Security forces are carrying out an intensive  investigation following the discovery near Jerusalem of the body  of a soldier. He was identified as Shahar Simani, age 20, of  Ashqelon. The funeral will take place in Ashqelon this  afternoon. Details from Tzvi Pantanowitz.    [Begin recording] Shahar Simani's body was found in a wadi  near the Arab village of Bayt Hanina, on the northern edges of  Jerusalem. He had been stabbed several times in the back. A  local resident found the body and summoned the police around 2  o'clock yesterday afternoon. Police and its special criminal  investigation unit have been working around the clock to try to  establish what happened. They say that the soldier was killed  some 20 hours before the body was found and that he obviously  struggled fiercely with his captors before he was murdered.    The alarm was given by Simani's girlfriend, a resident of  Moshav Massu'ot Yitzhaq near Ashqelon, yesterday morning. She  said that Simani had telephoned at about 8 PM on Wednesday to  say he was on his way to her from Beersheba after leaving his  base in the south, where he was training to be an officer. It  is thought that he took a bus to the Qastina junction from where  he may have hitchhiked to Massu'ot Yitzhaq, about 10 km away.    Security authorities think he was picked up by hostile  elements. They are puzzled by the fact that the body was dumped  so far away and are considering the possibility he was kidnapped  in a car with Israeli license plates. Security forces have  noted also that although his personal weapon disappeared, his  identity tag and Army identity card were not taken -- moves  common to the actions of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement].  In addition, no terror group has so far claimed responsibility.  The authorities are seeking witnesses who may have seen Simani  getting into a car on Wednesday night.    Prime Minister Rabin last night said that the soldier had  been murdered by the enemies of peace, who were continuing to  strike at Israelis in an attempt to strengthen those in Israel  who were deluding themselves that halting the peace talks would  stop the killing. Continued rule over another people would only  increase terror, Rabin said. With all the pain involved, Israel  would continue to fight extremist terrorism and to negotiate for  peace.    After his murder, Shahar Simani, who was completing an  officer's course, was promoted posthumously to the rank of  second lieutenant. [end recording]</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Borealis advances in third quarter with DKr340m Borealis, the petrochemicals joint venture formed this year between Norway's Statoil and Finland's Neste, forged ahead in the third quarter, reporting operating profits of DKr340m (Dollars 57.6m) and a profit after net financial items of DKr256m in the third quarter. This took operating profit for nine months to DKr330m and pre-tax profit to DKr8m on sales up about 12 per cent to DKr10.3bn. Mr Juha Rantanen, chief executive, said the third quarter brought one of the sharpest improvements in profitability in the industry since 1988. He attributed the improvement to strong demand in Europe, Asia and the US, with an increase in both sales volume and in prices for the group's main products, polyethylene and polypropylene. Third-quarter polypropylene and polyethylene prices in Europe increased by 10 per cent and 20 per cent respectively from the second quarter while sales volume advanced 7 per cent. The strength of demand was attributed to consumer demand and to inventory building by customers. Mr Rantanen said Borealis had secured long- and short-time financing facilities from its core banks. He said, 'We have become fully independent for financing.' Borealis said its forecast for its first full year of operations was positive, with a final quarter which should show an improvement on the third-quarter figures. However, Mr Rantanen said, however, there was still some uncertainty about the durability of the present recovery and continued concern about the fundamental problems of the European petrochemical industry, such as slower long-term demand growth and competitiveness compared to other regions.</p>

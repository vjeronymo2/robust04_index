			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: US buys Vodafone Trading in Vodafone shares was at a more sedate level yesterday after the burst of activity on Monday when Vodafone was one of the heaviest traded stocks on Wall Street. A block of 9.3m shares traded in London at 553 1/2 p, coinciding with a trade of 920,000 ADRs on Wall Street at Dollars 84 3/4 . US investors have been heavy buyers of Vodafone shares in recent months. Yesterday it was announced that US holdings in Vodafone shares, via ADRs held by BNY Nominees, now amount to 253.2m shares, or 25.2 per cent of Vodafone's issued capital, a significant increase on the last revealed US holding. Vodafone shares closed 9 higher at 562p, having touched 564p at one point. Turnover was 2.8m shares. A generally strong oil and gas area was featured by the continued strong demand for the exploration and production sub-sector, where Lasmo again took the honours as the most heavily traded stock. Turnover in Lasmo yesterday reached 6.8m shares, leading many sector observers to take the view that a potential stake-builder has been at work during the past two weeks. During that time turnover in Lasmo has gradually accelerated, building up to the 14m shares traded last Friday. The past seven trading sessions have seen just over 50m Lasmo shares change hands, the equivalent of a 6 per cent-plus stake. After allowing for double counting that would mean a predator could easily have acquired a near disclosable stake in Lasmo. It was significant, said one dealer, that the big rise in turnover in Lasmo coincided with the first hints that the MMC would recommend British Gas divest itself of its gas trading business. One oil sector specialist said yesterday that 'much of the Lasmo stock bought recently had gone in the same direction', triggering the stakebuilding stories. Enterprise Oil, among the FT-SE 100's worst performers this month and badly affected by the resignation recently of Mr John Walmsley, finance director, also made excellent progress, closing 8 higher at 436p after being recommended by Kleinwort Benson and Lehman Brothers. The latter said Enterprise 'should perform well on the back of an exciting exploration programme and better than market dividend growth.' Monument Oil &amp; Gas jumped 2 to 50 1/2 p after well received figures, while Hardy Oil rose 8 1/2 to 157 1/2 p and Goal 3 to 60p. A stock shortage was said to have driven BP 7 higher to 305 1/2 p and Shell 9 1/2 to the good at 660 1/2 p. Standard Chartered was a big casualty in an otherwise firm banks arena, with the shares troubled by a number of bearish and unfounded stories. Dealers said the stock had been hit by nothing more than intermittent bouts of profit-taking - Standard Chartered shares have been among the FT-SE 100's best performing stocks so far this month. A couple of large blocks of Standard shares, said to have been on offer around 910p, were also said to have been overhanging the market and largely dealt with in mid-morning. Standard shares dropped to a day's low point of 915p but later rallied to end a net 18 off at 925p. Turnover was a heavier than usual 2.8m. Barclays Bank, on the other hand, continued to draw strength from last week's news of the appointment from January next year of Mr Martin Taylor as the bank's new chief executive. The shares rose 8 more to 505p on 4.7m traded. Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel bounced 9 to 453p, with dealers saying the shares had been oversold. There was continued speculation that building products and printing group MB-Caradon was about to launch a rights issue to fund its acquisition of RTZ's Pillar subsidiary. The shares shed 2 to 312p. RTZ strengthened 5 to 703p. Graseby, the electronics company, fell 6 to 179p following news of a proposed reduction in final dividend. A buyer of 100,000 shares at 248p drove bid target Logica up 9 to 252p. In buildings, takeover speculation revived in Spring Ram where the shares jumped 2 1/2 to 68 1/2 p. Shares in office equipment company Gestetner improved 7 to 146p, after it announced the appointment of Mr David Thompson as its new chairman. Rank Organisation, at whose Xerox subsidiary Mr Thompson was a director, shed 9 to 761p, on the news. International trading group Inchcape, which has a stake in Gestetner, gained 9 1/2 to 554p. Speculation that aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce will join the prestigious FT-SE 100 at the next meeting of the FT-SE steering committee boosted the stock. The shares finished 4 ahead at 159 1/2 p. Reports that Taiwan may guarantee loans in a bid to save the Pounds 250m regional jets joint venture between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation led to a recovery in the fortunes of BAe's shares. In trade of 2.3m, the shares firmed 3 to 438p. A stock overhang depressed Siebe, leaving the shares trailing 12 to 536p. Engineering group Vickers eased 2 1/2 to 148 1/2 p amid suggestions of continued weakness in sales at its Rolls-Royce Motor subsidiary. US buying interest was reported in Unilever, the shares adding 10 to 1070p. There were buyers for Dalgety, which reports figures next month. The shares moved 8 ahead to 498p. A broker's recommendation made on Monday, together with a general feeling that the stock had been left behind, brought a further improvement in Northern Foods, the shares gaining another 3 to 280p. Sims Food gained 15 to 109p, following an agency cross at 95p. Shares in Euro-Disney bounced 25 to 645p, after the company said the theme park is to remain open this winter. Agency broker James Capel was said to be positive on Thorn EMI. The shares firmed 4 to 981p.</p>

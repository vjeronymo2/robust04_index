			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Boxmore A 23 per cent increase in pre-tax profits was announced by Boxmore International, USM-quoted maker of packaging products, for 1993. On turnover of Pounds 32.6m (Pounds 32.2m) profits improved from Pounds 3.62m to Pounds 4.45m. Mr Harold Ennis, chairman, said severe competitive pressures had prevailed in most of the group's markets and prices either remained stable or fell. The better margins were a result of innovation and improved efficiency, he added. Earnings per share rose to 16p (13.1p). Because of the placing to fund the acquisition of Label Research, a second interim dividend of 2.75p in lieu of a final, was declared in February, making 4p (3.68p) for the year.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / ANC ultimatum on weapons THE African National Congress (ANC) has issued another ultimatum to the South African government, threatening to suspend talks on a post-apartheid constitution unless Pretoria agrees to include spears and sticks in its recent ban on dangerous weapons in public. On Thursday the ANC allowed an earlier ultimatum to expire without action, after reaching outline agreement with the government on measures to halt township violence which has left nearly 10,000 people dead since 1984. These included a ban on all so-called 'traditional weapons', apart from spears and sticks. However it now appears that crisis may have been averted only temporarily. ANC officials said yesterday they were expecting new proposals from Pretoria on the issue within seven days. If these were not satisfactory, the organisation would refuse to participate in talks on the country's political future. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the rival Inkatha Freedom Party, is understood to be insisting that the carrying of spears be permitted as part of Zulu culture. But ANC officials argue that all lethal weapons should be banned to reduce the political temperature in black townships. Meanwhile, signs of dissent emerged within the organisation over the deal agreed two days ago between Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC deputy president, and President FW de Klerk. It included not only the ban on traditional weapons, but agreement to phase out single-sex hostels, which have been at the centre of violence (some single accommodation will remain), and a new code of conduct for police handling crowds in black areas. The New Nation, the ANC's newspaper, branded it a failure.</p>

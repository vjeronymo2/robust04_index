			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AIRPORT SOLUTION  </P> <P> Your editorial ("Lindbergh Needs a Short-Term Fix," Aug. 26) is right on target  in suggesting that making plans to expand Lindbergh Field to 24 million people  would derail the effort to relocate our commercial airport. Nothing derails  faster than a complex political solution effort.  </P> <P> Too many of today's leaders are falling victim to the same old obstacles that  have prevented an airport solution for 40 years. We need some vision in this  city of ours. Although the majority of the City Council voted to expand  Lindbergh, that doesn't change the fact that Lindbergh can't cut it as a 21st  Century airport. No consultant has been able to craft a plan that will  adequately deal with capacity, safety, and noise issues at Lindbergh, because  it cannot be done.  </P> <P> It's time for us to recognize that Sandag's recommendation for a binational  airport is a good one and should be seized upon by our community. Not only can  a binational airport meet the criteria for capacity, safety, and noise  requirements, but it has the potential to help our two countries better deal  with existing border related problems.  </P> <P> We can start to build a solid consensus by demonstrating to the Mexican  government the mutual benefits to be derived by both countries, and reject  short-term agendas of politicians who are currently trying to derail their own  regional council of governments' wishes.  </P> <P> Thanks to you, L.A. Times, for staying on track and trying to convince our  elected officials to do likewise. And thanks also to members of Sandag's  committee who have met with officials in Washington, D.C., and will soon meet  with representatives of Mexico. Thanks for not turning your backs on San Diego  and showing courage and vision in your pursuit of the airport answer. We're  glad you can all see beyond the year 2000.  </P> <P> NANCY PALMTAG  </P> <P> Sandag Technical Site Selection Committee  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVING OLD PASADENA  </P> <P> I was moved by Morris Newman's article, "Old Pasadena Project Is Dogged by  Profits Vs. Preservation" (Aug. 13), on the efforts of Claire Bogaard of  Pasadena Heritage to save historic buildings at Colorado Boulevard and Fair  Oaks Avenue.  </P> <P> I grew up in Altadena and I love the region. That part of Pasadena was part of  my territory. I rode the bus and spent hours delving into Army surplus stores  on Colorado Boulevard and looking at stamps and coins at the Royal Stamp Co.  Years later, I worked in the Pasadena Art Museum (now the Norton Simon).  </P> <P> The approach to development as conveyed in this article is that compromise is  all right as long as it is convenient, but the overriding value is profit. This  attitude (which we are all responsible for) reveals much that is wrong with our  culture.  </P> <P> Common sense tells us how shortsighted such a view can be. Southern California  has long witnessed the obliteration of unique character and continuity provided  by specific places. Perhaps one day we will see the tide turn.  </P> <P> Changes and evolving use are inevitable, but economic development and  preserving of legacies should go hand in hand.  </P> <P> PETER NELSON  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

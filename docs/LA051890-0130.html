			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONGAKER COMES BACK STRONG;  </P> <P> SOFTBALL: AFTER NEARLY QUITTING LAST SUMMER, UCLA PITCHER LEADS BRUINS IN  NATIONAL TITLE HUNT.  </P> <P> UCLA's top-ranked women's softball team will begin its quest for a third  consecutive national championship today at 3:30 p.m. against Northern Iowa in  the first game of a best-of-three series at Sunset Field on campus.  </P> <P> The Bruins (55-6) have won 25 of their last 26 games, the loss coming to  Arizona in the final game of the regular season.  </P> <P> Starting for the Bruins will be senior pitcher Lisa Longaker, who was named  Pacific 10 player of the year for the third time. Longaker was 18-1 with an  earned-run average of 0.47.  </P> <P> "I'm excited to play Northern Iowa," she said. "They are somebody new. We've  always played other teams from Southern California in the first round of the  playoffs, and this way we get to play somebody we haven't seen before."  </P> <P> Longaker was heavily recruited at Mayfair High in Lakewood, and made an  immediate impact with the Bruins. She won her first Pac-10 player-of-the-year  award as a freshman, going 20-5 with 213 strikeouts and an ERA of 0.35.  </P> <P> "We came so close when I was a freshman (losing in the tournament final to  Texas A&amp;M)," she said. "Actually, I think that is what made my sophomore  year so great."  </P> <P> As a sophomore, Longaker was named the national player of the year when she was  31-4 with an ERA of 0.30.  </P> <P> "I would have to say that was my best year because I had so many games, and the  pressure was on because one of our pitchers left school and another got  mono(nucleosis) in midseason," Longaker said. "So the pressure was on and I  reacted."  </P> <P> Although the Bruins won a national championship again when she was a junior,  Longaker struggled for he first time in her college career. She was 18-1, but  her strikeouts slipped to 114, fewer than half her sophomore total.  </P> <P> "I was struggling the whole year," she said. "I think it was a mechanical  problem at first, and then I waited too long and it turned into a mental  problem."  </P> <P> Longaker uses five pitches, her best pitches being a riseball and a fastball  that has been clocked at 65 m.p.h.  </P> <P> According to Sharron Backus, the Bruins' coach, Longaker's strong suit is her  control.  </P> <P> "Lisa has a command of all the pitches," Backus said. "What distinguishes Lisa  is her ability to put any of those five where she wants to."  </P> <P> Longaker, whose father coached softball until last summer, began playing the  game when she was 8. She started pitching when her family moved from Houston to  Lakewood and, on the advice of a friend in the area, Longaker and her father  went to see Ron Lefebvre, a pitching instructor in Anaheim.  </P> <P> "A girl who played for my dad in Houston played for Ron, so when she moved  here, she told us to go see Ron if I wanted to pitch," Longaker said. "My dad  was the one to catch me six days a week, and Ron was the one we went to one or  two days to learn how to throw pitches. He would tell me what I was doing  wrong, and Dad would pick up on it."  </P> <P> Longaker chose not to seek Lefebvre's advice last season when she experienced  trouble, deciding instead to live with it. Disappointed, she also decided to  quit softball after the season.  </P> <P> During the summer, her father, who had retired from coaching, had a change of  heart, got a team together and asked his daughter if she would like to play.  </P> <P> "How do you say no to your father?" she said. "I've never been able to do it."  </P> <P> By the end of the summer, Longaker was pitching well again and shelved the  retirement plans, for this season at least.  </P> <P> "I'm going to retire after this summer," she said. "I'm going to play in the  Olympic (Festival) and an international tournament in Illinois this summer, but  then I'm going to retire."  </P> <P> This season, Longaker pitched 11 shutouts, including a perfect game against  Arizona State. Her only defeat was that 3-2 season-streak-ender against  Arizona.  </P> <P> "They were on fire," Longaker said of the Wildcats. "I would have had to (have)  been extremely on to beat them."  </P> <P> Now the task is to beat Northern Iowa, a team that seemingly has peaked at the  right time. Northern Iowa won the Gateway Collegiate Athletic Conference  tournament after being seeded ninth.  </P> <P> "I'm a little more apprehensive than the kids," Backus said. "Any team that  gets into the (tournament) had to be good to get there."  </P> <P> The series will continue Saturday at 1 p.m. and if a third game is necessary,  it will be played after the first game Saturday.  </P></p>

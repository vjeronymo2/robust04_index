			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> SOVIETS CANCEL 2 REACTORS  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has canceled plans to construct two more reactors at the  stricken Chernobyl nuclear power station and has halted expansion of all  similar plants for safety reasons, the Tass news agency said. The decision was  announced six days before the third anniversary of the accident at Chernobyl,  60 miles north of Kiev in the Ukraine, that killed 31 people in the world's  worst civilian nuclear disaster. Plans to construct two additional reactors at  the facility had been suspended since the explosion of the No. 4 reactor spread  a cloud of radiation over Eastern Europe on April 26, 1986. The No. 4 reactor  is now sealed in concrete. The additions of No. 5 and No. 6 reactors would have  made Chernobyl the biggest atomic energy station in the world.  </P></p>

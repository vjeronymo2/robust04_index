			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NO CARL'S JR AT CSUN  </P> <P> Congratulations to CSUN! At long last, an institution of higher learning  practices what it preaches and sets a good example by not allowing Carl's Jr on  campus.  </P> <P> Students are taught to be open-minded, to thoroughly analyze situations before  making decisions and choices, and not to discriminate on the basis of race,  sex, religion, culture, etc.  </P> <P> Carl Karcher and his foundation exemplify the extreme opposite. A national  survey (Haile, 1990) identified Carl Karcher Enterprises as one of the nine  worst companies to work for, due to its discrimination against employees based  on gender, race, etc.  </P> <P> And don't believe the standard Karcher corporate reply: "What Mr. Karcher does  with his own money is his business, not Carl's Jr's." Corporations set up  tax-dodge foundations all the time; Karcher is president of the Karcher  Foundation as well as chairman of the Karcher Enterprises board. Thus, he bears  the ultimate responsibility for both.  </P> <P> It can be difficult to do the right thing by our youth when money is involved.  Rental of an on-campus site by Carl's would have generated income for CSUN, but  given its students the wrong message.  </P> <P> Recently, my co-ed Explorer Scout post approached several foundations for  financial help with travel to Washington to accept a conservation award as one  of President Bush's "Points of Light." After discussing the foundations, our  youth officers decided NOT to ask the Karchers for help because "Exploring  stands for good citizenship, respect for the basic rights of others and  non-discrimination; to request help from a foundation which does not stand for  those ideals would be morally wrong."  </P> <P> Hurrah for my Explorer youth and for CSUN. CSUN's decision to ban Carl's from  campus is not a rein on freedom, but a clear message that CSUN values citizens'  rights, beliefs and anti-discrimination. I respect CSUN and am proud that my  son is a CSUN freshman.  </P> <P> Anyone who wishes to support Karcher's policies can eat at the Carl's Jr one  block west of campus.  </P> <P> MARLENE M.

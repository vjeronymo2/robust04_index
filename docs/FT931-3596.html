			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Arts: Parisian cathedral of culture - Architecture I do not often sit down to a candlelit dinner in a French cathedral but last week I had the opportunity, between mouthfuls of lamb and couscous, to study the Romanesque sculptures of the cathedral of St Lazare at Autun. At the same time I was able to contemplate the outstanding 12th-century carvings of the tympanum of the Vision of the Apocalypse at the abbey church of Moissac; and I scarcely had to turn my head to see the remarkable relationship between architecture and sculpture at the basilica of St Madeleine at Vezelay. Within reach of my table were the slender sculptures from Chartres as well as columns, capitals, chancels and Carolingian conceits from all over France. I was, of course, in a cathedral of culture, at an elegant Parisian event to mark the re-opening of the Musee National des Monuments Francais at the Palais de Chaillot. The story of this museum goes back to the 1880s when the architect Eugene-Emanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814-1879) had the idea that the French public should have the chance to see, in Paris, the high points of French architecture and sculpture of the Middle Ages. He put together this remarkable assembly of cast copies of important elements of buildings in what was then the new Palais du Trocadero, which had originally been designed by the architect Davioud for the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1878. The display was always intended to be didactic, offering the visitor the opportunity to make comparative analyses of stylistic developments. Viollet-le-Duc was a scholar and historian and his architectural activity consisted principally of repair and restoration, including work on monuments including Notre Dame and the Sainte Chapelle in Paris. He wrote a dictionary of French architecture and this museum is an effective monument to his conviction that architects can and should learn from the past. He saw the parallels between Gothic structures and the development of 19th-century engineering. As the original progenitor of the museum, Viollet-le-Duc would have approved of the way it has suddenly taken on a new lease of life. The original Trocadero was transformed in 1937 by the architect Carlu into the Palais de Chaillot, as the centrepiece of the Paris Universal Exposition of that year. Today these former exhibition buildings gather around the steps and stylish fountains of the Trocadero, paying homage to the Eiffel Tower. They remain resolutely of the 1930s and provide an extraordinary contrast to the architectural collections housed there. For a long time the casts have been seen as little more than dusty relics, stranded in the 1930s splendour of the Chaillot. It has taken the dramatic energy of Mr Jack Lang and his ministry of education and culture to see the potential of this important museum. It has also taken an enormous amount of work and inspiration from the young curator  - Mr Guy Cogeval, who came here from the Louvre; in only six months he has achieved a considerable transformation. It begins in the new entrance hall which has been designed by a young architect, Jean-Christophe Denise. This is a handsome light space in the spirit of Carlu. It has a most stylish cafe-restaurant with a marvellous view of the fountains of the Trocadero and the Eiffel Tower (the furniture is based on Carlu's original art deco designs); there is also a new bookshop. The clean lines of this hall provide a cool setting for the four giant fragments of the reproduction of the sculpture - 'la danse de Carpeaux' - originally created by Paul Landowski in 1931. These look dramatic and surreal, mounted at a high level on large plinths. The hall is accessible to all visitors to the museums in the Palais de Chaillot, including those of the theatre and cinema. (The Musee du Cinema is likely to enjoy a close relationship with the renovated Musee national des Monuments Francais because of Mr Cogeval's great interest in film and his plans to create events that explore both the plastic and the cinematic arts.) To visit the great halls upstairs that house the maquettes, casts and models is a thrilling experience, although in time the displays will probably be reordered and captioned to make them both more instructive and more enjoyable. Mr Cogeval is anxious to make more of the amazing collections of topographical and architectural photographs stored here. They will form part of the large programme of temporary exhibitions. The first exhibition to be held is called 'Marseille a Paris', a version of the very successful exhibition held in Marseilles. Its subject is the city in the 19th century, considering both the physical character of the changing city and the artistic activity within it at the time. A large variety of artefacts ranging from contemporary models and maps to paintings and plans, drawings and sculptures is displayed to convey the commerce and creativity of one entire city at a peak moment of its growth. (The installation here is sometimes inevitably in conflict with the permanent installation of the museum, but in 1994 there will be a full-scale temporary exhibition space.) Marseilles grew and prospered in the 19th century, its artistic flowering as aesthetically mixed as any other city at the time. It is probably right to show the whole range so that comparisons of quality can be made. Relatively unknown history painters are shown as seriously as old masters, and posters and plans rub shoulders with fine drawings. It is a complex and dense exhibition, giving a sense of a city touched by the exoticism of its African trade and yet solidly rooted in the Second Empire in its architecture and monuments. The renewal of this museum in Paris is important for the broadening of our architectural culture. It will take a lot of imagination to build on the solid foundations of the unique collection. The resurrection has just begun, but I am sure Mr Cogeval will ensure that it continues with both scholarship and excitement. It is a museum to watch.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 9 STATE ATTRACTIONS, DELTA JOIN TO LURE VISITORS;  </P> <P> TOURISM: THE AIRLINE WILL GIVE FREE TICKETS TO DISNEYLAND, UNIVERSAL AND OTHER  LOCATIONS TO CERTAIN CALIFORNIA-BOUND FLIERS.  </P> <P> Nine of California's major tourist attractions have joined forces with the  state Department of Commerce and Delta Air Lines in what tourism officials on  Thursday described as an unprecedented campaign to bolster the state's meager  share of tourists from Eastern states.  </P> <P> Tourism industry officials also hope that the campaign -- scheduled to begin  Jan. 1 -- will revive gate receipts that have declined in the past year because  of a nationwide economic slowdown, fear of gangs and the threat of war in the  Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> The state has dedicated $180,000 of its $7-million annual tourism advertising  budget to help promote the "Delta California Dream Vacation" package, in which  the Atlanta-based carrier will offer California-bound passengers free admission  tickets to the state's major tourist attractions under certain conditions.  </P> <P> Disneyland, Universal Studios and the San Diego Zoo are among the tourist  attractions contributing $25,000 each to the advertising campaign, in addition  to providing Delta with admission tickets at a "deep, deep discount," said Jack  Stewart, the Commerce Department's chief deputy director.  </P> <P> The promotional campaign could generate as much as $25 million in additional  tourist spending if Delta reaches its goal of selling 25,000 travel packages to  tourists in the East, Stewart said.  </P> <P> Equally important, he said, Delta's television and newspaper advertising  campaign in major Eastern markets should leave "countless impressions" on  consumers who traditionally have flown or driven to Florida rather than  traveled to California for family vacations.  </P> <P> That kind of exposure is important, tourism experts said, because the state  spends woefully little on out-of-state promotion, and individual tourist  attractions lack the capital to heavily advertise their attractions back East.  </P> <P> "Nobody has ever done anything like this before," Stewart said. "We're going  head-to-head with Florida" for Eastern tourist dollars.  </P> <P> During 1991, Delta will offer the free tickets, which would carry a value of  more than $500 to a family of four, to passengers who book certain round-trip  flights, agree to rent a car and remain in California for at least five days,  Stewart said. The package is available to residents of all states except  California, Nevada and Arizona.  </P> <P> Other tourist attractions participating are the Queen Mary and Spruce Goose,  the San Diego Wild Animal Park, Knotts Berry Farm, Sea World of California,  Marine World Africa USA Theme Park and the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  </P> <P> Industry and state tourism officials have for years known that California ranks  far behind Florida as a destination for Eastern tourists. During 1989, for  example, tourists from states east of the Rocky Mountains accounted for just  25% of the nearly $50 billion of tourism-related spending in California. The  remainder was spent by Californians and residents of 10 Western states.  </P> <P> Delta declined to specify how much it would spend on the campaign, but Stewart  said Delta has agreed to spend "a figure that is between $3 million and $5  million" on the promotion and the purchase of admission tickets.  </P> <P> Delta outbid United Airlines, American Airlines and USAir for the right to the  California vacation promotion, Stewart said.  </P> <P> Delta spokeswoman Frances Conner said the airline pursued the promotion to  bolster its share of the lucrative East-West air traffic market.  </P> <P> "The cooperation (for the Delta campaign) is unprecedented," San Diego Zoo  spokesman Jeff Jouett said. "We've never been all together like this before,  and the state deserves praise. I think it's really a sign of the times; we're  all seeing (attendance) decreases in Southern California, so we're trying to  combine forces and get people here."  </P> <P> "It comes down to a common cause, a common interest," Disneyland spokesman Bob  Roth said. "We've done some joint efforts previously (with Knotts Berry Farm)  but nothing on this broad a spectrum."  </P> <P> Tourism industry experts said they would hope to recoup the cost of the ticket  giveaways through sales of "T-shirts, food, souvenirs and the like," Stewart  said. In addition to money spent at the attractions, hotels and restaurants  would also get some of the tourist dollars.  </P> <P> The cost to the parks will not be as dramatic as it first appears because  "nobody could have the energy to do all nine parks," said Harrison Price, a  Torrance-based tourism industry consultant. "Whoever priced it (for the parks)  has contemplated the fact that not all the (free admissions) will be used."  </P> <P> Price commended the state for getting the nine attractions to agree to a joint  campaign. "Over the years I've seen a ton of joint-marketing efforts where a  couple of different parks might get together," Price said. "But this is the  biggest group I've ever seen together."  </P> <P> Although the parks are working together to get Easterners into the state, "once  the tourists are in California, it's everyone for himself again," Jouett said.  </P> <P> Stewart said it is too soon to say if the program will be repeated during 1992.  </P></p>

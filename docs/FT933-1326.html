			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Guinness suffers 9% decline: Reduced sales of deluxe Scotch whisky varieties erode margins GUINNESS, the UK brewing and spirits group, reported a 9 per cent decline in first-half profits yesterday, and forecast flat full-year profits and only modest growth in 1994. Mr Anthony Greener, chairman and chief executive, said world conditions this year were 'proving to be less favourable than anticipated. We are still seeing signs of further deterioration in some major markets.' He insisted that the group was performing resiliently with key brands maintaining, or gaining, share in most important regions. But Guinness shares fell 32p to close at 427p. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 of Pounds 320m were at the lower end of market expectations. The group announced that the full-year results would be hit by a renewed contribution of Pounds 30m to its pension fund. Operating profits fell 7 per cent to Pounds 384m on turnover 13 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.98bn. Profits from United Distillers, the spirits division, dipped 8 per cent to Pounds 280m on turnover of Pounds 1.11bn (Pounds 981m). Though Scotch whisky volumes rose 2 per cent, sales of deluxe brands were lower. The change in the sales mix, competitive pricing and increased marketing costs cut operating margins from 31 to 25 per cent. Most European markets were depressed. Volume sales were well down in Germany and Spain, but increased substantially in Greece. In the UK there were signs of a slowdown in the rate of decline, but prices remained under pressure. Conditions in Japan and Thailand were difficult. Sales improved in the US, but volumes declined in Brazil and Mexico. Brewing contributed Pounds 104m profits, down 4 per cent, on turnover 12 per cent ahead at Pounds 867m. Cruzcampo, the Spanish operation, contributed only Pounds 9m compared with Pounds 22m last time. In Britain, stout volumes were only slightly lower but a continuing decline in the market, 2 per cent down in the first half, and price competition was 'likely to make profit growth difficult to achieve', Mr Greener said. He added that there was considerable untapped potential in the Guinness stout brand - and the group was focusing on expansion in the Caribbean market with an offer of between Pounds 41m and Pounds 45m for a 51-55 per cent stake in Desnoes &amp; Geddes, the Jamaican brewer of Red Stripe lager. Diluted earnings per share were 8 per cent lower at 11.6p. The interim dividend goes up from 3.35p to 3.62p. Lex, Page 20; Pensions, Jamaican deal, Page 23</p>

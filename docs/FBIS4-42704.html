			<p>BFN     [Text] Neusaess (DPA) -- Christian Social Union [CSU]  Chairman Theo Waigel on Saturday [4 June] called on the Czech  Government to dissociate itself from the "Benes decrees that are  contrary to international law" and to repeal them. The decrees  signed by Czechoslovak President Eduard Benes after the end of  World War II were the legal basis for the expropriation and  expulsion of many Sudeten Germans.    Waigel, who addressed 660 members of the CSU working group  "Union of Expellees" in Neusaess near Augsburg, dealt with the  wish of East European states to become members of the European  Union (EU). The CSU is "open to it." However, as Waigel  further stressed, these states would also have to be prepared to  accept the European legal system with the relevant law on ethnic  groups and expellees.    As spokesman of the Sudeten German ethnic group, Franz  Neubauer stressed that the right to one's homeland includes the  right to return. "It is not decisive how many will really make  use of it."</p>

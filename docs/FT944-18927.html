			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Cardoso looks to help of 'sovereign ruler': ACM, the Brazilian politician who can deliver millions of votes for president The letters ACM stretch across Brazil's north-eastern state of Bahia, visible on posters along each roadside and in every dusty village. They are the initials of Mr Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, one of the country's most influential politicians, whom enemies call the 'sovereign ruler' of Bahia. ACM is also one of the reasons Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former finance minister, is likely to win Brazil's presidential election on Monday. An alliance with ACM has delivered Mr Cardoso several million votes in poor northern states, such as Bahia, where he was unknown. 'I had the courage to support Fernando Henrique when he had only 10 per cent in the polls. I don't have the vanity to say it was our support which will win him the election, it was also the Real plan,' says Mr Magalhaes in an interview, referring to Brazil's new Real currency, which has sharply reduced inflation. Mr Magalhaes is an old-style, populist leader who has spent 40 of his 67 years in politics. He has been governor of Bahia three times and confidant of several Brazilian presidents, of the left and right. His influence in Bahia is so great that local politicians are known either as supporters called 'carlistas' - because of his middle name - or 'anti-carlistas'. He has grown rich from politics but has maintained his popular touch, often wearing T-shirts with red, white and blue stripes - the colours of the flag of Bahia. And he knows the proper greetings and dances for Bahia's candomble religion, developed by immigrant African slaves, even though he is a Catholic. 'My power stems from my people because they know that I work for them,' he says. 'When I pass by, people want to hug me and kiss me. You won't see any other politician like that.' Once again, Mr Magalhaes is seeking public office. This time, he is standing for the senate and he has 60 per cent support in the polls. Mr Magalhaes' opponents, however, say he has been in power too long. They point out that he nominated more than half the state's judges during his terms as governor. In the state's legislative assembly, 42 of the 63 members support him. In the federal legislature, 20 of Bahia's 39 representatives are members of the political party he controls, the Liberal Front (PFL). Following a controversial decision while he was minister of communications, he gained Bahia's five main broadcasting concessions for TV Globo, Brazil's most popular station. He and allies are also alleged to control 56 radio stations in the state. And opponents claim TV and radio are often used against them. Says Mr Jaques Wagner of the left-wing Workers' party: 'If you oppose him, you are dead politically.' During elections, Mr Magalhaes' electoral maquina or machine is almost unbeatable. His only serious defeat, in 1986, came after the opposing party introduced another new currency, taking votes from him. Mr Magalhaes' hold over Bahia is a situation common to many other states in Brazil's north-east, the country's poorest and most depressed region, where politics depends on patronage. The mayor of a small town lacks sufficient resources to build schools or hospitals and thus needs the support of the state's governor. In return the mayor is expected to use his influence to deliver his town's votes. At a weekend election rally in the town of Jequie in Bahia, the local mayor spent about five minutes of his speech thanking 'ACM' for help with various construction projects. He then told the several thousand people to vote for Mr Cardoso as president, ACM for the senate and ACM's candidate for governor, Mr Paulo Souto. ACM waved each time his name was mentioned. The voting process is not always fair. Six Bahia districts were recently found to have more registered voters than inhabitants. The ballot papers of people who have moved away or died are held by local leaders. One common practice is the 'ant vote', where voters copy the choices of the person in front and pass them on to the person behind, rather like ants at work. In return, they are paid a small sum of money, given food or sometimes sterilised for free. Not that such practices are uncommon in Brazil. Indeed, they are used freely by Mr Magalhaes' opponents. What distinguishes Mr Magalhaes is that he is better at using the system to retain power. Under Brazil's election rules, each candidate is given free TV time every night. But opponents often find their time reduced because Mr Magalhaes, alleging he has been misrepresented in an earlier programme, is granted a 'right of reply' by election authorities. Mr Jutahy Magalhaes, a candidate for governor and no relation, says his TV programme has been interrupted 10 times but he has only won one right of reply in return. 'ACM has the backing of the federal government, the state government, the justice system and the election authorities. It's total control,' he says. ACM denies any influence over the justice or election authorities and says he wins more rights of reply because his opponents 'lie and distort' the truth. He says he aims to fight for Bahia when he reaches the senate. But most observers think he has wider horizons. With his power base he is likely to be a key figure in Congress - especially since his son, Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, is a front-runner to be elected president of the lower house. Some observers think Mr Cardoso's very different background as a left-wing academic will create problems between the two men. Some have suggested Mr Cardoso will try to break with Mr Magalhaes once he is president. But opponents of Mr Magalhaes in Bahia, several of whom used to be allies before breaking ranks for personal or political reasons, caution that he is a dangerous man to betray. 'Some of us still don't sleep well, even years later,' according to one.</p>

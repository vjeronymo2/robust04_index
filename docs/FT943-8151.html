			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Basin responds to US initiative Equities saw late afternoon profit-taking which eroded most of their earlier gains, and the Nikkei 225 average closed only moderately higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was up 38.20 at 20,824.56 after a day's low of 20,791.96 and high of 20,875.78. US interest rate rises provided a brief stimulus, with buying by domestic investors and dealers, and arbitrageurs later in the afternoon. Volume expanded from 254m shares to 360m. Profit-taking and index-linked selling around the 20,800 level persuaded many investors against active buying. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 5.07 at 1,663.75 and the Nikkei 300 gained 1.17 at 302.79. Advances outnumbered declines by 516 to 427, with 219 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 1.79 at 1,352.62. Overseas investors continued to buy steels and chemicals, with some domestic financial institutions following suit. Leading steels took the top five places in the active stocks list, with Nippon Steel, the most active, remaining unchanged at Y375, Sumitomo Metal Y14 stronger at Y341 and Kobe Steel Y3 firmer at Y330. Sumitomo Chemical moved ahead Y6 to Y578 and Mitsubish Kasei advanced Y8 to Y565. However, cement shares, which had also been bought earlier in the week, could not sustain their gains. Chichibu Cement dropped Y60 to Y1,360 and Onoda Cement retreated Y16 to Y663. Foreigners also bought Kumagai Gumi, the contractor, which climbed Y15 to Y572. Telecom and multimedia- linked stocks were popular. Reports that the government would invest in multimedia networks ahead of the 1998 Nagano winter Olympics, and the development of a new wireless network by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and Victor, revived interest. Dealers also purchased electricals, regarded as laggards. Victor appreciated Y60 to Y1,390 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone moved forward Y21,000 to Y880,000. In Osaka, the OSE average finished 141.85 higher at 23,207.30 in volume of 28.1m shares. Roundup The region responded to the US interest rate rise, Australia adding one of its own. Jakarta and Colombo were closed. HONG KONG jumped 1.8 per cent, the Hang Seng index closing 171.36 ahead at 9,537.98 in turnover of HKDollars 5.46bn. Property stocks led the rally, with Henderson Land Development gaining HKDollars 1.60 at HKDollars 41.80 and Sun Hung Kai Properties adding HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 52.75. Traders suggested that much of the buying came from Japanese and US investors. Some analysts expected a rate rise tomorrow but felt that this was already factored into local share prices. Wharf Holdings advanced HKDollars 1.10, or 3.5 per cent, to HKDollars 32.10 on a 26 per cent rise in half-year earnings. Hang Seng Bank recovered after its fall on Monday's interim results, rising HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 54.75, one of the largest gains of the session. China's Qingling Motors rose to HKDollars 2.75 from its initial offering price of HKDollars 2.07. The stock bucked the trend of the H-share index, which fell 7.57, or 0.55 per cent, to 1,313.40. SINGAPORE bought blue chips, the Straits Times Industrial index ending 35.83 higher at 2,334.40 in volume of 409m shares. City Development added 40 cents at SDollars 7.60 in heavy volume on high expectations of new projects sched-uled for the rest of the year, and on an upturn in its office rental and hotel operations. KUALA LUMPUR added more strong earnings reports, the easing of capital controls by Bank Negara and a lower than expected July inflation figure, to the US interest rate news and the KLSE composite index put on 17.96, or 1.6 per cent, at 1,126.14. Volume climbed from 310m shares to 563m. Renong and Idris, both speculative favourites, led activity with rises of 32 cents and 10 cents respectively to MDollars 4.24 and MDollars 5.65. Genting rose 50 cents to MDollars 24 on strong half-year results. SYDNEY rose as the Reserve Bank of Australia outdid its US counterpart, lifting official interest rates by 75 basis points. The removal of uncertainty left the All Ordinaries index 19.5 higher at 2,059.5 in turnover of ADollars 389.55m. CRA rose 32 cents to ADollars 19.26, matching its previous record close on February 8, aided by speculative buying after troops recaptured the closed Panguna copper mine, in which CRA has a 53.6 per cent interest, on Bougainville Island. WELLINGTON liked the US and Australian moves and the NZSE-40 index ended 18.49 firmer at 2,101.46 in turnover of NZDollars 30m. TAIWAN blamed its own government's tight monetary policy for the fact that its advance - 62.00 to 6,645.90 - was not greater. KARACHI saw selective buying of financials and some foreign interest as the KSE index edged up 19.04, or 0.85 per cent, to end at 2,265.75. Dewan Salman Fibre rose Rs4.75, just over 3 per cent, to Rs161.50 as synthetics manufacturers came into demand on the new account day.</p>

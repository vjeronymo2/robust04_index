Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon said the agreement  will be signed if the US approves Thailand's demands and  conditions.    "The discussion will be going on as long as the US cannot  agree on the conditions. We propose to set up the quotas," he  said.    Uthai said Thailand will emphasize exporting high quality  products. He added that the import tax structure on raw  materials will be reduced so that the production cost will be  considerably lower, allowing Thailand to compete with foreign  countries.    President of the Thai Garment Industry Association, Wirot  Amatakunchai, said that even though the world garment trade will  enter free trade under the GATT agreement, and that in the next  ten years the garment quota will be increased by 2.34 percent,  it is still likely that the Thai garment industry, on the  contrary, will encounter increased obstacles.    Wirot said Thailand now faced problems regarding the cotton  price which has increased by 30 percent. He added, that it has  been rumored that the price of cotton will be reduced by 30  percent this year.    "Garment traders therefore try their best to keep the cotton  in stock. The production cost in the meantime has increased by  20 percent following the cotton price rise," he said. However,  Wirot said it was expected that the situation will improve next  month. Thailand now imports 80-90 percent of cotton used. Wirot  made his statement during the seminar entitled "Summary on the  Uruguay Round Trade Talks on General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT) and the Repercussion on Thai Garments".</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WARSAW PACT TO EYE DEMOCRATIC TRANSFORMATION  </P> <P> Leaders of the Warsaw Pact called today for a review of the organization's aims  and its transformation into a grouping of states "based on democratic  principles."  </P> <P> Pact leaders, in a statement issued after a one-day summit, said political  change in Europe had made it possible to overcome the division of the  continent.  </P> <P> "We therefore consider it necessary to review the character and functions of  the Warsaw Pact," the statement said.  </P> <P> The statement said the seven member states of the Soviet-led alliance are  beginning a "transformation into a pact of sovereign and emancipated states  based on democratic principles."  </P> <P> The pact's new role, it said, is linked with disarmament and the creation of a  pan-European security system.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had earlier told leaders at the summit,  the first since popular revolutions purged Eastern Europe of hard-line Marxist  rule, that the alliance has to change radically to survive.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said the Soviet Union could envisage "basically every sort of  transformation of the Warsaw treaty, including various forms of membership and  obligation."  </P> <P> But officials said members agreed there was no question of a mass departure  from the organization.  </P> <P> The final statement clearly marked a will throughout East Europe to end the  pact's role as forged 35 years ago to shore up Kremlin power and confront NATO.  </P> <P> Member states said concessions by both East and West had overcome "the  ideological concept of the enemy. The concepts of East and West have now  regained their purely geographical meaning."  </P></p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: BIS warns banks over growth in derivatives trading THE growth of trading in derivatives markets has made it impossible even for experienced financial analysts to gauge a bank's health from its published accounts, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements warned yesterday. Pointing to the lack of transparency which has resulted from the growth of derivatives and other off-balance sheet instruments, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy said: 'In turn this has rendered the nature and distribution of risks in financial market operations much more opaque.' Following hard on the heels of the BIS's Promisel report earlier this month on banks' involvement in the derivatives markets, Mr Lamfalussy's comments mark renewed attempts by the central bankers' club to focus regulatory attention on what has become a major area of many banks' business. Mr Lamfalussy, who was speaking at a conference in London, called for all banks to disclose their off-balance sheet risks 'in a reasonably standardised way.' He acknowledged, though, that this would need 'very careful thought' over how risks should be measured. Assumptions about market volatility, for instance, need to be reassessed, following upheaval in financial markets in September. The events of September had also exposed weaknesses in banks' risk management systems, he said. 'I have the impression that some of the volatilities experienced a couple of months ago were of a scale which were not incorporated in the models and may have therefore led to an unexpected erosion of liquidity in some of the markets.' Mr Lamfalussy also called for better statistical data on activity in particular derivative markets. In an apparent allusion to the possibility of future crises in derivatives markets, Mr Lamfalussy said that the availability of data on banks' cross-border exposures in 1982 made the handling of the Mexican debt crisis easier. 'Data collection, however distasteful for those who would have to supply and collect the figures, seems to me unavoidable, but only after a careful definition of what we want to measure,' Mr Lamfalussy said.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Off with their hands]: Dominic Lawson welcomes tougher sentences but says the law could go further IT SEEMS only yesterday that the former Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker, brought in the Criminal Justice Act. But now Kenneth Clarke, his successor is to alter two of that measure's key provisions. The new system under which fines are means-tested will be neutered - no more Pounds 3,000 fines for well-to-do litter-droppers. The no less new injunction that magistrates should not take previous offences into account when deciding on sentencing will apparently be removed. While the original legislation introducing means-tested fines was ill-thought out and most unTory, I think it was well-intentioned, as a way of preventing crime by a novel form of anti-middle class deterrence. But the law that prevented magistrates from treating recidivists more harshly than the first-time offender, and which has rightly succumbed to criticism from the Lord Chief Justice, could never have been anything other than an attempt to reduce the prison population, and let the public take the consequences. The legislation arose, not out of a desire to see crime properly punished, but to save the Home Office from the incident which its civil servants dread above anything else: a prison riot. Riots had been breaking out with increasing frequency, and the cause, it seemed to the Home Office, was overcrowding. The rational answer was to build more prisons, but that is a long-term solution, and something was needed in the short term to reduce the prison population. What could be more natural than to impose conditions which would minimise sentences? Indeed, the policy has been a success: the growth in the prison population has been reversed. Unfortunately the rise in crime has continued, fuelled by the villains' knowledge that the chances of condign punishment has been greatly reduced. It was often joked in ministerial circles that the most difficult job in government was the one that Kenneth Baker had just had: nobody has more cause to laugh ruefully at that, than Kenneth Clarke. But it is not enough to revoke the most obviously loony aspects of the Criminal Justice Act. As Mrs Beeton might have said: first catch your criminal. To some extent tougher sentencing will lead to more criminals being caught. For the police, much of the satisfaction of their work comes from putting criminals away. The more severe the sentences, the greater the incentive for the police. The forces of law and order often do not press charges where they should be pressed, because they judge the work involved unlikely to be rewarded by the removal of the criminal from society. In recent months we have been burgled, once in the country, once in London. On both occasions the only apparent action taken by the police was to send my name and address to counselling agencies. Thus last week we received a letter which read: 'We are sorry to hear from the police that you have been the victim of a recent crime. If you would like someone to visit you to talk through the experience, please get in touch with us'. We also received a letter from Rochester Row police station, which began: 'I am sorry to hear that you have been a victim of crime . . . the crime is being investigated by an officer whose name is shown above.' No name 'appeared above', unless 'Burglary Squad' is the name of an officer. I suppose I should not sneer at attempts by the police to be 'user-friendly', and I suppose I should talk to the carers at the South Westminster Victims' Support Scheme if only to cheer them up by giving the impression that their services are not entirely useless. The only thing which would cheer ME up is the thought that the intruder who broke into our house might be captured, and, if he were captured, that he would be made very miserable for a long time. I confess that having also, in the past fortnight, had my car twice broken into, my attitude to criminal justice has hardened. In the small hours, as I lie awake anticipating the sound of breaking glass, my mind wanders to Saudi Arabia, where persistent thieves can have their hands cut off and I speculate what would happen if we merged the Westminster parliamentary system with an Islamic code. Perhaps that is something for the next home secretary to consider. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

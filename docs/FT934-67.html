			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Questions that dog President Clinton Sir, Thank you for Jurek Martin's article on President Clinton, 'He Must Have Got Something Right' (December 29). Often a foreign perspective brings a clarity that your own nationals have trouble delivering. But as an American voter, I think I can offer an answer to a question implicit in Mr Martin's piece. Despite President Clinton's rather impressive record in getting bills through Congress, Americans still question his abilities on at least three grounds. First, there is a suspicion that in order to pass important, highly visible legislation, particularly the budget, he has promised an inordinate number of special benefits to individual districts and interest groups. This sort of trading is common enough. However, the near panic with which Mr Clinton has used the phone from time to time worries some that the budget and other legislation has cost the nation a great deal and that the full expense in favours, will not become apparent for some time. Second, there is a sense that the North American Free Trade Agreement was less a success than it might have been. To many observers, Mr Clinton seemed to let the bill's ample momentum die and then scramble at the last minute to get the necessary votes. People are as critical of the initial neglect as they are impressed with the final passage. As it is, there were more votes than the White House led the public to believe. Some critics go so far as to suggest that it was all a cynical display to make the treaty look more like his than in fact it was. Third, with his party comfortably in the majority in both houses, critics argue that he ought to find it easy to get legislation through Congress. To them, his resorting to tremendous efforts could signify a lack of leadership. As Mr Martin suggests, the public is hopeful. It is anxious to discard its reservations about the president. But for the time being, a large part of the public is not yet ready to have full confidence in him. Milton J Ezrati, 12 Oakland Drive, Port Washington, NY 11050, US</p>

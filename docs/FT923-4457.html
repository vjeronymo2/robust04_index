			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / City regulation under fire REGULATION of many financial institutions continues to be ineffective, bureaucratic and costly, although it is better regarded than it was two years ago, according to a survey of 100 senior City professionals by Access Opinions. Among the main findings are that the City believes that customers of financial services are dissatisfied with the effectiveness of the regulatory system, and the self regulatory organisations are perceived as being less effective now than in 1990 in protecting private investors. The Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro) has seen perceptions deteriorate - 64 per cent now say that Imro is ineffectual compared with 30 per cent two years ago. The Securities and Investments Board is better regarded than it was in 1990, with 62 per cent very or fairly satisfied compared with 52 per cent two years ago. City Regulation. Access Opinions, 7 The Sanctuary, Parliament Square, London SW1P 3JS. Pounds 19.95.</p>

South Asia faces a threat from  India, not Pakistan, which wants to meet its power shortfall by  utilizing nuclear energy. Pakistan has no other option but to  build its own nuclear reactor to meet its energy requirements.  He made these observations while addressing the 23d graduation  and awards ceremony at the Center for Nuclear Studies.    Pakistan is faced with the problem of increasing its power  output. The existing resources cannot produce an adequate  amount of electricity to meet the requirements of the  industrial, agricultural, and trade sectors as well as domestic  consumers. That is why the country has to cut power  distribution every year, thereby affecting industrial and  agricultural production and disrupting people's normal lives.  Increasing electricity production is essential for Pakistan's  all-around development. The country's existing thermal and  hydroelectric power stations are generating electricity at full  capacity; to produce additional power, Pakistan will have to  utilize nuclear energy.    France is an example for everyone. That country meets most  of its energy requirements with its nuclear power stations.  Pakistan can also become self-sufficient in electricity  production. The nuclear power plant in Karachi has been running  successfully for the past 20 to 22 years, and the expertise  gained with this plant can be utilized to operate other nuclear  power stations. The country can rely on the expertise of  Pakistani scientists and technical experts to build nuclear  reactors to generate electricity.</p>

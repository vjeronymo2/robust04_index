			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAN BURNS FLAG IN DISPUTE OVER JOB  </P> <P> A 28-year-old jobless man burned an American flag outside a University of  Wisconsin-Oshkosh building today, saying it was a protest over his not being  allowed to work at the campus radio station.  </P> <P> Asked why he was burning the flag, David Machen said: "It is because the flag  has been identified as the promise of the rights granted in the Constitution  that are now being, I believe, grossly violated in my case by an official of  the state of Wisconsin."  </P> <P> Machen said he was involved in physical fights with station personnel when he  worked at the station in 1978 and 1981. He blamed an "emotional condition" and  said it has since been corrected.  </P></p>

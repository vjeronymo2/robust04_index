			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOLLAR SURGES DESPITE EFFORTS TO LOWER RATES  </P> <P> The U.S. dollar surged against major foreign currencies in European trading  today, overcoming what dealers said was repeated central bank intervention.  </P> <P> Foreign exchange dealers said central banks intervened twice in the day to sell  dollars in an effort to keep exchange rates down.  </P> <P> But the selling only encouraged the markets to regard the American currency as  a good buy, dealers said.  </P> <P> They said the U.S. Federal Reserve entered the market alone for a third time,  late in the day, but failed to stem the dollar's rally.  </P> <P> In London, one British pound cost $1.7655 late today, cheaper for buyers than  Thursday's late $1.7730.  </P> <P> Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared to Thursday's late rates:  1.8570 West German marks, up from 1.8440; 1.5743 Swiss francs, up from 1.5671;  6.2875 French francs, up from 6.2705; 2.0880 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0815;  1,352.37 Italian lire, up from 1,350.25; 1.1853 Canadian dollars, up from  1.1816.  </P> <P> Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 128.65 Japanese yen, up from 127.52 yen.  In London late today, the dollar traded higher at 128.93 yen.  </P></p>

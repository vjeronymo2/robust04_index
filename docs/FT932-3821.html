			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Italian kickback cash is found MILAN magistrates have located L50bn (Dollars 34.22m) of assets allegedly coming from kickbacks paid to Mr Giuseppe Parrella, the ex-managing director of ASST, the former state telecommunications agency. This is the largest single amount found by magistrates in the corruption scandals and was revealed by a senior official in the ministry of posts. One of the most puzzling aspects for the magistrates investigating the corruption scandals is the extent to which money collected has been spent or retained - and if retained in the name of inviduals for their own benefit or that of the political parties for whom the funds were notionally collected. Of the total, L30bn has been found in cash in offshore accounts in Vaduz, and L7bn in property investments in the northern city of Udine. In another development two new foreign companies became involved in the corruption scandals with the announcement by Milan magistrates one executive from Philips and another from Bull had been arrested in connection with alleged kickbacks on contracts supplying to equipment to the justice ministry. Italian police struck twice at the Mafia yesterday arresting two top associates of a detained crime boss and swooping on dozens more suspects, Reuter adds from Palermo. Police said they arrested Raffaele Ganci and his son Calogero, alleged to be close aides of suspected boss of bosses Mr Salvatore 'Toto' Riina. Mr Riina was arrested in January after 23 years on the run and since then police have scored several coups in the fight against the Mafia, helped by a growing number of informers. In a separate anti-Mafia operation centred around Milan and the southern region of Puglia, police made dozens of arrests and served fresh warrants on scores more in jail. Most were suspected of Mafia association. In Milan, magistrates ordered police to detain more than 100 people for questioning. Some inmates of jails in northern Italy were served new warrants to delay their scheduled release pending further investigation.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Revamp helps Neste back to black Neste, the state-owned Finnish oil and petrochemicals group, yesterday confirmed a strong return to profitability this year with figures showing a swing to a pre-tax profit of FM879m (Dollars 190m) in the first eight months of the year from a loss of FM1.3bn in the same period last year. Sales were down sharply at FM32.96bn from FM42.8bn, due in part to lower crude oil prices. However, operating profit jumped to FM1.5bn from FM454m, and Neste said it expected profitability to be sustained at the same levels during the rest of the year. The turnround - and much of the fall in sales - was attributed to the effects of a broad restructuring programme designed to return Neste to profit, and prepare the 97-per cent state-owned group for a partial privatisation. Part of the fall in sales was blamed on the merger in spring of Neste's petrochemicals and polyolefins operations in a 50-50 joint venture with Norway's Statoil. The merged company is called Borealis. Neste has also reduced operations in its main trading division, which saw sales in the first eight months fall to FM17bn from FM24bn. Neste says it will concentrate its activities on oil and energy. It has set up a separate natural gas subsidiary called Gasum in which Gazprom, the Russian monopoly gas company, has a 25 per cent stake. It also this year sold its 24 per cent stake in the Swedish refiner OK Petroleum.</p>

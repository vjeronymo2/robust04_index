In his words, the last four Tu-95 MS of the 79th heavy  bomber  division, stationed near Semipalatinsk, had been withdrawn from  Kazakhstan to Russia on his orders on February 19.    He said that a total of 40 Tu-95 MS's had once been  stationed  in Kazakhstan. They have been moved into Russia which is the  successor of the Soviet Union as far as nuclear forces are  concerned. "The withdrawal of heavy bombers, as they are  referred to in the treaty even though they are strategic rocket  carrying aircraft, from Kazakhstan into Russia was consistent  with START I because this was done within the former Soviet  Union," Deinekin said.    Several obsolete Tu-95 bombers that still stay in  Semipalatinsk airfield were manufactured in 1955 and pose no  threat because Kazakhstan does not possess rockets of nuclear  warheads for this type of bombers, he said.    He mad it clear that Kazakhstan lacked the capability to  assure safe storage of nuclear warheads or to keep strategic  aircraft operational. "As a professional I am confident that  outside Russia none of the CIS member nations can keep the air  force component of the strategic nuclear forces operational  because this requires large spending, very high skills and aid  from design boards and manufacturing industries," he explained.    Of all these countries only Ukraine possesses strategically  important aircraft. In particular, there are 20 Tu-95 bombers  in Uzin, 50 km away from Kiev, and 20 Tu-160 aircraft in  Priluki, Chernigov Region, Deinekin said. He added that only a  few of them were capable of taking off.    Deinekin said that talks were underway with the Ukrainian  armed forces on withdrawal of these aircraft into Russia "but we  have not come to a full understanding."</p>

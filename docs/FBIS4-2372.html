			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Hosokawa Quits Over Diet Stalemate"] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa announced his resignation today to "take moral  responsibility" for money scandals that have stalled Diet  (Parliament) debate on the fiscal 1994 budget.    Hosokawa said at a news conference he decided to step down  after new allegations were revealed about financial dealings  involving his private office.    The new allegations came to his attention Thursday [7 April]  night, Hosokawa said, adding that he made up his mind to quit  his job after barely eight months to pave the way for resuming  the Diet business.    Hosokawa said the new allegations include receiving interest  on a 100 million yen (950,000 U.S. dollars) loan from the  scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin parcel delivery group as political  contributions and obtaining profits via dealings by using  political contributions.    He asserted that he was not aware of any of the alleged  deals.    Hosokawa said his office allegedly made the profits for  several years from 1981.    Hosokawa, 56, became prime minister of a seven-party  coalition government last August, ending the 38-year-long grip  on power by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    Hosokawa opened his 30-minute news conference with a brief  statement on a list of achievements and unfinished jobs under  his administration.    The announcement came only two days after a media frenzy  over  reports on his joking about resigning, which he strongly denied.    Prior to the news conference, he suddenly summoned the  leaders of the coalition to his official residence and told them  he was quitting.    At the emergency cabinet session, Hosokawa reiterated that  he  repaid the 100 million yen loan in 1982 from Sagawa and denied  that he was personally involved in a 1986 Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corp. share purchase, which claimed was a deal by his  late father-in-law.    But he said he should take the responsibility for the  current  political turbulence triggered by the wranglings between the  coalition and the opposition camp over his questionable  financial affairs.    The LDP has been boycotting the debates on the state budge  for fiscal 1994, which began on April 1, at the House of  Representatives Budget Committee, it has demanded a Diet  testimony of Hosokawa's former secretary, who was in charge of  his financial affairs when he borrowed the money from Sagawa.    The government is currently running on a 50-day stopgap  budget.    "However, to my regret, I could not fully address the issues  of drastic educational reform and administrative reform for the  new era," Hosokawa said at the press conference.    During his eight-month term as premier, Hosokawa achieved  political reform and helped conclude the Uruguay Round of  multilateral trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade.    However, he has yet not finished such jobs as tax and  pension  reforms, decentralization and greater transparency of government  operations.    Hosokawa said it is "extremely regrettable" that the  financial affairs involving his office and his late  father-in-law have stalled the Diet business.    Meanwhile, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, is widely viewed here as the most possible successor  to Hosokawa.</p>

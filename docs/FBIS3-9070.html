			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Hands Off Dobrudzha!"] </F>   [Text] Illegal and unrecognized organizations are pouring  out threats and sharpening their shears regarding Bulgaria,  while the Romanian leaders simply stay mum when the issue of  these actions by their homegrown nationalists is raised.    To put it mildly, the top statesmen in Bucharest are  protecting them and say nothing when they reveal their appetites  for "the ancient Romanian lands."    The "Great Romania" Organization has itself admitted in a  letter that it is acting under the authorities' wing. Again,  Prime Minister Vacaroiu is reported to have told the parliament  speaker not to provide any information about the "Romanian  Guard."    The nationalism game in the Balkans has reaped enough  victims  this century. It is time for the people in Bucharest to  remember that we are living in a powder keg, so they should  refrain from making territorial claims.    Alternatively, they should proclaim their claims openly,  instead of hiding behind real or fictitious organizations.</p>

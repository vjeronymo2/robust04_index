			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> CREDIT;  </P> <P> BOND PRICES MIXED AS MARKET CALMS  </P> <P> Bond prices finished mixed Friday, stabilizing after a selloff on Thursday. The  Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1/16 point, or 63 cents per $1,000 face  amount. Its yield inched up to 8.93% from 8.92% on Thursday.  </P> <P> Yields finished the week at their highest levels in three months, and up from  8.79% a week ago.  </P> <P> Trading was quiet Friday in the absence of fresh developments in the Persian  Gulf standoff between Iraq and a multinational force led by the United States.  </P> <P> But some dealers capitalized on the low prices to buy, said Bruce R. Lakefield,  executive vice president with Shearson Lehman Government Securities. Traders  also bought bonds to cover short positions.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans,  was quoted at 7.75%, down from 8.125% on Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dollar Falls Again onEconomic Gloom  </P> <P> The dollar sank to another all-time low Friday against the German mark and fell  against most other currencies, reflecting continuing pessimism about the state  of the U.S. economy.  </P> <P> The dollar fell to a record low close of 1.5485 German marks in Europe from  1.5630 late Thursday. Its previous low close in Europe was 1.560 marks  Wednesday.  </P> <P> In New York, the dollar ended at 1.550 marks, a new low for that market. Its  previous low close in New York was 1.552 on Thursday.  </P> <P> For the week, the dollar sank 6.7% against the mark.  </P> <P> Against the Japanese yen, the dollar edged up to 147.60 from 147.25 on  Thursday.  </P> <P> Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late rates Thursday: 1.2820  Swiss francs, down from 1.2915; 5.1975 French francs, down from 5.2220;  1,142.25 Italian lire, down from 1,143.25, and 1.14365 Canadian dollars, down  from 1.14815.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gold Mixed in U.S. After Foreign Rally  </P> <P> Gold prices were mixed in New York, after rising overseas. On the Commodity  Exchange, gold for current delivery rose 40 cents to $409.60 an ounce.  </P> <P> Silver for current delivery rose 1.1 cents to $5.18 an ounce on the Comex.  </P> <P> The metals' muted gains were in sharp contrast to another leap in the price of  oil, up $1.27 to $28.63 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate for September  delivery.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, analysts predicted a sharp drop in cattle futures prices after a  government report showed that far more cattle were placed on feedlots last  month than the market had expected.  </P> <P> An anticipated drop of at least a penny a pound would extend losses posted on  the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of the report.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets Friday, pork futures were mixed, oil and gasoline  futures skyrocketed, precious metals rose, and grains and soybeans were mixed.  </P> <P> Live cattle futures settled .20 to .57 cents lower in Chicago, with the  contract for delivery in August at 77.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were  unchanged to .67 cents lower, with August at 89.65 cents a pound; live hogs  were unchanged to .35 cents lower, with August at 57.52 cents a pound, and  frozen pork bellies were .83 cents lower to 1.17 cents higher, with August at  48.12 cents a pound.  </P> <P> In a report released after the close of trading, the Agriculture Department  said 7 million cattle were on U.S. feedlots Aug. 1 -- 4% more than a year ago.  </P> <P> The USDA said July feedlot placements were 18% higher than a year ago, while  July marketings off feedlots rose 3%.  </P> <P> Analysts were surprised by the placements figure, which compared with  expectations of a 6% increase.  </P> <P> Corn and soybean futures rose but wheat ended lower on the Chicago Board of  Trade after a day of choppy trading in the absence of fresh supply-and-demand  developments.  </P></p>

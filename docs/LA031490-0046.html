			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: MILK ALLERGIES  </P> <P> Question: When I try to drink milk by itself, I usually have a reaction to it.  </P> <P> I think I may be allergic to it. But when I have milk with chocolate syrup, it  doesn't seem to bother me. Can chocolate keep someone from being allergic to  milk?  </P> <P> Answer: People who are lactose-intolerant may experience gas and bloating when  they try to drink milk. As I've explained previously, these people lack a  sufficient amount of the intestinal enzyme lactase, which digests lactose.  Lactose, in turn, is the sugar found in milk.  </P> <P> Investigators have reported that when chocolate flavoring is added to milk, the  symptoms of gas and bloating are not as prominent. Exactly why this occurs is  not known.  </P></p>

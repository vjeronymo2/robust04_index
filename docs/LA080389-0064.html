			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> BILL INTRODUCED TO RESTORE NORTH PENSION  </P> <P> The House Armed Services Committee's top Republican introduced legislation to  restore the $23,000-a-year pension former White House aide Oliver L. North lost  because of his felony convictions in the Iran-Contra affair. Rep. William L.  (Bill) Dickinson (R-Ala.) said North, a 20-year Marine veteran, has  "demonstrated his willingness to give his life for his country" and should not  be asked "to give up the security of his own family on charges that may not  have been his doing." Dickinson's legislation would exempt North from a law  that denies retirement pay to any government officer convicted of destroying  government documents, one of three felony crimes for which North was convicted.  The U.S. comptroller general on Monday rejected a recommendation from the Navy  that North's pension be restored, saying there is "serious doubt" about whether  North was entitled to retirement pay.  </P></p>

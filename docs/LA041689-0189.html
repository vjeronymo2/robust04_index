			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> METS PITCH TO GUERRERO AND PAY FOR IT WITH LOSS  </P> <P> Manager Davey Johnson has never been timid when it comes to extolling the  virtues of his New York Mets.  </P> <P> After watching them in a workout in spring training, he told Mike Littwin of  the Baltimore Sun, "We have so much talent that even if I make a mistake, I'm  still probably going to be right."  </P> <P> The Mets didn't make that statement look too good Saturday at St. Louis.  </P> <P> With runners on first and third and one out in the 10th inning of a 2-2 tie  with the Cardinals, Johnson elected to have Don Aase pitch to Pedro Guerrero,  instead of walking him to face the left-handed Milt Thompson.  </P> <P> Guerrero, who has always hit right-handers well, has been driving in runs at  almost every opportunity this season.  </P> <P> The former Dodger slugger made the strategy look bad. He tagged Aase's first  pitch, a high fastball, for a line drive over left fielder Kevin McReynolds'  head and Vince Coleman scored from third to give the Cardinals a 3-2 victory  and drop the Mets back into last place in the National League East.  </P> <P> Coleman opened the inning with an infield single. He stole second, giving him a  45-for-45 record for steals against the Mets. Ozzie Smith, reactivated just  before the game, singled to left, Coleman stopping at third. Terry Pendleton  popped out.  </P> <P> Then came decision time. Johnson didn't hesitate, choosing to pitch to  Guerrero, who had 13 runs batted in in seven games, instead of Thompson, who is  batting .462.  </P> <P> Johnson pitched to Guerrero because he was easier to double up.  </P> <P> "If the count had gone to 2-and-0, we would have walked him," Johnson said. "If  you make the right pitch, he's easy to double up. But he (Aase) gave him a high  fastball."  </P> <P> All Manager Whitey Herzog could say was, "That Guerrero sure can hit with men  on base."  </P> <P> Darryl Strawberry's first home run of the season in the sixth inning off  Cardinal starter Don Heinkel tied the score and three straight singles followed  to give Dwight Gooden a 2-1 lead.  </P> <P> Gooden departed in the seventh when the Cardinals tied it. Tom Brunansky opened  with a double and scored with two out when Willie McGee, out since April 5 with  a rib injury, delivered a pinch single.  </P> <P> San Francisco 1, Atlanta 0 -- It was a typical afternoon at Candlestick Park.  The sun was shining and the wind was swirling.  </P> <P> Pete Smith, who gave up only three hits and struck out 13, lost the game  because center fielder Dale Murphy lost Kevin Mitchell's fly ball in the  seventh inning. It went as a two-base error and the Giants won the game when  Terry Kennedy, one out later, ripped a double that skipped past left fielder  Lonnie Smith.  </P> <P> "It was just another beautiful, balmy day at the 'Stick," Giants' Manager Roger  Craig said.  </P> <P> It wasn't all laughs for the Giants, who lead the West with a 7-3 record. Don  Robinson, who gave up both Atlanta hits in the second inning, stepped in a hole  on the mound warming up in the sixth and had to leave with a leg injury.  </P> <P> Atlee Hammaker pitched four hitless innings to get the victory.  </P> <P> "When Mitchell's ball was up in the air, I could've sworn the wind picked up 5  or 10 m.p.h.," Smith said. "You can't blame Murphy, you can't blame anyone."  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 6, Montreal 4 -- With several stars sidelined by injury, the Pirates  turned to their reserves in this game at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Glenn Wilson, who platoons in the outfield, hit a two-run home run and utility  players John Cangelosi and Gary Redus combined to reach base six times.  </P> <P> The two substitutes replaced regulars Andy Van Slyke and Sid Bream, both  injured Friday night. Bream, who strained a knee, has joined pitcher Jim Gott  and utilityman Benny Distefano on the disabled list.  </P> <P> Mike Dunne, who gave up five hits and two runs in 5 2/3 innings to win it,  almost didn't start because of an undisclosed family medical emergency.  </P> <P> Cincinnati 6, San Diego 3 -- Eric Davis hit a three-run home run in the 10th  inning at San Diego to give the Reds the victory.  </P> <P> Barry Larkin, who homered earlier, singled and went to second on an infield  out. Kal Daniels walked and Davis followed with his third homer of the year.  </P> <P> Davis also had a run-scoring single, and Larkin scored twice.  </P> <P> The Reds moved ahead in the top of the eighth, 3-2, but Jack Clark singled in  the bottom of the inning. Bip Roberts ran for him, stole second and scored the  tying run on Benito Santiago's single. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

The king of  laundry has landed in Argentina.    With $40 million tucked under its arm, the Italian firm  Antonio Merloni SPA, a world leader in the production of  household appliances, has just entered a joint venture with the  local company Adzen SA in order to establish itself in the  country.    The company has two plants in Italy: one in Ancona and  another in Peruggia, where 1.5 million washing machines and  700,000 refrigerators are produced. And now Merloni has decided  to establish itself in Moreno, Buenos Aires, where it will build  a 40,000-square-meter plant on a 13-hectare lot.    Indeed, the Merloni Company has no small ambitions. It plans  to produce 450,000 washing machines annually, which, according  to market studies, would exceed the annual national demand.    Here are the facts for a business which moves more than $150  million annually. In 1992, there were 280,000 washing machines  sold throughout the country, a volume surpassed in 1993 by the  sale of 340,000 units.</p>

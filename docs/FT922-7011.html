			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Hopes of another rate cut lift Dow to record Wall Street US SHARES, after trading in a narrow range on either side of opening values through most of the day, sprang to life yesterday afternoon and rose to a record level as investors responded to growing expectations of a further cut in interest rates in the wake of poor housing numbers, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 21.96 at 3,397.99, a shade above its previous all-time high of 3,397.58 set on May 11, but turnover on the New York SE was light, with 189.4m shares changing hands. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed 3.56 to 416.37, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks gained 1.52 to 578.05. The day opened with the news from the Commerce Department that housing starts fell 17 per cent in April, more than three times the decline forecast. The drop in housing activity would normally have depressed stocks, but the fact that the data increased the likelihood of an easing of policy by the Federal Reserve restricted the damage. Market sentiment was also aided by a fresh decline in bond rates, which in the case of the benchmark 30-year bond yield, fell to 7.75 per cent. Upjohn rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 35 3/8 in turnover of almost 690,000 shares after the US Food and Drug Administration panel voted to allow the company to continue marketing its controversial Halcion insomnia drug. The ADRs of British Airways forged ahead Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 55 3/4 in active trading after the company reported a 119 per cent jump in earnings for the fiscal year ended March 31. Dayton Hudson climbed Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 62 1/4 on first-quarter net income of 40 cents a share, against 39 cents a year ago and above the consensus of analysts' forecasts. Polaroid firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 26 after Mr Morton Langer, the industry analyst at broking house Bear Stearns, initiated coverage of the stock with a 'buy' rating. On the Nasdaq market, Nova Pharmaceutical showed no change at Dollars 4 5/8 in active trading after the Baltimore-based biotechnology company said that it had begun testing an anti-inflammation compound for the treatment of septic shock and inflammatory bowel disease. Mesa Airlines moved forward Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 25 1/4 on news that Kemper Securities had upgraded the carrier's shares and raised earnings estimates for the fiscal third quarter because of strong traffic gains and bookings. South Carolina Federal advanced Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 21 1/2 after stating that it was engaged in preliminary merger discussions with an undisclosed financial institution. Canada TORONTO ended slightly easier after moderate trading. The composite index lost 6.1 at 3,385.3 as declining issues led rises by 295 to 268. Volume came to 22.5m shares valued at CDollars 255.7m. Nine of the 14 sub-indices were lower, but there were no significant changes. Financial services and golds, the latter after early firmness, lost ground.</p>

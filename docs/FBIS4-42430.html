			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Julie Kirkbride: "Chapter Puts Jobs at Risk </F> Says Major"]    [Text] The Social Chapter risked plunging Europe into a  depression not seen since the 1930's the Prime Minister said  yesterday. Speaking in Nottingham Mr John Major sought to focus  the Tories' election campaign on the Social Chapter which he  claimed would destroy jobs and damage the employment  opportunities for those out of work. "If it costs more to take  on staff" businesses will employ fewer people. It is all very  well to think about the rights of people in work. But I care  about those without work as well." Decrying plans in the  Socialist manifesto for a 35hour-week and a minimum wage, he  said: "We won't beat the Far East where factories are humming  six days a week -- and frequently seven -- by packing our bags  for a three day weekend in Skegness. We don't need to work  less, we need to work harder" he said. The people who would pay  the price of employment protection policies would be young  apprentices looking for their first job and office cleaners who  would face the sack if firms had to pay a minimum wage. In  raising the spectre of unemployment, Mr Major also claimed that  Europe now faced the worst crisis since the 1930s. Over the  past 20 years Europe had created only 8 million jobs, while the  USA had created 36 million. Mr Major was also unrepentant about  his policy shift earlier this week, when he signalled that  Britain could opt out of further political and economic  integration in the EC. "I do not propose to change my ways," he  said. "Because I want Europe to succeed I will be critical where  I must, difficult if I have to be. "I would rather speak up and  put the case for what I know to be right for Britain, than clink  glasses in agreement with something that is wrong," he added.  In a phone-in for BBC Radio Nottingham earlier in the day, Mr  Major was concerned to explain the benefits of belonging to the  European Union. It was vital to jobs to remain part of the  trading bloc as 60 per cent of British exports were destined for  the Continent, he said. He also claimed that it was vital to  peace and stability.</p>

After the expiration of such non-redemption or non-refunding period, as the case may be, such shares would be redeemable at Met-Ed's option. The price paid to redeem such shares would equal the stated value thereof together with accrued dividends to the date of redemption, plus a premium of up to 100% of the dividend rate. This price would decline annually on a straight-line basis until arriving at the stated value thereof, and thereafter be set at the stated value of the shares being redeemed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, certain shares of the Preferred may be subject to a sinking fund. Such a sinking fund would require that, following the expiration of a non-redemption or non-refunding period, Met-Ed annually redeem a number of shares of Preferred equal to between 5% and 20% of the number of shares of Preferred initially issued. The price paid to redeem such shares of the Preferred would equal the stated value thereof, together with accrued dividends to the date of redemption. Met-Ed may also, at its option, redeem on any such date an additional equivalent amount of Preferred (sometimes referred to as a ``double up'' option). Met-Ed may reduce or satisfy any such sinking fund redemption requirement, in whole or in part, by the number of shares of Preferred theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by Met-Ed (other than pursuant to such redemption provisions) and not previously made the basis for such reduction or satisfaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Pennsylvania Electric Company (70&hyph;8321) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pennsylvania electric Company (``Penelec''), 1001 Broad Street, Johnstown, Pennsylvania 15907, an electric public-utility subsidiary company of General Public Utilities Corporation, a registered holding company, has filed a declaration under sections 9(a), 10 and 12(c) of the Act and Rule 42 thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Penelec intends to issue and sell up to $100 million aggregate stated value of one or more new series of its cumulative preferred stock, each issue having a stated value not to exceed $100 per share (``Preferred'') under Rule 52 of the Act. Penelec requests authorization to acquire or redeem through the operation of such sinking fund or optional redemption provision up to the entire amount of the Preferred to be issued and sold. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Penelec would acquire shares of the Preferred through sinking fund and redemption provisions. Specifically, shares of the Preferred would be redeemable, under certain conditions, at Penelec's option in connection with any merger or consolidation to which Penelec may be a party. Any such redemption would be at a price equal to the stated value of those shares of the Preferred being redeemed, together with accrued dividends to the date of redemption, plus a premium of up to 100% of the dividend rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Preferred would not otherwise be redeemable at the option of Penelec for a period ending on a date occurring up to 15 years following the date of its issuance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, Penelec may preclude redemption at its option for a period of up to 15 years if the monies for such redemption are obtained at an effective interest rate or dividend cost less than the dividend rate of the Preferred shares being redeemed.

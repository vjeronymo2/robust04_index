			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Washington correspondent Dietrich Zwaetz: </F> "Two-Faced Policy"]    [Text] Juergen Weber does not conceal his disappointment.  The partial approval granted by the U.S. Department of  Transportation for the alliance between Lufthansa and its ideal  partner in the United States, United Airlines, is "almost  worthless" for the Lufthansa chief. "If one denies United basic  rights, then the alliance does not make any sense," explained  Weber before his meeting on Wednesday [26 January] with U.S.  Transportation Secretary Federico Pena in Washington. For  Weber, "the key element" is flight code sharing (the use of  joint flight numbers) on the Atlantic route and "connecting  flights on both sides."    Of all the potential partners that Lufthansa spoke to in the  United States, Weber still considers United to be the ideal one.  "If we get this going," said Weber, referring to the fact that  -- apart from the Atlantic route -- Lufthansa's and United's  services hardly ever overlap, "we would have a network covering  the globe." However, the alliance will not come about now,  because Pena has been playing for time and has blocked the  cooperation plans by approving only part of the application.    Weber will now be counting heavily on Transportation  Minister  Matthias Wissmann, whose commitment he can "only praise." At  his meeting with U.S. President Clinton on Monday, the  chancellor can also try to move things forward. However, the  Lufthansa president knows that negotiations on a new air  transportation treaty -- despite the "agreement" in the fall of  1993 -- and on partnership with a U.S. airline will have to  start from scratch. Now, the German side must once again  reserve for itself the right to withdraw from the 1955/1978 air  transportation treaty.    It is not the first time that U.S. policy has been  two-faced.  On the outside, only competition is supposed to shape markets  in all areas of the economy. However, if the interests of U.S.  companies are at risk, the brakes are applied gently or firmly.  That United Airlines is a U.S. company is also being ignored:  The pact with Lufthansa would run counter to the interests of  American Airlines and especially Delta Airlines to too great an  extent.    Delta, which already dispatches passengers from the United  States all over Europe, especially East Europe, from its hub  airport Frankfurt would be interested in a third country form of  code-sharing. That is not provided for explicitly in the new  air transportation treaty, but that was something that the U.S.  side only discovered after the conclusions of the negotiations  in the fall of last year. However, it was enough for Secretary  Pena to shelve the treaty. That also means that the  Lufthansa-United alliance is also blocked. Yet, a failure to  form an alliance will jeopardize Lufthansa's recovery, and if  Lufthansa does not get out of the red, then that would also  endanger the privatization of the Kranich airline.</p>

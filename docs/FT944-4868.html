			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (8): Reckoning may be at hand - Heavy industry On an island in Tokyo Bay stands a living embodiment of the decline of Japan's primary industries. Built in the 1970s, when demand for Japanese steel was multiplying, the massive Ohgishima Steel Mill was designed to produce 9m tonnes of crude steel a year, almost one-tenth of the country's total output. But a few years ago one of its two blast furnaces was extinguished and the mill, built by NKK, one of the country's five largest steel makers, is now running at less than 50 per cent capacity. The mill is a concrete reminder of the overcapacity that dogs Japanese heavy industry. Despite years of falling demand for their product, Japanese companies have avoided taking the painful decisions that would keep them competitive in a region where new challenges from the emerging Asian economies grow more threatening every year. In the past few years the high yen has forced them to look again at their chronic problems - over-capacity, high costs and inefficient production techniques Japan's heavy industrial behemoths have had longer to adjust to the straitened conditions of the recession that is just ending, but that advantage has hardly helped them. For the giant industries of steel and shipbuilding, the difficulties began in the 1970s with the first oil shock, and despite a recovery in the late 1970s and 1980s, crude steel production has never returned to its peak of just under 120m tonnes in 1973. The recession of the early 1990s has exacerbated the decline. Weak global demand gave way in the last year to a genuine slump at home. In 1993, crude steel production was 99.6m tonnes, the second year in succession that Japan has produced less than 100m tonnes. In the first six months of 1994 production remained flat. Exports have risen in the past year as a result of strengthening demand in Asia and the US, but the strong yen has eaten away manufacturers' profits. Domestic demand this year has remained weak. The coming year may see some improvement as as demand for higher-margin products such as cars, picks up, but the shift of much of the country's manufacturing capacity offshore means longer-term prospects are bleak. The unaddressed problem is that the industry still needs wholesale restructuring. Total excess capacity is estimated at more than 20m tonnes. The number of hours worked in steel production per worker per year fell below the 2,000 mark in 1993 for the first time ever, but there have been only limited reductions in staff numbers. Employment fell from 309,000 in 1989 to 289,000 last year - barely matching the fall in production. Mr Stephen Wolfe, industry analyst at UBS in Tokyo, says: 'the steel industry is capable of producing 110m tonnes of crude steel a year, and yet by the year 2000 domestic demand will be for no more than 90m tonnes of active production.' The prospects for exporting the excess are slim. Although demand for steel in Asia remains strong as the regional economy continues to expand, Japan's ability to supply that demand is threatened by much cheaper steel elsewhere. Japanese prices are as much as 50 per cent higher than other countries' steel, especially Korea, and there seems to be little prospect of a narrowing of that differential. Japanese shipbuilding, like the steel industry, reached its peak in the early 1970s and has struggled to adapt since. Following the slump in new building demand after the first oil shock, Japanese shipyards suffered their worst-ever decline. But, unlike their steel counterparts, shipbuilders made some progress in restructuring. Excess capacity was cut and the industry was able to weather the worst of the weak demand for ships in the 1980s, which saw ship prices fall sharply. But just as the prospects for demand have begun to revive, and despite its efforts, it is an unhappy irony that the industry faces probably a greater immediate threat to its survival than any other Japanese sector. In the next 10-15 years the combined effect of the ageing nature of the world tanker fleet and more stringent safety requirements which will boost the production of double-hulled ships, is likely to raise demand for ships. But late last year, the South Korean government gave the long-awaited go-ahead for a huge expansion of South Korean shipyard capacity and in the process signalled a bare-knuckled fight with the Japanese, one in which Korea has a critical advantage. Japan and her principal rival both have roughly one-third of the global shipbuilding market. In the next three years, Korean capacity is set to expand by more than 50 per cent. The effect will be to drive prices down further - a price-cutting war that Japan seems set to lose. Costs in Japan are way above those in South Korea - wages are on average more than double Korean wages, raw material costs are 10 per cent higher, and the strong yen has helped that country's shipbuilders gain a price advantage. The Japanese builders have indicated their willingness to cut costs further, but the scope for further reductions is limited. According to Mr Timothy Marrable, shipping analyst at Barings Securities in Tokyo, 'The massive expansion of Korean shipbuilding capacity is now a hard reality and spells disaster for Japan's shipbuilders.' But perhaps no industry is identified more closely with the traumas of the past few years than construction. Not only were the leading construction companies the immediate beneficiaries of the commercial property boom in the late 1980s, but through a series of well-publicised scandals involving bribes-for-contracts, they came to symbolise the web of problems at the core of Japan's economy. The enormous over-investment that was the most striking feature of the boom years seems likely to depress the industry for many years yet. Total orders fell by more than 60 per cent between 1991 and the middle of this year. The one bright spot has been public sector orders, where fiscal stimulus packages in the last 18 months have helped bolster demand. But the difficulties seem set to continue. Companies are in many cases burdened with land bought at the peak of the boom, and with uncollectable debts from insolvent clients. Losses are at record highs. Restructuring is more of a reality in the construction sector than elsewhere. The leading contractors have all virtually eliminated their overseas activities and have cut staff levels at home. But in a labour-intensive industry, there is little scope for genuine rationalisation. The weakening of Japan's manufacturing sector - caused by excess capacity in the late 1980s, the subsequent recession and the surging yen - have eroded the country's industrial base. Much of the modern manufacturing that has powered Japanese growth in the past two decades has gone offshore where labour is cheaper and the currency weaker. For Japan's primary industrial giants, many of whom have postponed their long-overdue restructuring, this unfortunate coincidence of adverse events means that the reckoning may soon be at hand.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-GANG PROGRAM  </P> <P> Regarding the (June 23) editorial entitled "The Death of a 4-Year-Old," your  comments are well-taken regarding the untimely death of an innocent youngster.  However, I am distressed by some of the unfortunate language that stereotypes  our community.  </P> <P> Southern California does have gang problems. However, to characterize Garden  Grove as one of six cities dominated by street gangs threatening innocent  bystanders " . . . in the roughest sections . . . " is untrue.  </P> <P> We do not consider Garden Grove to be dominated by gangs or that innocent  bystanders are more liable to be victims than elsewhere.  </P> <P> The Times may not know the solutions to ending gang violence, but to stay ahead  of the gang problem here are some of the steps Garden Grove has taken. We  instituted proactive police programs such as school education, special gang  investigation units, more gang training and information for all officers, and  joined a computerized information service with other law enforcement agencies.  </P> <P> Our Police Department is continually investigating and arresting all those who  break the law, including gang members. We are proud of the law enforcement job  that our police officers perform.  </P> <P> I hope that in the future The Times will be more careful in assigning labels to  cities, because we feel Garden Grove is dominated by good citizens.  </P> <P> WALT E. DONOVAN  </P> <P> Mayor  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

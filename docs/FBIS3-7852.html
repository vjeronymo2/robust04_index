			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's special envoy,  Yasushi Akashi, had talks in Mostar today with Ivan Bender, the  president of the Chamber of Deputies of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna, Prime Minister Jadranko Prlic, and Slobodan Bozic,  the head of the Government Office for Relations with UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces]. Our correspondent Milan Sutalo reports  on the talks:    [Sutalo] I feel that all the sides who are involved in this  tragic conflict are now ready to make gigantic steps toward the  cessation of hostilities and that they are ready to pay the  price to restore a permanent peace. This conviction was  expressed by Yasushi Akashi at the beginning of talks with his  hosts, representatives of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.  Recalling the agreement that was signed in Zagreb by Generals  Roso and Delic envisaging a cease-fire, withdrawal of heavy  weapons, interposition of UNPROFOR, and the organization of a  mixed commission that will be chaired by UNPROFOR, Akashi said  that UNPROFOR was ready to enter this process, but it was  necessary for all involved parties to cooperate. We also need  additional forces, Akashi said.    I think we will get support from the United Nations and its  member countries, but only when they are sure that the  interested parties are ready to make steps toward peace. Akashi  recalled the importance of the talks that are currently being  held in Washington and New York, but also said that efforts  toward peace were necessary to be made at the local level.    After we have alleviated the suffering of Sarajevo, Mostar  should be the next town where the suffering of population ought  to be alleviated. Therefore, I would like to hear what the  Croat side is ready to do in Mostar for the restoration of peace.    From what we could hear at the beginning of the talks, which  were open to public, we can fathom what the purpose of Akashi's  visit to Mostar is. After that, the talks were held behind  closed doors. Here is what Yasushi Akashi and Ivan Bender said  following the talks:    [Begin Akashi recording, in English with superimposed  translation] I have had very useful and productive talks here  with Croat leaders in Mostar and I have received assurances of  their full commitment to peace, I have heard their concerns that  this peace might be too fragile. That is all the more reason,  in my opinion, that we should join forces to make this peace  more durable. We have to start with specific concrete steps  toward a comprehensive peace. We will not be contented with  peace in Sarajevo, which is important [break in transmission  lasting for 1 minute 10 seconds]. [end recording]    [Begin Bender recording] We discussed the restoration of  peace in Sarajevo. We do not demand the application of that  kind of peace to Mostar alone: We demand that the same be done  with Mostar, Banja Luka, and Tuzla. We will persevere in that.  [end recording]    [Sutalo] Asked by a journalist, Yasushi Akashi commented on  the NATO downing of the Serb aircraft.    [Begin Akashi recording] This was a NATO action in  compliance  with the Security Council resolution concerning the no-fly zone.  I spoke with NATO Southern Command this morning which assured  me that they had followed the established procedures. UNPROFOR  was not involved in this action.    I also called Mr. Karadzic who was in Belgrade. He assured  me that it was important for us not to over-dramatize these kind  of incidents. And we will continue to make efforts to restore  peace, the process of which started in February, and we will try  to extend it to other places and areas.</p>

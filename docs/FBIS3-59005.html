			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Karl Rauscher editorial: "Scandalo Rosa"] </F>   [Text] "Scandalo rosa all'Hofburg," writes Milan's  CORRIERE. This evokes pictures of a horse-drawn carriage,  curtains drawn, that takes Mary from the ballet to the crown  prince's chambers.    Good for tourism, bad for the republic. Seriously: The  image of a scandal-ridden operetta-like Austria, unable to  govern itself properly, suits the plans of certain political  groups very well. The Vienna correspondent of the nationalist  conservative FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE has been writing for years  that only the German nationalist Joerg Haider can "renew" the  country. Haider's Pan-Germanic guru Andreas Moelzer justifies  his anschluss fantasies with the argument that Austria "is  unable to survive without outside help." A "pink scandal in the  presidential office" perfectly suits the plans of a change to  the "Third Republic."</p>

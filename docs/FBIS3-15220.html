To advise that, in accordance with Ukraine's Constitution  and current legislation,    a. The Crimean Republic is an autonomous constituent part of  Ukraine and has extensive rights in the sphere of economics, the  utilization of natural resources, ecology, culture, the  organization of social life, and so on. However, the Crimean  Republic, as an autonomous constituent part of Ukraine, has no  state sovereignty and cannot establish political relations with  foreign states;    b. Ukraine's Constitution is effective on the entire  territory of Ukraine, including the territory of the Crimea, and  the Crimean Republic's Constitution cannot contradict the  Ukrainian Constitution;    c. In accordance with Article 70 of the Ukrainian  Constitution, the territory of Ukraine, including the territory  of the Crimea, is unitary, indivisible, inviolable, and  integral. Any changes to Ukraine's territory or state borders  without the consent of the Ukrainian people are inadmissible.  At the same time, as is envisaged in the legislation on the  status of the Crimean Republic, Ukraine has no right to make  decisions on changing the territory of the Crimean Republic  without that republic's consent;    d. The Crimean Republic has no citizenship of its own,  separate from Ukraine. Citizens of Ukraine who permanently  reside in the Crimea are citizens of the Crimean Republic. The  Crimea cannot have its own military formations or its own  monetary or financial systems separate from Ukraine.    That is why, in accordance with Ukrainian legislation, the  supreme bodies of the Crimean Republic's power cannot resolve  these or other questions that are under the exclusive  jurisdiction of Ukraine's authorities.    2. All bodies of state power of Ukraine and of the Crimean  Republic, as well as their officials must be guided in their  activity by Ukraine's Constitution and laws and also by this  present decree.    3. The Supreme Council of the Crimean Republic must, within  one month, bring the Constitution and other legislative acts of  the Crimean Republic into conformity with Ukraine's Constitution  and legislation.    4. The president of Ukraine must ensure the fulfillment of  Ukraine's law "On the Ukrainian Presidential Representation in  the Crimean Republic."    5. The president of Ukraine and Ukraine's Procurator General  must react in time to violations of the Ukrainian Constitution  and laws.    [Signed] Chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council I. Plyushch    [Issued] Kiev, 24 February 1994</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Andreas Foerster report: "`Swissified' Money From Dark </F> Channels"]    [Text] The "Zhirinovskiy File" at the Federal Intelligence  Office [BND] is growing and growing. The Pullach office has  been investigating links between the Russian nationalist leader  and German companies since the end of December.    One of the bases are photographs the Austrian State Police  has made available to the BND. On 22 December an official of  the Vienna Interior Ministry, camouflaged as a skier by wearing  a ski cap, took photos of the group of entrepreneurs who visited  Zhirinovskiy in the Carinthian hotel "Rainsberg" in Reichenfels.  "We had businessmen from Austria, Germany, Belgium, the  Netherlands, Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia here," Edwin Neuwirth,  owner of the "Rainsberg" hotel and Zhirinovskiy's host said.  <H5>  German Businessmen Visited </H5>   Limousines with German license plates also arrived in  Reichenfels. One of them let out Berlin businessmen Werner  Girke and Werner Neumann. According to the trade registry,  their company, the Trustee, Administration, and Organization  Company (T.V.O.) in Kaiserin-Augusta Allee in Tiergarten, is  dealing with trusteeship deals of all kinds as well as the  acquisition of companies.    In fact, however, until May 1990 T.V.O. belonged to the  Swiss  holding ORVAG AG, which has multiplied and administered the  foreign assets of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] in  Switzerland and Liechtenstein since 1970. Together with the  Liechtenstein Corefina company in Balzers, ORVAG established a  complicated empire of companies comprised of at least nine  financial and real estate companies. As trustee of the  "Swissified" SED assets, strings were pulled by the same Werner  Girke who has visited Zhirinovskiy.    As early as 1990, Girke may have made sure that he need not  face his new friend Zhirinovskiy with empty hands.  <H5>  Million-Mark Loans to Unknown Persons </H5>   BERLINER ZEITUNG has obtained evidence of a transfer of 1  million German marks [DM] to a Swiss numbered account that was  carried out by Girke. On 22 March 1990 this sum was transferred  from the Corefina account at the Zurich Leu Bank to the Leumi le  Israel Bank in Zurich. Some days later Girke sent another  DM1.7753 million to three Luxembourg banks. As a reason for  payment Girke always cited loans, the recipients of which  remained unknown, however.    Still, this was not the only smuggling of money that the  former SED trustee initiated. At the end of 1993, DM14.2  million were seized from cover accounts in Luxembourg. Girke  had received the money in cash at the beginning of 1990 from Mr.  Langnitschke, the former financial administrator of the Party of  Democratic Socialism [PDS].    PDS Treasurer Dietmar Bartsch has denied any ties between  his  party and Girke and his companies. There are no financial and  ideological interlacements, he says.    An investigator of the Austrian State Police told  WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE published in Vienna today, that Zhirinovskiy's  financial adviser Aleksey Vedenkin "is establishing cover firms  in West Europe and looking for partners so that he can fully  participate in the oil trade." Zhirinovskiy's confidante  Neuwirth even says that "Vedenkin has already established 10  companies in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and in  Switzerland."    Yesterday no one at T.V.O. -- which, by the way, had invited  Zhirinovskiy for his failed visit to Berlin in December -- was  willing to tell us anything. In the Federal Interior Ministry,  too, everything was quiet. The question about Zhirinovskiy's  contacts with German companies touches on "an intelligence  service background; therefore, the Federal Government will not  give any information," the Ministry's press office stated.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Tight controls help IWP to IPounds 4.52m IWP, the Irish industrial holding group, reported a 5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from IPounds 4.31m to IPounds 4.52m (Pounds 4.3m) on turnover up 4 per cent to IPounds 48.4m for the six months to September 30. The company said that despite depressed consumer spending during the period, especially in its main UK market, the core household products and packaging divisions performed satisfactorily due to tight management control. The small and unprofitable telecommunications division is to be disposed of by the year-end. Enhanced growth is anticipated in the full year, due to a first-time contribution from Levendaal Beheer, the Dutch toiletries and household products group, which IWP purchased last October in a complex IPounds 51.2m cash and shares offer. Mr Joe Moran, chief executive, said that in future almost 50 per cent of profits would be sourced from the Netherlands division, which is expanding into the German and east European markets, instead of from the UK at present. He said that a combined marketing and purchasing approach in the enlarged group 'will bring results in 1994-95 rather than this year'. He said gearing is expected to drop from the current 98 per cent to 85 per cent by year-end, and 40-45 per cent within 12 months due to cash flow and the anticipated expansion of the equity base. Earnings per share were 12.11p (11.35p) and an interim dividend of 3.25p (3p) is declared. The company has also announced a series of board changes, including a separation of the roles of chairman and chief executive. Mr Joe Moran, formerly executive chairman, is now chief executive, while Mr Frank Plunkett Dillon, a non-executive director and hitherto deputy chairman, becomes chairman. Two new non-executive directors join the board; Mr JWC Van de Veer, a director of Levendaal and chairman of P&amp;C, the Dutch retail clothing group, and Mr Patrick Dowling, a former deputy chief executive of Allied Irish Banks. Mr Jim Stewart is resigning from the board for health reasons.</p>

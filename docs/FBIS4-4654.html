			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kim Chin-sok from Chongwadae, presidential </F> office -- live]    [Text] Today, President Kim Yong-sam replaced Kim Yang-pae,  minister of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; with Choe  In-ki, former vice minister of home affairs; in connection with  Minister Kim's responsibility for the controversial revision of  the Uruguay Round implementation plan.    When announcing the reshuffle of the minister of  agriculture,  forestry, and fisheries today, Chu Ton-sik, spokesman for  Chongwadae [presidential office], said: President Kim Yong-sam  admitted that the Uruguay Round implementation plan had been  revised for farmers and would be beneficial to them. However,  Minister Kim had told the people, as well as the president, that  he would not correct even one word of the implementation plan.  Therefore, by revising this plan, he deceived the people and  the president and tarnished the morality of the civilian regime.  So, the president had no alternative but to hold the minister  responsible and replaced the minister with the former vice  minister of home affairs.</p>

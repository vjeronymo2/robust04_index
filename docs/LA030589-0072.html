			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCIAL WORKER'S TRAGIC DEATH  </P> <P> We mourn the tragic and untimely death of a committed and compassionate social  worker, Robbyn Panitch, who died while doing what she loved; helping the  disenfranchised and desperate members of our society, the homeless chronically  mentally disabled. Your editorial ("Death at the Clinic," Feb. 23) expressed  the deep feelings that we all share for a colleague who represented the highest  ideals of our profession: respect for the inherent worth of all human beings,  and a firm belief in equal opportunities for all members of our society. I am  personally proud to be a social worker.  </P> <P> During this time of grief, we must be reminded of our collective responsibility  to strongly advocate for the necessary resources and support to provide  accessible and comprehensive care and treatment for mentally disabled  individuals; and to alleviate the societal conditions which aggravate their  situation.  </P> <P> It is ironic that in March, designated as "Professional Social Work Month," the  National Assn. of Social Workers will initiate a yearlong campaign -- "There's  No Place Like Home" -- focusing on the plight of the country's estimated 3  million homeless people.  </P> <P> To the memory of Robbyn Panitch, and to all others who are working with this  population, go our deepest respect and strongest support.  </P> <P> ALLAN G. RAWLAND  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

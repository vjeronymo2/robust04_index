			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG TEN ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ILLINI OFFENSE STALLS, BUT DEFENSE STIFFENS TO KEY 21-3 VICTORY  </P> <P> Fifth-ranked Illinois remained unbeaten in Big Ten play, defeating Wisconsin,  21-3, Saturday at Madison, Wis.  </P> <P> Illinois Coach John Mackovic credited his team's defense, which had to play  well because the offense was not productive.  </P> <P> "Offensively we had way too many turnovers, but fortunately our defense did  what was needed," said Mackovic, whose team is 6-1 overall and 4-0 in the Big  Ten. "They kept the pressure on Wisconsin's quarterbacks, which reduced their  effectiveness."  </P> <P> Illinois fumbled five times and lost three, but the Illini defense also  recovered four fumbles, held the Badgers (1-6, 0-4) to 15 yards rushing, and  kept the pressure on Wisconsin quarterbacks Tony Lowery and Sean Wilson, who  were sacked five times.  </P> <P> Lowery left the game in the third quarter with a bruised back.  </P> <P> Quarterback Jason Verduzco passed for two touchdowns and Wagner Lester ran for  a third to lead the Illini offense.  </P> <P> Lester, who played high school football in Racine, Wis., said the Fighting  Illini were not looking ahead to next Saturday's showdown against Iowa, which  holds a share of the Big Ten lead.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't say we took Wisconsin lightly," Lester said. "We just didn't  prepare for the physical game it turned out to be. They played real tough and  came out and got right after us."  </P> <P> Wisconsin Coach Barry Alvarez said Illinois' defense was as tough as any the  Badgers have faced this season. "They are confident and physical and that's how  you win football games -- playing like that," Alvarez said.  </P> <P> Verduzco threw a six-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Shawn Wax to open the  scoring on the first play of the second quarter. The Illini got the ball back  three plays later when Lowery fumbled on the Badger 23 and Erik Foggey  recovered.  </P> <P> Four plays later, Lester ran in from six yards out to give the Illini a  two-touchdown advantage.  </P> <P> Wisconsin scored 26 seconds before the end of the first half on a 43-yard field  goal by Rich Thompson. The field goal was set up by Scott Nelson's interception  and return to the Illini 33.  </P> <P> With a stiff wind and chilly temperatures affecting both teams, Illinois  fumbled three times in the third quarter and the Badgers twice. Thompson also  missed a 52-yard attempt in the quarter.  </P> <P> Illinois got its final touchdown on Verduzco's seven-yard touchdown pass to  Elbert Turner with 4:53 left in the game.  </P> <P> Illinois is now 9-1-1 in its last 11 meetings with Wisconsin.  </P> <P> No. 15 Iowa 56, Northwestern 14 -- Hawkeye tailbacks Nick Bell and Tony Stewart  played only half the game at Iowa City, but Wildcat Coach Francis Peay saw  about as much as he wanted.  </P> <P> "What did I think about the pair of Tony Stewart and Nick Bell? Thank God we  play Iowa only once a year," Peay said.  </P> <P> Matt Rodgers threw for two first-half touchdowns and Bell scored three times  before halftime.  </P> <P> Iowa (6-1, 4-0) plays at Illinois next Saturday.  </P> <P> Northwestern (2-5, 1-3) dropped its 17th consecutive game to the Hawkeyes. The  Wildcats haven't won at Iowa City since 1971.  </P> <P> The Hawkeyes put the game away early by scoring touchdowns on five of their  first six possessions, including 29 points in the second quarter. Coming into  the game, Iowa had outscored its opponents 79-37 in the second quarter.  </P> <P> "Our backs, I thought, both Stewart and Bell ran extremely hard, breaking  tackles, twisting and turning," Iowa Coach Hayden Fry said. "They've done that  in several ball games. I try to rotate them to keep them fresh."  </P> <P> Bell gained 136 yards in 16 first-half carries, and scored the game's first  touchdown on a six-yard run. He also scored on runs of 16 and 26 yards in the  second quarter to help Iowa build a 35-0 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Stewart, who rotates with Bell at tailback, carried 15 times for 122 yards  before coming out early in the third quarter.  </P> <P> No. 20 Michigan 45, Indiana 19 -- Wolverine quarterback Elvis Grbac completed  14 of 18 passes for 166 yards and three touchdowns as the Big Ten's top offense  manhandled the conference's leading defense at Bloomington, Ind.  </P> <P> Michigan safety Tripp Welborne set up scores with a 60-yard punt return and a  pass interception.  </P> <P> Jon Vaughn, the nation's rushing leader, gained 91 yards -- including a 47-yard  touchdown run -- despite sitting out much of the game with a sore ankle.  Vaughn's season rushing total is 1,011 yards.  </P> <P> The Wolverines improved to 4-3 overall and 2-2 in the Big Ten. The Hoosiers are  4-2-1 and 1-2-1.  </P> <P> Indiana got a touchdown late in the second quarter on an eight-yard pass from  Chris Dyer to Rob Turner, who sprained his right ankle on the play, and on runs  of one yard by Cal Miller and 16 yards by Vaughn Dunbar in the final quarter.  </P> <P> Michigan State 55, Purdue 33 -- Tailback Tico Duckett rushed for 210 yards in  34 carries and scored four touchdowns as the Spartans (3-3-1, 2-2) dominated  the injury-riddled Boilermakers (1-6, 0-4) at East Lansing, Mich.  </P> <P> Michigan State had 34 first downs and 423 yards rushing, while Purdue was held  to six first downs and six yards rushing. But Purdue did manage 253 yards  passing, most of it coming late.  </P> <P> Duckett scored on runs of two, 14, 15 and three yards. Hyland Hickson had 103  yards in 16 carries, including touchdown runs of one and six yards. Sebeatian  Small scored on a one-yard run and John Langeloh kicked field goals of 24 and  33 yards for Michigan State.  </P></p>

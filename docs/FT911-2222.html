			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: British Land braves dearer borrowing BRITISH LAND, the UK property company, raised Pounds 100m of bonds due 2016 yesterday, braving higher borrowing costs in the long-term sterling bond market, writes Tracy Corrigan. According to research by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, there is a positive cost in issuing long-term bonds relative to bank finance for the first time since 1987. However, the company was keen to lock in long-term funding in order to extend its maturity profile. 'Property is a long-term business,' said Mr John Weston-Smith, finance director of British Land. The bonds were launched at a substantial 250 basis point margin above the yield on the 9 per cent gilt due 2008. But the bonds yield less than 12 1/2 per cent, so, in absolute terms, the widening in spreads has been countered by the fall in gilt yields in recent months. British Land could have borrowed more cheaply by securing its debt on property assets, as Land Securities did earlier this year. However, Mr Weston Smith said that secured financing is both cumbersome and expensive to administer. In addition, the documentation of the company's unsecured bank lending limits the circumstances in which it can raise secured funding. In February, British Land issued Pounds 78.75m of convertible capital bonds due 2011. The company also has substantial short-term funding, including a Pounds 175m revolving credit facility set up late last year.</p>

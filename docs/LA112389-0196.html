			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> A Westlake Village-based television production company's plans to convert one  of Anaheim's original luxury movie houses into a TV studio have collapsed.  Complying with myriad requirements of Anaheim city officials -- from widening  sidewalks to redesigning a driveway -- proved impossible for Winning  Productions, said spokesman Matt Cimber. The production firm had signed a lease  to turn the decaying Cinemaland theater into a studio where game shows and  other programs would have been produced before live audiences. While Winning  was ready to fund the theater's conversion and refurbishment, "We were not  about to start redesigning Anaheim," Cimber said. There are currently no  alternative plans for the landmark cinema across the street from Disneyland, a  city official said.  </P></p>

			<p>940419 FT  19 APR 94 / Thais invite Burma to Asean Mr Prasong Soonsiri, Thailand's foreign minister, flies to Burma today to invite Rangoon's military regime to attend the Association of South-East Asian Nations ministerial meeting in July, William Barnes writes from Bangkok. Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines have been persuaded to set aside 'reservations' that such an invitation to a widely reviled administration could disrupt the organisation's relations with its western trading partners. Asean ministerial meetings are followed by a regional forum and then meetings with its seven 'dialogue partners' - the US, European Union, Australia, Canada, South Korea, Japan and New Zealand. Burma will probably be invited as a guest of the host, Thailand, rather than - more significantly - as a guest of Asean.</p>

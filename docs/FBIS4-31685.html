			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Resolution of the 41st Bulgarian Socialist Party </F> Congress": "Bulgaria Faces New Choice"]    [Text] Bulgaria is at a crossroads and faces a difficult  choice. Our society faces dramatic questions that require a  clear and unequivocal answer.    Will we create a new political climate and and atmosphere of  national consensus, or will we continue the descend the downward  slope of lethal disunity, intolerance, and confrontation?    Will we strengthen the state, or will we allow chaos,  anarchy, and war to prevail among the institutions?    Will we stop the catastrophic destruction of our economy and  plundering of our national wealth and allow Bulgaria to become a  state of poverty and humiliated human dignity?    Will we remain indifferent toward the growing unemployment,  corruption, speculation, and the unprecedented increase in  crime, or will we establish the rule of law, democratic order,  and security -- guarantees of the protection of our life,  property, and peace for our children, and their future?    Will we reconcile ourselves to the collapse of intellectual  life, the smothering of the Bulgarian language, the destruction  of Bulgarian education and science, the commercialization of our  art and culture, and watch them replaced by harmful imported  surrogates, or will we revive the Bulgarian spirit and preserve  our cultural assets?    The choice between these alternatives is a choice between  disaster and recovery for Bulgaria, between national destruction  or revival.    1. The Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] confirms its striving  for a peaceful transition and its policy of dialogue and  cooperation aimed at national consensus and reconciliation. It  calls upon all citizens, political forces, and public  organizations in Bulgaria to display prudence and good will in  overcoming political hostility and the desire for revenge, and  to create a civilized atmosphere in Bulgarian political life.  The BSP is against the war between the institutions. It finds  relations between the political forces to be anything but normal  and nationally responsible, and rejects manifestations of ethnic  confrontation.    2. The BSP favors holding early parliamentary elections in  the fall of 1994. Despite the efforts of the people's  representatives, the current parliament is about to exhaust its  legislative possibilities and political and moral prestige. A  new poll is the only democratic and nationally responsible way  to stabilize power in the country.    The BSP's success in the elections would allow a new policy  of salvation to be pursued in Bulgaria that will help to  overcome the acute crisis, stop the destructive processes, curb  inflation, and change the model of transition. In its election  platform the BSP will present its positions on those changes  that are vital for our society. The way those positions are  realized will depend on the voters. The BSP views the coalition  agreement as the best formula for our country. If it is  impossible to achieve this, the BSP is prepared to assume  responsibility for governing the country.    The main tasks of the socialist deputies during the period  until the elections are:    -- to adopt amendments and addenda to the Constitution of  the  Republic of Bulgaria;    -- to adopt amendments and addenda to the Law on Electing  People's Representatives, Mayors, and Municipal Councillors, and  the Law on Municipal Self-Management and Administration;    -- to adopt the Judiciary Bill and the Bill on Defense and  the Armed Forces, and adopting amendments to the Law on  Restructuring and Privatizing State and Municipal Enterprises  and the Mass Privatization Program.    The congress proposes to the Parliamentary Union for Social  Democracy [PSSD] to implement until the elections systematic and  strict parliamentary control over the government's work  regarding timely and just income compensation, especially the  incomes of the socially deprived, struggling effectively against  speculation, enrichment that is not the result of work, and  crime, and concluding a deal on our foreign debt.    3. During the period of transition the BSP supports an  economic policy that will guarantee:    -- a revival of production and its restructuring and  renewal,  and protection of Bulgarian national capital;    -- the stimulation of a variety of forms of ownership and  acceleration of privatization by applying market and social  mechanisms;    -- the efficient management of state property;    -- the acceleration of agricultural reform with a view to  creating a modern and efficient agriculture; the creation of  state protection and stimulation of agricultural producers; the  creation of conditions for developing all economic forms and  advantages for cooperatives and associations as a means of  improving the economic and social status of farmers and halting  the fragmentation of the land;    -- a qualitatively new budget policy that will stabilize the  country financially and in terms of foreign currency, overcome  the disproportions in the budget, improve the collection of  taxes, finally resolve the bad credits problem, and bring about  a gradual transition toward developing own sources if financing  in the municipalities;    -- the orientation of the Bulgarian economy toward  exporting,  creating conditions for changing the import-export structure,  restoring our country's traditional markets, and linking  Bulgaria with the European and world economy.    4. The BSP views the following as its basic tasks:    -- guaranteeing the social security of the population;    -- providing social compensations and social aid, conducting  a struggle against unemployment, and providing every Bulgarian  citizen with the possibility of self-fulfillment;    -- effecting strict control over the prices of goods  monitored by the government and conducting an anti-inflation  policy;    -- providing the necessary means for education, health  protection, and the activity of the municipalities;    -- forming independent pension, health, education, and other  humanitarian funds.    5. The BSP declares the irreversible character of the  democratization processes and supports the improvement of the  political system;    -- it draws public attention to the danger of the  authoritarian degeneration of the transition and of the  deliberate striving to destabilize the democratic institutions;    -- it supports restoring and expanding local  self-management,  and expanding the possibilities of conducting a regional and  local policy through developing financial, property, and  organizational autonomy of the municipalities and settlements;    -- it insists on real political independence for the  judiciary, which implements the basic role determined by the  constitution, namely, to be a barrier against crime and anarchy;    -- it declares its adherence to the pluralistic and  democratic character of the national media, overcoming their  manipulative and confrontational character, and turning them  into a public tribune.    6. The BSP supports the protection of Bulgarian culture and  arts and the achievements of our education and science,  language, and spiritual identity, and opposes the persecution of  Bulgarian intellectuals for political reasons.    7. The BSP supports religious tolerance, but it is seriously  concerned about the schism in the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. It  categorically opposes the infiltration of foreign religious  sects and the continuing Turkicization of the Bulgarian  population.    8. The BSP will seek cooperation in the future with the  trade unions in protecting the people's labor interests, and it  favors the further strengthening of the tripartite partnership.    The BSP is against the use of the trade unions for achieving  political goals and opposes their direct interference in  governing the state.    9. The BSP supports the depoliticization of the armed forces  and guarantees their high social prestige, financial situation,  and combat ability. It protests against attempts to  repoliticize the armed forces and views the kindling of  conflicts associated with the military reform as a threat to our  national security.    The BSP is in favor of maintaining the stability of the  security organs, providing their material needs, preserving  their high professionalism, and improving their authority as  protectors of law and order. The BSP is in favor of an  uncompromising struggle against manifestations of corruption in  the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and attempts to  utilize the agencies of law and order for political goals.    10. The BSP is in favor of conducting an active foreign  policy that corresponds to Bulgaria's national interests and  international obligations;    -- it adheres to peace and goodneighborly relations in the  Balkans and opposes dragging Bulgaria into the Yugoconflict in  any form;    -- it adheres to our further integration in the European  structures;    -- it supports strengthening confidence and cooperation with  our partners on an equal bilateral and multilateral basis;    -- it adheres to guaranteeing the country's national  security;    The congress adopts the report on the BSP's political line  and approves the reports on the activity of the BSP Supreme  Council, the All-Party Control Commission, and the socialist  deputies after the 40th BSP congress.    -- 6 June 1994</p>

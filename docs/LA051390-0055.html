			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PROBLEMS AT FOOTHILL HIGH IN TUSTIN NEED TO BE RESOLVED  </P> <P> Tustin Unified School District seems to have "Lost Sight of the Principle of  the Thing" (Editorial, Orange County, May 4). The problems at Foothill High  School need to be resolved, not suppressed.  </P> <P> Foothill students come from homes where parent education levels are superior.  Of 56 high schools in Orange County, only two (Corona del Mar and University)  have a higher percentile rank in parent education. Only one (Corona del Mar)  has a smaller percentage of parents who haven't finished high school.  </P> <P> But California Assessment Program (CAP) test scores at Foothill are low by  comparison. Average CAP scores are better in reading at 24 Orange County high  schools, in writing at 10 high schools and in math at six high schools. The  dropout rate and pupil attendance rate also need improvement. Fourteen high  schools have a lower percentage of dropouts, and eight have a higher attendance  rate.  </P> <P> Another problem at Foothill is the number of seniors who take the Scholastic  Aptitude Test (SAT) and get high scores. The percentage taking the SAT is  larger at four high schools in Orange County. Average scores are better in the  verbal section of the SAT at five high schools, and better in the math section  at 10 high schools.  </P> <P> This information comes from recent California Department of Education  statistics printed by The Times (Orange County, Section U, Dec. 10). The facts  indicate something is wrong at Foothill High School. If Tustin Unified School  District will improve its vision, solutions can be found.  </P> <P> TERRENCE W.

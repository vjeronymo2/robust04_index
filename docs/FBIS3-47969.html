The conference, presided over by Comrade Ha Dang, head of  the  department, was attended by a large number of foreign  correspondents.    Also present were Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai and the  deputy head of the CPV Central Committee's Foreign Relations  Department, Pham Van Chuong.    Comrade Ha Dang said: This is the first time that a mid-term  conference of the Central Committee has been held. The  conference is not an exception, as it is organized in accordance  with Article 15 of the party statutes passed at the seventh  party congress. Apart from other important tasks, the conference  will hold a by-election to choose a number of Central Committee  members. The number of candidates to be elected in this  by-election, as stipulated in the party statutes, must not  exceed 10 percent of the total Central Committee members elected  at the seventh party congress.    A XINHUA correspondent asked what will be the standards for  new members elected?    Ha Dang said: There are four major standards: Candidates  must  have good political acumen, working ability, and ethical  integrity, and they must also be relatively young -- less than  55 years of age. He went on:    [Ha Dang] That is the principle for selection. But  there will be some amount of flexibility.    A BANGKOK POST correspondent asked: Mr. Department Head, one  of the tasks for the period ahead -- as outlined in the  political report to be presented at the mid-term party  conference -- is to renovate and rectify the party and  strengthen the relationship between the party and the people.  What will the CPV do to attract the participation of the  younger generation, as the majority of youths has never been  through war?    [Ha Dang] Our party has been associated closely with  the people since its founding. This relationship has originated  from the fact that all tasks set forth by the party as well as  its interests conform to the demands of the nation, for example,  fighting for national independence and building socialism to  bring about a beautiful life for the people. While implementing  these tasks, we have scored countless achievements. Besides  these achievements, there are shortcomings. To remain closely  attached to the people, it is our immediate duty to unfailingly  develop achievements and overcome shortcomings and deficiences.  I would like to tell you that the majority of our party members  is young.    An Australian Television correspondent asked if there would  be any Central Committee plenums following this mid-term  conference. Also, if the shortcomings to be raised will involve  corruption and will have anything to do with the party.    [Ha Dang] There will be no Central Committee plenums  held [immediately] after the mid-term national party conference.  With regard to personnel changes in the Political Bureau, as you  know, nothing will be changed, except for the replenishment of a  number of members. The party will never change its name. This is  because our party and people love the name of the Communist  Party. As for the question of corruption, we regard this as a  harmful practice. We will resolutely struggle to overcome and  eliminate the harmful practice of corruption. Whatever their  positions, corrupt officials must be punished in accordance with  their offenses.    [Correspondent] I am a REUTER correspondent. Mr. Ha  Dang, will the events in East Europe and the former Soviet Union  cause the CPV to revise its diplomatic and political  policies?    [Ha Dang] We are firm on Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi  Minh thought. We will continue to firmly maintain our course of  development along the socialist path. All these things do not  contradict our efforts to broaden our international relations  and cooperation with many countries, international  organizations, and different economic forces. It is the purpose  of our renovation process to ensure successful national  construction and defense. [passage omitted]</p>

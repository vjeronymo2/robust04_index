			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories face rebuff in mini-referendum - David Butler scans the political landscape ahead of today's local authority elections TODAY two-thirds of the British electorate have a chance to vote in county council elections but most won't be voting on local issues or politicians. They will be taking part in a mini-referendum on the government's performance. Although a majority are not expected to bother to cast their votes, the elections still matter because of their verdict on the Major administration. On the whole the votes will mirror what the opinion polls have been telling us. Even where they run frugal, well-managed councils, the Conservatives will fare badly - their current poll ratings are worse than in 1985 or 1989, the last times the counties voted. Tomorrow's headlines will be bad news for a government that had hoped to be basking in the spring of economic recovery. The gloom is likely to be heightened by the loss of Newbury. After the longest gap (10 months) between parliamentary by-elections since 1689, a safe Conservative seat seems set to go to the Liberal Democrats. The Conservative spin doctors may find a stray council victory against the tide but they will be lucky if they can match their 1990 achievement; then they masked disastrous local results by adroit highlighting of the isolated triumphs in Westminster and Wandsworth. What happens today will be little remembered a few months hence let alone at the end of the four years that remain of this parliament. More and more power has been taken from local government as Westminster and Whitehall intervene ever more directly in education, policing and housing (or pass control over to unelected quangos). Few citizens will in fact notice the consequences if on Friday control of their county hall moves from Conservative to Labour or, more likely, from Conservative to no overall control. Local services and even council taxes will not change much under any party regime. Yet the atmosphere of politics will be significantly affected. A swing away from Conservative control in some counties could give new impetus to Labour-Liberal Democrat co-operation. Such party co-operation gathered pace in 1985 when more than half the shire counties in England and Wales suddenly fell into the category 'no clear control'. A new era of cohabitation began with local Lib-Lab, Lib-Con, or even Lab-Con coalitions or understandings. Some worked well, some worked badly but, in a time when local elections have become more and more party-dominated, partisanship of-ten came to be diminished by sensible collaboration. The number of hung counties diminished to 15 but it is bound to jump up again this week. Surrey, Buckinghamshire and West Sussex seem to be the only places where the Conservatives can feel completely assured of a clear majority. The government's dealings with the Association of County Councils will become more abrasive. Spin doctors for Labour and the Liberal Democrats are already trying to build up the possibility that the Conservatives will lose control of a series of southern, traditionally Tory counties. They would claim this as a victory. In this centralised country the government will still govern strongly. But with a recovery-driven surge in the opinion polls, it may soon feel able to dismiss this month's manifestation of popular discontent. A cut in its parliamentary majority from 21 to 19 may not, however, be altogether unimportant to the government's hard-pressed and hard-pressing Whips. Labour is likely to gain control of a few councils - Avon, Lancashire and Northamptonshire seem the best bets. But the shire counties are, for the most part, not good Labour territory. The winners on Friday should be the Liberal Democrats. In 1989 they were in a bad way. This time it is the government that is in a bad way. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday predicted up to 80 gains for his party in the local elections. 'Liberal Democrats do better in the ballot box than in opinion polls, especially in local council elections,' he said. If Mr Ashdown's troops fail to elect their man in the Newbury by-election, together with a host of county councillors, they should feel very disheartened. If they do well, they can count on a boost in the opinion polls as well as in money and membership. But, much more important, the green shoots of party co-operation will be given a hormone implant. We shall hear a lot more of Lib-Labbery and electoral reform.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Vasquez] </F>   [Text] Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, Armed Forces commander in  chief, stated that the jeering received by the Armed Forces  Superior Council at the National Stadium was a demonstration of  the freedom and democracy in Honduras.    "Logically, interested parties manipulated the masses to do  this. If you study psychology you will see that people can  easily be prompted to do such things. Honestly, it is nothing  more than a reflection of the democracy achieved in this  country," he added.    Discua Elvir also denied that this is an attitude shared by  Hondurans in general. "The population does not just consist of  people in Tegucigalpa. There are 5 million inhabitants in this  country, and there were only approximately 15,000 people at the  stadium. They do not represent the entire country."    He said that what has most affected the institution's image  are the mistakes committed by the military in the past. "As  responsible persons, we must face the challenge. We must never  look back, and we must continue on." Discua Elvir explained that  in Honduras "we must look for what is best. A great future is  envisioned for the country. Dr. Reina was very clear in his  inaugural speech when establishing the rules of the game, so let  us hope that the people support him." He stressed that people  must pay attention to the last part of the president's speech,  when he said that "united people can solve their problems."    The chief of the Armed Forces expressed that he does not  feel  like people showed disrespect for him. "I think it was a very  well organized demonstration. This is not the first time this  kind of action has taken place."    Discua Elvir regretted this kind of demonstration, however.  He added that it divides the Honduran people because "the  members of the institution are part of society; they have  children and other relatives; no matter what, we are part of the  Honduran family." Consequently, he said that "if we begin this  government with division in the family, I think we will not go  anywhere."    Discua Elvir asserted that he hopes the people do not leave  President Reina alone and that in the next few days he can  consolidate part of what he has said. Concerning the promise  made by Reina during his campaign on the application of a  military education service, Discua Elvir revealed that the Armed  Forces are "absolutely ready. We have reviewed our system and  determined that it is too costly. It would be more suited for a  developed country." He explained that countries such as Mexico  and South American nations do not use a system like this for  youngsters to fulfill this citizens' duty. However, he added  that Honduras cannot be the first Latin American country to  implement such a system. "As we are a very cultured and  educated people, it is going to turn out alright," he said in a  sarcastic tone.    Regarding the possibility of eliminating the position he  holds, Discua Elvir remarked that he has not heard such a thing.  Nonetheless, he said that in other countries information is  being sought, while "here it is being taken away." [sentence as  published] "I have no problem with that," he continued. He  stated that if the post of chief of the Armed Forces is  eliminated, the defense minister would have to assume his post.    He noted he has some ideas on the police and the country's  defense that he will present to President Reina. "We are  advancing in keeping with Latin America's political reality.  Let us hope it all turns out alright and Hondurans can  reconcile with themselves, which is so much needed."    Gen. Discua Elvir concluded that many new reforms could be  implemented during the present presidential period.</p>

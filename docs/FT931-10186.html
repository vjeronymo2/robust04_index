			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Bill and Al on the road again: Away from Washington, out among the voters, the issue is still the economy - and it is picking up BILL Clinton and Al Gore begin another campaign today, on their natural turf. The president is off to Detroit and the vice-president to Ontario, California, to appear in televised 'town meetings', fielding questions from citizens, not the media. Their goal is quite simple: to convince a wider audience that this is a young administration still firmly on track, which is not necessarily the prevalent impression inside the hypercritical and media-dominated capital. They will probably welcome the change of scenery in their first escape from Washington since the inauguration. But, even as they leave, there are changes in Washington itself which indicate some adjustment by the president to the capital's political realities. Back on board in the White House, albeit in informal consulting capacities, are Mr James Carville, Mr Paul Begala and Ms Mandy Grunwald, three of the key political strategists behind Mr Clinton's skilful and disciplined election campaign. Implicit in their return, which may be no more than temporary, is the recognition that the administration has had an uncertain political beginning, marked by the double failure to find a new attorney general and the early controversy over Mr Clinton's determination to end the ban on homosexuals in the military. The withdrawal, for 'nannygate' reasons, of Judge Kimba Wood from consideration to run the Justice Department seems a more grievous item of White House mismanagement than that of the aborted nomination of Ms Zoe Baird. Judge Wood has acknowledged in a letter to the New York Times that the newspaper's initial accounts of her exchanges with the White House - obviously, though anonymously, provided by her journalist husband Mr Michael Kramer - were partly inaccurate and that she may, indeed, not have been crystal clear in what she said. But there is no gainsaying that Mr Clinton's aides were ill-advised in leaking that she was at the top of the short list to be attorney general. The net result is that, for the moment at least, the administration finds itself fending off outraged criticism (not only from women's groups and talk show hosts) that the president is applying a double standard to men and women appointees and is running scared of public opinion. Now, it appears all nominees for positions requiring Senate confirmation, about 1,100, will be obliged to confirm that they have always obeyed the law in hiring domestic help, a criterion not exactly germane to their abilities to do the job. Worse, it may well rule out of consideration a lot of talent. Finger-pointing for this firestorm is under way. Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, already a target because of her patent power and influence, is being blamed for her insistence on finding a woman for the justice department. Other aides, like Mr 'Mack' McLarty, the White House chief of staff, Mr Bernard Nussbaum, the president's legal counsel, and Mr George Stephanopoulos, the communications director, are also being charged with lack of political nous. Similar accusations of loose talk surround the formation of economic policy. Mr Stephanopoulos has defensively blamed unauthorised leaks for the number of kites being flown around town - on social security and energy taxes and on the size of any planned stimulus. The impression gleaned is that whenever one has been shot down - as in the mooted freezing of the indexation of pensions - the administration has caved in to powerful special interests. The Kimba Wood fiasco last Friday interrupted what had been a good week for Mr Clinton. The passage of the family leave bill could be portrayed as early evidence that Washington legislative 'gridlock' was over. There had been a series of presidential consultations with Congress and with the nation's governors that spoke of policy innovation and new co-operation. At least these passing domestic passions have taken some of the heat off foreign policy. This may come as little consolation to Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the Bosnian negotiators, who are convinced that the prospect of US assistance is the main reason why the Bosnian Moslems have not agreed to their peace plan, but it has bought some time for the administration to make up its own mind. More generally, as Mr Jim Hoagland perceptively wrote in the Washington Post yesterday, it is becoming increasingly clear that Mr Warren Christopher's role as secretary of state is 'to keep Clinton out of trouble abroad in the opening phase of his presidency'. In the Middle East, Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti, 'quick fixes and policy reviews are the order of the day.' The compromise agreement negotiated by Mr Christopher with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, over the Palestinian deportees was a quick fix, getting the US off the potentially embarrassing hook of being forced to veto a UN Security Council resolution against Israel. His trip to the region next week equally is designed to buy some more time. Such delay does not seem to suit the European Community, agitated over trade policy, and Japan, anxious because it seems to have no friends in the Clinton court. This week's visits to Washington by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, and Mr Michio Watanabe, the Japanese foreign minister, may not be as fruitful as either would like. But it is a fair bet that in Michigan and California tonight foreign policy will not intrude much on Mr Clinton and Mr Gore. Their dialogues with the people, in the preferred medium of the moment, are going to be about what brought them into office, neatly summed up in the placard Mr Carville hung on the Little Rock election war-room; 'the economy, stupid'. The only difference now is that it is getting better.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Danes begin talks to form a new coalition Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Denmark's Social Democratic party leader, prepared to form his second administration yesterday, despite the beating which his four-party centre-left coalition suffered in Wednesday's general election to the Folketing (parliament). He handed his resignation to Queen Margrethe yesterday, but immediately began negotiations for the formation of a new government, saying he was confident that he could put together a new minority coalition. He is expected to try form a government with the Centre Democrats and the Radical Liberals, both members of his previous government, but his task was made more difficult by the elimination from the Folketing of the fourth member of the outgoing government, the Christian People's party. The proposed new coalition would only have 75 seats in the 179-seat Folketing and would require the parliamentary backing of the left-wing Socialist People's party (SPP) and the Unity List. The SPP signalled yesterday that it will set tough conditions for its support. One report suggested that the SPP might try to force Mr Nyrup Rasmussen to form a government of the Social Democratic party alone which the SPP would seek to influence towards more left-wing policies. The SPP leader, Mr Holger K Nielsen, declined to comment. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, thwarted in his ambition to become the country's prime minister, although his own Liberal party went ahead by 13 seats to 42, predicted that the coming government would be weak and would not survive the full four-year parliamentary term. 'It won't be long before there's a new election,' he declared on election night. But as long as the Radical Liberals and the Centre Democrats remain loyal to Mr Nyrup Rasmussen, the Liberal party and its right-wing allies cannot force a change of government. The first task facing the new government will be to carry the 1995 budget bill. The outgoing government planned to tighten fiscal policy next year in order to reduce the budget deficit, now running at 5.1 per cent of the gross domestic product. Mr Nyrup Rasmussen has said the the budget framework presented in the draft budget, published in August, is not negotiable, but the left-wing parties may try to exert pressure for higher government spending on welfare and the environment. Danish comedian Jacob Hougaard was elected as an MP on a campaign ticket of shorter supermarket queues, better weather in Denmark, and a tail wind for cyclists.  ------------------------------------ Danish Elections Results*  ------------------------------------ Population: 5.2 million Electorate: 4.0 million  ------------------------------------ Parties Number of seats                          1994   1990  ------------------------------------ THE RULING COALITION Social Democrats           62     69 Radical Liberals            8      7 Centre Democrats            5      9 Christian People's          0      4 Total                      75     89  ------------------------------------ THE CENTRE-RIGHT Liberal party              42     29 Conservative party         27     30 Progress party             11     12 Total                      80     71  ------------------------------------ THE LEFT Soc People's party         13     15 Unity List                  6      0 Total                      19     15  ------------------------------------ INDEPENDENTS Greenland/Faroes            4      4 Independent                 1      0 Total                       5      4  ------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Exporters count the cost of Soviet market collapse / A look at the predicament of east German producers confronting a vacuum in sales outlets WHILE some west German companies have been hurt by plummeting exports to the former Soviet Union, east German producers have suffered an unmitigated disaster. Only two years ago West Germany still managed DM28bn (Pounds 9.5bn) in exports to the Soviet Union, but this fell to DM18bn last year. The decline was even more dramatic than it appeared as the figure included east German exports for the first time. Sales to all former Comecon countries, as a percentage of total German exports, were 4.1 per cent in 1990 and 2.7 per cent last year. In the heyday of German trade with the East in the mid-1970s, nearly six per cent of German exports went to Comecon buyers. Mr Karl-Hermann Fink, managing director of the eastern trade board of German companies trading with the East, is pessimistic. He forecast a further slide in German exports to the former Soviet market this year of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent. Although there were a few hopeful signals, most large west German companies with sizeable exports to Moscow had registered the alarm signals early enough to enable them to switch to other markets. Mannesmann, for example, cut output and sought alternative markets for its pipes, with some success, in North Africa and South America. But companies such as Mannesmann have kept their manufacturing capacity and retain a presence to try to prevent competitors from capturing orders when they pick up. The company is following potential energy ventures in the Commonwealth of Independent States, such as the Sakhalin oil and gas project in which Japanese companies are also interested. Some smaller German companies, which sold a large proportion of their output to Moscow are hurting far more. The situation is worse for those not being paid by former Soviet buyers and not covered by the German Hermes export credit guarantee agency. The shoe company, Salamander, one of the few production-oriented German joint ventures with a Soviet partner tried, not very successfully, to bridge Soviet payments problems by selling east German shoes to the Russians. The company, however, sought other markets to compensate and reported healthy earnings in April. The impact of the trade collapse on east German companies has been a nightmare for the Treuhand agency which still owns nearly all the large producers who were dependent on the Soviet market for 60 per cent and more of their output. SKET, the heavy engineering manufacturer in Magdeburg had placed high hopes on deals with Ukraine to modernise steel mills it had built there. The projects were to have been paid for by shipments to the West of Ukrainian rolled steel. The Ukraine even gave the necessary counter-guarantee needed in order to finalise the granting of Hermes credits. But in practice the state guarantee proved to be inoperable, a predicament which could take another year or so to be resolved. Waiting this long would be fatal for SKET and other east German manufacturers such as Deutsche Waggonbau, Europe's largest producer of rail carriages which exported 75 per cent of its output to the Soviet Union. 'These companies need a breathing spell in order to develop new products and new markets in the West', Mr Fink said. But in the meanwhile they will require even higher subsidies from the Treuhand agency, which cannot allow them to collapse as it would deal a fatal blow to the cities and towns where they are located. The difficulty in finding alternative markets for products developed for the former Soviet Union is illustrated by the 15 new ships ordered by Soviet shipping lines and built at Warnemunde, where they still lie at berth. Although the vessels are covered by Hermes credits, the buyers did not agree to the altered rate of currency exchange. The idle ships cost the builder nearly DM800,000 a day in insurance and maintenance charges and cannot be re-sold elsewhere without costly rebuilding. Hermes credits to the former Soviet Union were sharply cut to DM5bn this year, mainly for the Russian Republic, and will probably only be slightly extended, Mr Fink said. This month Bonn government said that Moscow, after a long delay, had given the necessary counter-guarantees to allow Germany to release current Hermes export credit guarantees to east German companies. A significant expansion of Hermes guarantees was politically impossible, according to Mr Fink, because of the already strained Federal budget. The collapse in orders from the CIS may also deter potential western buyers from placing orders with east German companies suspected of being candidates for closure by the Treuhand.  --------------------------------------------------------------            GERMAN EXPORTS TO SOVIET UNION/CIS  -------------------------------------------------------------- 1990: DM28bn 1991: DM18bn  -------------------------------------------------------------- Current exposure of Hermes to former Soviet Union ..DM30bn Untied government credits ..........................DM11bn Total government-backed credit exposure ............DM41bn  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

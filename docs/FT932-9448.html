			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls contract Shares in aero engine group Rolls-Royce leapt forward in the last few minutes on news that Continental Airlines, which recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, had placed a Dollars 4.5bn order for 92 Boeing aircraft, including a high proportion powered by Rolls-Royce engines. The firm order includes 25 Boeing 757s (with an option on another 25) to be powered by Rolls-Royce engines, and the company put the potential value to the British aero engine group at Pounds 375m. The shares started moving ahead just after lunch, although analysts initially ascribed interest to a positive presentation from the company at its industrial power division on Tuesday. However, there were suggestions that the early demand may have come from US buyers already aware of the impending contract announcement. With delivery set to begin in 1994, analysts expect a spate of upgradings of Rolls-Royce profits for next year. The shares closed 5 better at 138 1/2 p. Turnover was 3.7m.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Southern African leaders reassure investors South African President Nelson Mandela and other southern African leaders yesterday urged foreign businesses to invest in the region and pledged to work quickly towards a regional free trade treaty and common market. Speaking to several hundred business leaders from around the world at a meeting of the World Economic Forum in Cape Town, President Mandela declared South Africa's support for the creation of free trade agreement between eastern and southern African states and said he hoped an African common market would be established 'in the near future'. President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and President Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, who also addressed the summit as part of a panel, made similar commitments. They said the demise of apartheid in South Africa meant that, for the first time, frontline states were able to enter into a co-operative relationship with their giant neighbour to the south. Over the past few months there has been widespread debate over future economic plans for the southern African region, with most neighbouring countries eager to encourage the export of South African skills and investments but fearful the country might use its power to gain regional domination. The meeting appeared to indicate a desire on both sides to approach the issue cautiously, while highlighting to the rest of the world that most countries in the region were now politically stable and supportive of free market policies. Mr Mandela's speech opening the two-day meeting, was clearly designed to reassure potential investors about the new government's commitment to a stable, free market economy. He pledged his government would not pursue any policies that might 'upset market balance and undermine fiscal stability'. President Mandela also insisted the government would not consider nationalising industries, although it was still a strategy that could be used at 'appropriate time' such as after a war. However he was vehemently opposed to any further privatisation of state corporations.</p>

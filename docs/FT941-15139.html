			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Gaidar departs 'I cannot at one and the same time be in government and in opposition to it.' So did Mr Yegor Gaidar, architect of Russia's reforms and leader of the largest reformist party, Russia's Choice, justify his refusal to serve as first deputy prime minister. His judgment was right. The question is where this leaves President Boris Yeltsin, Russian reform and the western governments that have tried to sustain them both. In justifying his announcement, Mr Gaidar pointed to decisions to forge a monetary union with Belarus and spend Dollars 500m on a new parliamentary building. The second of these is outrageous, but the first is serious. The ability of the central banks of other members of the rouble zone to expand Russia's money supply at will made monetary control impossible. In the last two months these credits had been turned off. Now, fear the reformers, the monetary spigot will be turned on once more. Of the other economic reformers, Mr Anatoly Chubais may continue to run privatisation, though the benefits of that flagship policy will be gravely compromised by the willingness of the state to supply money it does not have. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, has not yet decided whether he will serve. But his conditions include the departure of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the chairman of the central bank, something he is about as likely to obtain as Russia is to embark on coherent reform. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, who may take Mr Gaidar's place, is a firm believer in an economic union among the successor states of the former Soviet Union. But he has radical hopes for de-monopolisation, which are virtually certain to be disappointed. Except perhaps in the first few months of 1992, Russia has never enjoyed what people in the west would call a government. The government has been more like a parliament, while parliament tried to govern. This is the knot Mr Yeltsin hoped to cut by dissolving the old parliament. Unfortunately, his brave gamble failed. He now confronts a parliament that is more legitimate and more firmly opposed to reform than before. Ostensibly, he possesses greater powers himself, but it is doubtful whether he can use them. Mr Gaidar's departure clarifies the challenge facing the president. Mr Yeltsin must decide whether he is cohabiting with his opponents or in charge of the government. He cannot be both. At present, the new government looks doomed to be one of the printing press and the half measure, of nationalistic assertion abroad and craven weakness at home. If so, Mr Gaidar is well out of it.</p>

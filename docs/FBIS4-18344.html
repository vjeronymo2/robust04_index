			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said the  government understands U.S. coordinator Robert Lamb's latest  efforts for an agreement on the confidence-building measures  [CBM's] but it considers the results preordained because of the  clearly negative position of the Turkish side.    Commenting on Lamb's statement that the process is  continuing, Mr. Mikhailidhis also noted that he does not share  the conclusions that portray the Americans as ignoring UN  appraisals on the failure of the process. He added: The  Americans know very well what is actually happening. The  government is waiting for the UN secretary general's report  while it completes plans for actions it will take after the  report is submitted.</p>

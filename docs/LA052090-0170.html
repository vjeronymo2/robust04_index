			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOO AIDE GETS HOLLYWOOD BLVD. CONSULTING JOB;  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT: CRITICS CHARGE CONFLICT OF INTEREST AFTER CONTRACT IS AWARDED  WITHOUT BIDS OR MUCH ADVANCE NOTICE.  </P> <P> The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded a $56,000 contract Thursday to an  aide to City Councilman Michael Woo to organize Hollywood Boulevard merchants,  prompting charges of conflict of interest and trickery.  </P> <P> The contract, approved that morning by the city's Community Redevelopment  Agency, which provided the funding, was given to Woo aide Nina Greenberg  without competitive bidding and with little advance notice or fanfare. Chamber  President Larry Kaplan, a top Woo aide until last year, said he selected  Greenberg for the contract at the urging of Woo and CRA officials. Kaplan added  that competitive bids were not required.  </P> <P> The move fueled a longstanding conflict in which critics have charged that Woo,  who represents Hollywood, and the CRA and chamber with working in concert to  plan the massive Hollywood Boulevard revitalization effort, disregarding the  needs and wishes of local merchants and residents.  </P> <P> "Nice deal. That is so political I can't believe it," said Robert Goldfarb, a  local merchant and member of the chamber's board of directors. He said the  board had no prior knowledge of the contract.  </P> <P> Greenberg, who will leave Woo's employ to take the consulting job, will be  responsible for carrying out the chamber's contract with the CRA to organize  business owners to carry out the objectives of the Hollywood Redevelopment  Plan.  </P> <P> Some merchants expressed outrage that one goal of the new consultant, as  approved by the CRA, is to set up an assessment district in which merchants  will be asked to pay for area improvements.  </P> <P> The boulevard, said CRA Administrator John Tuite, has "unique needs that the  city can't fully address," but that the consultant could, particularly by  creating the assessment district.  </P> <P> Kaplan, however, said the CRA misstated the chamber's position, and that the  assessment district is just "an option we are considering seriously."  </P> <P> The $56,000 will pay salary and expenses for Greenberg, Woo's crime issues  deputy, who will work in the chamber office full time, Kaplan said.  </P> <P> Greenberg said she is "excited about the job," but refused to discuss her new  or old salary. The City Controller's Office said Greenberg's annual salary is  $32,427, and she joined Woo's staff in October, 1988. Her contract with the  chamber will be renewed for another year "if services are satisfactory," the  CRA said.  </P> <P> Woo was on vacation, and not available for comment. But Greenberg, Woo  spokeswoman Julie Jaskol, CRA spokesman Marc Littman and Kaplan all defended  the selection of Greenberg and the way in which it was done.  </P> <P> "I can predict what (critics) are going to say, that it's a scam," Kaplan said.  "This is the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, and I can sole source (a contract  without bidding) when I want. And Nina has proven that she can do a good job."  </P> <P> "It became clear that a (consultant) might be a really efficient way to get  done what everybody wants done; the cleanup, the anti-crime improvements," said  Jaskol. "It's not like everybody got together and crowned her."  </P> <P> Goldfarb, manager of the McDonald's restaurant on Hollywood Boulevard, echoed  some other merchants who complained that they were not notified of the  impending contract, Greenberg's hiring and the possibility of assessment fees.  In fact, Greenberg and CRA officials said nothing of the plans during a meeting  they attended at McDonald's on Tuesday, in which about 40 merchants complained  bitterly about area conditions and the ineffectiveness of Woo and the CRA.  </P> <P> "This just shows, again, that we can't believe them, we can't trust them, we  get open promises and we are being led down a primrose path while the entire  machinery of the city infrastructure is broken," Goldfarb said.  </P> <P> For years, many merchants have been critical of the city's response to the  crime, graffiti and other urban blight in Hollywood, particularly the failure  to get increased police foot patrols on the boulevard to make tourists feel  safer. As Woo's crime deputy, Greenberg should have done more, Goldfarb said.  </P> <P> "It is a manipulative move to control merchants on the boulevard. That is what  this is about," said Ruth Goulet, a member of the Hollywood Project Area  Committee, an elected body that Woo replaced as the official citizen advisory  group on the redevelopment project in favor of his own group last year.  </P> <P> Marguerite Power, owner of Hollywood Celebrity Florist, said she was especially  disturbed that the CRA said merchants were going to be asked to pay "for things  we are really entitled to. I am very disturbed by it and wondering what  recourse there is to take on this."  </P> <P> Besides, said Power, "who is (Greenberg) to be getting so much money? She's no  elected official."  </P> <P> Three years ago, Doreet Hackman and an aide to Woo set up the Hollywood  Merchants' Assn. at the councilman's request. Hackman, now the elected  president of the association, said she was "let down" because merchants were  left out of the selection process and will get none of the money.  </P> <P> "It is so outrageous and so terrible that it is hard to understand," Hackman  said. "It's so clear that no benefit will be there for the merchants. They will  be used to please whatever Michael Woo has in mind."  </P></p>

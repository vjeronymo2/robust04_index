			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Key parties absent from Algeria talks A national dialogue aimed at reducing the violence in Algeria is unlikely to resolve the situation because of the absence of three key protagonists. The talks, sponsored by the president, were scheduled to start in Algiers yesterday. The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which was set to win the general election suspensed in 1992, has not been invited to attend. Two senior leaders of the lay opposition, Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, who leads the Socialists Forces Front (FSS) and Mr Mouloud Hamrouche, a former prime minister and prominent member of the National Liberation Front (FLN) have argued that in the absence of FIS leaders and a radical overhaul of the existing political system, the talks were pointless. The two junior Islamic parties, Hamas and Ennahda, will attend the talks as will the FLN which held power from 1962 to 1991. However, the absence of Mr Hamrouche who, when prime minister from September 1989 to June 1991, legalised the FIS robs the FLN presence of much of its meaning. Meanwhile, in a letter addressed to the head of state, Gen Liamine Zeroual one month ago and made public yesterday, one of the two paramount FIS leaders has repeated his party's insistence that the military-backed regime must free FIS leaders. Mr Ali Benhadj, who has been held in the military prison of Blida since June 1991, said that the FIS and the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS), which owes allegiance to the FIS, should meet the government and debate publicly the country's future. He also says that 'in supporting the dictatorial junta', western countries are committing 'two crimes, against the Algerian people, and against their own nationals (living in Algeria) by putting them at risk'.</p>

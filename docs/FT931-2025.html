			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rank worries Leisure and hotel group Rank Organisation was upset by the interpretation by some analysts of tax changes announced at the Budget. NatWest Securities was one house taking the view that the capital losses that Rank had bought with the purchase of Mecca in 1990, amounting to between Pounds 400-500m, might not be allowed to be offset against taxable gains on potential disposals of the stake in Rank Xerox. The sale of Rank's 50 per cent holding in Xerox has long been mooted as a way of freeing resources for the group to focus on its core activities. A figure in excess of Pounds 1bn from such a sale has been suggested by analysts. Yesterday, NatWest used the tax argument to reiterate its negative stance on Rank. The shares tumbled 16 to 653p, although turnover was only a moderate 447,000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The 16-member NATO  decided Wednesday [18 May] to offer Russia a "special  partnership" to encourage the country to join its new military  cooperation program for the former members of the Warsaw Pact.    The decision was made at a weekly meeting of the NATO  ambassadors in Brussels, one week before Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev visits the NATO headquarters.    Moscow has refused to join NATO's "Partnership for Peace"  program if it was not given a special status.    Clearly NATO's offer will enable Moscow to have close  consultations with NATO on security and other issues, though its  outlines are still sketchy.    The relationship would be separate from the "Partnership for  Peace", NATO sources said. However, he added that Moscow would  certainly not be given a seat in NATO.    NATO offered the "special partnership" to Russia because  Russia is a big and important country, the sources added.    In January, NATO outlined the "Partnership for Peace"  program  in order to draw former Warsaw Pact adversaries closer.    The plan was regarded by most of the former Warsaw Pact  nations as the first step towards fully joining NATO. Russian  President Boris Yeltsin has warned the alliance against moving  its border eastward.    Observers notice that the NATO's decision was evidently  planned prior to next week's visit of Russian Defense Minister  Grachev. He is scheduled to address NATO ministers on Russia's  views on "Partnership for Peace".</p>

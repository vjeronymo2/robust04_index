			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / World News in Brief: US stance sends yen to new high The Japanese yen continued to rise sharply against the dollar, touching a new high and defying repeated intervention from the Federal Reserve.

The yen hit a post-war high of 105.9 to the dollar in early US trading, closing at Y106.3.

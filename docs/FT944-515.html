			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Management: Beyond the numbers game - Tony Grundy and Keith Ward say there are nine key principles to ponder when appraising investments Most managers know something about valuing key investment decisions. They have frequently heard of net present value, discounted cash flow, internal rate of return, payback and sensitivity analysis. Yet in management practice these financial tools are so often distorted, degenerating into a 'numbers game'. An Alternative Guide to Corporate Finance might translate NPV to 'numbers prevent vision' and DCF as 'deliberate cash fudge'. 'Sensitivity analysis' might become 'insensitivity analysis' (that is - knowing the right answer and then playing with the assumptions to get there). 'Payback' might be more suitably translated as 'pray-back', emphasising managers' fear of longer-term uncertainty in decision making. On this page earlier in the year (February 9) Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh of the London Business School suggested that many companies are in danger of under-investing because they are applying too high a cost of capital. The numbers game has thus become a corporate ritual, even though the financial environment has changed. But could it be that some of the bias towards unduly high hurdles of cost of capital is due to the very limitations of the business and financial assumptions which managers make? Our own research of five large corporations has highlighted that there are many not-so-obvious reasons why managers may be looking at investment decisions using the wrong lens. Applying the appropriate cost of capital may be important but it is not nearly as important as identifying the underlying sources (or 'drivers') of value. These are typically whether the investment decision exploits an inherently (and sustainably) attractive opportunity; or where it builds from; or on some area of competitive advantage; or where there are tangible and measurable synergies. Possibly it is based on some area of distinctive implementation capability. Finally, it might be a function of simple, good timing. These tests - attractiveness, competitive advantage, tangible synergy, implementation and timing - can be used to probe the softer drivers of value which our research study explored. We conducted in-depth studies with small groups of managers in five leading organisations - Rolls Royce Aeroengines, International Distillers and Vintners (part of Grand Met), Post Office Counters Business, London Underground and BP. From managers' point of view there were three main problems or 'curses' surrounding investment appraisal - uncertainty, intangibles and interdependencies. Together these problems far outweighed those associated with the cost of capital. The uncertainties included not only external uncertainty (such as the economic, regulatory and competitive environment), but also internal uncertainties (such as implementation capability, management's commitment and intent). Intangibles turned out to pose particularly acute problems for managers. These are often seen as the 'no go' areas of financial analysis, and covered a 'wide range of value, from improving customer service through to defending against competitive erosion and areas of future opportunity. We found that almost all intangibles could be subjected to some form of targeting, even if only by way of indicators. Our argument goes - if we can't think of any world in which value might be harvested, then intangibles don't really have genuine value at all. Finally, we discovered that most project decisions faced by managers were not like the 'stand alone' projects described in traditional financial texts. They are interdependent with the business areas or with other projects coming on stream. It seemed sensible, often, to appraise them as part of a larger set when these interdependencies were complex, rather than in isolation. The issue of interdependencies needs to be tackled on a case-by-case basis, again by understanding the key value drivers (internal and external) - and how these are linked. We discovered that in those instances where managers found decision-making intractable, those decision zones became much clearer if coupled with strategic thinking to fit the project to the business strategy. A simple way of forging closer links was to specify strategic objectives for each project, and to do this explicitly rather than implicitly. During the action research study, managers gained further insights by asking questions such as 'if we have a project with X million pounds NPV, how does this exploit market imperfection for advantage? Is it because it exploits a particularly attractive market segment (and if so, for how long)? Or is it because we have a wonderful, and sustainable, competitive advantage? Or is it because we have synergies (killing two birds with one stone), or have some very powerful innovation? These tests can be used to explore each decision and challenge the assumptions underlying project value. By probing the three areas of uncertainty, intangibles and interdependencies through strategic thinking much of the strain on the financial numbers dissolves. This reduces the temptation to use the unnecessarily high hurdle rates of return which Dimson and Marsh highlight. What we are not saying is that improved, and more balanced, analysis alone will dissolve the numbers game. Better strategic and financial analysis needs to be supported by two things. First, it requires a more open process of debate on key decisions, for instance using workshop or learning approaches rather than bureaucratic meetings as a primary evaluation tool. Second, it requires more challenge by senior management (and not less) to reshape the project to add more value or to achieve similar value at lower cost and risk. Too often, the testing of a business case becomes akin to a legal battle between defence and the prosecution. This climate does everything to dissuade open debate of the assumptions which a learning process using key strategy and financial tools implies. Managers may find it fruitful to ponder nine key principles which help lift investment appraisal above the numbers game. Identify the most appropriate level of analysis (this may be the project itself, a group of projects or possibly the business unit strategy - based on an analysis of the interdependencies). Explore the key value drivers which have an impact on the project (including the competitive environment, margin potential, cost base, quality of implementation, timing). Evaluate the key sources of external and internal uncertainty. Where intangibles exist, target them and set measures (if not primary, financial measures, then secondary, operational or competitive measures). Where value is of a contingent nature, then examine the conditions under which this value might arise and the likelihood of it crystallising. Where value is protective or defensive, explore how this value can be gained at least cost and through what other options. Compare a basket of financial measures (including both NPV and payback) and ensure that short-term goals don't drive out longer-term goals, and vice versa. Generate challenge in the decision process by openly exposing key assumptions and uncertainties through learning workshops. Use management challenge in a supportive way to re-shape the project: a project not initially passing the net present value test may still be worth pursuing. *Managers' Perspectives on Making Major Investment Strategic and Financial Appraisal, British Journal of Management, Vol 4, December 1993, Grundy A N and Johnson G.

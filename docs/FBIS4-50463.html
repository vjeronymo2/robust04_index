			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chen (7115 8301) and correspondent Fan </F> Liangsheng (2868 5328 3932)]    [Text] Nanjing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- China's first  provincial tax law -- the "Jiangsu Procedures for Implementing  the `PRC Law for Tax Collection and Control'" -- has officially  become effective.    Ever since their becoming effective, China's tax law and the  detailed rules for implementating this law have been playing an  important role in expediting the development of market economy  in Jiangsu, in intensifying tax collection, in promoting tax  management according to law, in tightening tax supervision, and  in increasing revenues. Jiangsu's business taxes in 1993  increased 54.4 percent over that of 1992, reaching 21.273  billion yuan, accounting for more than 96 percent of the  province's revenues in 1993. Taxes have become the province's  main source of income.    Basing on the PRC tax law, the procedures drawn up for  implementation in light of Jiangsu's actual situation have also  assimiliated certain measures which Jiangsu has found effective  for tax collection and control.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Letter From Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "The Xi Yang </F> Case Should Not Be Linked With Politics"]    [Text] Dear Brother,    On 15 April, the Beijing Higher People's Court made a final  judgment in the case of Hong Kong's MING PAO reporter Xi Yang  stealing and spying on the state's banking and economic secrets,  rejected Xi Yang's appeal, and maintained the 28 March verdict  by the Beijing Intermediate People's Court, which sentenced Xi  to 12 years imprisonment and deprived him of political rights  for 2 years. In my opinion, the verdict is legal and just, and  the penalty is accurately meted out.    Xi Yang was involved in a criminal case, which was not  complicated. Regarding those who do not know the truth or the  procedure of trial by the judicial departments, questions of one  kind or the other are understandable. However, some people are  trying to seize upon the incident to exaggerate matters and to  link this purely criminal case to politics in an attempt to  throw mud at China's judicial departments. They are confusing  right and wrong by saying that the sentence meted out by China's  judicial departments on Xi Yang according to law runs counter to  the principle of freedom of the press.    As a matter of fact, punishing the crime of stealing secrets  and protecting the freedom of reporters in gathering news are  two things entirely different in nature. News, news gathering,  and legality are entirely different from secrets, stealing, and  illegality. We can judge this point from the crime committed by  Xi Yang. During June and July of 1993, Xi Yang came to Beijing  in the name of covering the Sino-British talks and the  establishment of the Preliminary Work Committee for the  Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region. People in this circle all know that Hong Kong reporters  should first submit an application for gathering news on the  mainland. As far as I know, neither the XINHUA Hong Kong branch  nor the People's Bank of China [PBC] received any application  from Xi Yang to cover news about the PBC. Neither did the bank  assign its staffer, Tian Ye, to receive Xi Yang. When Xi Yang  arrived in Beijing, he was not interested at all in the news he  was allowed to cover. Instead, in light of the request of the  person in charge of MING PAO, he instigated Tian Ye, deputy  director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the PBC, to steal the  state's banking and economic secrets, which included the sample  of banknotes to be printed by China, the decision of the bank on  bullion trading in the international market, and the plan of the  bank on interest rate changes which had not yet been published.  The document entitled "Explanations on Provisional Method for  Foreign- Funded Financial Organizations To Engage in Renminbi  Businesses" was labeled "confidential." Did Xi and Tian not  know they were violating the law? "Did they 'trespass the  forbidden zone' by mistake while covering news?" No. I learned  from relevant departments that Xi and Tian were surreptitious  during their involvement in these activities. They dared not  meet at Tian Ye's office or at the Jianguo Hotel, where Xi Yang  was staying. Instead, they met on street corners. To avoid  public attention, they neither shook hands on meeting nor bid  farewell on parting. If this was normal news coverage, why were  they so furtive? Obviously, they had guilty consciences.  Regarding this, Xi Yang admitted that "he knowingly violated  the law." While engaged in these activities, he also said, he  "only received instructions from MING PAO, but never got any  approval from the departments concerned." "His lawless behavior  has caused unnecessary losses to the country's economy and has  interfered in the country's policy of macroeconomic regulation  and control. As a Chinese citizen who had lived and worked in  the country for years, he knew that the nature of his case was  serious, as his lawless behavior incurred enormous losses to the  state's interests." When the PBC was investigating the case of  China's financial and economic secrets published in MING PAO,  the newspaper urged Xi Yang on numerous occasions to return to  Hong Kong as quickly as possible. This also proved that the  official responsible for the newspaper clearly knew the nature  of the case. Since Xi Yang and Tian Ye have violated the law,  incurring serious economic losses to the state, it is absolutely  necessary to mete out punishment against them according to the  law. They deserve this punishment. Otherwise, how can we guard  the sanctity of the law?    Since reform and opening up, China's relevant departments  have enthusiastically welcomed news coverage by reporters from  overseas -- including those from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao --  and have provided convenience and created conditions for their  normal coverage. In 1993 alone, Hong Kong reporters came to  China to cover news on more than 1,000 occasions. However, if a  person violates the law, he must be punished according to the  law, regardless of his status. As Xi Yang stole and spied on  the state's financial and economic secrets, violating China's  law, China's judicial organs have meted out his punishment  according to the law. This is entirely a matter within China's  sovereignty.    [Signed] Bao Xin, 18 April</p>

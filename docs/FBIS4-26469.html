			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Simon Fluendy] </F>   [Text] Few will need reminding that the direction of the  United States dollar has a big effect on world equity and bond  markets. On Monday night equity prices around the world dived  on the back of a weakening dollar. But if that bad news was not  enough to wreck what was left of Hong Kong's sentiment, then the  eventual effects on the territory's economy from the greenback's  crash could be worse.    Because of the peg, anything that happens to America's  dollar  also affects Hong Kong's currency. In the short to medium-term  it might be of some benefit to foreign companies in Hong Kong  worried about the cost of doing business here. If their home  currency is European or Japanese then they will get more for  their Hong Kong buck than before. But that will soon be  overridden by higher prices for things the territory brings in  from the outside world--things such as food, cars and steel.  And that will lead to inflation. As the cost of imports rises,  so the cost is passed on--to consumers who buy imported goods in  shops, or to companies who buy equipment or raw materials from  overseas. The effects are compounded by the push for higher  wages to cope with the higher cost of imports and the cycle then  repeats itself.    Multi-national companies in Hong Kong will hardly suffer.  They have their pick of sources and currencies and are  insulated from some of the effects of a falling dollar. It is  the individual consumer and smaller companies who are likely to  suffer most. Traders and exporters busily turning drums of  polymer into Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod's action  figures will initially be seduced by the thought of being able  to offer lower yen prices to Japanese customers and lower mark  prices to European customers.    But as the effects of a devaluing dollar are pushed through  the system, that feeling will fade. Hong Kong imports huge  amounts from Japan $178.03 billion last year and most of that is  in consumer goods such as cars. As the price of Japanese goods  rises, Hong Kong will likely start to feel the effects both in  extra costs and in higher wage demands, as higher import prices  convert into wage inflation.    The question is: How big an effect and how soon? It is not  easy to answer. There are those who will argue that a stronger  yen will act only at the margins of the economy. Most imports  from Japan are consumer goods and many will be pushed straight  out again in the form of reexports or tourist purchases. The  second factor to consider with Japan is the scale of Japanese  investment in Hong Kong and China. It has not been noted much  in Europe or the US yet, but Japan's foreign policy has long  shifted from its trading relationship with the West to its  relationships in Asia.    In the old days, the giant Japanese firms were tumbling over  each other to open factories inside Fortress Europe. No longer.  And when trade talks broke down a few months ago, the Japanese  almost shrugged their shoulders. With the passing of the  generation which was old enough to see and understand World War  II, Japan is again trying to extend its ties in the region. The  bad blood is diminishing and in its place is a hunger for cheap  Japanese loans and the friendly hand of a nation willing to take  equity stakes in even the most crumbling ruin in China not just  because of future potential, but because of the disaster which  hangs over the whole region if China's economic reforms spin out  of control and end up a failure.    Japan's Foreign Ministry is now far more interested in  China's continued prosperity and stability that it is in what  becomes of the U.S. dollar. If the dollar dives, there is that  much less danger of U.S. President Bill Clinton trying to beat  the Japanese trade surplus into submission. Meanwhile, Japan  gets on with the business at hand--making Asia great.    If the money which Japan is presently pulling out of the  U.S.  dollar finds its way to Hong Kong it will obviously be good  news. The cloud on the horizon is in the form of reports from  brokers that Japanese clients are going to cash in Hong Kong to  insulate themselves from currency loss. Better to think that  every dollar the Japanese take out of the U.S. to protect  themselves from the fall is a dollar which could find its way  back into building up Asia.</p>

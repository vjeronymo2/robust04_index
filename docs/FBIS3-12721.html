			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 4 Mar (INA) -- Deputy Prime Minister Tariq  'Aziz has stressed that the bad advisers to the U.S. President,  who are pushing the U.S. Administration into taking rancorous  and illogical stands and are preventing the UN Security Council  from fulfilling its obligations toward Iraq, will reap the  results of their shallow and rancorous positions.    Reacting to a recent article by U.S. National Security  Adviser Tony Lake in FOREIGN AFFAIRS magazine, in which Lake  discusses what he calls the double containment policy, 'Aziz  told INA that these advisers are involving their president in  incorrect positions and pushing U.S. policy in the region to a  dead end.    Tariq 'Aziz added that the position announced by U.S.  National Security Adviser Tony Lake -- in which he adopts the  views of his professional Zionist assistant, Martin Indyk --  reflects a rancorous, hostile, colonialist attitude, as well as  the shallow thinking of U.S. President Bill Clinton's advisers.    'Aziz said: Tony Lake speaks of peoples and nations as if he  is playing a computer game. He forgets the facts of history and  the will of the peoples, which, in the end, is the decisive  factor that determines results.    Tariq 'Aziz explains that this adviser, who lacks sufficient  knowledge of history, the social and political facts of the  region, and conditions inside Iraq, cannot provide any  convincing evidence to prove the policy he is promoting has  achieved any of its objectives.    He noted that the insistence on maintaining the blockade  against Iraq is not only a hostile and evil course, but is also  the wrong course and will not achieve any of the declared  objectives stated by the U.S. policy planners.    He stressed that Iraq is a deep-rooted country that has a  superb ability to stand fast and that its people are strongly  behind their national leadership and have proved this on the  ground. He also said the reports Tony Lake mentions about the  domestic situation inside Iraq are silly and are based on  sources with no credibility whatsoever. This information, 'Aziz  added, is given to the U.S. Administration by elements who are  paid for their worthless services by U.S. intelligence services  and the governments of Jabir [Kuwait] and Fahd [Saudi Arabia].    Tariq 'Aziz said the game of containing peoples and states  by  applying pressure and extortion is a losing game that will lead  to a dead end. He said the correct way to build security and  stability in the region and the world is to show respect for the  will of the peoples and their legitimate interests, and to deal  with them in a civilized manner.    Regarding Iraq's position on issues of security and  stability in the region that were discussed by Tony Lake, the  deputy prime minister said: Iraq was, and will remain, a  principal factor influencing security and stability in the  region. The policy of weakening Iraq that the United States has  been following will not improve the state of security and  stability, as suggested by Lake. Instead, it has led to  increasing tension and chaos, and led, in effect, to indirect  U.S. occupation of the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. It also  led -- and this is clearly a fact -- to the impoverishment of  the states of the Peninsula and the Gulf and the squandering of  their wealth. These states were very rich before the aggression  against Iraq, but are now in debt and have lost all their  reserves. Their future is no longer guaranteed. This reality  is one of the factors threatening security and stability in the  region. These facts also refute this shallow and wrong course  which Clinton's advisers are promoting.    Tariq 'Aziz said: These advisers are involving their  president in wrong positions. In the most recent letter they  prepared for him to send to Congress on policy toward Iraq, they  included lies and flagrant falsehoods. The content of that  letter contradicts the statements and documents issued by the UN  Security Council Special Commission and the International Atomic  Energy Agency. It also includes silly allegations that do not  agree with reason and logic or geographic facts in Iraq.    'Aziz added: Such advisers are pushing U.S. policy in the  region to a dead end. The allies in the region, referred to by  Lake in his article as pillars that guarantee this policy, are  now weaker in all aspects -- political, economic, and security  -- than they were before the aggression against Iraq. So, how  can they guarantee for Mr. Lake the objectives he has drawn for  U.S. policy in the region?    Tariq 'Aziz said: Iraq has fulfilled its obligations as  stipulated by UN Security Council resolutions. This dictates  that Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 should be implemented  immediately and without setting any additional conditions.</p>

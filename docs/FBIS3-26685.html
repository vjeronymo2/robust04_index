			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Says Names of the First Group of </F> District Affairs Advisers To Be Announced Soon"]    [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA News  Agency Hong Kong Branch, pointed out yesterday at an annual  dinner hosted by the Bo-Yuen (Taos) Machinery Maker Company  Limited that the problem of the new airport remains unsolved to  this day because the financial arrangements of the Hong Kong  Government exceed the provisions of the Airport Memorandum of  Understanding [MOU]. He also revealed that the name list of the  first group of district advisers will soon be announced.    Zhang Junsheng gave his New Year's greetings to Hong Kong  citizens through the news media, wishing them luck in the new  year and Hong Kong better economic growth than last year through  its own efforts, as well as continued prosperity and stability.    At the dinner party, Zhang Junsheng said in reply to a  reporter's question: We have just received the Hong Kong  Government's fourth financial package. We will formally  announce our view on it after detailed study. Zhang pointed out  that the airport problem should have been tackled strictly  according to the MOU, and that the concerned party should have  fulfilled what it was supposed to fulfill. However, because the  airport financial package of the British Hong Kong Government  exceeds the provisions of the MOU, to this day there has been no  agreement on it between China and Britain.    On Sino-British relations, Zhang pointed out that it is not  up to China to decide the state of Sino-British relations. We  hoped for very good cooperation on the problem of Hong Kong, but  the state of cooperation has been damaged, the cause of which  does not lie with us, but with Britain.    Asked about the safety of the Daya Bay nuclear power  station,  Zhang said: Even during the construction, the power plant  strictly observed the relevant provisions of the International  Atomic Energy Agency. All safety standards and contingency  plans are in strict accordance with international standards.</p>

The  appeal came after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S.  President Bill Clinton failed at their summit in Washington  Friday to resolve a dispute over "objective criteria" demanded  by the United States to measure progress in reducing Japan's  trade surplus.    "They should continue their dialogue from a viewpoint that  Japan-U.S. relations are the most important bilateral  relationship for both countries," said Takeshi Nagano, president  of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren).    Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren), described the failure to reach  agreement over "objective criteria" unavoidable. "This is  because Japan has stuck to its policy of rejecting the U.S.  managed trade-like approach. It's unavoidable," Hiraiwa said in  a statement.    Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, concerned about a possible U.S. move to take  retaliatory action against Japan, expressed hope that the U.S.  will use "good sense" in settling trade issues.    The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, meanwhile,  praised the Japanese negotiators for refusing the U.S. demand  that numerical targets be set to measure progress in the opening  of Japan's auto and auto parts markets.    In a statement, it expressed regret that Japan has failed to  obtain U.S. understanding of the industry group's position.    It also expressed the hope that the breakdown in the auto  trade negotiations will not cause the U.S. to impose trade  sanctions and take other unilateral action against Japan. Such  action would contravene the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT) for liberalizing world trade, the association said.    Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corp., also  expressed regret over the failure of the talks and promised  continued efforts to promote overseas production of Japanese  automobiles and expand auto imports.</p>

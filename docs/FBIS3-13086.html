This situation  has also impacted on the Palestinian leadership, which has lost  a significant part of its credibility as a result of Israel's  practices on the ground.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi noted that after the massacre, the  Palestinian popular mood lost confidence in the current  political process. It believes that the talks will be futile  and harmful if they are resumed without Israel dropping its  claims on Jerusalem and the settlements and halting all  settlement activities, which seek to create new facts that  dictate the outlines of the final stage before the beginning of  the interim stage.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi stressed that the Palestinian leadership,  which wants to be apprised of what the people in the occupied  territories are saying now, should insist on the terms it has  set and not back down. If the leadership wishes to regain its  credibility, it should make those terms preconditions for  returning to the negotiating table.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi added: We are not demanding impossible  conditions, because the issue of the Palestinian residents'  security must be sacred to the decisionmakers. Therefore, we  must adhere to our demands, epitomized by disarming the  settlers; ensuring effective international protection for our  people in the occupied territories; and evacuating the  settlements from Arab towns and heavily populated areas, such as  the settlement quarter in the heart of Hebron and similar places.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi pointed out that adherence to these  conditions might lead to the derailment of the peace process but  that should this happen, the issue must be referred back to the  international community to be resolved by it.</p>

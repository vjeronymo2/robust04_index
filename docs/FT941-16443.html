			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Ireland remains an attractive option - Capital &amp; Credit While most European bond markets wallowed in the doldrums, Irish gilts powered ahead last week, fuelled by bullish domestic fundamentals and a cut in interest rates. Although the market has enjoyed a sizeable rally in recent months, many feel it has further to go. 'Ireland is one of the most attractive stories around,' says Mr Gordon Johns, managing director of Kemper Investment Management, the London-based fixed-income subsidiary of the large US fund. According to Kemper's calculations, Irish gilts last year posted the strongest performance of the 21 bond markets it monitors, yielding a 30.2 per cent total return in local currency terms. While such stellar returns are less likely this year, 'on fundamental economic grounds, the Irish market is still very attractive', says Mr Johns. The Irish Treasury last week surprised the markets with lower-than-expected 1993 budget deficit numbers, announcing that the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement for last year was IPounds 690m, or 2.5 per cent of gross national product, well below the target of IPounds 766m, or 2.8 per cent of GNP. 'The underlying state of public finances was much better than expected, and Ireland and Luxembourg were the only two countries to meet the Maastricht criterion on budget deficits last year,' notes Mr Han de Jong, chief economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin. The government's funding position at the end of 1993 was 'extremely favourable, leaving it in a very healthy position going into 1994', he adds. Funding is set to decline this year, with gross issuance seen down sharply from last year's IPounds 3.5bn. Mr Oliver Mangan, senior economist at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin, estimates gross issuance of about IPounds 1.9bn this year. While last year's issuance was concentrated mainly in the 5-10 year maturities, some borrowing is likely to shift to longer maturities next year. '1994 is likely to see the creation of a new long-dated stock, possibly a 25- or 30-year issue,' says Mr Mangan. Meanwhile, the Irish pound has been going from strength to strength, becoming the firmest currency in the European Monetary System's exchange-rate grid and trading above its former 2.25 per cent ERM ceiling against the D-Mark. It traded at around DM2.48 late on Friday, well above the DM2.4660 upper limit accorded to it under the former narrow-band ERM. The currency's strength, and last week's decline in money markets rates following a Christmas squeeze, enabled the central bank to cut its short-term facility and overnight deposit rates by 25 basis points on Friday, to 6.75 per cent and 3.50 per cent respectively. The move followed last week's rate cuts in Austria, Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands, though it surprised many observers who had not expected the Irish Central Bank to cut rates before the Bundesbank's next monetary easing. The Irish pound is likely to remain underpinned by the country's solid economic performance. After growing by some 2 per cent in 1993, Ireland's GNP is set to rise by about 3.5 per cent in 1994, lifted by a recovery in domestic demand, the acceleration of UK growth and the consolidation of the US recovery, Mr Mangan predicts. By the end of the year, he expects the pound to be higher against sterling at Pounds 0.97 and a good deal stronger against the D-Mark, at around DM2.57. Inflation is expected to remain under control. Following last January's 10 per cent devaluation of the pound, many forecast a headline inflation rate around 3 per cent. Instead, it fell to an annual average of about 1.6 per cent. In spite of prospects for continued economic recovery next year, inflation pressures are expected to remain capped by low oil prices, subdued UK inflation, the strength of the Irish pound, moderate pay increases amid near-17 per cent unemployment and few, if any, indirect tax increases in the January budget. Most analysts are looking for an average headline rate of 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent in 1994. The Irish 10-year yield spread over German bunds narrowed sharply in 1993 after hitting a high of some 300 basis points last January. On Friday, it stood at some 68 basis points, at the low end of its recent 70-90 basis point range. However, although yields are expected to continue falling, many analysts do not expect that gap to get much tighter. If anything, it could widen back to the top of that range in the second half of the year, when UK yields are expected to rise in response to a deterioration in the UK inflation profile. The favourable inflation gap over Germany is likely to be eroded in the course of this year as inflation declines in Germany and rises in Ireland, causing the yield gap to widen. By the year-end, most analysts expect the Irish 10-year yield to be between 5.75-6 per cent, trading at some 80 basis points over bunds.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Help for school fees - John Authers explains how parents can benefit but parents showed signs that they had, finally, worked out how best to plan for paying them. Average fees increased by 8.3 per cent in 1992, according to the latest census of schools by the Independent Schools Information Service (Isis). But this figure includes wide variations. Term fees for boarding schools increased to an average of Pounds 3,125, while day school fees rose to Pounds 1,368. There are also broad regional variations. Boarding school fees range from Pounds 2,003 in Ireland (including both the republic and Ulster) to Pounds 3,532 in Greater London, while day fees vary between Pounds 686 (again in Ireland) to Pounds 1,540 in Greater London and the south-east. More than a quarter of independent pupils now receive financial aid for their fees, most of which comes from schools' bursary and scholarship funds. Indeed, many schools are in such difficult circumstances that, often, they will be prepared to make a contribution just to keep their fee income flowing. The government's assisted places scheme is useful for those on total family incomes of less than Pounds 25,000, and take-up is improving - 31,582 pupils are now benefitting from it. For those who have not saved in advance, Isis has a special reserve plan which provides cheap lending facilities for parents. Draw-down loans come from the Halifax, and you borrow money only when it is needed for another term's fees. This scheme has two big advantages. The first is the rate of interest, which is linked to the Halifax's base rate of 7.99 per cent. If borrowing is likely to be more than Pounds 60,000, the rate charged will be 7.54 per cent; this drops to 7.39 per cent if you borrow more than Pounds 100,000. The second is that there are no strings to how you repay the loan - you are not forced to buy an endowment policy. Michael Kaye of Claremont Savile, the independent adviser which administers the scheme, says: 'Endowment mortgages, long held to be an answer, are no longer attractive and are neither cost-effective nor tax-efficient.' Instead, Claremont Savile steers parents towards the least risky and most tax-efficient investments first. In more complex cases, you can also opt to sell endowments to market-makers - which could give you a big pile of cash - or make them paid-up, thus avoiding further outlay. The Isis scheme has been on offer for a year and now pays out almost Pounds 1m a week to parents. Obviously, it is still better to save in advance; but if your child is about to start school, and you cannot fund fees out of income, there is no need to borrow any more, at any higher cost, than you need.

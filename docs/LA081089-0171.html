			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> REVITALIZED SOVIET PARLIAMENT: 'NEW, REAL POWER' THAT CAN'T BE IGNORED  </P> <P> It surprised Western cynics, occasionally traumatized Communist Party officials  and provided some of the best late-night television entertainment seen here in  a long time.  </P> <P> But most of all, the just concluded premiere session of the revitalized  national legislature served notice that after decades of being run exclusively  from the top down, the system of government here has undergone a fundamental  change.  </P> <P> No one is likely to mistake the Congress of People's Deputies for the  comparatively unfettered U.S. Congress or the British Parliament. But neither  is there any comparison of the new Supreme Soviet with its predecessor, whose  deputies silently raised their hands in such unanimous compliance to the  party's every whim that it set the standard for the term "rubber-stamp  parliament."  </P> <P> "A new, real power has emerged," Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, premier and member of the  Communist Party Politburo, told senior party leaders recently, "and we cannot  ignore the fact."  </P> <P> Listening to weeks of harsh parliamentary criticism of the government's  shortcomings had taught him "the meaning of the word catharsis," Ryzhkov said.  </P> <P> He said the restructured Parliament has already shown itself to be so  aggressive that the mechanisms by which the party traditionally controlled  virtually every aspect of Soviet public life "have become suspended in air."  </P> <P> Earlier, Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, head of the KGB, the feared security agency,  had described his grilling by lawmakers as "the most difficult examination of  my life."  </P> <P> The revitalized Parliament emerged last spring in a highly complex voting  procedure that for the first time forced a majority of the candidates to face  genuine competition. About 85% of those elected were members of the Communist  Party, but the difference now is that most are beholden as much to their  constituents as to the party.  </P> <P> The 2,250 Congress members, who were convened in late May for the first of two  scheduled sessions a year, subsequently elected from among themselves a Supreme  Soviet of 542 members that serves as the full-time Parliament.  </P> <P> "It's a body that has emerged very quickly into a prominent role," a senior  Western diplomat said, "and it's a lot less conservative than many people  thought it would be."  </P> <P> The Supreme Soviet quickly established a precedent by rejecting a dozen of  Ryzhkov's nominees for ministerial posts, effectively making the government  accountable to the public rather than the party for the first time since the  earliest days of the Soviet state.  </P> <P> Several hundred deputies even formed the first organized parliamentary  opposition group that has existed here in 70 years.  </P> <P> The parliamentary sessions, televised live during the initial meeting and  selectively -- on a delayed basis and late at night -- during a six-week  session of the Supreme Soviet, gave millions of ordinary citizens their first  heady taste of genuine political debate.  </P> <P> During the session, some factories reported that up to 20% of their employees  were absent, apparently staying home to watch the debate on television. While  the switch to delayed coverage at night helped, it did not solve the problem.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Up Until 2 A.M.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry," a Moscow woman apologized to her employer when she showed up late  for work one recent morning. She and her husband had got so absorbed in a  lively televised parliamentary debate over economic independence for the Baltic  republics that they were up until 2 a.m., she said sheepishly.  </P> <P> According to Anatoly Lukyanov, first deputy president of the Supreme Soviet,  195 hours of proceedings were shown on television in a little over two months,  making witnesses of millions of ordinary citizens as the deputies boldly  attacked one sacred cow after another.  </P> <P> The televised debates spilled over into the streets, where long-apathetic  Russians could suddenly be overheard talking politics on park benches and in  shopping queues.  </P> <P> Parliamentary debate and the public mood appeared to feed on each other. The  link was most obvious during last month's coal mine strikes.  </P> <P> The miners, many analysts believe, were emboldened by the televised proceedings  to protest what they saw as a system deaf to their needs. And the strikes  triggered an extraordinary special parliamentary session that turned into a  virtual declaration of no confidence in party and government officials at all  levels.  </P> <P> While clearly interested in its work, the general public is far from  enthusiastic about the results it has seen from the Supreme Soviet so far,  according to a weekend poll conducted by the Sociology Institute of the Soviet  Academy of Sciences and published in the newspaper Evening Moscow.  </P> <P> While 70% of Muscovites responding to the survey said the Parliament was more  or less democratic, 39% complained that all the deputies did was talk. Only 6%  described the revitalized legislature as a major step in political reform.  </P> <P> A writer asked rhetorically in the latest issue of the weekly New Times:  "Really, just what are we expecting from the new Supreme Soviet, that it  clothe, feed, and provide better medicine for us? No one seems to be saying so  directly, but in many irritated comments one can see these unfulfilled  expectations: 'We are sick of the empty shops, we must spend weeks to get even  simple items, and meanwhile you are taking a full week to discuss some new  minister!' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Than Just Talk  </P> <P> It may not have fulfilled some of the people's more pressing desires, but the  revitalized Parliament did prove itself capable of more than just talk.  </P> <P> It overrode the government on the language of a new law on political dissent,  sharply narrowing its application and easing the penalties for violators. It  reduced the maximum tax rates on cooperative businesses, giving them a new  lease on life after an administrative backlash that had threatened to destroy  them. It ignored the wishes of the minister of defense to permit draft  exemptions for students. And it more than doubled the minimum pension level,  overriding a government plan to raise the smallest pensions by only one-third.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev described himself in a recent Radio  Moscow interview as "tremendously satisfied" with the new arrangement, which he  described as having laid the groundwork for a genuine separation of powers  between the party and popularly elected soviets, or councils, at all levels.  </P> <P> Gorbachev promised even more dramatic progress at the Supreme Soviet's next  session, and added: "This is why I think that now no one will dare say that  perestroika (restructuring) can stop, come to a standstill. Now we can already  speak of perestroika's irreversibility, although this does not mean that it  will proceed smoothly."  </P> <P> A key test will be elections scheduled no later than next spring for local and  republic-level soviets, Lukyanov said. The main challenge now, he said, is not  so much agreeing at the top on what needs to be done, but implementing  decisions down through the system.  </P> <P> The process "will be largely assisted by renovation of cadres to be achieved  during the coming local and republic elections," Lukyanov said.  </P> <P> A problem in the meantime, a senior Western analyst noted, is that the party  "is losing credibility and power faster than new institutions are developing."  </P> <P> This view was buttressed by the poll published in Evening Moscow, which found  69% of respondents agreeing that the party had lost prestige in the last year.  More than 75% said that the party's constitutional "leading role" in Soviet  society should be modified, and more than 50% said the provision should be  dropped from the constitution.  </P></p>

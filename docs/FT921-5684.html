			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Banco di Napoli advances 11.3% BANCO di Napoli, the big Italian public sector bank which last year floated 20 per cent of its shares on the stock market, raised gross profits before depreciation and provisions by 11.3 per cent to L856bn (Dollars 696m) last year. The bank announced it would issue 53.25m new ordinary shares as part of a L213bn rights issue, reserved for the Italian Treasury. The deal marks the second tranche of a four-stage L850bn plan to bolster its capital ratios via the injection of fresh funds from the public sector. Boosted by the opening of 101 new branches last year, total deposits increased by 14.5 per cent to L75,700bn, while loans rose by 18 per cent to L63,700bn. Total assets for the bank rose to around L97,000bn at the end of last year from L83,000bn in December 1990. Banco di Napoli's net worth jumped by 159 per cent to L4,233bn following the revaluation of its assets as part of Italy's bank reform provisions and the arrival of fresh capital from both private shareholders and the Treasury. Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss confectionery group, has completed its long search to break into the Italian coffee market with agreement to buy Splendid, the country's second biggest coffee brand, from Procter &amp; Gamble Italia. No price for the deal was disclosed. However, Splendid and Caramba, a second brand being acquired, have around 12 per cent of the Italian market, with annual sales of about L140bn.</p>

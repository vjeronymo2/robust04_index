			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAN SLAIN BY EX-WIFE AFTER BREAKING INTO EL CAJON HOME  </P> <P> An El Cajon man was fatally shot when he attempted to attack his ex-wife in her  home, El Cajon police said Thursday.  </P> <P> Edward Mendidles Jr., 42, was shot once in the chest Wednesday night with a  .38-caliber revolver and died a short time later at Sharp Memorial Hospital,  police spokeswoman Julie Palos said. His ex-wife, Linda Sharon Minear, was  questioned by police and released, Palos said.  </P> <P> At 6:47 p.m., officers responded to a report of shots being fired at a home in  the 1400 block of Naranca Avenue, Palos said. They found Mendidles lying on the  floor with a bullet wound in his chest, she said.  </P> <P> Minear told police that she shot Mendidles when he broke down her back door and  came toward her making threats, Palos said.  </P> <P> Minear told police that her 1966 marriage to Mendidles ended in 1968, and they  did not speak to each other until last June, when Mendidles called and asked  her on a date, Palos said. During their new courtship, Minear said that  Mendidles drank heavily and abused her.  </P> <P> Although Minear filed and later dropped an assault with a deadly weapon  complaint against Mendidles in October, he moved into her El Cajon home earlier  this month, Palos said. Minear told police that on the day of the shooting  Mendidles was drinking heavily and she locked him out of the house because she  believed her life was in danger, Palos said.  </P> <P> An autopsy and toxicological tests will be performed.  </P></p>

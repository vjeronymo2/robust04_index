			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Big business gives its verdict Andrew Buxton chairman, Barclays Bank 'It was a low-key but constructive Budget with plenty of encouragement for small businesses and the unemployed. It was clear that with the economy set fair he did not want to upset the apple cart. The transitional relief for business rates will be particularly welcome news for small firms. His PSBR predictions are in line with current CBI forecasts and if he can get us in balance in three years' time then it will have been a great achievement and may even allow for some tax-cutting measures at the end of next year. All this is against the backdrop of a stable, low-inflation environment.' ***** Peter Jarvis chief executive, Whitbread 'I am delighted the chancellor has held duty rates for a second year and has recognised the cross-Channel problem. However, he cannot rely on European action and will need to go further by actually cutting rates unless he wants to see pubs closing all over the country.' Simon Ward, Whitbread's strategic affairs director, said: 'The cross-Channel issue is not going to go away. It won't be easy to convince the French to raise their duty rates. I don't see why they should hike their rates just to please the UK government in what is a self-imposed problem. We would have preferred the chancellor to reduce the rate of beer duty to that more in line with current French levels - 5p a pint, compared with over 30p in the UK.' ***** Sir Brian Pearse chairman, Lucas 'Companies such as ours have worked extremely hard through the recession to improve global competitiveness. We welcome this 'steady as she goes' Budget that should enable us to continue this improvement in the UK and overseas. However, we are disappointed with the apparent erosion of the differential on duties on diesel and unleaded petrol because of the proven economic and environmental advantages of diesel. Overall, the Budget strengthens our quiet confidence in the future. We were hoping the chancellor would not treat this year as one for dramatic changes. We wanted minimum interference from the chancellor and that is what has happened.' ***** Sir Lawrie Barratt chairman, Barratt Developments 'Unfortunately the chancellor has not announced any measures to stimulate the UK housing market. The market had been improving until September's half point interest rate rise. This increase was totally unnecessary and I believe the chancellor should have taken the opportunity to reverse this interest rate rise . . . and restore housebuyers' confidence. Furthermore, nothing was done for the 10m homeowners with mortgages who have suffered so greatly in recent years as their mortgage tax relief has been eroded. This erosion has had a damaging effect on the UK housing market. All in all, I think the government should accept that a strong and stable housing market is crucial to the recovery of the economy in general.' ***** Ian Prosser chairman, Bass 'There were no particular surprises in the Budget, although I was disappointed that the chancellor did not reduce beer duty and that he felt it necessary to impose gaming licence duty on amusement machines. However, I am glad that he recognised the cross-Channel problem and that he will address the issue with our European counterparts. I hope they will listen. Given the strength of the economy, I hope he will have the flexibility to cut excise duty rates next year. Overall, however, the chancellor's priorities were correct and I would agree with his objective of sustaining strong UK economic growth through investment and exports.' ***** Sir Trevor Chinn chairman, Lex Services 'The Budget message from the chancellor to industry was that the economy is now heading in the right direction. It was a 'steady as she goes' Budget and he is absolutely right to pursue a low-inflation economy as the fruits of this will eventually feed through into increased consumer expenditure. This will obviously help industry and benefit businesses like our own. His move to reduce VAT on leased cars seems to be favourable to our own particular industry, although it is impossible to quantify its impact at this stage.' ***** David Simon chief executive, BP Group 'This is a Budget which should please business. It is broadly revenue-neutral and it proposes no changes that would jeopardise steady recovery and the continuing squeeze on inflation. It demonstrates that public expenditure is clearly under control and sound fiscal and monetary policy is in place. Additional support for UK exporters will help continued growth. The strength of UK companies in export markets is a very encouraging feature of current performance in the economy. The chancellor's measures to promote the success of small companies and to encourage recruitment of the long-term unemployed are also helpful.'</p>

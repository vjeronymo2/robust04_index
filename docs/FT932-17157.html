			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / A search for justice in east Germany's property mire: The woes facing legislators trying to accommodate a million victims of Nazi and Soviet confiscations MR FRED Kaufmann fled Nazi Germany in March 1938. He left behind in Gorlitz, in south-eastern Germany, a textile factory that had been in the family for two generations. Since October 1990, Mr Kaufmann has been trying to reclaim the property. Like many others Mr Kaufmann has presented to the local restitution office sheafs of legal documents proving his family's entitlement to the property. But a combination of red tape and inefficiency has prevented him from winning it back. His efforts have coincided with several attempts by the federal government to come up with a law aimed at financing compensation claims and settling the property question in eastern Germany. After more than two years of wrangling, the cabinet presented its final draft this week. But Mr Kaufmann is dismissive. 'It is an outrageous law because it is taking from those whose property was taken away from them in the first place.' The draft law is based on the terms of the unification treaty. Under it, individuals whose property was confiscated between 1935 and 1945, and between 1949 and 1990, have the legal right to seek compensation or restitution. Those whose property was expropriated by the Soviet occupation forces between 1945 and 1949 will receive only limited compensation. Many of these are 'Junkers', the large landowners in eastern Germany, who feel a deep sense of injustice about being denied the right to restitution. However, in an effort to attract foreign investment in eastern Germany, the government has already passed a law that allows investors to have priority over restitution claims. Under this law, the investor must pay the claimant full compensation at current market value. This, however, has not sped up investment in the five new eastern German states because because there are vast differences of opinion about what property is worth. Also, property developers are reluctant to invest until they are sure there are no outstanding claims on the property. More than 1.1m individuals have claimed title to 2.5m holdings up to December 31 1992, the final date for doing so. Fewer than 15 per cent of the claims have been resolved. The Berlin Federal Office for the Settlement of Property Questions says it could take another decade to sort the rest out. But it is not only these provisions in the law which are upsetting Mr Kaufmann, former large land owners, and those who owned small plots of land. What they are angry about is the way the government is seeking to finance those seeking compensation. The draft law states that those who get their property back must pay a tax as a means of financing those who are compensated. The government has put aside a compensation fund worth DM12bn, (Pounds 5bn) out of which DM3.5bn would be raised from this form of taxation. The complicated tax structure would be based on the 1935 land value of property. For example, the value of a property at that time would be multiplied by 10. From that final amount, the claimant would pay a third to the finance ministry. Those who were able to prove that they intend to invest in the region would, in most cases, be exempt from paying tax. As for those seeking compensation, they would receive payment based on 1935 land valuations which would then be multiplied by a certain amount depending on the type of property. The maximum amount of compensation paid out to any individual would not exceed DM950,000, regardless of the size of the property and today's value. They would be exempt from tax, but they would not receive any compensation until after 1995. The present bill is unlikely to please constitutional lawyers either. Mr Hansjurgen Schafer, head of the federal office for the settlement of property questions, said the bill would have to be referred to the constitutional court. 'The point is that lawyers will argue that property is not being treated equally. Why, they will ask, should those who get their property back pay tax, while those who receive compensation for property be exempt from tax?' But even if the constitutional court upheld the draft law, there is no certainty that the bureaucratic and local opposition towards giving back property to either those now living in western Germany or those forced to emigrate before or after the Second World War will diminish. Mr Kaufmann is willing to persist in getting his property back, or at least obtaining official recognition that he is entitled to full compensation if an investor chooses to buy his land: 'I am fighting for a principle and for a right. The law says I am entitled to get my property back. I will not give up until justice is done.'</p>

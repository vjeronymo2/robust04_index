			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Arts: Concern for the young - Radio RADIO 1, with its usual concern for the young, gave Rape is a Four-letter Word on Monday (International Women's Day, celebrated only on Radio 2). Radio 1 followed a listen-to-me title with sensible advice from a judge, police officers, 'agony aunts' of both male - and female-oriented journals and a psychologist. It is reckoned that only one rape in ten is reported; in three-quarters of those that are, the woman knows her partner. The expert presenter was Nicky Campbell, and he chaired a live discussion afterwards. 'I was very drunk,' one victim admitted. 'I was only fifteen.' More such programmes are clearly needed, with items like the helpline on 0800 850 800. And indeed next day Radios 1 and 2 had a joint 90-minute phone-in, Talking 'bout my Generation, where the young and the adult voiced their respective concerns. What I heard was sadly full of old, rather Tory, thoughts. But next Monday Radio 1 begins its three-part Consequences about rape, pregnancy and parenthood. In the circumstances, Saturday's Body Politics, Radio 3 on sex in the 1920s, had less than its potential interest. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Out of the Shadows, about the 1920s movies, was good on the reactions of European directors to the post-war explosion of the industry (led by the Americans); and Friday gave us two giants of the decade, Le Corbusier and TS Eliot. Radio 3's Sunday play, Sarah Woods's Silence in Blue kept the sex offstage. Lisa, crossed in love and sad at an abortion, goes to Australia to recuperate, but decides instead to drown herself scuba-diving, when her unborn child flies up to the skies. A mixture of simple travel-information and interior thought, this struck me as one of the silliest plays I ever heard. On Monday, Radio 4 did better with Nothing Happens in Carmincross, adapted by Mike Gerrard from Benedict Kiely's novel. The title represents the New York thoughts of Mervyn, an Irish-American; but how wrong he is, for Carmincross is in Northern Ireland, Radio 4's top drama locale. Mervyn (Ian McElhinney) links up with Deborah (Kate Binchy), an old flame followed about by her neglected consort Mandrake. After a look at Ireland, they attend a wedding party at a Carmincross hotel; a warning comes from the IRA, then a bomb that breaks up the party but reconciles Deb and Mandrake. This is reported in New York as a 'distraction'. Eoin O'Callaghan was the director. Neil Kinnock was John Humphrys's victim in his courteously critical series On the Ropes (Radio 4, Monday). He was frank about what he confessed as errors and expressed no hope of being Party-leader again. Perhaps he should be in Radio 4's Friday series, Famous for 15 Minutes. The Ghost of Thomas Kempe is a great story by Penelope Lively read through the week by Willie Rushton - the first Radio 5 youth-offering I have really liked, except the cricket. Kemp turns up in our own day as a poltergeist in the house where 10-year-old James lives, and tries to involve him in his activities, to everyone's alarm. Full of fun, and very well done. On Sundays, the World Service series on South Asia has been covering religions. I caught this week's, on the Parsees and the Indian Jews. I learnt much about the Zoroastrian Parsees and their devotion to Ahura Mazda. Their numbers are dwindling, due to a housing scarcity, though the Hindoos have always been on good terms, apart from their Towers of Silence for the dead, which will not do in multi-storey Bombay. The Jewish settlements are diminishing too - they tend to move westward to Israel.</p>

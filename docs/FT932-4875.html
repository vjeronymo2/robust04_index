			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: Substantial demand for Shangri-la share float SHANGRI-LA Asia's flotation of 150m shares is expected to be oversubscribed by about 97 to 100 times, according to Schroders Asia, which is managing the offer, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Schroders Asia says that the flotation appears to have drawn more than HKDollars 70bn (USDollars 9bn) out of Hong Kong's money markets. The flotation is poised to raise HKDollars 735m for the company, the hotel arm of the Kuok Group of Malaysia. Trading in the shares is expected to begin on June 17. In February, a flotation by Denway Investments, whose main asset is a stake in a south China car factory, attracted HKDollars 240bn in applications - equivalent to more than one-third of Hong Kong's annual gross domestic product - when it was oversubscribed a record 658 times. That issue prompted the colony's monetary authority to study ways to avoid strains on the banking system. Mr Joseph Yam, head of the authority, said banks had followed guidelines to curb borrowing for the Shangri-la issue. 'We wanted to ensure that the flow of this substantial amount of money was smooth and that there was no disruption to the financial system,' Mr Yam said. The Kuok Group will hold 59 per cent of Shangri-la after the listing, and Beijing-controlled China Resources (Holdings) 8 per cent. Shangri-la holds hotels in Hong Kong and China, and commercial, residential and office complexes on the mainland. The Hong Kong stock exchange said Chinese and Hong Kong securities authorities will sign a memorandum of regulatory co-operation in Beijing on June 19, Reuter adds. It paves the way for nine Chinese companies to list shares in the colony within the month. Signatories will include the stock exchanges of Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen as well as China's Securities Regulatory Commission and Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission.</p>

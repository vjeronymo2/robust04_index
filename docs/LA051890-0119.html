			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLYLEVEN CAN SHARE BLAME IN 6-3 LOSS  </P> <P> The offense he criticized so scathingly last Saturday provided him with an  early lead and later got him off the hook, so Bert Blyleven could not complain  about lack of support Thursday.  </P> <P> Nor did he utter a peep about his teammates' failures, focusing instead on his  own efforts in the Angels' 6-3 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers.  </P> <P> "I'd like to have one pitch back, but what can you do?" Blyleven said,  referring to Greg Vaughn's three-run homer in the second inning. "You keep  going out there and battling and try to turn it around. You just try to be  consistent, that's all."  </P> <P> Blyleven did not pitch badly over six innings, walking three, striking out five  and yielding only the runs on Vaughn's third home run of the season. Angel  Manager Doug Rader had found fault with the location of some of Blyleven's  pitches after the 39-year-old right-hander tired in his last outing, but Rader  saw little that displeased him Thursday.  </P> <P> "Bert threw one poor pitch and unfortunately that led to a three-run home run,"  Rader said. "I thought he pitched extremely well. We just didn't put anything  together. We didn't get it done in the first inning, when we had to get it  done. We got the bases loaded in the first inning with no one out and only got  one run."  </P> <P> The Angels appeared ready to back Blyleven heartily in the first after singles  by Luis Polonia and Max Venable and a walk to Wally Joyner, but the threat  fizzled when Chili Davis struck out, Dante Bichette forced Joyner at second --  scoring Polonia -- and Johnny Ray popped to short.  </P> <P> After Vaughn had powered what Blyleven called "a major league hanging  curveball" into the left-field seats with two out in the second inning, the  Angels countered in the third on a double by Joyner and a single by Davis to  cut the lead to one run. They tied the score, 3-3, in the sixth inning on a  walk, an error by Vaughn and a single by Lance Parrish.  </P> <P> But Willie Fraser, in his first appearance since his recall from triple-A  Edmonton on Monday, couldn't hold Milwaukee in the seventh.  </P> <P> The Brewers scored three times on four hits, none of which could have been  mistaken for a blast, burdening Fraser with his second loss in as many  decisions and handing the Angels their sixth loss in eight games and 20th in  28.  </P> <P> Paul Molitor, Gary Sheffield, Robin Yount and Dave Parker singled in succession  for two runs, then Greg Brock drove in Yount with the final run on a sacrifice  fly.  </P> <P> "I thought (Fraser) threw better than when he left," Rader said. "He gave up  one broken-bat hit, one jammed base hit, then one legitimate hit. I thought he  threw pretty well, much better than how it all came out."  </P> <P> That it came out a loss left Fraser frustrated.  </P> <P> "When you're going the way I'm going right now, that's the way it's going to  happen," said Fraser, who had been optioned to Edmonton on April 30 for three  starts and came back with a split-finger fastball to replace his ineffective  forkball.  </P> <P> "I made a few good pitches and a few bad. I just basically didn't get the job  done. I had a chance to get a win and we lost. That's the only thing that  bothers me.  </P> <P> "The pitch Yount hit was breaking down pretty good. The pitch to Sheffield was  up. Parker hit a ground ball that just found a hole. That's the way it goes  when you're struggling."  </P> <P> That is precisely what the Angels are doing. They had a chance to take the lead  in the seventh when Kent Anderson led off with a double, but he had to hold  when Polonia grounded out. He tagged on Brian Downing's fly to right but was  stranded when Joyner grounded out to second.  </P> <P> "We had our chances to go ahead," Joyner said. "We just need to keep going out  there and playing well. We'll have our opportunity and we'll start turning it  around."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Infielder Mark McLemore was put on the 15-day disabled list Thursday because of  a sprained right wrist and suspected break in his navicular bone, the bone  between the thumb and the wrist. He injured it in the fifth inning Wednesday,  when he fell while rounding first on a double. X-rays taken here were  inconclusive and he returned to California for further examination.  </P> <P> Center fielder Devon White was scratched from the starting lineup because of a  sore left thumb. He came in as a defensive replacement in the seventh. . . .  Pitcher Jim Abbott watched tapes of his 1 1/3-inning, four-walk performance  Wednesday with pitching coach Marcel Lachemann and said they had found some  mechanical flaws that might explain his woes.  </P></p>

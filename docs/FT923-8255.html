			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / US demands action on human rights THE US has called for all those violating international humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere to be named and brought to justice. In a strongly-worded speech to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, Mr Morris Abram, US ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said yesterday many such crimes fell within the jurisdiction of domestic courts or military courts-martial. 'Trial before an international tribunal is another possibility,' he said. Mr Abram, a veteran civil rights campaigner who was on the team at the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal, said countries were reluctant to take effective action against those abusing human rights. 'The standards and laws are out there, all that is required is action - in particular, action against those who commit acts of genocide and torture.' Mr Abram was speaking ahead of a two-day session of the Human Rights Commission, starting tomorrow on human rights violations in the Yugoslav republics. A US-drafted resolution to be put to the 53-member Commission, which has support from other, so far mostly western, countries, condemns 'widespread, massive and grave violations' of fundamental human rights and the practice of 'ethnic cleansing'. It calls for appointment of a special rapporteur to investigate abuses, the immediate release of all those arbitrarily detained and immediate access for the International Committee of the Red Cross to all detention camps and prisons. The resolution also reminds countries of their obligations under international humanitarian law, in particular that individuals are responsible for their actions and that states are accountable for rights violations committed by their agents on another state's territory. This would pave the way for possible action against Serbia for atrocities perpetrated by Serbian forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Some 36 Yugoslavs were deported from Britain last month, the Home Office confirmed last night. They had come via other countries where they had already claimed asylum and were being returned to those states in accordance with the international convention on the treatment of refugees, an official said. About 4,000 Yugoslavs a month were being allowed to enter Britain as visitors.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Securities gains behind sharp Uni Storebrand rise UNI Storebrand, Norway's largest insurance group, yesterday announced sharply improved first half pre-tax profits to NKr689m (Dollars 94.8m) from NKr79m in the same period last year, helped by substantial gains on securities. The group boosted net operating income to NKr10.93bn from NKr10.1bn. The increase was achieved despite a loss in premium income by the life business which saw market share decline by 2.8 percentage points to 31.9 per cent in terms of premiums written during the last year. Uni said group operating expenses had been cut by 2.67 per cent during the six-month interim to NKr8.69bn from NKr9.3bn. Although the payroll was reduced by 286 employees to 4,221 during the period, the full effect of cost reductions is not yet apparent due to terms and conditions of voluntary redundancy arrangements, the company explained. Gains on securities hit NKr1.41bn, including a NKr213m net gain on the disposal of the group's 25 per cent stake in Skandia, Sweden's biggest insurer, against a loss of NKr690m last year. Uni said unrealised gains on a consolidated basis rose by NKr1.5bn during the second quarter and stood at NKr3.6bn at end-June. However, by the end of last month unrealised gains had increased further to NKr3.81bn. Uni pledged to place particular emphasis on quality assurance in future as part of measures to regain market confidence in the group following its release on July 13 from public administration. Uni collapsed last August under the weight of NKr3.8bn debt taken on to but the Skandia shares in a failed attempt to gain control of the company. The group's shares were relisted on the Oslo bourse in mid-June and NKr4.3bn was raised through share and bond issues in a major recapitalisation of the group. Uni said it made cash settlements to creditors last month whose claims had fallen due and been approved. The settlements involved full payment of principal, together with interest of about 11 per cent per year and reduced Uni's external debt and cash holdings by NKr4.3bn.</p>

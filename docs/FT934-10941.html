			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / People: Curry takes top meat job A Northumberland farmer by profession, Don Curry, 49, has been appointed by the government as acting chairman of the Meat and Livestock Commission; he had been deputy chairman of the MLC since December 1991. The MLC's former chairman, Geoffrey John, has moved to take up the post of chairman with Food From Britain. Chairing the MLC is a three-day-a-week job. Besides his farming interests, Curry is chairman of a livestock marketing co-operative based in Ponteland, also in Northumberland. He first joined the MLC in 1986, having attracted ministerial notice through his work on the council of the National Farmers' Union. Although not full-time, the MLC is nevertheless a demanding job, with 'a lot of public relations, meetings and committees to attend, representing the MLC at various events,' says Curry. He describes it as 'a very important body with an annual budget of Pounds 2m for research and development projects aimed at improving the long-term efficiency of the industry'. Probably the most publicly visible activity of the MLC in recent months has been its controversial advertising campaign using the slogan 'Meat to live'. 'I don't think that is taking things too far,' says Curry. 'We take a responsible view of our advertising. There is a lot of nonsense talked about meat-eating. There is an awful lot of advertising which one could look at and ask if what it is saying is actually correct.' Curry says that 'when and if' he was asked by the government to stay on permanently as chairman he would have to give it serious consideration. For the moment Gillian Shephard, the new agriculture minister, has just begun to get her feet under the table; the temporary nature of Curry's MLC post may well change once Shephard has sorted out a few sheep from goats.</p>

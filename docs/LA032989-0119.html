			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOT GUILTY OF MURDERING FRIEND'S BROTHER;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM MAN CELEBRATES HIS RELEASE  </P> <P> After a jury found him not guilty of murder in the shooting death of his best  friend's brother, Keith Roberts enjoyed his first full day of freedom Tuesday  since his arrest in October.  </P> <P> "He's got a date tonight, and I think that's great," Roberts' mother, Pamela  Spangrud, said Tuesday. "(Last night) he had a few beers. That was the first  thing he wanted to do."  </P> <P> Roberts was found not guilty by an Orange County Superior Court jury in the  slaying of John Valle. Jurors ruled Monday that Roberts acted in self-defense.  </P> <P> The shooting occurred Oct. 16 during a party at an Anaheim house that Roberts  and friends had rented. Roberts, who was recovering from a herniated disk, was  in his room when Valle entered. The two argued, Roberts ordered him to leave,  and a fight began.  </P> <P> Roberts took out a .357-caliber magnum pistol and fired a warning shot into the  floor. When Valle kept coming toward him, Roberts fatally shot him, he told  police.  </P> <P> "I thought it was a case that shouldn't have been filed," said Roberts'  attorney, Deputy Public Defender Brian L. Ducker. "This was as clear a case of  self-defense as you will ever see. . . . It's a travesty that he spent that  much time in jail."  </P> <P> Both Spangrud and Ducker said 5 months in jail, marked by a bout with  pneumonia, hindered Roberts' recovery from his back injury. Roberts was also  threatened by friends of Valle, Ducker said.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Melvin L. Jensen said he was not "terribly pleased" with the  jury's decision.  </P> <P> During the trial, Jensen argued against self-defense, contending that Roberts  used excessive force and that he did not try to get help from people in the  next room.  </P> <P> "He was armed with a .357 magnum, which you might say is an equalizer, and he  was also bigger," Jensen said.  </P> <P> Spangrud said her son's first priority is to get medical treatment for his back  ailment. Then, she said, he will try to renew his friendship with Mike Valle,  the dead man's brother.  </P> <P> "He (Roberts) really feels bad about John," she said. "He knew the whole  family, and he and Mike were very close. I think the two will make up because  Mike knew what his brother was like. They all knew. He (John Valle) just wanted  to cause problems."  </P></p>

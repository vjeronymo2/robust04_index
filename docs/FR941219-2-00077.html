			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Failure to collect copayments or deductibles for a specific group of Medicare patients for reasons unrelated to indigency (e.g., a supplier waives coinsurance or deductible for all patients from a particular hospital, in order to get referrals).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Insurance programs'' which cover copayments or deductibles only for items or services provided by the entity offering the insurance. The ``insurance premium'' paid by the beneficiary is insignificant and can be as low as $1 a month or even $1 a year. These premiums are not based upon actuarial risks, but instead are a sham used to disguise the routine waiver of copayments and deductibles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D. Special Fraud Alert: Hospital Incentives to Physicians  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Issued May 1992)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Why Do Hospitals Provide Economic Incentives to Physicians?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As many hospitals have become more aggressive in their attempts to recruit and retain physicians and increase patient referrals, physician incentives (sometimes referred to as ``practice enhancements'') are becoming increasingly common. Some physicians actively solicit such incentives. These incentives may result in reductions in the physician's professional expenses or an increase in his or her revenues. In exchange, the physician is aware that he or she is often expected to refer the majority, if not all, of his or her patients to the hospital providing the incentives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Why Is it Illegal for Hospitals to Provide Financial Incentives to Physicians for Their Referrals?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Inspector General has become aware of a variety of hospital incentive programs used to compensate physicians (directly or indirectly) for referring patients to the hospital. These arrangements are implicated by the anti-kickback statute because they can constitute remuneration offered to induce, or in return for, the referral of business paid for by Medicare or Medicaid. In addition, they are not protected under the existing ``safe harbor'' regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These incentive programs can interfere with the physician's judgment of what is the most appropriate care for a patient. They can inflate costs to the Medicare program by causing physicians to overuse inappropriately the services of a particular hospital. The incentives may result in the delivery of inappropriate care to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients by inducing the physician to refer patients to the hospital providing financial incentives rather than to another hospital (or non-acute care facility) offering the best or most appropriate care for that patient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Suspect Hospital Incentive Arrangements_What To Look For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To help identify suspect incentive arrangements, examples of practices which are often questionable are listed [below]. Please note that this list is not intended to be exhaustive but, rather, to suggest some indicators of potentially unlawful activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Payment of any sort of incentive by the hospital each time a physician refers a patient to the hospital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The use of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment (in facilities usually located close to the hospital).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing or other staff services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Free training for a physician's office staff in such areas as management techniques, CPT coding and laboratory techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Guarantees which provide that, if the physician's income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital will supplement the remainder up to a certain amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Low-interest or interest-free loans, or loans which may be ``forgiven'' if a physician refers patients (or some number of patients) to the hospital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Payment of the cost of a physician's travel and expenses for conferences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Payment for a physician's continuing education courses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Coverage on hospitals' group health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Payment for services (which may include consultations at the hospital) which require few, if any, substantive duties by the physician, or payment for services in excess of the fair market value of services rendered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

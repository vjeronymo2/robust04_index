So far, 19 counties of the province have used aerial seeding  on 64,667 hectares, and have seen trees grown on 29,300  hectares, including 15 large stretches of forest each with an  area of 667 hectares.    With vast areas of arid land and deserts, Gansu only has a  forest cover of 3.9 percent, far from the national average of  13.63 percent.    Local governments have worked out regulations and set up  more  than 30 permanent stations for tree management and protection  work in areas to conduct regular aerial seeding, in a bid to  guarantee the success of the aerial seeding.    Aerial seeding, which is said to be cheaper than manual  afforestation, has not only helped grow more trees for Gansu,  but also helped reduce soil erosion by 80 percent, said local  officials, adding that they will grow more trees on more land by  way of aerial seeding in the coming years.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Curtain rises on the millennium - The arts world is queueing up to dip into the lottery financed honey-pot The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, would like Pounds 45m to bring its back stage facilities out of the Dark Ages while the Tate Gallery is thinking more in terms of Pounds 50m for its new Museum of Modern Art. The South Bank Centre has made a bid for a modest Pounds 40m to smarten itself up and the museum quarter of Kensington, including the Royal Albert Hall, could quite easily absorb Pounds 150m in its grandiose plan, designed by Sir Norman Foster, to become the arts and educational centre of the world. These are London's front runners for millennium money, the lottery financed honey-pot designed to give the nation permanent reminders of 2001. Throw in the supporters of a dance house for London, and a project for a big screen Imax cinema at Waterloo, and it becomes obvious that there will be many disappointed candidates. The millennium is almost seven years away but already the contenders for its largesse are jostling for attention. The government plans to exploit January 1 2001 to the full. It has set aside a fifth of the revenues raised by the National Lottery for a Millennium Fund, which will both celebrate this trick of the calendar, and leave lasting memorials for the pleasure of future generations. Just how impressive they will be depends on the gambling instincts of the British public. The most cautious estimate, favoured by Peter Brooke, secretary at the department of National Heritage and the minister responsible for launching the Lottery, anticipates annual turnover of Pounds 1.5b, of which around 25 per cent is to be split between five good causes - the arts, sport, heritage, charities, and the Millennium Fund. This would leave the fund around Pounds 75m a year to distribute. Optimists think Brooke is too conservative. They estimate that the lottery could build up to at least Pounds 3b a year, giving the Fund over Pounds 150m. The seven Millennium Fund commissioners, who along with Brooke and Michael Heseltine will decide how the money is spent, have now been chosen. They are a carefully mixed group, with Lord Dalkeith based in Scotland, Sir John Hall in the north east, Robin Dixon in Northern Ireland, and so on, with journalist Simon Jenkins supplying the metropolitan touch. In the summer they will issue guidelines for prospective beneficiaries. Early next year, when the lottery comes on stream, they will announce the chosen projects. The commissioners plan to be independently minded and relish their freedom from government interference. But Brooke, who chairs the fund, has admitted to a few prejudices which might influence their thinking. For a start millennium projects must be spread around the country. Brooke also wants them to be limited to half a dozen, perhaps eight, major developments which will leave a real mark on the 21st century. The commissioners are unlikely to be too impressed by the barrage of arts applications. As well as the London based projects, Cardiff hopes to receive around Pounds 30m for an opera house on its revitalised Bay; Glasgow expects that, as the recently appointed home of the planned Museum of Scottish Art, it is in the frame for roughly the same sum; the Salford Opera House is up and running; and there is a plan to convert the Baltic Flour Mill on the Tyne into a museum of contemporary art for a modest Pounds 10m. Although there will be undoubtedly be cultural beneficiaries from the fund, the commissioners are keenly aware that their money comes from the bets of the man in the street and they want to spread the benefits fairly. Arts organisations may have been the first to throw their hats in the ring but many punters will regard sport as equally in need of new facilities and will favour Manchester's bid for a national sports arena. And what of the villages and small towns away from the big cities: how will the buyers of lottery tickets there benefit from the fund? The commissioners are open to ideas. They could look kindly on a major engineering project, a new bridge across the Forth, the Mersey, the Avon, or the Thames. They might well want to stimulate the nation's engineers and scientists with a millennium scholarship fund. Environmentalists are lobbying for a new national forest, or perhaps a complete pathway round the coast. The nation's greatest heritage site, Stonehenge, could finally receive the protected setting its fame deserves. There is also the idea, from the Royal Society of Arts, for a Festival 2001 which would encourage 2001 initiatives at grass roots level. The RSA was the force behind the Great Exhibition of 1851, and the Festival of Britain a century later, and its plan to let ordinary people achieve their ideals will be taken seriously. The 1851 Great Exhibition gave the nation the South Kensington museums; the 1951 show, the South Bank arts complex. The RSA expects that the grass roots initiatives will attract money locally and be topped up by the fund. This is also the thinking behind Covent Garden's re-development proposal, which has been promised multi-million pound donations from Lord Sainsbury and Vivien Duffield, and that of the Tate Gallery. Brooke has said he will favour projects that can prove their popularity by attracting money from supporters. London cannot walk away with much more of the funding than its population deserves, plus perhaps a little more as the nation's showcase, and already some London based projects are planning life without millennium money. These alternatives also tend to revolve around the lottery, but involve the slices of its revenue to be distributed to the arts, by the Arts Council, and the heritage, via the National Heritage Fund. Covent Garden and the South Bank are eyeing the arts pot, although the belief is that the Arts Council will look after the smaller, under Pounds 10m, development projects. The Heritage Fund might consider the Tate, or even Albertropolis within its remit. There is also the possibility of joint applications. The Tate Gallery should announce this month its preferred site for its new museum, with the abandoned Bankside power station on the Thames the front runner. But if the vacant spot alongside the South Bank was chosen instead there could be a joint regeneration scheme for this key site with the South Bank Centre, stressing its importance as the first glimpse of the UK for travellers arriving at Waterloo Station, the rail arrival point for Euro Tunnel. The commissioners have plenty of options but not much time. Their task will be completed at the end of 2000, when, in theory, their fifth of the National Lottery revenue gets re-distributed among the four remaining worthy causes. They will want to get the major projects underway next year. But, given the national fondness for a gamble, it is quite possible that by the late 1990s they will be receiving larger tranches of money than they currently anticipate.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UN force deployed in Cambodia THE United Nations yesterday strengthened efforts to bring order to Cambodia, sending Indonesian soldiers to monitor a ceasefire in the centre of the country and announcing plans to deploy a further 4,000 peacekeeping troops and police in the next few weeks. The announcements by Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, and Lt Gen John Sanderson, the commander of UN forces, were welcomed by diplomats and aid workers. Fighting since January around Kompong Thom in central Cambodia between leftist Khmer Rouge guerrillas and the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government had raised fears for the future of the peace accord signed in Paris last year, and for the programme to repatriate 375,000 refugees from Thailand. A meeting yesterday of the Supreme National Council, a body which brings together leaders of the main Cambodian factions agreed that returning refugees would not be prosecuted. Officials of the UN High Commission for Refugees, meanwhile, said they would be allowed to visit Khmer Rouge-controlled territory in Battambang province for the first time next week to look for suitable land for returnees.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Greenalls improves 7% to Pounds 26m - Expanding pub chain outperforms local rivals GREENALLS Group, the Lancashire-based pubs and hotels operator, achieved a 7 per cent increase, to Pounds 25.8m, in pre-tax profits for the half year to March 27. Mr Andrew Thomas, managing director, said the business climate 'continues to be difficult. We have not seen any sign of a real upturn in consumer spending.' Trading profits rose from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 23.9m on the back of a 5.6 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 238.2m. Fully diluted earnings rose from 11.7p to 12.5p and the interim dividend is increased to 4.84p - a 10 per cent rise on last time's 4.4p. In spite of the recession, the group's 1,368 pubs raised operating profits by 7.6 per cent to Pounds 20.7m, outperforming the industry in its trading area. Drinks sales were 3.5 per cent higher though volumes were down overall by nearly 6 per cent. Food sales grew some 24 per cent, partly reflecting an increase in the number of managed food houses. Nearly Pounds 9m was spent on pub refurbishment, and the 40 pubs acquired from Allied-Lyons for Pounds 10.2m at the end of March were expected to boost the estate's second half performance. Operating profits from the 104 catering inns and restaurants were 42 per cent higher at Pounds 3.1m. Another 13 establishments were being developed as part of the division's expansion programme. Profits from Cellar 5, the off-licence chain, advanced from Pounds 1.45m to Pounds 1.81m. The operation has yet to feel the full benefits of the 187 Blayney shops bought from Vaux. The drinks and services division, encompassing amusement machines and drinks distribution and wholesaling, raised profits by 8.6 per cent to Pounds 3.42m. Trading conditions continued difficult for De Vere hotels in the UK. Operating profits declined 11 per cent to Pounds 6.08m as occupancy rates fell from 57 per cent to 53 per cent. Advance bookings for the autumn have been improving, however, and the operation is expected to benefit in the second half from a new hotel at Swindon, and the recently-opened golf hotel in Cheshire. Losses in the US hotels operation were cut from Pounds 959,000 to Pounds 677,000. Profits from the disposal of properties fell from Pounds 2.89m to Pounds 1.96m, reflecting the group's decision to curtail sales until the market improves. Net debt stands at Pounds 213m, representing 26.6 per cent of shareholders' funds.</p>

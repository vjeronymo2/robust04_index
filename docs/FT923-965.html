			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Technology: Filofax becomes computer-literate Filofaxes were one of the indispensable business accessories of the 1980s but computerised equivalents, in the form of personal information management software programs, were much slower to take off. Now Threadz, a UK software company, and Lotus Development of the US are hoping to change that by teaming up to offer the Lotus Organiser, the first personal organiser for the increasingly popular Windows computer environment. The Lotus Organiser retains the look and feel of a traditional leather-bound organiser but has Windows capabilities with features such as SmartIcons which are common to all Lotus-authored Windows applications. Via a mouse or tracker ball, the user can switch between six sections - Diary, To-do List, Planner, Address Book, Notepad and Anniversary - and information in different sections can be linked for quick reference.

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Nato Summit: Worner call to avoid dividing Europe anew Opening the Nato summit, Mr Manfred Worner, secretary general, set out five 'tremendous challenges' for the alliance. The following are extracts: 'First, the transatlantic relationship and its importance have to be reaffirmed. Our support for the European security and defence identity must be equally clear and firm. 'Transatlantic solidarity and European integration are not alternatives, let alone contradictions. Europe must gain in unity and strength, in order to assume its share of responsibility in our alliance. 'This is as much in the interest of the alliance as of North America and of Europe. Nato reform and European integration have to be seen in connection to each other. . . 'Second, in order to stabilise the whole of Europe we have to give a new quality to the co-operation with our partners. The initiative Partnership for Peace does exactly this. . . 'We will not allow anyone or anything to manoeuvre our alliance into a false alternative: to have to choose between Russia and the other co-operation partners. 'Our message to Russia has been consistent and clear ever since, after our summit in London, you sent me to Moscow to extend the hand of friendship: 'Yes' to an ever closer partnership with a democratic and reformist Russia - 'No' to any revival of expansionism. . . 'Our message to the new democracies of central and eastern Europe has been equally consistent: We shall not leave you alone. We care about your security, which is of direct and material concern to us. And when we extend membership of Nato to new democracies of central and eastern Europe, it will be to help stabilise Europe and not to divide it again. 'Third, we have to improve our alliance's crisis management and peacekeeping capabilities. In particular, we should be ready to use Nato as the forum for achieving concerted views early in a crisis. . . 'Fourth, we have to adapt our structures to allow Nato to fulfil its new missions. A significant level of American forces permanently based in Europe will remain an indispensable component of our common security. . . At the same time, alliance structures must be developed in such a way as to enable the forces of European allies to operate under Western European Union auspices, if need be. However, more flexible structures will serve our purpose only. . . if we maintain an adequate level of well trained and well equipped armed forces backed up by adequate resources. 'Fifth, we have to prepare for the new security risks, particularly from proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Non-proliferation is and I think will remain our priority, but it may not suffice. So we have to look also at the appropriate means of protection of our member nations and citizens.'</p>

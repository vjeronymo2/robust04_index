			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: DISCOVERING THAT THERE'S LIFE OUTSIDE BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Here, at last, is my chance to catch up on other pressing current events in the  wide world of sports, after having been so preoccupied in recent weeks with  matters pertaining to college basketball. So many stories, so little time. I  feel as though life's owners have locked me out.  </P> <P> Oh, well. On to the headlines:  </P> <P> MOOSE ATTACK DELAYS DOG RACE  </P> <P> You know that big dog-sled race in Alaska, the one that-there Butcher woman  always wins? Well, it seems a couple of her fellow sledders had some trouble  getting to the finish line. They got attacked by a moose.  </P> <P> Now, I know it must come across as pretty heartless of me to be making fun of  somebody who had to ward off the charge of a wild animal, so let me apologize  up front. However, goofy me, I just can't help laughing at the mere thought of  somebody going 10 rounds with Raging Bullwinkle.  </P> <P> I keep picturing an Anchorage anchorperson, saying: "Well, Wendy, some bad news  out at the Iditarod today. Race called on account of moose." I keep picturing  some Valdez ambulance-chaser, defending the moose on charges that he was  intoxicated when he attacked the sled.  </P> <P> I keep picturing one of the husky dogs, seeing the moose coming toward him,  shouting: "I thought you had a lodge meeting tonight." I keep picturing the  moose fooling the dog, distracting him by saying: "Your snowshoe's untied."  </P> <P> I just hope nothing like this ever happens at the Final Four. Hate to think  what some dumb moose would do to somebody's poor mascot.  </P> <P> MAN ACCUSED OF BLACKMAILING STEINBRENNER  </P> <P> Evidently, the owner of the New York Yankees is attempting to get authorities  to believe that some guy attempted to extort a job from him. Hey, officer: I'd  like to think the real crime here is that anybody actually wanted to work for  George Steinbrenner.  </P> <P> Boss S. apparently paid this dude some serious money to do some scouting on  outfielder Dave Winfield. You know, the usual stuff: How was Winfield spending  his money? Who was Winfield seeing socially? The old Winfield spy rule.  </P> <P> This is the same George Steinbrenner who is now one of the gentlemen (cough)  granted the responsibility of guiding the United States Olympic team to greater  honor and glory. We can see George now, paying some Jamaican doctor $50,000 to  discover whether those pills Ben Johnson is popping are illegal drugs or  Flintstone vitamins.  </P> <P> Hey, you Yankee baseball players:  </P> <P> Lock the owner out.  </P> <P> OAKLAND RECONSIDERS RAIDER DEAL  </P> <P> Here are some handy tips, to any city officials giving thought to bidding for  the Raider football team:  </P> <P> Pay your schoolteachers.  </P> <P> Pay your firefighters.  </P> <P> Shelter your homeless.  </P> <P> Feed your hungry.  </P> <P> This public-service message comes to you today from the Citizens to Prevent  Professional Football From Interfering With the Quality of Human Life as We  Know It.  </P> <P> TERROR OF TENNIS IS GIRL, 13  </P> <P> Well, it's finally come to this. My tennis-crazy boss is going to walk up to me  someday soon and say: "Mike, we want you to go interview a 13-year-old girl."  And when I ask why, he's going to look me right in the eye and say: "Because  she's there."  </P> <P> Better get my questions ready for the interview:  </P> <P> "Who do you like better, Barbie or Ken?"  </P> <P> "Do you think ALF will really go back to his home planet?"  </P> <P> "Exactly how many Bon Jovi posters do you have in your room?"  </P> <P> "What was it like, seeing your first PG-13 movie?"  </P> <P> And, of course:  </P> <P> "What do you want to be when you grow up?"  </P> <P> It'll be my first interview ever with an athlete who can't remember the 1970s.  </P> <P> BASEBALL PITCHER GETS BURNED  </P> <P> His name is Smoltz, a good name for a guy who smolders. John Smoltz, a  22-year-old pitcher for the Atlanta Braves. Born: Detroit. Throws: Right. Bats:  Right. Irons: Right.  </P> <P> Irons? Yes. John Smoltz irons his own clothes. At least that's what he was  doing the other day, in spring training. He was ironing his shirt.  </P> <P> While he was wearing it.  </P> <P> That's right, the way I understand it, Smoltz's shirt was wrinkled, so he  picked up a hot iron and decided to smooth it right out. He proceeded to burn  the hairs right off his chest. He's lucky the iron didn't put an iron-shaped  hole right through him, like in a cartoon.  </P> <P> This is a touching story, don't you think? Here we thought baseball players  were all so rich, they all had valets to iron their shoelaces. It takes a  Smoltz to remind us that some baseball players do have to fend for themselves,  and let's face it, this kid is definitely a real Smoltz. He's about the  Smoltziest player I've ever seen.  </P> <P> Once again, I picture the scene: World Series! Atlanta vs. the Yankees! Game 1  starter Smoltz says to himself: "Hey, national TV! I'd better spruce myself up  a mite!" He irons the front of his uniform! The Indian logo screams! His  tomahawk melts! An Atlanta relief pitcher pours a bucket of Gatorade over  Smoltz, to put out the flames!  </P> <P> And promptly wins fireman of the year.  </P></p>

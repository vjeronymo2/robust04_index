			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Yesterday [23 March] voters had an opportunity  to meet Peter Boross at the University of Economics. Agnes Papp  interviewed the prime minister there.    [Begin recording] [Papp] What is your opinion about the  result of the latest survey, which shows that 40 percent of the  population is vacillating about going to the ballot boxes at all?    [Boross] I hope that at least half of them will decide to  go.    [Papp] What turnout do you expect?    [Boross] It is impossible to estimate. [passage omitted]    [Papp] What sort of campaign do you expect, regarding the  tone?    [Boross] I am not very optimistic. If the tone of the  campaign is to remain fair and clean, both the press and  political players should make some sort of pledge.    [Papp] Prime Minister, very many people are concerned that  the extremists will get too loud and the style of the campaign  will deteriorate because of this. To what extent do you share  these worries?    [Boross] If there are less provocative voices and less  inciting protestations to keep up tension, than less extremism  will occur. For extremism is often a reaction to something.    [Papp] What sort of protests do you mean?    [Boross] All kinds of protests, petitions, in writing, in  articles. [passage omitted] At this moment extremists do not  constitute any political danger and their upsetting the  political balance is inconceivable.    [Papp] Let me quote to you another opinion poll result: The  MDF's [Hungarian Democratic Forum] election chances of a victory  are declining, while at the same time, the HSP's [Hungarian  Socialist Party] chances of a victory are increasing. How do  you see this?    [Boross] It cannot be denied that the HSP's position at the  moment is better than four years ago. [passage omitted] I think  that the Democratic Forum will achieve a better result at the  elections than its rivals expect.    [Papp] You warned about a kind of left-wing danger. How  should one interpret this?    [Boross] I observe with regret that the HSP seems to be  drifting to the left. In the countryside, the old boys are  reappearing among the ranks of the party. [passage omitted]  Hungarian political life could very well do without this. That  is, that a structure already removed from the agenda -- in some  sort of new form -- should be revived. It is not even in the  interest of the HSP, but the party probably cannot resist the  temptation.    [Papp] What is your party's relationship with the other two  opposition parties?    [Boross] I cannot envisage a coalition with the Alliance of  Free Democrats [SZDSZ] as long as it is led by the hard core.  In my mind, more and more, the SZDSZ represents two parties:  That particular hard core, which is of left-wing tradition and  left-wing ideology converging toward the HSP, and another  bourgeois-middle trend, which I cannot imagine embracing the HSP  at any time. I think that the hard core is stronger, but this  other trend has a larger number.    Looking at the Fidesz [Alliance of Young Democrats]  transformation from the start, it has taken on a  national-liberal profile, which is taken seriously by them, it  seems. Naturally, the national-liberal trend is a lot more to  my taste than the liberal trend without the national adjective.</p>

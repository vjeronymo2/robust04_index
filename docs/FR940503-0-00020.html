The OTS may, in its discretion, and upon written request, extend the twenty day comment period for an additional twenty calendar days. Failure to provide the written comments in twenty calendar days may preclude the pursuit of any administrative or judicial remedies. Two copies of the comments should be sent to the Chief Counsel, Corporate and Securities Division, one copy to the Corporate Activities Division and one copy to the Regional Director. The proposed plan of conversion and any comments will be available for inspection by any member of the applicant at the Chief Counsel's Office and at the Regional Director's Office.

Only general reference thereto need be made in that portion of the application which the applicant deems not to be confidential. Applications under this part shall be made available for inspection by the public, except for portions which are bound and labeled ``confidential'' and which the Office determines to withhold from public availability under 5 U.S.C. 552 and part 505 of this chapter. Preliminary soliciting materials will be made available upon filing, unless such materials are not otherwise available to the public and are bound and labeled ``confidential.'' The applicant will be advised of any decision by the Office to make public information designated ``confidential'' by the applicant. Even though sections of the application are considered ``confidential,'' as far as public inspection thereof is concerned, to the extent it deems necessary, the Office may comment on such confidential submissions in any public statement in connection with its decision on the application without prior notice to the applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.

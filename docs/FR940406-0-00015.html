The Board issued these Rules as an interim rule, with request for public comments, on February 18, 1993. This final rule deviates from the interim rule in only a few particulars, based upon recommendations received from the Commission and from interested members of the Board's staff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to laws respecting discrimination in employment, the Board as a matter of policy has long recognized that it should afford to its employees, applicants for employment, and others the same substantive and procedural rights that are enjoyed by persons in their dealings with other government agencies. Pursuant to this policy, part 268 has been revised by the Board after the issuance by the Commission of its federal sector complaint processing regulations (29 CFR part 1614) which became effective on October 1, 1992. A new part 268 was issued by the Board as an interim rule effective February 18, 1993; (58 FR 9517, February 22, 1993) and is now issued as a final rule with revisions following receipt and consideration of public comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the Commission's new regulations, this final rule addresses matters of the kind addressed by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .), the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 791), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 621  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) and the Equal Pay Act (29 U.S.C. 206(d)). Subpart G (Prohibition Against Discrimination In Board Programs And Activities Because Of A Physical Or Mental Handicap) of the interim rule has also been revised consistent with recent revisions to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission and one commenter recommended that the terms ``handicap'' and ``handicapped'' should be replaced with ``disability'' or ``disabled'' throughout the Rules. The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 substituted the term ``disability'' for the term ``handicap'' throughout the Rehabilitation Act (Section 102(f), Pub. L. 102&hyph;569). It is the Board's intention to update the language of its Rules to conform to the 1992 amendment with whatever updates are made by the Commission. Although such revisions have not yet been incorporated in the Commission's regulations (29 CFR part 1614), in light of the Commission's specific recommendations, the Board has substituted appropriate language throughout the Rules as set forth above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter took exception to the deletion of section 703 (Self evaluation) of the prior Rules, which was in effect prior to February 18, 1993. Section 703 had required the Board to evaluate its then current policies and practices, and to make necessary modifications, regarding the upgrade of its facilities to conform to the standards of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The time limits stated in section 703 have passed. The Board has conducted the required survey of its facilities, and the Board has been implementing appropriate modifications to its facilities. Therefore, the Board believes that section 703 has become moot. The Board believes that this is a technical deletion that does not affect the Board's strong and continuing commitment to equal opportunity and equal access for individuals with a disability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Strong purchasing data trigger selling of Treasuries A MUCH stronger-than -expected National Association of Purchasing Management's report triggered heavy selling of US Treasury securities yesterday, although late in the day prices recovered from their lows. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  21/32 at 101 7/32 , yielding 7.887 per cent. The short end of the market was also markedly weaker, with the two-year note off  5/32 at 99 23/32 , yielding 5.259 per cent. The rise in the NAPM's index for May from 51.3 the previous month to 56 was bigger than analysts' forecasts (which had centred around 54), and sparked an immediate sell-off as hopes for another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve dwindled further. The purchasing managers figures indicated the economic recovery may be advancing at a faster pace than bond investors initially realised. The data suggested that Friday's employment report for May could show an improvement in labour market conditions. UK government bonds ended the day lower, taking their cue from the US Treasury bond market. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from its opening level of 118 9/32 to trade at 117 31/32 by late afternoon, yielding 9.07 per cent. Short-dated gilts slipped by around  1/32 of a point, dealers said. The Liffe gilt futures contract fell from its opening of 100.02 to end the day at 99.23, but volumes in the futures market were lower than normal with about 15,000 contracts traded. The latest tap stock - the 9 per cent Conversion stock due 2000 - continues to overhang the market, and dealers estimate that only about Pounds 200m of the total Pounds 800m has been sold since it was issued on May 22. The market will be watching today's final money supply figures for April which are expected to provide details of exactly how much stock the Bank of England sold after the April 9 general election. According to earlier estimates, the Bank sold about Pounds 4bn of gilts immediately after the election. THE main European government bond markets slipped yesterday, following the US Treasury bond market's lead and in the absence of significant economic news on the domestic front. German government bond futures drifted from their opening level of 87.87 to end at 87.70, having traded in a narrow range of 87.69-87.89. The Danish government bond market saw some profit-taking ahead of today's referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on European Monetary Union. In view of the most recent batch of opinion polls, traders expect Denmark to ratify the Treaty, and the Danish bond market has already started to discount a vote in favour. Some traders reported switching out of Denmark into Belgium, a market which has under-performed in recent days. The yield spread of the Danish bond due 2000 over the 9 per cent Belgian bond due 2001 narrowed from 16 basis points to 10 basis points yesterday. A stronger yen against the US dollar helped to boost Japanese government bonds yesterday, but the fall in share prices and the halt in the yen's rise prompted profit-taking, and the bond market closed lower on the day. The Bank of Japan intervened in the foreign exchange markets selling dollars to boost the Japanese currency. The yen opened at Y127.15 in Tokyo trading yesterday, against Y128.15 at Friday's Tokyo close, and strengthened to Y126.6 in the afternoon at the peak of the central bank's intervention. Traders noted some profit-taking as the yen slipped to reach Y127.15 against the dollar at the end of the day. The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.475 per cent, ending in Tokyo trading at 5.50 per cent. The yield moved to 5.515 per cent in London following the initial weakness in the US Treasury bond market and the yen's failure to continue its strengthening against the dollar. Dealers noted the No 144, which matures in 2001 and has a 6 per cent coupon, may soon take over as the new benchmark bond as the three separate No 144 issues are combining to form a single large issue.</p>

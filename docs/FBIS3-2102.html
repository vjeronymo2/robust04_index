Jiang Chunyun,  secretary of the provincial party committee, emphasized at the  conference the need to seize the opportunity to deepen reform,  face up to challenges, maintain the good development trend of  township enterprises, concentrate efforts to upgrade their  quality and level to a new height, and make township  enterprises, a new force, come to the fore for the second time.    Attending the conference were Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary  of the provincial party committee and provincial governor; Li  Chunting, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and  provincial vice governor; Chen Jianguo, standing committee  member of the provincial party committee and provincial vice  governor; and responsible persons of pertinent provincial  departments.    Shandong's township enterprises continued to maintain the  trend of robust development and created 482.5 billion yuan in  output value last year. The industrial output value they  created was 359.3 billion yuan, accounting for more than 60  percent of Shandong's total.    Jiang Chunyun said: Shandong's township enterprises  registered the fastest and best development rate last year.  Compared with advanced provinces and municipalities, however,  we still lag rather far behind in many aspects. We should  remain clear-headed to note that the endeavor to accelerate  establishment of the socialist market economy system not only  provides a good opportunity and opens up a vast world for  township enterprise development but also brings new challenges.  All localities should continue to regard township enterprise  development as the strategic priority of Shandong's economic  development, add impetus to reform, and make township  enterprises more vigorous in development. In the reform of  township enterprises, we should greatly extend the shareholding  system in compliance with the requirement for establishing the  socialist market economy system; bring property right relations  into better balance; achieve success in the merge and  cooperation between the enterprises of different ownerships and  trades; promote lease, merge, and auction; and do a good job in  the organization and management of enterprise groups. In  deepening the reform of township enterprises, we should put it  in the most important place to emancipate the mind, seek truth  from facts, and change ideas; embrace as soon as possible the  new concepts and new ideas compatible with the socialist market  economy; be brave in exploration and active in pioneering; and  create a new advantage and new pattern of township enterprises  by deepening reform.    Jiang Chunyun emphasized: We should further clarify the  guiding thought and truly shift the work focus of township  enterprises to the improvement of economic efficiency. We  should pay close attention to weak links to facilitate township  enterprises' development of the export-oriented economy and the  tertiary industry. We should further improve the investment  climate, attract foreign funds, and develop the three types of  foreign-funded enterprises. Geared to the world market, we  should broaden our field of vision, make friends with others  extensively, and bring in projects and capital from abroad. We  should adopt preferential policies and feasible measures to  encourage and guide more enterprises to establish plants and  offices outside the country and outside the province in order to  directly participate in the competition of the world and  domestic markets.</p>

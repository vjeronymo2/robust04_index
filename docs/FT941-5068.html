			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile issues copper plan ultimatum The Cyprus Amax/Lac Minerals consortium, which last year offered Dollars 555m for 51 per cent of the El Abra copper deposit in Chile, has been given until May 15 to sign documents. The ultimatum, delivered by Codelco, Chile's state copper company and the prospective joint-venture partner of the US/Canadian consortium, carries with it the possibility of legal action. If the consortium backed down on its original offer, 'Codelco has the possibility to reject it. . . and to use the courts to get compensation for any losses suffered', said Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's vice-president for development. The consortium last month postponed the agreement after discovering that ore grades might be lower than originally estimated. Ms Patrice Merrin Best, vice-president corporate and investor relations at Lac Minerals, said the 'due diligence process' had begun. This gave the consortium the right to make further tests, which would be completed by mid-May, she said. Asked whether statements from Codelco had soured negotiations, Ms Merrin Best said: 'We have goodwill and good faith and both parties hope that this can go ahead.' She pointed out that Mr Bande had expressed confidence that an agreement could be worked out. A mining executive in Santiago said the public jostling between the joint-venture partners did not augur well. 'It's a bit like getting married when you've started fighting even before you've got to the altar,' he said. Mr Jorge Rodriguez, acting Codelco president, said that if negotiations with the consortium broke down, Codelco would probably call a second round of bidding. Under Codelco's original rules, failure to conclude a deal with the highest bidder was to have resulted automatically in the start of negotiations with the under bidder. An executive at BHP Minerals/Magma, second in last year's bidding, said he thought the consortium would still be interested in developing El Abra.</p>

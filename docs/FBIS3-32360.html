At a public plaza gathering, which occupied the five blocks  west of the National University (UNA), the PUSC candidate said  education is the instrument that permitted the country to  achieve its current living standards.    Rodriguez guaranteed his supporters, who waited for two and  a  half hours in the middle of a chilly January day, that preschool  education will be implemented nationwide and primary education  will be improved. In that sense he insisted that he will give  students opportunities through student bonds and high school  education scholarships. He vowed to strengthen this sector as  well as education in arts and crafts schools.    He stressed that his administration will totally fulfill the  financial agreement for state superior education so that  universities and businesses can jointly carry out investigations  that will net revenues.    In the area of coffee plantations, Rodriguez criticized the  departure of former Finance Minister Fernando Naranjo, who is  now a Liberal Party leader and who left his post because he  refused to reduce the coffee tax. He underscored that the  current administration, on the contrary, created the coffee fund  for $665 million colones, which permitted 5,000 families in  Heredia to face the international market price crisis.    Most of the speakers who preceded him attacked opposition  Liberal Party candidate Jose Maria Figueres and appealed to  honest Liberal Party members to vote for the PUSC in the coming  elections.    Among the speakers who preceded Rodriguez was Gujillermo  Chacon, candidate for province alderman; Sergio Salazar, deputy  candidate; political leader Bernardo Benavides; former Security  Minister Victor Emilio Herrera; former presidential candidate  Juan Jose Trejos; Mabel Nieto, candidate for second vice  president; and Abel Pacheco, candidate for first vice president.    The rally was also attended by Deputy Danilo Chaverri,  former  President Mario Echandi, and Lorena Clare, the presidential  hopeful's wife.</p>

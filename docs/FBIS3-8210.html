General Rasim Delic said the Bosnian army had "no  confidence"  in the neutrality of Russian troops and did not want to see them  deployed, even as observers, in line with a UN plan to reopen  Tuzla airport. People were "irritated with things they (the  Russians) have done. Some incidents could happen and it has to  be avoided," Delic said. Twenty-five Russian experts arrived in  Zagreb Friday en route for Tuzla, where they are to visit the  airport in preparation for Russian deployment.    In an interview with AFP, the commander of the Bosnian army  said the besieged mainly Moslem population in Tuzla mistrusted  the UN idea of deploying Russian troops there, viewing the  Russians as allies of the Serbs. Delic said the airport at  Tuzla was Bosnian property and that the Bosnian government  should be able to decide who was based there. "We're not asking  for some special troops but we don't want the Russians," Delic  said, also rejecting the idea of Russian observers, if that were  proposed instead of armed soldiers.    The United Nations has said it will start using Tuzla  airport  this month to boost the humanitarian aid effort in central  Bosnia. Serb forces besiege almost half a million people in  Tuzla and have bombed the airport several times in recent weeks.    The Russian experts are to visit the airport, which Bosnian  Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev said Tuesday in Moscow they had agreed to reopen after  almost two year's closure.    Bosnian government officials have already protested the  deployment of 400 Russian UN troops behind Serb lines in  Sarajevo.    Meanwhile ceasefires were holding broadly, UN officials  said.  But UN peacekeepers admitted problems pinpointing the origins of  the sporadic shellfire that fell within the NATO-imposed  exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital.    Two mortars shells fell overnight Friday near the  UN-controlled Sarajevo airport, without causing casualties, said  UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Major Rob Annink. The  incident was the latest breach of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation's heavy weapons exclusion zone set up 20-kilometres  (12-miles) around Sarajevo.    UN Bosnian Commander General Sir Michael Rose on Friday  repeated his urgent appeal for more UN troops to be sent to  Bosnia to help enforce the ceasefires, warning continued  ceasefire breaches threatened to topple the fragile peace  process. The British general has called for at least 5,000 more  troops to reinforce the 13,000 UNPROFOR soldiers already in  Bosnia.    Meanwhile, five 122-mm howitzers discovered inside the  Sarajevo exclusion zone Thursday have been driven out by the  Serbs, UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said, adding that a sixth  was due to leave Saturday. The Serbs told UNPROFOR that they  considered that the weapons, discovered at Cifluk, 19 kilometres  from Sarajevo, were outside the exclusion zone.    In central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina British and  Canadian UN troops were due Saturday to deploy along the  confrontation lines between government soldiers and Bosnian  Croat forces. UNPROFOR planned to inspect 350 kilometres of  front lines, mainly in the areas around Vitez, Mostar, Gorni  Vakuf, Prozor, Konijc and Jablanica. The opening of six aid  routes through the front lines were also to be negotiated.    Under the terms of a Croat-Moslem ceasefire which came into  force late last month, all HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and  Bosnian army checkpoints are to be dismantled or placed under UN  control.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAY LEAGUE BASEBALL;  </P> <P> MONTGOMERY WINS THIS MATCHUP;  </P> <P> HOMER OFF FULLERTON'S ARIAS HELPS SUNNY HILLS TO VICTORY  </P> <P> There are sibling rivalries, and then there's the special relationship between  Fullerton High School pitcher Rene Arias and Sunny Hills outfielder Jon  Montgomery.  </P> <P> Arias, a native of Mexico, moved into Montgomery's home 2 1/2 years ago after  Arias' mother moved back to Mexico. He has remained at Fullerton and has  developed into one of the school's premier athletes.  </P> <P> He pitched a no-hitter in the Southern Section 3-A division playoffs as a  sophomore. He was the starting varsity quarterback last fall and was among the  county's top three-point shooters in basketball.  </P> <P> Montgomery has been selected to play in this summer's Orange County All-Star  football game as a defensive back, but for the most part, his athletic exploits  have been overshadowed by Arias'. That is, until Wednesday afternoon.  </P> <P> Montgomery hit a three-run homer off Arias that keyed a five-run outburst in  the sixth inning in Sunny Hills' 10-8 victory at Fullerton.  </P> <P> The loss dropped Fullerton (7-6-1, 4-2) out of a first-place tie with Sunny  Hills (10-6, 5-1) in the Freeway League.  </P> <P> Montgomery hit an 0-2 curveball high over the right-field fence to give Sunny  Hills a 10-5 lead and chase Arias (5-2). Afterward, Montgomery was asked if the  play would be discussed at the dinner table.  </P> <P> "All I'm going to say to Rene was that it (homer) was a lucky shot," Montgomery  said. "I'll feel more uncomfortable talking about it than he will. I was  looking for a curveball and got lucky.  </P> <P> "I would have rather hit it off somebody else than Rene. Whenever I hit against  him, I try to block it out of my mind, but I'm always aware that it's him on  the mound."  </P> <P> Arias said the pitch was a fastball, but there was no argument that  Montgomery's homer took Fullerton out of the game in a ballpark where the  center-field fence is only 175 feet away from home plate.  </P> <P> "It was a bad pitch that took us out of the game," Arias said. "I won't see Jon  until tomorrow, but I'll congratulate him and tell him, 'Nice game.' I made  some bad pitches today, but we get another shot at them Friday."  </P> <P> George Montgomery, who invited Arias into his home, was caught in the middle of  the confrontation between his son and Arias.  </P> <P> "I had mixed emotions," he said. "My family has grown very close to Rene, and  he's almost become a son to me. I was happy for Jon, but I was hurting for  Rene."  </P> <P> La Habra 4, Sonora 3 -- Rob Szente had an RBI double with no outs in the sixth  to give the Highlanders (7-5, 3-3) a 4-3 lead at La Habra. David Stevens (2-3)  pitched a six-hitter, striking out seven, for the victory.  </P> <P> Troy 12, Buena Park 5 -- Matt Carter had a grand slam in a five-run first  inning for the Warriors (10-4, 5-1) at Troy. Carter had three hits and three  runs scored.  </P></p>

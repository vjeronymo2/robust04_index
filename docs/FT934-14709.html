			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / City told to fund policing of markets CITY companies were warned yesterday that they should be prepared to pay the cost of policing market manipulation. A conference at Westminster on City regulation also heard that companies were to expect a crackdown on selective leaking of corporate information. The warnings from senior regulators came at the same forum as a speech from Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, in which he said he had made representations in Brussels regarding the regulation of cross-border payments in different currencies. 'I am concerned about the extent of double charging and the occasional lack of transparency,' he said. Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, said companies which raised capital in the London markets and those which trade securities should be prepared to pay for weeding out and punishing market manipulators. He said that detecting improper activity related to the prices of securities and punishing wrongdoers is one of his principal tasks. 'We do insist that our market places should be seen to be the best policed and most difficult for bad hats to get away with it,' he said. 'Would the industry or issuers be prepared to contribute to the cost of ensuring that? I believe they would. And I believe they should.' The absence of a single body responsible for containing, deterring, and punishing abuse has allowed different organisations to avoid responsibility he said. Meanwhile, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange, warned that he was determined to stop the practice of selective leaking of corporate information to the marketplace. Earlier this year, the Stock Exchange for the first time censured a company for disclosing exclusively to a small group of analysts that its earnings would be lower than expected. Sir Andrew said that when companies felt that market expectations were out of line with reality there had been 'a growing tendency to nudge and wink until the market - or some players - get the message'. He added: 'If expectations are out of line, then an announcement to the market as a whole is the way forward.' Companies had been trying to avoid a sudden adverse reaction in their stock price by selective leaking, he said. But if markets got used to such announcements, the odds of an over-reaction in stock prices would be diminished. Imro, the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, has sent a letter to members saying it no longer wishes to regulate the marketing of packaged investment products such as unit trusts. Mr Charles Nunneley, Imro chairman, said those activities should fall to the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulatory body for retail financial services. However, those unit trust managers who are not concerned with mass marketing of their products to the public will be able to remain in Imro and will not need to belong to two self-regulatory bodies. Imro's move increases the likelihood that the PIA will earn the support of the large insurance companies which must vote to create it.</p>

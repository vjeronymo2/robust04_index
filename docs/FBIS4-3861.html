			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 23 (XINHUA) -- The Albanian parliament  today ratified a document on Partnership for Peace with NATO as  a step toward better relations with West European countries.    In February, Albanian President Sali Berisha signed the  document with NATO Secretary General Manfred Worner in Brussels  and later submitted it to the People's Assembly for approval.    Before the parliament convened over the weekend, the  president told the lawmakers that ratification of the agreement  was an important step toward new cooperation with NATO.    He stressed that it was also part of Albania's efforts to  obtain full membership in NATO.    The document provides that Albania and NATO will cooperate  in  peacekeeping missions, rescue operations and military exercises.    No further details were available.</p>

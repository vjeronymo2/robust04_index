			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Putting a gloss on UK crime THE HOMICIDE glossies one can take. True Detective and its like have been around for years, offering consistent instruction to all those commuters who might one day take up serial killing as a hobby. But a new journal has appeared this month. I found it tucked next to a quarterly called Murder Most Foul, but I doubt whether it is really in that innocuous category. The new publication is called Crime Buster, and its appearance is deeply disturbing. 'Helping you protect yourself and your family' is what it sets out to do. A fair enterprise, on the face of it. As we are reminded passim by the magazine, our homes are violated by thieves at the rate of one every 26 seconds. Cars fare little better, and you can even have the mobile phone whipped from your hand as you speak. So Crime Buster appears to be on to a good thing. And in this first issue, it has tackled its rubric with spirit. For a start, there are prizes. Do a crime busting crossword puzzle and you could win a full surveillance system. Runners-up get a 'really robust personal alarm' which even if crushed in a villain's fist will scream at 130 decibels on their behalf. Then there are seasonal tips. Watch out if you go sunbathing in the garden: this is a nice time for opportunist intruders. But if you go abroad for the sun, the robbers like it even better. Your house will probably be stripped at leisure, and gratuitously defiled to boot. Never mind: July's issue will at least supply a guide on where you stand most chance of being mugged when you do take that foreign holiday. I have learned to beware of all sorts of new criminals. For example, the quill clipper. This is the dodger who, feigning a stupefied state, lurches at you in a crowded place with his newspaper. What you don't know is that with a deft flick of his paper he has swiped the pen from your breast pocket. Positively Dickensian, that move. But it has to be said that Crime Buster does not romanticise the criminal class. Its contributors hardly ever refer to thieves as thieves. 'Clowns' is a favourite: I also noticed 'morons', 'scumbags' and jerks'. Car thieves have their own nomenclature: 'twockers' generically (Taking Without Owner's Consent), 'cats' if they specialise in car audio theft. The opening (and only) metaphor of the magazine likens the law-abiding public to a flock of sheep, doing nothing while wolves raid at will. Then on the back page there is a rabid-looking hyena: one of the 'cats', perhaps, about to slaver over your Blaupunkt. There are photo-narratives showing how villains get away with things, or how the law apprehends them. It is hard to say who is the more dominant presence in the magazine: the old-hand bobby, the master locksmith, or a figure in blurred silhouette simply referred to as 'The Insider'. The Insider seems to have done time and knows all the wrinkles: he is prone to making jolly ex cathedra interjections. 'If you've got it and you flaunt it, someone will nick it]'; 'Burglars hate bolts]', and so on. He sometimes alludes to thieves as 'the lads': though he is billed as a reformed character, you might still want to count your spoons after having him to lunch. The advertisements reveal a relentless battle out there between rival security systems. A large chunk of Crime Buster is effectively a consumer guide, guiding you towards the ultimate infra-red detection light, trying a jemmy on all sorts of locks. Never has the line about the Englishman's home being his castle sounded so true. This is a real fortress mentality. In fact, it cannot be long before Crime Buster recommends its readers to wear a suit of chain mail when out on the streets: already it is touting bullet- and dagger-proof vests. This sort of flesh-creeping view of the future is dismaying enough. Equally dismaying is the way in which these precautions become a sort of culture of their own (one manufacturer of bars and grilles describes itself as producing 'Poetry in Steel'). But what is most dismaying is what Crime Buster never mentions. Across 85 pages, there is not an iota of a scintilla of a suggestion that we could bust most crime by being a more equitable society. Not a whisper. And that is a very sad silence.</p>

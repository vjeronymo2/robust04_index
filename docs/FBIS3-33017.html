			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The development of a 12.7-mm caliber assault rifle,  the "Mambi," is among the most outstanding contributions of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] weapons specialists during  1993. The assault rifle was developed by Lieutenant Colonel  Armando Gutierrez Mesa. Margarita Torres has more detials:    [Torres] The "Mambi" is designed to fire on assault  helicopters, which were used by the Yankees in their aggressions  in Panama and the Gulf War. We will learn more of the rifle's  combat capability from the coauthor of the project, Lieutenant  Colonel Giraldo Perez Banos.    [Perez] We have the capability of hitting a target at 2 km  with very high accuracy. In tests, we verified that this assault  rifle can hit a target measuring 2 meters by 2 meters at a  distance of 2 km. That is more than enough to counter this  technique by the enemy.    [Torres] How much does it weigh?    [Perez] This assault rifle weighs approximately 14 kg and  can  be readily handled by any combatant. It is 1.4 meters in length  and its center of gravity has been designed to rest on the  shoulder of the marksman, which makes the weapon very easy to  use.    [Torres] Are we talking about an authentically Cuban assault  rifle?    [Perez] That is one of its main characteristics. Despite the  special period, Cuba has been able to design a weapon with these  characteristics that is effective against such means of  aggression as enemy helicopters. We have used Soviet 12.7-mm  caliber ammunition in it. We have designed a system by which one  man can fire an assault rifle of such size by himself.    [Torres] The Cuban Science Academy named this portable  12.7-mm caliber assault rifle one of the outstanding scientific  projects of the country in 1993.</p>

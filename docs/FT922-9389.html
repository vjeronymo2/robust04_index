			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Amstrad gains on rumours HEAVY trading in Amstrad, for the second day running, left it 4 higher at 40 1/2 p, the biggest percentage gain in the London market yesterday. The rise was sparked by rumours that chairman Mr Alan Sugar was buying stock. More extreme talk even had him preparing to take the company private. Both stories were dismissed by analysts as highly implausible and denied emphatically by Mr Sugar, who put the rise down to 'speculative buying by investors trying to make a quick profit'. The 8.2m shares traded followed Tuesday's 7m. Amstrad shares have been hit hard over the past 12 months as the recession has begun to bite. A profits warning a year ago was followed by the group's first-ever loss six months later. 'Since the share price collapsed, Amstrad has been susceptible to all sorts of rumours,' said Mr Patrick Wellington at County NatWest. 'I doubt if this old chestnut has any truth in it either.' Gas deflated A demand for gas price cuts prompted a sharp fall in British Gas as traders assumed that any reductions would have a knock-on effect on profits. Regulator Ofgas told the company to cut prices for domestic customers or face possible regulatory action. The shares were down 8 at one stage before rallying to close 2 1/2 off at 262 1/2 p with 12m traded. A number of analysts said a price cut would have no effect at all as it was related to inflation, and if inflation fell costs would also come down. The share price was also hit by concern that first-quarter results, due next Thursday, may be disappointing. S &amp; N downgraded Brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle lost 6 to 463p in an active market of 3.6m shares after Smith New Court downgraded its profits estimate for the current year and for 1993. Mr Mike McCarthy, drinks analyst at Smith, pointed out that Center Parcs, the company's leisure division, has a large exposure to Benelux countries and future profits may be influenced by problems involving the German economy. He added that in the short term the performances of Bass, up 26 at 637p, and Grand Metropolitan, 14 stronger at 496p, are likely to be better than S &amp; N. Mr Christopher Wickham at Lehman Brothers noted that 20 per cent of S &amp; N's volume is in the take-home trade, mainly involving off licences, and that margins are being squeezed by the amount of this business going through supermarkets. A statement that the chief executive of Johnson Matthey was resigning his post as non-executive director of Charter Consolidated raised a flurry of speculation and the shares in both groups responded sharply. Charter is the majority shareholder in Johnson and the resignation immediately sparked speculation that it was either considering selling its 38.5 per cent stake or launching a bid for Johnson. Apparently, the company said there was no significance in the management change and the share prices ticked back slightly at the close. Charter ended the day 11 ahead at 536p while Johnson Matthey closed 18 higher at 432p. A strong two-way pull was seen in Rolls-Royce shares, sending turnover to 14m as the stock firmed 2 to 172p. The interest was prompted by an announcement that China has placed an engine order worth around Pounds 100m. Smith New Court reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. US buyers were also said to have been in evidence, but County NatWest said the shares had performed strongly since the beginning of the year and advised investors to 'pause for breath and take profits'. Disappointment with the tone of Tate &amp; Lyle's statement accompanying the interim figures pushed the shares down 8 to 401p on turnover of 6m. Food manufacturer JLI Group reported a successful rights issue, with 96.1 per cent of the 13.28m shares offered taken up and the remainder placed in the market at a premium. JLI gained 4 to 124p. US buying was behind a good performance for Glaxo which, also benefiting from good news about its anti-nausea drug Zofran, climbed 23 to 774p. Good first-quarter figures from BAT Industries prompted the shares to rally 24 to 805p. Nervousness ahead of today's first-quarter figures left BP 1 1/2 easier at 262p. US investors bought British Steel, which added 3 at 85p on high turnover of 12m. Smiths Industries gained 3 to 316p as it held meetings with its leading investors. Car dealer Lex Service rose 11 to 245p after informing investors at the annual meeting that the UK car market had shown considerable improvement in April. The market appreciated Lex's Pounds 46m acquisition of Swan National Motor, formerly part of TSB. Improved air traffic figures prompted British Airways to gain 4 1/2 to 292 1/2 p. A larger than anticipated tax charge and higher than forecast borrowings caused Trafalgar House to buck the general trend as it reported interim profits in line with market forecasts. The shares eased 2 to 147p and brokers cut full-year forecasts. County NatWest trimmed its estimate by Pounds 15m to Pounds 120m and BZW's was cut by Pounds 8m to Pounds 125m. BZW became the latest broker to downgrade Rank Organisation. The securities house is looking for profits of Pounds 272m for this year, down Pounds 18m, and Pounds 340m, off Pounds 30m, for 1993. However, Rank, which was off 6 at one stage, rebounded to close 9 ahead on balance at 738p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (297).

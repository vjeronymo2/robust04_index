			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Hertfordshire head teachers oppose schools' opting out HEAD TEACHERS of local-authority secondary schools in Hertfordshire have declared strong opposition to their schools' opting out of local-authority control and have condemned plans to reintroduce selection of pupils. Encouragement for all schools to opt out and a move towards selection lie at the heart of the Conservative manifesto, and the declaration - at a private conference of the county's head teachers held late last week - will embarrass ministers. Throughout the election campaign Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, has predicted an avalanche of applications to opt out if the Conservatives are returned. He has publicly speculated that most secondary schools will opt out within two years, and is proposing to allow opted-out schools to reintroduce selection if they wish. However, Hertfordshire's head teachers resolved that they would 'advise school governing bodies and parents who raise the issue' that 'it is in the best interests of the education service in Hertfordshire for schools to continue to be maintained by the county council'. They also formally affirmed a 'commitment to maintaining a system of comprehensive education . . . which affords equality of opportunity.' Only five of Hertfordshire's 79 comprehensive secondary schools are grant-maintained. None of the other 74 is engaged in a ballot to opt out. Mr Jack Straw, the shadow education secretary, said the resolution showed 'that head teachers can see through the bribes to opt out to the real damage it does to the local education service'. Mr Matthew Taylor, for the Liberal Democrats, said it 'showed that most heads value the support of a good local authority'. However, Mr Tim Eggar, schools minister, said: 'We would like schools to opt out, but we have no intention of forcing them to. It's for parents and governors to decide, and we will abide by that.' A majority vote by parents in a secret ballot is required before a school can opt out. With most existing grant-maintained schools, the move was instigated - or at least supported - by the school's head teacher. Of the 5,000 state secondary schools in England and Wales, only 200 (4 per cent) are grant-maintained and 159 are grammar schools. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are committed to abolishing both types of school. Mr Straw challenged Mr Clarke yesterday to publish evidence about last year's tests for seven-year-olds which reportedly contradicts ministerial claims that the social and ethnic background of pupils and schools could not be held to account for differences in performance.</p>

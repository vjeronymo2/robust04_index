Sun  Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee and head of  the leading group, made a speech at the meeting.    He set forth that we should upgrade our understanding,  strengthen duties and responsibility, and deepen the development  of the double- support work.    The meeting heard the opinions made by some members of the  leading group and the report on summing up the double-support  work done in 1993, examined and discussed the 1994  double-support work priorities, and discussed the detailed rules  of the methods for naming and managing model cities and counties  advanced in the double-support work.    The meeting was chaired by Sun Weiben. Shan Rongfan, Yu  Jingchang, and Ma Shujie, deputy heads of the leading group,  attended the meeting.    Sun Weiben said in his speech: Some of our double-support  work achievements made in 1993 can be affirmed. The party,  government, and Army leaders at various levels and the broad  masses of armymen and people have upgraded their understanding  about the double- support work. The society as a whole has made  concrete efforts to grasp and manage the work. The gratifying  situation characterized by the unity between the Army and the  government and between the Army and the people has been  consolidated and developed. Both the Army and the localities  have done many good deeds by launching the double-support  campaign, the joint civility campaign, and the mutual service  campaign. Localities have extensively conducted investigation  and study and worked out local laws and regulations on giving  special care to disabled servicemen and to families of  revolutionary martyrs and servicemen. Thus, the policies on  giving special care to disabled servicemen and families of  revolutionary martyrs and servicemen have better been  implemented.    In regard to the 1994 double-support work, Comrade Sun  Weiben  said: The 1994 double-support work priorities have been  defined. We should clearly define our duties and grasp the  implementation of the 1994 work. We should concentrate energy  on conducting investigation and study, firmly attend to the  setup of laws and regulations governing the double-support work  and on giving special care to disabled servicemen and families  of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, and continue to improve  the campaign of striving to be model cities and counties  advanced in the double-support work. Both the Army and the  localities should earnestly do concrete deeds for each other and  make contributions to the province's reform, development, and  stability.</p>

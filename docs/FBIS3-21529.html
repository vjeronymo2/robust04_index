			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted]    Speaking about cuts in the Belarusian offensive weapons,  [Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav] Kebich said that if  Belarus was not given financial assistance in disarmament, it  would not be able to eliminate tanks and aircraft at the old  rate according to international agreements. He said that  Belarus bore all of the related expenses on its own.    The economic problems complicate the financing of the  disarmament program, said Kebich. He also pointed out that  Belarus was honestly and consistently implementing its  commitments to cut down armaments and would continue to do so in  the future.</p>

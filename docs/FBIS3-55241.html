			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova (ADPM), one  of the most influential in the republic, has approved its roll  of 106 candidates for the parliamentary elections on February  27. The party's co-chairman, Aurel Talmatskiy, told INTERFAX  that the roll will be submitted to the Central Election  Commission within the next few days.    Among party foremen, the roll includes most current  republican leaders such as Parliamentary Speaker Petr  Luchinskiy, Prime Minister Andrei Sangeli, Vice Prime Ministers  Nikolay Oleynik and Valentin Kunev, and other ministers.    Talmatskiy said most state officials included in the roll  will go on vacations and resign starting January 10. "We have to  do that in order to prevent our political opponents from  accusing us of abuse of power," he pointed out.    According to Talmatskiy, the agrarians do not intend to bloc  with any other political forces. However, he was quoted as  saying that "such blocs might be created in the parliament." "A  union with the republican and social democratic parties which  stand up for Moldova's stronger statehood and independence is  the most likely," he noted.    At the same time, Talmatskiy pointed out that both open and  disguised supporters of unification with Romania such as the  Christian Democratic Front of Moldova will be his party's main  opponents. "I mean the Congress of Intelligentsia and some other  political parties which emerged from the Popular Front," he  explained.    Local political scientists believe that the ADPM has the  best  chances of winning the parliamentary elections.</p>

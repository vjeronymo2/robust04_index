			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Mar 04, BNS -- The second reactor of the  Ignalina nuclear power plant, which was shut down for minor  repairs Feb. 25, will be turned on Friday night and is expected  to reach its peak 1,300-megawatt output by Monday [7 March].    The reactor was shut down after detecting radioactive steam  leaking from an air-tight compartment.    Experts established that the steam leaked through some  worn-out parts of a control valve.    Plant officials said the leak was considerably smaller than  permitted by reactor operation rules. The incident did not  affect the radiation background inside and outside the plant,  officials said.    Ignalina's leadership said the first reactor will be shut  down April 4 for maintenance repairs. The reactor might be  turned off several days earlier or later, depending on the  situation in the Lithuanian energy system.</p>

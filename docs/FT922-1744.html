			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Deadline for BT payments THE 1.8m partly-paid British Telecom shareholders will have received their call notices this week for payment of the second instalment of the stock by July 7, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. However, the Treasury says cheques must be received by Lloyds Bank, the issue registrar, by Thursday July 2 to be cleared. The second instalment will cost 120p per share but around 630,000 shareholders qualifying for the instalment discount, will only need to pay 105p per share on the first 1,000 shares. If you miss the deadline, you could lose your shares as well as entitlements to special incentives such as instalment discounts or bonus shares. However, the Treasury says it may pay a refund of a maximum of 110p per share. Shareholders could receive less if the Treasury makes a loss once it deducts selling and administrative costs from the price obtained for the shares. A number of special deals on the sale of BT partly-paid shares are being offered by some of the government-nominated share shops. Norwich and Peterborough is cutting its minimum commission to Pounds 15 on sales. Barclays Bank's commission rate is 2 per cent subject to a minimum of Pounds 15 and this charge will cover a further three members of the family. Bank of Scotland's charges are 1.5 per cent commission with a minimum of Pounds 15 for postal dealings and Pounds 20 for telephone dealings. The Share Centre (0442- 890800) is also offering a competitive deal. The selling commission is 1 per cent, subject to a Pounds 10 minimum. Brokers Dunbar Boyle &amp; Kingsley (071-247-8898) will sell for a 1.5 per cent commission or a Pounds 15 minimum. This single charge will cover up to 10 investors. The offer ends at close of business on June 23. Lloyds Bank has set up a helpline for BT shareholders. The number is 0903-503733.</p>

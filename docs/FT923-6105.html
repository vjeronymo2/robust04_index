			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: British Gas Yesterday's interim results from British Gas show some of the strains which have forced it into the arms of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. While warm weather may have been the proximate cause of much of the profits decline, the company clearly has an underlying difficulty in squaring costs with its pricing formula. Added to that, if the full-year dividend is raised in line with expectations, the company will be unable to meet its medium term objective of a twice-covered dividend unless demand picks up sharply. However, it is the MMC reference which overshadows all. As far as the natural monopoly pipelines are concerned, rate of return will be the key issue. On the supply of gas to consumers and industry, the extent and shape of competition will be the focus. It may be that horse trading might gain British Gas a higher rate of return on pipes, while the marketing of gas is restructured. But until the possibilities on marketing become more concrete, it is impossible to say what value is buried in British Gas.</p>

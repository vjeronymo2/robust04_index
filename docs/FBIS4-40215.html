			<p>BFN     [Text] President Mircea Snegur today denied an allegation  by Tiraspol authorities that the Moldovan leadership is blocking  the continuation of talks started under Russian and CSCE  mediation on the peaceful settlement of the Dniester conflict.    As already reported, Igor Smirnov, leader of the Dniester  region, accused Chisinau last week of silently blocking the  dialogue to settle the crisis. He appealed to Vladlen Vlasov,  the Russian president's special envoy at the talks, requesting  that the latter use his influence over Snegur who, in Tiraspol's  view, is avoiding talks.    A statement issued today by an official representative of  the  president of Moldova says that the Republic's leadership has set  up a group of experts to draft a bill on the special juridical  status of the region on the left bank of the Dniester River. It  has been ready to begin work for a long time, but Tiraspol is  delaying setting up a similar group for joint work on the bill,  as agreed during the meeting held at the end of April between  the leaders of Moldova and the Dniester region.</p>

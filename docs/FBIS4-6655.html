			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- The head of the Japan  Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI) said Thursday [21 April]  he believes the Japanese economy remains in the doldrums and is  showing few signs of recovery. JCCI Chairman Kosaku Inaba told  reporters that the economic condition is neither improving nor  worsening.    Inaba said the prolonged political uncertainties, recent  hikes in public utility rates and the yen's appreciation against  the dollar could affect an economic recovery.    He expressed concern over a delay in the selection of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's successor and called for urgent  efforts to form a new cabinet and expedite Diet approval of the  government budget for fiscal 1994, which started April 1.</p>

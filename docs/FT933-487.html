			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Clinton appeals for UN to step up Somalia efforts PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday called on the United Nations to step up its efforts to create a new government in Somalia so that the troops in the multinational peacekeeping force could leave, writes George Graham. 'There has to be a political strategy that puts the affairs of Somalia back into the hands of Somalis,' he said before a meeting with congressional leaders, who expressed concern about the continued US involvement in Somalia. 'We were not asked to go to Somalia to establish a protectorate, or a trust relationship, or to run the country,' Mr Clinton said. 'That's not what we went for.' Members of the US Congress have become increasingly sensitive about the Somali peacekeeping operation since the killing on Saturday of three US soldiers in Mogadishu, and the Senate has passed a resolution calling on Mr Clinton to seek congressional approval by November 15 for keeping US troops there. Somalia has also loomed ominously in congressional discussions on the possibility of sending up to 25,000 US troops to Bosnia to enforce an eventual peace settlement. But Mr Tom Foley, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, sought to minimise the significance of the battle the UN faces in its pursuit of General Mohammed Farah Aideed, a Somali warlord. 'That's in one part of Mogadishu, in southern Mogadishu,' said Mr Foley after the White House meeting. 'In other parts of the country village elders are taking over responsibility for governing the country, people are being fed, crops are being planted,' he said. Earlier this week, in a speech to the UN General Assembly, Mr Clinton said the US would ask hard questions before getting involved in future peacekeeping operations. The US will send 600 troops to Haiti from next week to help peaceful transition to a democratic government there, the Defence Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The Pentagon said the troops, including engineers, doctors and military trainers, were part of a six-month UN operation backing the restoration of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power on October 30, and 'will be fulfilling a non-confrontational role'.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL BOYARSKY: SUDDENLY, SOMETHING IN COMMON  </P> <P> Fear of crime and drugs has created a new and unlikely coalition between  neighborhoods in the suburban San Fernando Valley and South-Central Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> These two areas, which have had little in common in the past, now confront the  same problem. Both are experiencing an influx of prostitutes and heavily armed  drug dealers. Parts of the Valley, in fact, have become as dangerous as some of  South-Central's inner-city neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The shared threat has created an alliance between two Los Angeles City Council  members as different as their districts. Nate Holden, a black inner-city  politician who likes to play rough, and Joel Wachs, a gentlemanly voice of  prosperous, predominantly white suburbia, want the police to respond by putting  more foot patrols on the streets of their districts.  </P> <P> The alliance is evidence of how the city is changing.  </P> <P> A decade or so ago, Valley council members and those from South-Central seemed  to represent different cities. But pockets of poverty and crime gradually  developed in many parts of the Valley. When district lines were redrawn a few  years ago, Wachs found himself representing one especially dangerous high-crime  area.  </P> <P> Wachs came under increasing pressure from residents who wanted the foot cops to  make their neighborhoods safer. Across town, in the Crenshaw and mid-Wilshire  areas, Holden was feeling the same pressure.  </P> <P> Wachs and Holden are not particularly close. But circumstances threw them  together. First working separately, they proposed additional foot patrols. Then  they joined forces to get City Council approval, something that was needed  because their proposals required more money.  </P> <P> Setting up a foot patrol is more expensive than putting officers in cars. It's  not just a matter of sending out a couple of beat cops. These are dangerous  streets, and officers go out in patrols of eight or 10. Patrols split up into  teams of two, but everyone must keep in radio contact.  </P> <P> Wachs and Holden needed the support of Mayor Tom Bradley and Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky. As mayor, Bradley approves appropriations. Yaroslavsky runs the  finance committee, which screens all money matters.  </P> <P> But Bradley and Yaroslavsky said the department had enough funds and officers  on hand to increase the foot patrols. They noted the department had increased  in size from 6,900 to about 7,900 in the past four years and was authorized to  go to 8,400 officers by next year.  </P> <P> Although Holden and Wachs didn't plan it that way, their personalities threw  them into the roles of the old game of "good cop, bad cop." It was just the  right game for that moment.  </P> <P> Roughhouse politician Holden, the bad cop, brought angry constituents to the  council chamber. Although his move was resented by colleagues, council members,  under the glare of television coverage, voted more money.  </P> <P> Bradley vetoed the appropriation and, with Yaroslavsky helping him on the  council floor, the veto was sustained.  </P> <P> Then Wachs, the good cop, put together a compromise: Department funds would be  used for a "pilot program" of more walking patrols until the end of the year.  Additional foot patrols were ordered for 18 areas around the city, including  Wachs' and Holden's districts.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the Valley half of the coalition savored its victory. Wachs and  police officers held a press conference on Columbus Avenue near Nordhoff  Street, a place significant in the fight for more foot patrols.  </P> <P> The street is lined with two- and three-story apartment buildings that were  Valley luxury when they were built 15 years ago. Most of the residents are  working-class Latino families. To a stranger, the buildings look peaceful.  </P> <P> But drug dealers also live there, selling from their front doors and on the  street. Also in the building are prostitutes who work the motel strip on nearby  Sepulveda Boulevard. The combination terrorizes the other residents.  </P> <P> Foot patrols financed by the pilot program have been on the street for a month.  While crime went down, violence remained. Now, with support from Wachs, police  have erected a barricade to keep drug customers away. The press conference was  held to announce that officers on foot will bar everyone but residents, their  guests and commercial vehicles from the area.  </P> <P> This is a major test. If the combination of patrols and the barricade clean up  Columbus Avenue, the council and Bradley will find it difficult to resist  demands for more money for the foot cops.  </P></p>

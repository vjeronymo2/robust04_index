			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report given by Kim Ki-nam, secretary of the Central </F> Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) at the national  meeting of party cell secretaries held at the Pyongyang  Gymnasium in Pyongyang on 31 March -- recorded]    [Text] Comrades: Today we are holding the national meeting  of party cell secretaries under a ferment atmosphere in which  the whole party, all the people, and the entire Army are waging  the general onward march to effect an upsurge in the revolution  and construction and to further glorify the popular  mass-centered socialism of our own style, upholding the militant  tasks set forth in the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New  Year address and his letter to the National Agricultural  Meeting, and the decision of the 21st plenary session of the  sixth party Central Committee.    It is very significant that the national meeting of party  cell secretaries is held at a time when all party members and  people firmly defend and adhere to the socialism of our own  style, and demonstrate its superiority and vitality by smashing  all sorts of challenges and obstructive maneuvers of the  imperialists and reactionaries. [applause]    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent a message in which  he warmly congratulated the delegates to the meeting, as well as  all the party cell secretaries of the entire party. He also  clearly expounded the programmatic tasks of the work of party  secretaries, and ways and means of its implementation to bring  about a new upturn in the work in conformity with the  requirements of development of the party and revolution.  [applause]    This is a highest honor to the delegates to the meeting, as  well as the party cell secretaries of the entire party, and  greatly encourages them. [applause]    The current conference initiated by the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il personally is a historic meeting, the first of its  kind since the founding of the WPK. [applause]    It will powerfully demonstrate the revolutionary faith and  unshakable will of the entire party cell secretaries and party  members who have resolved to remain loyal to the party and the  leader [suryong] and have accomplished the cause of socialism to  the end without the slightest vacillation under today's complex  situation. Likewise, it will also mark an epochal turning point  in further strengthening the WPK into an invincible party and  accelerating the general march of socialism of our own style by  enhancing party cell secretaries' role and function. [applause]    Comrades: A long time has passed since our party's history  took root and the Korean revolution grew. The WPK scored great  accomplishments on the road of a long and arduous struggle,  which contributes greatly to realizing mankind's independent  cause and triumphantly advancing the Korean revolution.  [applause]    Under the revolutionary banner of the chuche idea, our party  audaciously overcame manifold difficulties and trials by  organizing and mobilizing the popular masses, firmly believing  in them. In so doing, our party turned our country into an  independent, self-reliant, and self-defending socialist power  that is the envy of all the people of the world. Furthermore,  it staunchly defended the most superior socialism of our own  style centered on the fatherland, the revolution, and the  popular masses, smashing all the enemies' aggressive and  provocative maneuvers. [applause]    Our party is highly trusted by all the Korean people, as  well as by international progressive people, because it  excellently carried out the national and international duty of  the Korean revolution and the international revolution.  [applause]    Through the long, difficult, and glorious struggle, the WPK  has been strengthened and has developed into a mature and tested  party with accumulated great revolutionary achievements and  extraordinarily rich experience and into the most mighty  revolutionary party that can advocate and complete the chuche  revolutionary cause and the socialist and communist cause to the  end through any storm and trial. [applause]    For the past few decades, taking the opportunity of the  collapse of communist and labor parties, which had pioneered  socialist causes in various countries, the imperialists and  reactionaries unprecedentedly strengthened their antisocialist  and anti-republic maneuvers. Amid such a circumstance, it is a  great source of pride and unequaled dignity of our party members  and people that they are vigorously advancing in front of the  times and mankind, while firmly defending and advocating the  chuche socialism following the leadership of the indomitable  party. [applause]    Party cells, which are the most basic organization of the  party to strengthen and develop our party and to enable the  Korean revolution to advance in victory, and which are direct  combat units for implementing the party's line and policy,  played a very important role.    In a congratulatory message sent to the delegates of the  meeting, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: The  founding, strengthening, and development of our party cannot be  separated from the strengthening and development of the basic  party organization -- party cells.    Party cells are the most basic organizations of the party,  which is a organic body of party organizations. A man is  healthy when all cells composing the human body are healthy.  The party can become stronger and properly carry out its  mission and duty as the guide of society only when all party  cells composing the party smoothly play their functions and  roles.    A party without strong party cells deeply rooted in party  members and popular masses is merely a building in the sky that  cannot even maintain its own existence. This is a lofty truth  and a serious lesson that was proven during the process of the  construction of our party and by the history of the  international communist movement.    For the first time in the history of the communist movement,  the WPK had the chuche idea -- the most scientific and  revolutionary world outlook of the working class -- as the  guideline and brilliantly embodied it and uniquely pioneered a  new road for building a revolutionary party.    The WPK is a new chuche-type revolutionary party founded by  the method of forming basic party organizations first, and then  expanding and strengthening them. [applause]    In the historic Karun meeting held in 1930, the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song presented a unique party founding policy of  founding a party not by promulgating the party center first, but  by forming basic party organizations after sufficient  arrangements and then endlessly expanding and strengthening them.    This policy put forth by the great leader was the  chuche-oriented policy that elucidated the most correct way to  make it possible to solve all the problems in founding the party  smoothly in conformity with the specific reality of our country  and the demand of our revolution and to build a strong and  mighty revolutionary party of the working class. [applause]    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song formed the first party  organization, the origin of our party, with the new generation  young communists, whom he himself had brought up immediately  after the Karun meeting. This became the original form and  mother's body of the party organizations that were organized one  after another thereafter.    The anti-Japanese armed struggle, which the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song organized and led, was a sacred war for  democracy and liberation to defeat the Japanese imperialist  aggressors and restore the stolen country under the banner of  the chuche idea. At the same time, it was a glorious struggle  to establish the revolutionary party, the general staff of the  Korean revolution. [applause]    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, organizing and leading  the overall Korean revolution, with the anti-Japanese armed  struggle at its center, brought up numerous communists who were  firmly armed with the working class revolutionary idea and  tempered in the practice of the revolutionary struggle. At the  same time, he firmly realized the purity of the communist ranks  and their ideological and volitional unity.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song saw to it that many  party organizations were formed in the country and in the Korean  residential areas in the northeastern region of China, and  orderly established the uniform guiding system of party  organizations of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, thus  firmly realizing the party's leadership for the overall Korean  revolution.    Because our party had a strong organizational and  ideological  foundation of party building and the glorious revolutionary  tradition, which were formed in the blaze of the long and  arduous anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, it was able to  promulgate its founding to the entire world without delay on a  solid base in the difficult and complicated condition after the  liberation. [applause]    After its founding, our party accepted many advanced  elements  from the working popular masses, including workers, peasants,  and intellectuals; expanded the party ranks; and organized many  party cells everywhere there were party members and the masses,  including plants and rural areas. At the same time, our party  emphasized strongly bringing up the organized party cells and  enhancing their role.    Under the wise leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song, the party cells and party cores increased in great  numbers and the party members' political and ideological  standard and vanguard roles were enhanced. Therefore, our party  was brought up strong organizationally and ideologically within  a short period of its founding, took root deep in the masses,  and was able to smoothly carry out its leadership role for the  revolution and construction as a ruling party following its  founding.    During the Fatherland Liberation War, our party further  strengthened the party cells' militant function and role and  enhanced the party members' party consciousness in conformity  with the wartime conditions. By so doing, our party vigorously  organized and mobilized all party members, soldiers of the  People's Army, and all the people of the country to the struggle  to win the war.    By forming the party organizations, including party cells,  in  the units, large and small, of the Korean People's Army [KPA] of  all levels, our party ensured that the party's leadership of the  People's Army is strengthened and the party's political work is  vigorously conducted in the Army.    Even in those busy days of shouldering the heavy burden of  the war all by himself, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song  went deep among the soldiers of the People's Army and the people  and vigorously aroused them to new victories and exploits. At  the same time, he exercised his leadership so that the party  cell work is militantly conducted and core party members are  brought up in large numbers in conformity with wartime  conditions.    During the days of fierce war, the heroic defenders of  Wolmido and 1211 Meter Hill, the 10 party members of Nagwon, and  all other party members, soldiers of the People's Army, and  people highly displayed the boundless loyalty to the party and  the leader, enthusiastic love for the country, and mass heroism,  and attained a historic victory in the difficult war with the  joint imperialist forces led by the U.S. imperialists, thus  demonstrating the spirit of the heroic Korea to the entire  world. [applause]    Our party firmly established the chuche in all fields after  the war, firmly and strongly brought up the basic party  organizations, including the party cells, and enhanced the party  members' party consciousness and vanguard role in order to  vigorously push ahead with the socialist revolution and  construction.    In the difficult days after the war, our party cells and  party members, with the firm faith to believe and follow the  great leader with all their hearts and minds, resolutely  protected and defended the party Central Committee headed by the  respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song. Effecting the  Chollima upsurge in socialist construction, they resolutely  crushed the anticommunist offensive and push-to-the-North  commotion of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges and the  antiparty and counterrevolutionary maneuvers of the factionalist  elements colluding with outside forces.    After the liquidation of factions, which did enormous harm  to  the party and the revolution's development with the  establishment of the socialist system and with the passage of  its history, our party vigorously organized and mobilized all  the party cells and party members to the struggle to further  enhance the party's unity and cohesion and leadership role and  to effect a revolutionary upsurge in all fronts of socialist  construction.    The great leader put forth the formula for the first time in  history that the basis of party work is work with people, and  exercised his leadership so that the party organizations of all  levels, including the party cells, may conduct effective  organizational and political work to firmly rally the party  members and masses around the party and organize and mobilize  them to the implementation of the party policy. With ceaseless  on-the-spot guidance, he energetically guided the party cells'  work.    Under the wise leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song, the party organizations of all levels, including the  party cells, were brought up strong and the party members' party  consciousness and vanguard role were further enhanced. This  enabled our party to strengthen its militant might and  leadership role enormously, thereby bringing forth an  unprecedented revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction.  As a result, the relations of kinship between the party and the  popular masses became so firm that no force could break them.  [applause]    In conformity with the demand of our party's chuche-oriented  party building ideology, the work to strengthen the party cells  was more vigorously pushed ahead in the grand struggle to model  the entire party membership and entire society on the chuche  idea under the outstanding and tested leadership of the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. [applause]    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il wisely led the work to  bring up strong the party cells, the lowest level basic party  organization, and enhance their role in order to strengthen and  develop our party to be the chuche-type revolutionary party  forever and to develop the chuche revolutionary cause  continuously and vigorously.    The works the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published  early in the 1960's: "On Effectively Conducting the Guidance  for Party Members' Party Life in Conformity With the Party  Cells' Duty," "The Party Cells Should Correctly Organize the  Party Assignment and Sum It Up in a Timely Manner," "Let Us  Strengthen the Party Members' Ideological and Volitional Unity  and Cohesion Based on the Leader's Revolutionary Idea," and many  other works of his became a programmatic guideline to improve  the party cell work and the party members' party life. [applause]    In that period, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il gave  on-the-spot guidance in detail to the party cells of the  Department of Political and Economic Science of the College of  Economics of Kim Il-song University; of the No. 1 machinery work  team of Pyongyang Spinning Machinery Plant's tool shop; of the  rolling machine repairing team of Hungnam Fertilizer Plant  synthetic shop; of Komidae, Ohyon-ri, Yanan county, South  Hwanghae Province; of the No. 6 party cell of the actors and  actresses group of the Korean Film Studio; and many other party  cells.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il declared it as our  party's supreme program to model the entire society after the  chuche idea and presented the party construction policy on  modeling the entire society after the chuche idea in the 1970's.  He presented principles for establishing the party's unitary  ideological system in accordance with the new demand of our  party and the developing revolution and enabled party cells to  vigorously push out with the work of raising party members as  enthusiastic, chuche-type communist revolutionaries, who are  boundlessly loyal to the party and the leader, and who uphold  the leadership of the party central. [applause]    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has led party cells to  effectively carry out work to firmly arm all party members with  our party's chuche idea and to make them firmly establish the  view of revolution, the view of leader, the view of  organization, and the view of masses. Developing the way of  summing up the party life, which was used by anti-Japanese  guerrillas, in accordance with today's reality, he established a  new system of summing up the party life for the entire party.  He has also made it possible to regularize and standardize the  party life and has led party members to constantly season their  party-oriented traits [tangsong] by participating in the party  life with a sincere and self-conscious attitude and with a  correct view of party organization.    The national party cell secretaries training held in May  1991  was a remarkable momentum in strengthening our party cells. In  the historic letter "Let Us Strengthen Party Cells" he sent to  the national party cell secretaries training, the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il presented the programmatic task of further  strengthening party cells in accordance with the development of  our party and the revolution to create a new turning point in  party cells' activities, and he clearly elucidated the way to  implement it.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il noted: "Let us make all  party cells loyal ones." This is an important slogan presented  by our party today, as well as a primary task that party  organizations should implement.    All party cells and cell secretaries have vigorously  struggled for the past three years to make each party cell a  cell with boundless loyalty to the party and the leader,  upholding the historic letter "Let Us Strengthen Party Cells"  that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il sent to the national  party cell secretaries training.    Many party members of various party cells, including the  party cells of the No. 1 machinery work team of Pyongyang  spinning machinery plant's tool shop and of the high-speed  heading section of Tokchon mine's No. 4 pit in the Tokchon  district mining complex, humbly sent letters of loyalty to the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il expressing their will to be  faithful to the chuche revolutionary cause to the end and to  entirely entrust their destinies to him, following the party  invariably, and they have been brilliantly putting their  determination into practice. The dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il sent his personal letter of love to many party cells  and party members, extending his sublime intent to give them the  greatest honor and confidence and boundless expectations and  encouragement. [applause]    As mentioned above, the leader [yongdoja] firmly trusts  party members and gives them great confidence and benevolence,  and party members absolutely trust and follow the leader and  fulfill their loyal and filial duties for him. Therefore, our  party has become great today, and socialism of our own style  becomes more victorious as days go by. [applause]    In the course of the vigorous movement to create loyal party  cells, many people have grown to be genuine loyal servants, who  faithfully trust and follow the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song  and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as well as resolutely  protect and defend the party and the leader [suryong]  politically, ideologically, and death-defyingly.    There are lofty examples and steady efforts of cell  secretaries, who are boundlessly loyal to our party, in the  heroic struggle and precious feats registered by many party  members and working people, who protected and defended the party  and the leader politically, ideologically, and death-defyingly  by sacrificing even their valuable lives in unexpected  emergencies.    The lofty traits of Comrade Hyon Chang-sik, a party cell  secretary of the Pukkyongju railway section of the Kaechon  Railway General Bureau's Chongju railway division, who  guaranteed the safety of a train in a heavily rainy midnight by  displaying his peerless self-sacrificing and heroic spirit; of  Comrade Yi Chong-hun, a secretary of No. 1 party cell of the  fishing sector of the Pochon Fishery Cooperative in Myongchun  County, North Hamgyong Province, who threw himself into the dark  blue sea without hesitation after handing over his life vest and  portraits of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il to a young member of the League of  Socialist Working Youth of Korea as all fishermen who were with  him on a fishing boat adopted the general party cells meeting's  decision to keep their portraits undamaged, risking their lives  when the boat faced a crisis of shipwreck due to a sudden  typhoon and a tidal wave; and of party members of this cell show  our party members' firm and pure loyalty to the party and the  leader. [applause]    Party cells and cell secretaries are devotedly struggling to  resolutely protect, defend, and add luster to the achievements  made by the party and the leader. Considering our party's  honorable, chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition to be the  lifeline of our revolution, party cells and cell secretaries are  resolutely struggling to firmly protect it under any stormy  circumstances and to thoroughly embody it in all areas of the  revolution and construction.    A great number of party cell secretaries and party members  throughout the country have discovered scores of thousands of  new revolutionary slogans, remains, and relics in the past  several years alone, going up and down the rocky mountains, with  the revolutionary determination to glorify our party's honorable  revolutionary tradition through generations.    When an unexpected fire took place in the mountains one day  several years ago, party cell secretaries of Yongsindae, Saebyol  County, North Hamgyong Province surrounded trees engraved with  slogans thick and threefold and ultimately protected the slogans  despite of being seriously burnt in the fierce fire. [applause]    There are many party cell secretaries who are making devoted  efforts to further glorify our party's revolutionary tradition.  For example, Comrade Choe Chae-yong, a party cell secretary of  the Sinpa Revolutionary Museum, has located and examined many  underground revolutionary organizations and revolutionary  remains of the anti-Japanese struggling period for the past 26  years.    Party cells of units, to which the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il gave  on-the-spot guidance, are protecting and defending the great  achievements of the party and the leader by completely  implementing tasks presented during their on-the-spot guidance.    In the work to follow and learn about the No. 2 cell party  members of the fifth bureau of KCNA, the party cells and cell  secretaries are closely linking and substantially carrying out a  living example of loyally upholding the great leader by all the  generations of the revolution and the work to follow and learn  the positive example that is being manifested in their party.  Thus, many loyalists and dutiful children of the nineties were  fostered.    Through the loyal party cell creation movement, the party  cells are fostering the party members to advocate, adhere to,  and all the more elucidate socialism of our own style centered  on the popular masses so they can become resolute fighters.    In the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's immortal classical  works including, "Socialism of Our Own Style Centered on the  Popular Masses Is Invincible and Ever-Victorious," "The  Historical Lesson in Socialist Construction and Our Party's  General Line," "On the Fundamental Problem of the Revolutionary  Party Construction," and "Slander of Socialism Cannot Be  Tolerated," he wholly analyzed and summed up our party's  immortal revolutionary achievements and struggle experiences  that were achieved through his iron-like theories and gem-like  theses while walking along the long and glorious road of the  historical lesson of socialist construction and as the socialist  ruling party. He also made it possible to all the more adhere  to and elucidate socialism of our own style, and brightly  elucidated the future road to revive socialism from a worldwide  scope. [applause]    The party cells and cell secretaries regarded the  chuche-oriented scientific socialist ideology and theory  elucidated by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as a firm  guiding principle. They also freshly carried out through  various forms and methods the indoctrination work for the party  members and workers to deeply recognize the truth of the true  superiority and invincible vitality of socialism of our own  style, the inevitability of the ultimate victory of socialist  cause, and that we will be victorious if we defend socialism and  die if we throw it away, by linking them with the lively reality.    Today, as long as our party members and people are possessed  with the spirit that the Korean nation is the best--that is the  spirit that our leader is the best, that our party is the best,  that our chuche idea is the best, and that the spirit that  socialism of our own style centered on the popular masses is the  best--and are possessed with the wise leadership of the party  and the leader; the single-hearted unity of the leader, the  party, and the masses; and a strong self-supporting national  economy and self-defensive national defense power--they have the  firm faith that our socialism is invincible and ever-victorious.  With this, they are carrying out a devoted and heroic struggle  to thoroughly advocate, adhere to, and all the more elucidate  socialism of our own style that is their living and life.  [applause]    The party cells and party members of the ship, Loyalty No.  5,  of the 24 May export goods fishery work site were confronted  with the South Korean puppet naval vessels many times on the  high seas during the past several years. However, each time  they triumphantly fully loaded their ship with goods by smashing  [chitbusyoborigo] the rascals' provocative maneuvers with the  faith of victory and spirit of exterminating the enemy without  the slightest wavering. Also, when the enemies made  provocations by burying thousands of explosives, the party  members of (Yiman)-ri, Panmun county, Kaesong city, held open  party meetings and vigorously sang songs like "Let's Defend  Socialism," at places where the rascals were clearly looking and  removed all the explosives, thus making the enemies shiver with  fear. Such struggle feats, as well as other struggle feats  carried out by many party cells and party members, show well the  resoluteness and firmness of the faith and will of our party  members and people, which are preciously treasured in their  hearts.    However, the imperialists and reactionaries rave to block,  suffocate, and crush [apsal] us, they cannot by any means  surprise our party members and people who are resolutely  fighting for the just cause by impregnably uniting around the  party and the leader. The rascals' maneuver is rather all the  more encouraging the revolutionary will and struggle enthusiasm  of our party members and people who are highly upholding the  revolutionary banner and socialist banner. [applause]    Upholding the slogan, "What the party decides, we will  do!" the party cells and cell secretaries are vigorously  inspiring party members and workers to the valuable struggle to  strengthen the might of socialism in our country and to fully  demonstrate its genuine superiority and vitality to the entire  world.    The party members and workers registered proud feats on all  fronts of socialist construction by more highly displaying  loyalty and filial piety to the party and to the leader and  invincible faith in and indomitable will for the socialist cause  even under complex situations and repeated difficulties. Thanks  to their devoted struggle, the might of our socialism has been  consolidated into an ever-victorious and indomitable one.  [applause]    By vigorously waging the struggle to thoroughly carry to  accomplishment our party's self-defense military line, party  cells are greatly contributing to strengthening the nation's  defense capabilities so we can smash the enemy in a stroke, no  matter how strong it may be.    Since we have highly upheld the respected general Kim  Chong-il as supreme commander of the KPA and chairman of the  DPRK National Defense Commission, the traditional fine custom of  military-civilian unity has bloomed more brilliantly.    Our party members and workers are sincerely looking after  soldiers of the People's Army--fighters of comrade supreme  commander--just like their own brothers, and soldiers of the  People's Army are unhesitatingly dedicating their youth and  lives to defending happy life, property, and lives of the  people. [applause]    Last year, when the U.S. imperialists frantically waged a  nuclear inspection row and the Team Spirit 1993 joint military  exercise in a bid to isolate and crush our republic--the  stronghold of socialism--a touch-and-go crisis resulted in which  a war threatened to break out at any time, all soldiers of the  People's Army, who heartily accepted the order of the respected  general Kim Chong-il, and people, rose like a rigorous mountain  and honorably defended the socialist fatherland and  revolutionary gains. [applause]    The party cells and cell secretaries are devotedly  struggling  to further consolidate and develop the single-hearted unity of  the leader, the party and the masses, which is the most precious  asset of our party and the revolution and invincible might of  our socialism.    The respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught us that the  whole party and all people, inheriting the glorious tradition of  our party and revolution on the single-hearted unity, should  firmly unite with dear Comrade Kim Chong-il. By upholding his  teaching, the party cells and cell secretaries firmly grasped as  the key task in the work of party cells to further strengthen  the single-hearted unity of the party and revolutionary ranks,  which is a decisive factor for success in the chuche  revolutionary cause and for the destiny of socialism. [applause]    Today all party members and people, in firm unity with the  party and the leader in one mind and one intention, are  breathing only according to the party's idea and will, no matter  how many of us there may be; are making exactly the same remarks  as that of the party; and are moving as one only according to  the party's order.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il inherited intact the  respected leader's lofty intent for welfare of the people and  society, and implemented politics of boundlessly lofty  benevolence and humanity. Highly praising the fine custom of  communists and beautiful acts of pioneers who dedicated  everything to the nation, to the people, to society and to  groups, he saw to it that all party members and people follow  and learn from them.    The fine custom of communists has brilliantly bloomed each  day among our party members and workers, such as an act of  voluntarily advancing to mines and cooperative farms, to which  the party directs strength, without wishing any reward, honor,  and comfortable life, by departing their beloved home and work  site; an act of unhesitatingly offering their own lives to  rescue people who are at the point of death; an act of sharing  their lives with soldiers who were wounded and disabled in the  sacred struggle to defend the nation, by marrying them; and an  act of fostering and sincerely looking after orphans and old men  without sons, like their own sons and daughters and parents.    This is a great pride of our party and people, and is the  true shape of our-style socialism under which the whole country  constitutes a great harmonious and happy family, sharing the  destiny. [applause]    In the course of vigorously waging the movement to create  loyal party cells, the party cells and cell secretaries effected  great improvement in strengthening the organization and guidance  of party life of the party members.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il stressed that the party  cells are the stronghold in the party life of party members, and  that proper organization and guidance of party life are the  basic mission of the party cells.    Only when the party's cell secretaries properly carry out  organization and guidance of the party life of party members can  they successfully resolve all problems raised in strengthening  our party and in enhancing its guiding role. Keenly realizing  this, the party's cell secretaries are making active efforts to  establish a diversified and revolutionary outlook on the party  life among the party members.    The party's cell secretaries are consciously leading the  party members so they realize that party organizations are their  protector that forges blood ties between the leader [suryong]  and party members and that looks after and leads them to  constantly glorify their political life and to love and respect  party organizations. The party's cell secretaries are leading  the party members so that they consciously accept guidance and  control by party organizations.    Today our party members truly follow party organizations,  just as a son does his mother, and call on their party cells to  frankly speak out what they cannot speak even to their own  family and relatives, thus seeking new encouragement and  strength from party organizations and party cells.    All of our party members are participating in the party life  voluntarily and faithfully according to the demand of the  party's regulations and of the rule in the party life. They  assumed the position of equal party members worthy of  revolutionaries who voluntarily joined the party, not at a  directive of anyone else, for the party and for the revolution,  regardless of their positions, merits, conditions and  circumstances. Thus, they are constantly disciplining their  loyalty to the party.    The party's cell secretaries are leading party members so  that they enhance their consciousness of the party, making such  consciousness their constitution, and put emphasis on enhancing  their loyalty to the party and to the leader in the course of  faithfully implementing the decision of party organization and  assignment given by the party. They are leading the party  members so they will successfully carry out the revolutionary  tasks on a lofty political and ideological level.    The party's cell secretaries are leading the party members  so  that they correctly realize that the party life is a course of  implementing the revolutionary tasks assigned by the party and  the purpose of strengthening the party life is to satisfactorily  carry out the revolutionary tasks. The party's cell secretaries  make efforts to ensure that all factors involving party  conference, summing up of the party life, organization of  assignments, study, and guidance of party life, will contribute  to implementing revolutionary tasks. The party's cell  secretaries are leading the party members so that they play the  vanguard role in satisfactorily implementing the revolutionary  tasks.    By establishing the revolutionary outlook on study among the  party members, the party's cell secretaries are leading the  party members so that they will educate the masses with  temperament and traits as political activists, and will fulfill  honorable missions and duties as educator and propagandist of  the masses to actively inspire the masses to implementing the  revolutionary tasks.    The party's cell secretaries are the core of our party and  primary political functionaries who directly organize and guide  the party life of party members by bearing the responsibility  for our party's lowest [maltan] basic organizations. Therefore,  it is a prerequisite and important guarantee for strengthening  the party cells to properly organize the party's cell  secretaries and to enhance their role.    After the national lecture of party cell secretaries party  committees at all levels held more firmly meetings of party cell  secretaries, attended by those party members who are infinitely  loyal to the party and the leader [suryong], whose party and  working class position are firm, and who enjoy confidence among  party members and are firmly prepared politically and  administratively.    Party organizations, including party committees of  Mangyongdae-kuyok of Pyongyang, Onsong County of North Hamgyong  Province, and Songjin Steel Works, have given the work  directives to party cell secretaries in a timely manner, and  organized lectures, workshops, and discussion sessions for party  cell secretaries on a regular basis and in a substantial manner.  In these party organizations, party functionaries directly go on  the spot to assist party cell secretaries in conformity with the  party's demand, "Let us party functionaries mingle with party  cells and the masses."    Today, our party has hundreds of thousands of vigorous and  militant party cells which have grown up with the first party  organization organized by a few young communists in the period  of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle as the parent body.  Through these party cells our party members and people are  breathing together with our party regardless of whether they  live in remote rural villages, islands, and oceans which are far  from the fatherland. [applause]    Party cells and party cell secretaries have more firmly  rallied the masses of all strata around the party by properly  carrying out their work with the masses. The dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il has elucidated that properly carrying out the work  with the masses is an important problem related to the destiny  of the party and the revolution and that it is an important duty  of party cells and party cell secretaries.    Party cells and cell secretaries, by concentrating special  efforts on their work with the masses, have seen to it that they  thoroughly abide by their class position without forgetting  their past situation and class origin and play the leading role  in upholding the party and the leader [suryong] and safeguarding  and defending socialism. Party cells have led the bereaved  families of revolutionaries, the families of fallen soldiers,  the families of those killed by the enemy, disabled veterans,  and discharged soldiers, and other core masses to be model in  all fields of their work and life and to be loyal to the party  and the leader generation after generation.    By paying interest to indoctrinating young people of new  generations, who are the successors to our revolution, in a  revolutionary manner party cells and cell secretaries are  fostering all of them into young vanguards who are infinitely  loyal to the party, the leader, and the socialist cause like the  anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters--who were infinitely loyal  to the great leader [suryong] on the days of anti-Japanese  struggle--and like the heroic fighters--who struggled for the  party, the leader, the fatherland, and the people at the risk of  their lives during the fatherland liberation war.    Party cell secretaries have become the standard bearers who  lead intellectuals in their units to carry out the oath they  swore before the party at the Korean intellectuals meeting and,  thus, to perform the honorable mission and duty as the party's  eternal companion, faithful supporter, and outstanding adviser  and as the enthusiastic protector and thorough implementer of  the party's policy in the rewarding struggle of resolutely  safeguard and defend the party and the leader [suryong] and of  demonstrating the honor of chuche Korea and further  strengthening the might of our own style socialism.    Party cells and cell secretaries trust the masses as  indicated in the party policy of putting emphasis on their  present work and lives, rather than on their family background  and social and political life habit. They are also leading the  masses to sincerely trust the party and follow it.    It is thanks to the devoted struggle and unheralded efforts  of all party cell secretaries that the WPK has been strengthened  and developed into an ever-victorious revolutionary party taking  roots deep among the masses and that our party and people are  winning victory in succession in the political and military  confrontation with the enemies who are running wild to crush our  socialist cause. [applause]    By exerting efforts to possess the 10 characters of cell  secretaries set forth by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il,  our party cell secretaries are fondly called "our cell  secretary," "our cell secretary father" among party members and  working people and are highly respected and loved.    Among our party cell secretaries, there are martyrs like  Comrade Nam Sung-u, the late party cell secretary of Unit 3, Pit  No. 3 of Chuhung Mine, who sacrificed himself without hesitation  to save a revolution comrade at a critical moment; and there are  models of war victory movement of the nineties like Comrade Son  Suk-chin, secretary cell No. 7 of the People's Clinic of Hosan  County, who devoted her all for the recovery of patients working  as a nurse for 35 years since her days as a short-haired young  girl.    The tens of thousands of party cell secretaries, who are  endlessly loyal to the party and the leader and devoting their  everything for the fatherland and the people, are precious  treasures for our party and revolution. It is our party and  people's great pride to have such outstanding party cell  secretaries. [applause]    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il are putting the party cell secretaries at  the highest by calling them our party's core, professional  revolutionaries without particular position, and unpaid and  unheralded heroes, and are warmly holding their hands and  leading them to properly implement their honorable mission and  duty as the supervisors of the lowest basic-level party  organization and elementary political functionaries.    The WPK was given birth and brought up by the mother body  Construction Comrades Company, which was our party's first party  organization personally formed by the great leader. The fact  that the WPK was able to strengthen and develop itself into an  ever-victorious indomitable party with tens of thousands of  combat party cells endlessly loyal to the party, the leader, and  the chuche revolutionary cause; and the fact that our party cell  secretaries were able to fulfill their honorable mission and  obligations as elementary political functionaries in charge of  the party's basic organizations while leading happy lives and  walking along the single rewarding road of struggle are indeed  wholly a result of the wise leadership and family love of the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il and a great victory and lofty fruition of our party's  unique line for the construction of party organizations.  [applause]    Taking the opportunity of the meaningful occasion of the  meeting of party cell secretaries of the entire party, I pay the  utmost honor and the warmest thanks to the great leader of our  party and our people Comrade Kim Il-song, and to our party's  outstanding leader and the supreme commander of the Korea  People's Army [KPA] dear Comrade Kim Chong-il with the single  heart of enthusiastic admiration and endless loyalty from the  meeting participants and all the party members and people.  [applause]    Comrades, our revolution, which has victoriously advanced  under the banner of chuche ideology, stepped into a new stage of  development today, and our party and people are faced with the  weighty and honorable task of defending and advocating the  popular masses-centered socialism of our style from the  challenge of the imperialists and reactionaries, endlessly  developing it, and expediting the achievement of the nation's  long-cherished desire of the cause of fatherland reunification.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: To smash  [chitpusigo] all kinds of challenges and interfering maneuvers  of the imperialists and reactionaries, and to defend, advocate  and further glorify our socialism is an honorable task of our  party and people.    As in the past, so in the future, we should vigorously  expedite the ultimate victory of chuche revolutionary cause and  socialist cause by courageously overcoming all trials and  difficulties with the might of the single-hearted unity  displayed by all the party members and people, who are firmly  united around the party and the leader, and with the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, and by  continued reform and advancement while upholding the banner of  chuche ideology.    Our-style socialism, which has embodied and built chuche  ideology under the leadership of our party, is true socialism  designed in conformity with the popular masses' aspiration and  demand for independence. Our people have acquired the belief  through experience from actual living that the road of  defending, advocating, and glorifying our socialism, which  guarantees true freedom and equality, and a happy and rewarding  life, is the only way to a glorious life and to victory.    Socialism is our people's living and life. The question of  smashing the vicious political and ideological offensives,  military threats, and economic blockade maneuvers of the  imperialists and reactionaries, and defending, advocating, and  completing to the end the popular masses-centered socialism of  our own style depends on how to strengthen the party, which is  the staff department of revolution, and how to enhance the  leader role of the party.    The party cells are the bedrock which upholds our party, and  the revolutionary outposts which defend our socialism. The  party cells are the bases for assimilating the party members as  revolutionaries and working class, linking them with the party  Central Committee, and achieving the blood-tie relationship  between the party and the masses. They are the direct combat  units for organizing and mobilizing the party members and  working people to follow and implement the party's line and  policy.    To strengthen the party cells is to strengthen the main body  of our party and our revolution and an important guarantee for  advocating and glorifying our socialism. All party cells must  be strong so that our party becomes strong, and that the main  body of our revolution can bear indomitable might. When party  cells properly carry out their functions and roles, the  superiority and vitality of our country's socialism can be  highly demonstrated. [applause]    In his congratulatory message sent to the delegates of the  meeting, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: With  high responsibility and sense of honor, all the party cell  secretaries should make their cells as loyal cells endlessly  faithful to the party and as combat cells that vigorously  organize and mobilize the masses to the struggle to defend,  advocate, and glorify the socialist cause.    In order to make all the party cells endlessly faithful to  the party and the leader, and in order to make them combat  organizations for defending, advocating, and glorifying the  socialist cause, the five major tasks of the party cell  presented in the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's  congratulatory message sent to the delegates of the meeting, and  the pragmatic tasks presented by the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il in his historic letter "Let Us Strengthen the Party  Cells" sent to the participants of the national party cell  secretaries training held in May 1991 should be thoroughly  implemented. These are the basic duty and the most honorable  and responsible revolutionary tasks of the party cell and cell  secretaries today. [applause]    To uphold the unitary leadership of the party and the leader  with loyalty is the very life of the party cells. [applause]    To guarantee the unitarity of leadership within the party is  the fundamental principle of the party construction and  activities. When all party cells become loyal cells endlessly  faithful to the leadership of the party and the leader, the  party can be strengthened and developed into an ever-victorious  and indomitable revolutionary party.    The socialist cause is the cause of the working class, and  also the cause of the leader and the party. The leadership of  the party and the leader is the decisive guarantee for the  victorious advance of the socialist cause. [applause]    Today, our party's cause, the chuche revolutionary cause,  has been brilliantly inherited and is being developed under the  outstanding and tested leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il, who has an excellent appearance and qualification of  the people-oriented leader [yongdoja]. [applause]    Our party has satisfactorily resolved [wonmanhui haegyol]  the  issue of inheriting leadership in compliance with the demand of  the revolution's development and the popular masses'  aspirations. This is the proudest achievement in party building  and firmly guarantees the bright future and brilliant victory of  our party and our revolution. [applause]    All party cell secretaries must persistently carry out the  work to establish the party's monolithic leadership [yuilchok  yongdo] system, cherish deep in their hearts great pride in  upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the center of  unity, the center of unity, and the supreme commander of the  revolutionary armed forces, and uphold the party's leadership  with loyalty, devotion, and single-mindedness. [applause]    To have single-hearted, unchanging loyalty toward the party,  it is important for party cell secretaries and party members to  positively learn from the firm attitude and position of Comrade  Yi In-mo, the incarnation of faith and will, toward the leader  [suryong]. Because Comrade Yi In-mo had an incomparable faith  and will for his leader [suryong], his leader [chidoja], he  adhered to to the end the revolutionary principle and clear  conscience as a WPK member despite the enemy's harsh tortures  and various appeasement ploys when he was serving his prison  term behind the enemy lines for as many as 34 years. And, after  entering the embrace of the socialist fatherland, he tried to  repay the love and considerations of the party and the leader  [suryong] and wrote refined dedicated poems and lyrics which  extol the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the savior of his  destiny [unmyongui kuseju]. Those poems and lyrics impressed  all people.    Party cell secretaries must substantially carry out the  educational work of instilling a revolutionary outlook on the  leader [suryong], an outlook on morality, and an outlook on life  among the party members by closely linking this work to the work  of learning from the firm attitude and position of Comrade Yi  In-mo toward the party and the leader [suryong] and his high  party spirits. In this way, party cell secretaries must raise  the party members into indomitable communist revolutionaries who  adhere to the resolves, which they conveyed when joining the  party, share the same destiny with the party, and sincerely  uphold the party and the leader [suryong] without any personal  desire, change of mind, or hypocrisy under any circumstances or  environment.    Loyalty toward the party and the leader [suryong] must be  demonstrated in the struggle for revolution and construction.  Party cell secretaries must have a revolutionary habit of  unconditionally accepting and completely implementing the great  leader's teachings, the dear comrade leader's words [malssum],  and the party's lines and policies which embodied those  teachings and words.    Party cells and party cell secretaries must positively make  efforts to more thoroughly establish the revolutionary  discipline under which the entire party, all the people, and the  entire Army move like one under the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il's monolithic leadership. They also must not allow the  slightest phenomena to obstruct [chohae] the party's monolithic  leadership but powerfully wage struggles to overcome [kukpok]  them in a timely manner.    Party cells and party cell secretaries must make all party  members impregnable fortresses and enthusiastic guns and bombs  who resolutely defend the party and the leader [suryong]  politically and ideologically by devoting their lives under any  circumstances and environment. [applause]    Defending and maintaining the achievements by the party and  the leader [suryong] and glorifying them generation after  generation is an important demand for upholding the leadership  of the party and the leader [suryong] with loyalty and  completing our party's revolutionary cause to the end.    Party cells and cell secretaries should lead all party  members and the working people so that they can firmly arm  themselves with our party's revolutionary tradition, resolutely  safeguard and defend it, and thoroughly embody it in their work  and life. Those party cells which received the on-the-spot  guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il should thoroughly implement the  tasks presented at the on- the-spot guidance to demonstrate a  model in all aspects.    It is the basic duty of party cells to foster party members  to be resolute revolutionaries who carry out indomitable  struggles for the party, for the revolution, and for the victory  of the socialist cause by properly organizing and guiding party  members' party life.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Properly  carrying out the organization and guidance for party members'  party life is the basic duty of party cells and is also an  important key to successfully solve all problems.    Party cells are the strongpoint of the party life of party  members. They are also the basic unit which directly organize  and guide their party life. Party cells should grasp the  organization and guidance to party members' party life as the  basis of party cells' work and concentrate great efforts on  this. Thus, party cells should foster party members into  indomitable revolutionaries who are infinitely loyal to the  party and the leader [suryong] and who risk their lives to  struggle for the victory of the socialist cause of chuche.    Party cells should strengthen the organization and guidance  to the party life of cadres, who are the commanding members of  the revolution, and, thus, should thoroughly revolutionize them.  Party cells and cell secretaries should see to it that cadres  who lead party lives under their units become standard bearers  and hands in upholding the party and the leader [suryong],  enthusiastic communist revolutionaries who fight to the end with  loyalty for the party and the leader with the firm determination  to defend the revolutionary outposts assigned by the party at  the risk of their lives, and genuine servants who devotedly  serve the people.    Important in party life organization and guidance is to  establish a voluntary and revolutionary party life habit among  party members. Party members cannot live for even a moment nor  maintain their political life apart from their party  organization. Party cells should see to it that all party  members emulate the lofty model of the view of the party  organization that the great leader Comrade and the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il have personally shown and, thus, respect  and treasure party organizations and make active efforts to  willingly receive the guidance and control of party  organizations.    Party cells should see to it that party members are clearly  aware of the regulations of the party and the rule of party  life, lead their party life in accordance with these regulations  and rule, and sincerely implement party organizations' decisions  and assignments.    Party meetings, summing-up sessions of party life, and party  lectures are important in party organizational and ideological  life. Party cells should thoroughly do away with such phenomenon  of sticking to unnecessary formalities and conducting empty  talks in their general cell meetings and should see to it that  all party members fully present their creative and constructive  opinions at the general meetings by properly carrying out  meeting preparations and operations. At the same time, party  cells should also establish a strong discipline under which  party members do not fail to implement the problems discussed  and decided on at party cell meetings in a timely manner.    Party cells should lead party members so that they can  sincerely and conscientiously present summaries at their party  life summing-up meetings and frankly accept fellow comrades'  criticism and make sincere efforts to correct their mistakes.    Party cells should properly hold study sessions and lectures  in close combination with reality so that party members can  obtain political nutrition and good knowledge and technology  which can be used in carrying out revoltuionary tasks. Party  cells should correctly organize and guide party members' party  life in close combination with the implementation of their  revolutionary tasks so that all party members can play a leading  and model role in the implementation of their revolutionary  tasks.    It is the responsible duty of the party cell to make the  broad masses firmly unite around the party by properly carrying  out the work with the masses. The work with them is an  important work to consolidate the party's mass-oriented  foundation and to strengthen the main force of the revolution.    Our people were able to become ever-victorious in the ardent  and harsh road of the revolution in which they had to go through  a sea of fire and blood in fighting against Japan; conduct a  fierce battle against the U.S. imperialists -- who are proud of  being the greatest power in the world; rise to their own feet  again on the ruins of war in which everything was destroyed; and  fiercely struggle against the imperialists who wanted to crush  [apsal] our socialism. This is due to the single-hearted unity  of all the people firmly united as one around the party and the  leader [suryong].    Today our revolution is being vigorously advanced under the  leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is  endlessly loyal to the popular masses' cause for independence.  Also, the tradition of single-hearted unity has been  excellently inherited. [applause]    To firmly consolidate the great unity and cohesion of  loyalty  and filial piety which have been handed down generation after  generation, we must lead all people to more firmly unite around  the party by constantly concentrating great efforts on the work  with the broad masses.    In carrying out the work with the masses, it is very  important to enhance the role of party cells and the party cell  secretaries who are directly engaged in the work with the masses  and who live together with them. The party cells and the party  cell secretaries must foster the popular masses to become the  cornerstone [chosok] that can truly and constantly uphold the  party and the leader [suryong] and to be the enthusiastic  revolutionaries loyal to the socialist cause and not forgetful  of their origins, by concentrating preferential efforts on the  work with the masses, a class foundation of the party.    The party cells must lead the bereaved family members of the  revolutionaries, the bereaved war family members, the family  members victimized by enemy barbarities, and the key members of  our party, including heroes and veterans, to set an example for  their works and lives by excellently carrying out their pledge  of loyalty made to the party during the national meeting of  heroes, the national meeting of the family members of martyrs,  and the national meeting of veterans, and to be endlessly loyal  and dutiful to the party and the leader [suryong] generation  after generation. [applause]    The party cells must vigorously carry out the work of making  all agricultural working people become loyal to the party, the  leader [suryong], and the socialist cause to the end by  constantly strengthening the leadership role of the working  class.    Youth are the successors to our revolution, flowers of the  future, and the most powerful army units in our society. Only  when the loyalty and revolutionary spirit of the previous  generation who braved the ardent storm of the revolution under  the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong] are  constantly handed down to the next generation can our  revolution's life be strongly retained and the socialist cause  be endlessly consummated.    The party cells must foster all members of the League of  Socialist Working Youth of Korea [LSWYK] to become the true  vanguard fighters who resolutely safeguard the party and the  leader [suryong] and take the lead in implementing our party's  plans and intents after becoming five million rifles and bombs,  as well as 5 million (Yi Su-poks), by actively backing the work  of the primary LSWYK organizations to implement their pledge  made to the party during the eighth meeting of the LSWYK.  [applause]    The party cells must properly carry out the work with  intellectuals so that they can properly carry out their  honorable mission and duty with their high revolutionary  awareness and clean communist consciousness, as the eternal  companions, the faithful supporters, the outstanding advisers of  our party, and as the warm supporters and the thorough  implementors of party policy, thus brilliantly carrying out  their pledge made to the party during the meeting of Korean  intellectuals. [applause]    Party cells should properly carry out work with the masses  of all strata who have different social and political life  circumstances, upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's  noble polititics of benevolence, so that they sincerely trust  and follow our party and faithfully work, devoting their all for  the party, the leader, the fatherland, and the people.  [applause]    Party cells and cell secretaries should properly lead cadres  to take the initiative, party members to play the leading and  key role, and public organizations to vigorously wage work with  their members in conformity with their duty and characteristics  in further strengthening the singlehearted unity of the party  and the revolutionary ranks by embodying our party's traditional  work method in which one person indoctrinates and moves 10  persons, 10 persons indoctrinate and move 100 persons, 100  persons indoctrinate and move 1,000 persons, and 1,000 persons  indoctrinate and move 10,000 persons.    Effecting constant innovations and upsurges in socialist  construction by vigorously waging the three  revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--is an  important revolutionary task facing party cells. The three  revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--are the  revolutions at the highest plane to completely realize the  popular masses' independence. Therefore, the key and basic way  of effecting revolutionary upsurges on a continuous basis in  socialist construction lies precisely in vigorously waging the  three revolutions.    Party cells should vigorously carry out the ideological  revolution, grasping it as a most priority revolution. The  ideological revolution is an important work which strengthens  the main force of the construction of socialist and communist  society by making all people revolutionary, assimilating them  into the working class, making them socialist, and modeling them  after the chuche idea. It is also the basis in human reform  work.    Confrontation between socialism and capitalism is synonymous  with ideological confrontation. The imperialists are  strengthening more viciously then ever before the ideological  and cultural offensives to break up the peosple's faith in  socialism and to destroy the revolutionary ranks politically and  ideologically.    To thoroughly smash ideological and cultural infiltration by  imperialism and to firmly protect the purity of socialist  ideology, it is imperative to give priority to the ideological  revolution over all work and, thus, to firmly arm all party  members and the working people with independent ideological  consciousness.    The basis in carrying out the ideological revolution is to  firmly arm all people with the chuche idea, which is the only  guiding ideology of our party, the revolution, and socialism.    Party cells should constantly strengthen indoctrination in  the chuche idea among party members and the working people so  that they take the chuche idea as their firm faith and think,  work, and live in accordance with the demands of the chuche idea  wherever and whenever.    Party cells should resolutely struggle against all sorts of  old and reactionary ideologies, including capitalist ideology,  revisionism, dogmatism, and flunkeyism, and, thus, should  prevent different ideologies running counter to the chuche idea  from infiltrating into our society. Party cells should conduct  ideological indoctrination work among party members and the  working people in a substantial manner to make loyalty to the  party and the leader the faith, conscience, morality, and  routine life, to firmly arm them with the Korean-nation-is-first  spirit, and to lead them to live our own style. Thus, party  cells should foster party members and the working people to  become enthusiastic revolutionaries and genuine patriots who  struggle for the party, the leader, the grandeur and prosperity  of the socialist fatherland, and the final victory of the chuche  revolutionary cause, devoting their all.    Socialism is mankind's ideal. It is the rule of history that  socialism wins victory in the struggle against capitalism.    Party cells and cell secretaries should conduct in various  up-to-date forms and methods not only the indoctrination to  plant firm faith in and strong will of the victory of the chuche  revolutionary cause, the socialist cause, among party members  and the working people, but also the indoctrination to lead them  to view and judge all social phenomena from a working class  viewpoint and from the revolutionary principle, to clearly know  the inherent nature of imperialist aggression and the  inevitability of defeat of capitalism, and to resolutely  struggle for the victory of the socialist cause.    Party cells should conduct indoctrination to influence  people substantially by positive examples to make the beautiful  communist virtues of helping and leading each other, of being  all for one and one for all, and of sharing joy and sorrow bloom  further throughout the whole society. At the same time, party  cells should also fill the whole society with the noble and  revolutionary ethos.    Party cells should concentrate great efforts on carrying out  the cultural revolution so that all party members and the  working people have high creative ability and enjoy a genuine  socialist cultural life. The cultural revolution is a task to  lead all people to enjoy a cultural life to their hearts'  content by liberating them from the constraint of old culture,  making them have a high technological and cultural level, and  creating a socialist culture which serves the popular masses.    Party cells should actively contribute to making  intelligentsia of the whole society by establishing a  revolutionary study habit among party members and the working  class. Party cells should assiduously build all work sites,  villages, streets, and houses so that all the people can enjoy  working and living under cultural circumstances and conditions.    In particular, party cells should thoroughly implement the  five major tasks of completing electrification, the introduction  of piped water services, and (urbanization) of rural areas to a  higher level and of realizing the introduction of the  central-heating system and the introduction of the gas system in  rural villages. Thus, they should eliminate differences in  living conditions between the urban and rural people.    Party cells should see to it that party members and the  working people bring their wisdom and talent into full bloom in  developing the socialist culture and enjoy their socialistic  cultural life to their hearts' content with a lofty cultural  ability.    Party cells at the front of socialist cultural construction,  including education, science, culture, arts, public health,  sports, should actively struggle to thoroughly implement our  party's line of socialist cultural construction to fully  demonstrate our nation's outstanding ability and wisdom. At the  same time, party cells at this front should vigorously  demonstrate the superiority of our own style socialism over  capitalism in the scientific, technological, and cultural  fields. [applause]    Developing socialist culture is an important condition to  successfully blocking the imperialists' ideological and cultural  infiltration. Party cells should vigorously organize and  proceed the cultural life of party members and the working  people in conformity with the ideological feelings of our people  and with the demands of our revolution to block corrupt  bourgeois culture from infiltrating our society.    Party cells should actively inspire party members and the  working people into the implementation of the technological  revolution and, thus, should lead them to effect new and great  upsurges in socialist economic construction.    The technological revolution is the basic way of remolding  nature, liberating workers from arduous work, and providing the  material and technological foundation that complies with the  demands of the socialist, communist society. Party cells should  vigorously inspire party members and the working people into  implementing the technological revolution and, thus, should lift  our science and technology to the advanced level of the world at  the earliest possible date.    Based on the scientific analysis of today's situation and  the  present status of our country's socialist construction, our  party has designated an adjustment year of three years and  presented its economic strategy of thoroughly implementing the  agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy,  of giving priority to the coal industry, power industry, and  railway transport, and of developing the metal industry during  this adjustment period.    The basic goal of our party's revolutionary economic  strategy  is to decisively solve the problem of the people's livelihood in  the two to three years to come by concentrating efforts on  developing agriculture, light industry, and trade; to regularize  production in all sectors by giving priority to the leading  sectors of the national economy; and to fully enhance the might  of existing economic foundations.    Party cells and cell secretaries should vigorously wage the  struggle to thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary  economic strategy, holding aloft the slogan of loyalty, "What  the party decides we will do." [applause]    Party cells should continue to struggle vigorously to  carry out the technological revolution in rural areas, upholding  the historic letter sent by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song  to the National Agricultural Conference, so as to actively  accelerate industrializing and modernizing agriculture.    Party members and agricultural working people of the rural  economic sector should do farm work scientifically and  technologically in accordance with the demand of the chuche  farming method, with self-awareness as masters in charge of the  country's food supply. By doing so, they should realize,  without fail, the high goal of agricultural production presented  by the party this year, which marks the 30th anniversary of the  publication of the rural theses.    Party cells in the light industry sector should well  maintain, strengthen, and modernize light industrial plants, and  should operate all facilities at full capacity to produce  various quality consumer goods at a large scale, upholding the  party's light industry-first policy.    Party cells in various sectors of the national economy  should  actively support light industry and drastically increase the  production of daily necessities and 3 August people's consumer  goods in all units.    Party cells in all sectors and units of the national economy  should actively inspire party members to struggle to produce  many quality export items and to develop processing trade by  firmly preparing export item production bases and by actively  exploring and mobilizing technological resources [kisul  wonchon], upholding the party's trade-first policy.    Party cells and party members in the sector of trade with  foreign countries should actively explore [kaechok] overseas  markets and gain our credit in trade [muyok korae-eso sinyongul  cholchohi chikidorok hayoya], in conformity with changing  environments.    In order to realize the party's strategic goals of economic  construction, it is important to give priority to the coal and  electric power industries and railway transportation, which are  primary sectors of the national economy, as well as to develop  the metal industry.    Party cells of the coal industry sector should vigorously  struggle to firmly uphold our party and our socialism by  increasing coal production. Party cells and party members of  the electric power industry sector should use our existing power  generation capability to the utmost and hasten the ongoing  construction of many power plants, so that they can smoothly  supply people's ever- increasing demand for electricity.    Party cells of the railway transportation sector should  strengthen the sector's material and technological basis and  completely implement the party policy on revolutionizing  transportation so they can deliver materials required by each  sector of the national economy in a timely manner.    Party cells of the metal industry sector should vigorously  carry out the struggle to increase steel products, with the  Chollima revolutionary spirit, which was demonstrated in the  great postwar Chollima upswing period.    We should greatly display the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude in order to completely implement the  party's revolutionary economic strategies, to smash the  imperialists' maneuver to apply economic sanctions [kyongje  pongswoe chaektong], and to constantly effect upsurges in  socialist construction.    All party members and working people [as heard] should  organize and mobilize party members and working people for the  struggle to completely implement the party's revolutionary  slogan "Let us accelerate the general onward march of socialism  with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude."  They should also create a new, great revolutionary upsurge in  all sectors of the national economy with the spirit of the  nineties' speed added to Chollima, by finding what is lacking  and creating what does not exist. [applause]    It is the party cells' important duty to reliably protect  the  socialist fatherland and revolutionary gains from the enemy's  aggression. We must not, even for a moment, neglect the work of  strengthening the national defense ability, under today's  condition that the imperialists are posing military threats  against us and are viciously conducting war provocation  maneuvers to crush our republic.    Party cells and party cell secretaries should help all party  members and working people always maintain great revolutionary  awareness to cope with the war provocation maneuvers by the U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique and help them  make every preparation to firmly defend the socialist fatherland  and revolutionary gains under any unexpected situation.    Party cells and party cell secretaries should firmly arm all  party members and people with the chuche-oriented view of war  and establish a social trait of valuing and learning from the  military [kunsa] in a sincere attitude, so that they can make  the whole country an impregnable fortress and make thorough  material preparations to cope with any enemy attack. [applause]    Party cells should vigorously wage the organizational and  political work to more highly display the traditional fine  custom of military-civilian unity.    The fine custom of military-civilian unity, which blooms  brilliantly in our country today, is the expression of one  intention and one will of the entire Army and all the people to  uphold General Kim Chong-il, our respected supreme commander, to  the end. It is also the expression of their lofty idea and  spirit to share the destiny with the party, no matter how  violent a storm may blow. [applause]    Only when the military actively helps the people while the  people sincerely support the military to achieve perfect harmony  and unity, can the People's Army be strengthened and developed  into an indomitable army and win victory in the fight with the  enemy, regardless of how strong it may be.    Party cells should encourage all party members and workers  to  always love and care for soldiers of the People's Army as their  own brothers and sons, who are defending the fatherland in  snowstorms and cold rain. Thus, they should help the soldiers  actively, sincerely, and warm-heartily.    If the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppet clique  provoke a new war, the Army and people, in firm unity with  respected supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, should rise,  like a stern mountain, in the struggle to defend the party, the  leader and popular mass-centered socialism of our own style  which we gained with blood, and should land an exterminatory  blow to the aggressors. Thus, we should again display dignity  and honor of heroic Korea. [applause]    National reunification is the supreme national task which  should no longer be delayed for our party and people. Upholding  the 10-point programs for great unity of the whole country which  was personally prepared and published by the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song, the sun of the nation and lodestar of  national reunification, party cells and cell secretaries should  achieve the unity of the whole country. They should vigorously  carry out the struggle to achieve national reunification in  accordance with the three principles of independence, peaceful  reunification and great national unity, based on the confederal  system.    We should make all party cells endlessly loyal to the party  and the leader and the militant organization to staunchly defend  and protect and carry to accomplishment the socialist cause, and  should enhance more highly the role and responsibility of the  party's cell secretaries.    By deeply cherishing a lofty pride and a sense of  responsibility in being our party's core responsible for the  lowest basic party organizations, all party cell secretaries  should devotedly struggle to satisfactorily carry out the work  for party cells.    For the party cell secretaries to fulfill their honorable  and  responsible missions and duties, they should completely and  perfectly preserve loyalty, revolutionary spirit, principle,  sense of responsibility, creativeness, sense of dedication, the  mass spirit [kunjungsong], humanity, optimism, and  integrity--the basic outlook defined by the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il--and should make efforts to constantly enhance  their political working level. [applause]    By cherishing the firm determination to share their destiny  with the party forever, the party's cell secretaries should make  loyalty to the party and leader their faith and constitution,  and should struggle by dedicating their lives to the party, the  leader, and victory of the chuche revolutionary cause, without  the slightest degree of wavering or change of heart [pyonsim] in  whatever trial they may face.    The party's cell secretaries should carry out all works in  the interest of the party and revolution with the lofty  revolutionary spirit and firm principle of the party and class,  and should staunchly defend the party's policies and line.  Thus, they should become the standard-bearers of the revolution  and struggle to lead the masses at the van of the struggle to  implement the party's policies and lines.    The party cell secretaries should endlessly love and respect  the people with a precise outlook on the masses, and should  become genuine servants who faithfully serve the people.    The party cell secretaries should always share the joys and  pains of the people according to the demand of the slogan put  forward by the party, "We serve the people," and should listen  to their voices. The party's cell secretaries should strive to  determine the difficulties and demands of the people with a  motherly love and should resolve them in a timely manner.    The party cell secretaries should never wield power or  expect privileges and special favors. Instead, they should  always lead a clean and upright life.    The party cell secretaries should make constant efforts to  enhance their political working level. Unless they constantly  enhance their standard in compliance with the demand of  developing realities, they cannot precisely organize and lead  the party life of the party members nor can they rightfully  organize and mobilize the party members to implement the party's  policies.    By studying hard and making constant efforts, the party cell  secretaries should firmly arm themselves with our party's chuche  idea, policies, and lines. Thus, they should prepare themselves  to become able functionaries with lofty working-level  capabilities.    Party organizations at all levels, including city and county  party committees, should make the conference of the party cell  secretaries a meeting of the core party members who are  unswervingly loyal to the party and to the leader, whose party  spirit and working-class position are firm, who are trusted by  the masses, and who have lofty, political, working-level  ability. All party functionaries should go down to the party  cells, and should properly help and substantively teach cell  secretaries.    Our party treasures the party cell secretaries as its core  and precious valuables. Through cell secretaries, our party is  leading the party life of all cadre members and party members,  and has forged blood ties with all people. Thus, our party  organizes and mobilizes party members and workers to implement  the party's policies and lines.    Trust in and expectations for the party cell secretaries by  our party and people are indeed great. The participants in the  meeting and all cell secretaries of the whole party should  excellently fulfill their honorable missions and duties in the  struggle to further strengthen our party and to defend, protect,  and accomplish the chuche revolutionary cause--the socialist  cause--and should meet without fail the lofty trust and  expectations by the party and people. [applause]    Our revolutionary cause is just, and our victory is sure. As  long as we have the ever-victorious, invincible revolutionary  leadership of the great leader and great party, the immortal  chuche idea, the heroic people firmly rallied behind the  outstanding leader, the firm, self-reliant national economy, and  the one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary armed forces, no strength  in the world can block our victorious advance. [applause]    Our party and people will not retreat even a step from the  revolutionary road which we chose ourselves, no matter how  complex or how acute a situation may be created and no matter  how grave the trial or difficulties of our revolution become.  We will effect a greater victory in the future, as we have in  the past, in the struggle to further glorify popular  mass-centered socialism of our own style by following the wise  leadership of the great leader [widaehan suryong] and  outstanding leader [tagwolhan yongdoja] with revolutionary  optimism and with the firm conviction in the justness of our  cause and of our victory. [applause]    Let us all vigorously fight to strengthen and develop our  party into a glorious chuche-type revolutionary party forever in  firm unity with the party Central Committee headed by the  respected Comrade Kim Il-song by upholding the ever-victorious  banner of the chuche idea. Let us all vigorously advance to the  final victory of the socialist cause, the party's cause.  [applause] [shouting of slogans, "Let us become the vanguard  and shields to defend with our lives the great leader and dear  comrade leader!" "All party cell secretaries should thoroughly  carry to accomplishment the five-point tasks of the party  cells!" "Let us uphold supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il  with single-hearted unity!"]</p>

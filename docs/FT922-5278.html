			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / France's smoking habit given a kick FRANCE, one of the last bastions of heavy smoking in Europe, is introducing tough restrictions on smoking in public places including trains, aircraft and restaurants. Under the restrictions published this weekend, which come into force on November 1, people will be allowed to smoke only in specially designated areas in public places such as restaurants, businesses, educational institutions, leisure centres and transport vehicles. If restaurants and leisure centres wish to allow customers to smoke they must provide special areas. Employers will also have to provide special zones. They will be given six months to consult with their companies' medical advisers and hygiene committees to decide how to reorganise offices, production floors and communal areas to accommodate smokers. Stiffer restrictions will be applied to public transport. The proportion of smoking seats on French trains will be reduced to 30 per cent. Smoking will be banned completely from buffet cars on trains, in metro stations and on all internal flights of less than two hours. Children under 16 will no longer be allowed to smoke in French schools and colleges. These restrictions reflect the general trend towards anti-smoking regulations across the European Community. However the French rules will be among the toughest in the EC. They reflect the French government's concern about the health hazards of smoking, said to be the direct cause of 54,000 deaths a year in France. Roughly 40 per cent of the French population now smoke, a far higher proportion than in most other EC countries. From November 1, anyone flouting the new laws will be punishable by fines of FFr300 to FFr600. Fines of FFr1,200 to FFr3,000 will be payable by restaurants and leisure centres.</p>

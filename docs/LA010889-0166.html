			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARRIVAL SIGNS  </P> <P> Picking up someone at Los Angeles International Airport when you are alone in  the car can be traumatic. There is no way to tell whether or not the flight you  are meeting is on time except to leave your car at the curb and enter the  terminal. By the time you've done this, your car will be ticketed by security.  I have a suggestion.  </P> <P> Why couldn't the airlines put up a computerized sign outside their terminals  for motorists to view? This sign would designate the arrivals for say, 30  minutes, telling the on-time and late arrivals.  </P> <P> EUNICE MENZING  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

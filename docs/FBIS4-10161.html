			<p>BFN     [Text] On 4 April, Peace Commission leader Hector Rosada  Granados reported that both the uprooting of people by the local  armed confrontation and the historic clarification of the past  -- known as the Truth Commission's work -- will be treated  separately by the government and guerrilla delegates in May in  what will be a follow-up of the peace talks. Rosada Granados  said these subjects will be discussed in this order and that the  second one will be debated in an ad hoc meeting. He said  special mechanisms will be used to complete the discussion after  it was decided to carry out the study and analysis. The official  said the signing of the framework agreement early in the year  was the end of the beginning and that the General Agreement on  Human Rights now marks the beginning of the end.    Rosada said he regards the fulfillment of the agreement very  probable because he detected in the URNG [Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity] commanders a determination to make good  their words and reach a political understanding so they can be  reincorporated into the country's legal life. He said the URNG  leaders have also pledged their word abroad, and the negotiators  and the international community are waiting for the two sides to  abide by the agreement. Finally, he said the only thing that  remains is to march forward with common sense and tolerance so  this process, which now exists only on paper, can become reality.</p>

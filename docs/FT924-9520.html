			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / GM lauds 'low-cost' UK plants THE Vauxhall car assembly plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port are among General Motors' 'lowest-cost plants in Europe', Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, said yesterday. Both, he said, had significant cost advantages over Opel plants producing the same cars in Germany and Belgium. Mr Nick Reilly, director of the Vauxhall car plant at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, said that since sterling's devaluation, the UK plant had produced Vauxhall/Opel Astras for DM900 (Pounds 364.30) a car less than GM's Astra assembly plants in Bochum, Germany, and Antwerp, Belgium. The Luton plant, which assembles the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra, established a significant production cost advantage over GM's Opel plant at Russelsheim, near Frankfurt, before sterling's devaluation. GM warned its German workforce earlier this year that it was costing DM750 a car more to produce a Cavalier/Vectra at Russelsheim than at Luton. GM will cut the 18,000-strong production workforce at the German plant by about a third over the next five years to combat high costs and remain competitive. Speaking at Ellesmere Port, where GM opened its new Pounds 190m engine plant yesterday, Mr Hughes said absenteeism at the UK plants was below 5 per cent, compared with 10 per cent in Germany. The two UK plants are matching the quality levels of GM's continental European plants and have begun to export large volumes to continental European markets in the past two years. Productivity is still lower at UK plants, but the gap is narrowing. They now have substantially lower total production costs because of lower UK labour costs, an advantage reinforced by the devaluation of the pound. Mr Hughes said GM wanted to buy more components in the UK. The company has transferred the purchase of about Pounds 200m worth of components annually to the UK since 1988. Mr Bill Ebbert, Vauxhall chairman, said the company's UK vehicle output was at a record high and would increase by more than 14 per cent this year to 300,000 from 262,000 in 1991. Vauxhall has maintained full-time working at Luton and Ellesmere Port during the recession, contrasting with recent short-time work introduced by Ford and Rover. GM remains pessimistic about the prospects for an early recovery in UK new car demand. Mr Hughes said sales were not expected 'to be much higher than 1.6m' next year, compared with fewer than 1.55m this year and 2.3m in the peak year of 1989. New car sales in west Europe will fall this year to 13.3m from 13.4m last year, Mr Hughes said, and 'could be clearly under 13m' in 1993 'if consumer uncertainty continues in some key countries'. Vauxhall launched a thinly veiled attack on Ford, the UK new car market leader, for failing to follow its example - picked up by Rover, Peugeot and Renault - by reducing new-car list prices and dealer profit margins to reduce the need for buyers to haggle over a 'fair price'. Mr Ebbert said 'some manufacturers' resisted change because reduced dealer margins adversely affected used-car residual values. 'I believe that distress marketing with frequent price cuts is much more damaging,' he said. Ford has been forced to cut prices on selected models on several occasions in the past two years to reduce stocks.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: Seagram takes Spanish stake Seagram, the Canadian drinks group, has taken a 20 per cent stake in Larios, Spain's leading domestic gin producer, for Pta8.4bn (Dollars 62.2m), writes Tom Burns from Madrid. Under the deal, Seagram's whisky brands will have access to Larios's marketing network in Spain. Last year Larios posted net profits of Pta2bn on sales of Pta26bn. Allied Lyons, the UK group, entered Spain earlier this year when it acquired the Domecq drinks group. Grand Metropolitan and Guinness, also of the UK, respectively control Gonzalez Byass, Domecq's main competitor, and Cruzcampo, a big brewing group.</p>

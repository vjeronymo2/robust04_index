			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Armco slips into red and sees year loss FURTHER indications of the troubled times facing the US steel industry were revealed yesterday as Armco, one of the large integrated producers, posted a first-quarter loss of Dollars 39.6m after tax. This compares with a Dollars 12.9m profit in the same period of 1990. Armco also warned that, despite steps being taken to cut costs, it would probably make a loss in the second quarter and in the full year. The company said that it 'does not anticipate an economic upturn in the second quarter, nor expect steel to recover significantly in the second half'. Its pessimism echoes that of Bethlehem Steel, which also unveiled a first-quarter loss earlier this week and said it expected to remain in the red in the second quarter. A number of smaller, specialised steel companies have also reported first-quarter losses. The bulk of the losses reported by Armco stemmed from Armco Steel Company, a joint venture with the Kawasaki Steel Company, which makes carbon flat-rolled steel and tubing for the automotive, construction and industrial machinery industries. This lost Dollars 61.6m in the first quarter, of which Armco's share was Dollars 31.6m. Sales for ASC were Dollars 334.3m, down 16 per cent on the previous year. The venture made a Dollars 50.5m operating loss last year, and a reorganisation of operations is under way. Elsewhere, Armco operations made a Dollars 900,000 operating profit overall in the first quarter - down from Dollars 28.2m in the same period a year earlier - although there were small losses in fabricating and processing, and bar, rod and wire products. After interest charges, this became a Dollars 8.4m loss. Inland Steel, the Chicago-based steelmaker which last week reported a Dollars 40m net loss for the first quarter, has passed its quarterly dividend. It cited a 'severe depression' in its primary markets, but said it would restore payments 'as soon as possible' after the company moved back into profit and the steel industry recovered.</p>

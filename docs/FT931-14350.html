			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Bock succeeds in acquiring 19% of Lonrho Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier, has become Lonrho's biggest shareholder with an 18.8 per cent equity stake following completion of the group's 198.67m share rights issue. As expected, a little more than 29.1m shares were taken up as a result of the 3-for-10 issue at 85p per share, representing 14.6 per cent of the offering. Included in the acceptances were 27.6m shares taken up by Laerstate, Mr Bock's private company. These shares were offset against Laerstate's underwriting commitment for 100m shares. Mr Bock had already acquired 43.5m shares from Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's chief executive, giving him a total stake of 143.5m shares. Mr Bock paid 115p a share, a substantial premium to the current share price, for half of Mr Rowland's 15 per cent stake. He has the option to buy the other half after three years, which would take his total holding to 24.8 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GIRL SAYS 'KIDNAPPING' WAS VOLUNTARY, A JOKE  </P> <P> A 14-year-old Chatsworth High School girl who last week claimed that five  fellow students kidnaped her and tried to rape her told police Monday that she  voluntarily accompanied the youths and considered the incident a "kid's  practical joke," authorities said.  </P> <P> However, two of the youths were detained Monday on suspicion of battery without  injury against the girl, who said the youths tried to kiss and touch her  against her will, Los Angeles Police Lt. L.A. Durrer said. The youths were  turned over to juvenile authorities, he said.  </P> <P> The girl told police Friday that five gang members kidnaped her from the high  school's parking lot and drove her to a house in the 10200 block of Nevada  Avenue in Chatsworth.  </P> <P> She said that she fled her alleged assailants after they attempted to rape her  and that she used a pay phone to call her boyfriend, who drove her to the  Police Department.  </P> <P> But Monday, the girl told police in the presence of her mother that she agreed  to go to the house with the youths on the condition that they take her to her  modeling class later, Durrer said.  </P> <P> "After an in-depth investigation, it was determined that no kidnap occurred or  could be substantiated," Durrer said.  </P></p>

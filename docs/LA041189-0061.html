			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR'S LETTER  </P> <P> Conservative George Will's moving description of the squalor and violence of  Chicago's Cabrini Green public-housing project was the more significant for his  recognition that poverty and hopelessness are the major culprits that thwart  well-meant social programs. His refusal to "blame the victims" (or government)  here is a repudiation of the laissez-faire style of government he himself has  so often advocated ("The Rebarbarization of America," Op-Ed Page March 30).  </P> <P> In contrast, on the same day, Gov. George Deukmejian (letter) fairly spat out  his own repudiation of The Times' excellent analysis of California's problems  (which include a sizable homeless population). By implying that no present or  future social problems can be serious enough to warrant government "spending  increases," Deukmejian shows that he is one-dimensional on a grand scale.  </P> <P> But the governor should not be blamed for being who he is. Rather, we should  ask ourselves whether we really intended his mean-spirited and callous brand of  conservatism when we elected him (or when we enacted Prop. 13, for that  matter).  </P> <P> Will's "rebarbarization of America" continues apace, and we have yet to show  the wisdom needed for laying the groundwork for a healthy social and political  climate for our posterity. Not much to be proud of, so far.  </P> <P> BILL BECKER  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

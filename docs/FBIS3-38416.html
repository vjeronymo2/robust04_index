			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner: "New </F> Chapter in NATO"]    [Text] NATO is occupying the center of attention again.  You no longer see the headline: "Why Should NATO Exist?" Many  countries wish to join our alliance or, at least, to develop  closer ties with it. There is nothing surprising about this.  Since our international scene is continuing to be shaken by  instability and conflicts, people are reassessing the  organizations that can effectively maintain their security, and  NATO is one of them. In fact, it is the only collective defense  organization operating in the entire world. But this is not  NATO's sole attraction. After all, the alliance is the main  security link connecting the West's two most important power  centers. Hence it is the key factor for stability in an  unstable world. No new security order in Europe can be imagined  without our alliance. NATO remains the main forum in which the  West can formulate and coordinate joint political decisions.  Under its umbrella, the dynamism of European unification can  develop.    Since the end of World War II, two new elements have been  added to NATO's traditional role of collective defense. One is  crisis control and peacekeeping operations; the other is the  projection of stability toward the countries of Central and East  Europe, and toward those of Central Asia. Our aim is to help  them readjust their defense policies and to assist them  throughout their difficult transitional stage.    No other international organization could replace NATO in  these tasks. Only NATO has such an impressive set of political  and military instruments for crisis control. Only the Atlantic  Alliance has the means to transform political statements into  coherent actions. Hence it is the basis on which any new  Euro-Atlantic security structure should rest. The setting up of  the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the development of a  new strategy, a new force posture, and a strengthened European  pillar show the essential role which our alliance continues to  play in Europe's security.    The summit which we have just held in January was an  impressive demonstration of what can be achieved if the  political will, energy, and creativity of North America and  Europe are combined: What we did was no less than to open a new  chapter in our alliance's history. Deepening the conclusions of  the 1990 London and 1991 Rome summits, the NATO heads of state  and government have given our alliance the necessary means and  instruments to be able to face up to the challenges of post-Cold  War Europe.    1) -- We reaffirmed the importance of transatlantic  relations, as well as our unqualified support for the European  security and defense identity. Transatlantic solidarity and  European integration are not alternatives -- still less  contradictions. Europe must acquire unity and strength in order  to be able to take up the share of responsibility and leadership  which rests with it in our alliance. This is to the benefit  both of the alliance and of North America and Europe. The  reform of NATO and European integration are interconnected. A  stronger Europe and Western European Union [WEU], able to  intervene, will make it possible to share responsibilities  within the alliance more fairly, without jeopardizing its role  as the main forum for consultation and prime instrument of  European security.    2) -- We decided to effect important changes in our  alliance's structures in order to make them more flexible and to  enable the advantages which this offers to be turned to account  more effectively in crisis control and in peacekeeping  operations. Specifically, we will develop a concept which, if  necessary, will enable the European allies' forces to operate  under the WEU's aegis. However, more flexible structures will  be of use for what we want only if we maintain an adequate level  of well-trained and well-equipped armed forces, backed by  adequate resources. The fewer means we have at our disposal,  the fewer choices we will have.    3) -- We decided in principle to open the alliance to new  members. Since our security is inseparably linked to that of  the other European states, NATO remains devoted to the  consolidation of the security and stability of the democratic  states to the east of our borders. In launching the Partnership  for Peace initiative, we have embarked on a process which will  transform relations between NATO and the states joining in the  initiative. This new program goes beyond dialogue and  cooperation in order to attempt to forge a real partnership.  With the speed and scope set by each country's wishes and  ability, we will seek specific channels for joint planning and  joint military maneuvers, and we will give these countries the  opportunity to work with NATO's forces in fields such as  peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. Prompted by a desire  for cooperation, we will also encourage transparency in defense  budgets and democratic oversight of defense ministries. These  measures, with the right of the partners for peace to consult  with the alliance whenever they feel threatened, will afford the  tangible benefits for security stemming from moving closer to  NATO. We will be holding the first joint maneuvers with the  partners for peace at the end of this year, and we will rapidly  proceed to set up a division for the coordination of  peacekeeping operations close to the headquarters of the allied  forces in Europe and to NATO [as published].    The Partnership for Peace is no substitute for joining NATO.  On the contrary, we applaud the alliance's enlargement as part  of an evolutionary process which will be to the advantage of  security and democracy throughout Europe. The Partnership for  Peace will help prepare the countries concerned for possible  entry into the alliance. Hence putting this initiative into  practice will be one of our main tasks over the next few months.  Our prime aim is still to build a new Euro-Atlantic security  architecture with Russia, rather than without or against it.  Nobody should be isolated. We must build bridges, not barriers.    4) -- We decided that NATO should face up not only to the  traditional security challenges but also to those emerging from  new political and technological developments. This is  especially true of the increasing danger posed by the  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Stopping this  proliferation by political and diplomatic means remains our  priority, but this may not be enough. We must also seek adequate  means of protection. For this reason, we have entrusted to the  alliance's appropriate political and military bodies the  formulation of an overall political framework for exploring the  way in which NATO can best help achieve this aim.    The work will begin without delay, and a working program and  list of priorities will be submitted to the foreign ministers  within six months.    The important initiatives adopted at our last summit  highlight the constant need for this alliance and its vitality.  NATO has charted a course which will take it resolutely to the  21st century.</p>

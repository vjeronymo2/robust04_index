			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / BAe to shed 500 more jobs British Aerospace yesterday unveiled plans for further job cuts involving about 500 staff in its missile division, more than a tenth of its remaining workforce in the sector. The cuts, likely to involve compulsory redundancies, follow a reduction of 830 jobs at three civil aircraft plants announced last week. The company's Dynamics guided-weapon division, which is due to be merged with the missile-making activities of France's Matra group, will be reduced to 4,040 employees, less than a quarter of the level at the end of the 1980s. BAe blamed the cuts on deferment or cancellation of orders. The main reduction affects 330 jobs at BAe's main missile manufacturing operation at Lostock, near Bolton. Another 160 jobs will go at Stevenage in Hertfordshire and 20 at Bristol. The company said the cuts were not related to the merger talks with Matra. Southampton warship builder Vosper Thornycroft announced yesterday it was recruiting 60 employees, mainly steelworkers.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Last night, locator vehicles of the Communication  Authority identified the illegal broadcasting station of Radio  Tilos [Forbidden] in a Budapest apartment on Sziv Street. The  police took action, whereupon the representative of the  Communication Authority initiated action against an unknown  offender for the violation of the press ordinance.    As one might recall, Radio Tilos also submitted a bid to  launch a local radio station, but the Ministry of Culture and  Public Education rejected their bid, together with those of two  other community stations. Radio Tilos announced at that time  that it would resume its illegal broadcasts.    Dr. Eva Balla, leading attorney of the Communication  Authority, told NEPSZABADSAG that according to a law,  broadcasting without a studio permit requires the involvement of  the police and the initiation of proceedings. She said that in  the course of yesterday's action it did not come to atrocities,  but she regretted that the operators of Radio Tilos refused all  cooperation. Thus, criminal proceedings must be started ex  officio, and as a result, on the basis of the current law, Radio  Tilos will not be able to receive a broadcasting permit for  three years. Incidentally, the attorney does not understand why  the community station was not granted a permit, because it would  have been an colorful addition on the air.    (We were unsuccessful in our attempts to interview the  illegal radio operators about the events.)    We reported in our Monday issue that the Fiksz [Fix] Club  wanted to hold a street demonstration to protest the fact that  the Ministry of Culture and Public Education [MKM] refused them  access to the files of frequency application cases. At the MKM  we learned that only access to the files of other petitioners  was refused.</p>

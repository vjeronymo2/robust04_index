			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> POPE PLEDGES SUPPORT TO AIDS PATIENTS, WARNS OF LIFE STYLES  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II today pledged the church's support for AIDS patients, but he  said people must change high-risk life styles and not resort to "morally  illicit" means of prevention.  </P> <P> "In its heart the church not only pronounces a series of 'noes' to certain  types of behavior but especially proposes a life style that is wholly  signifcant for the person," the Pope said in the closing address of a three-day  Vatican conference on AIDS.  </P> <P> While he did not mention the word "condoms," church officials said it was clear  that John Paul was ruling out their use as a means of checking the spread of  AIDS.  </P> <P> John Paul noted that AIDS can often be attributed to the "phenomena of drug  addiction and abuse of sexuality."  </P> <P> "The necessary prevention against the threat of AIDS is not inspired by fear,  but instead by the choice of a healthy, free and responsible life style," he  said.  </P></p>

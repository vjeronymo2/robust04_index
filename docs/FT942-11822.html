			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / People: Computer People choose Roger Graham as new chairman Computer People knows a thing or two about recruitment despite its somewhat lacklustre performance of late. The London-based computer consultancy, which is now back in the black after making a small loss in 1992, is undoubtedly patting itself on the back for having snapped up Roger Graham as non-executive chairman. Graham (right), on the brink of 55, is one of the leading lights of the UK computer business. A former president of the Computing Services Association and chairman and chief executive of the BIS Group before its acquisition by Birmingham-based ACT last year, he has been in the computer business since 1962. He has not let the grass grow under his feet since leaving BIS. Last week he was appointed non-executive chairman both of Mantix Systems, which specialises in advanced business management, and of Braid Systems which develops messaging software. Both are small, interesting companies with novel products. An engineer by background, Graham was educated at Cambridge University where he crossed paths with several other individuals who became luminaries in the UK computing services business. He says, however, that his chief interests as a student was politics, an interest he still indulges, and flying small aeroplanes. He first joined International Business Machines as a systems engineer, made his name in sales and then moved to BIS where he stayed for 24 years. Graham's entrepreneurial spirit remains bright; he talks enthusiastically of the opportunities in networked desk-top computers. The prerequisites for a new venture would be, however, 'the right opportunity and the right people'.</p>

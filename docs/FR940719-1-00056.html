			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Bleeder entries and worked-out areas are required to be traveled or evaluated at least weekly. This is most often done by a person traveling alone who is often required to be in the bleeder entries or worked-out areas for an extended period. The purpose of this standard is to protect miners, not to regulate air quality where persons are not exposed. Therefore, oxygen and carbon dioxide levels at bleeder connectors and bleeder evaluation points that do not meet the proposed concentrations would not constitute a violation of the standard if examinations are performed remotely or if persons making the examination can otherwise remain in air that meets the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (NIOSH Respirator Decision Logic, May 1987), 19.5 percent oxygen provides an adequate amount of oxygen for most work assignments and incorporates a safety factor. Also according to NIOSH, the safety factor is needed because oxygen-deficient atmospheres offer little warning of danger. In the NIOSH publication, ``A Guide to Safety in Confined Spaces,'' (page 4), a chart is presented that indicates that 19.5 percent oxygen is the minimum level for safe entry into an area, and that at a level of 16 percent, judgement and breathing are impaired. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), in ANSI Z88.2&hyph;1992, ``American National Standard for Respiratory Protection'' recognizes that at 16 percent oxygen there is an impairment in the ability to think and pay attention, and a reduction in coordination. ANSI recognizes that at 19 percent oxygen there are some adverse physiological effects, but they are unnoticeable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The need for regulating the oxygen level where persons work or travel in bleeder entries is illustrated by two mining accidents. One of these accidents resulted in the death of a mine examiner and the second resulted in the near death of two additional individuals, one of whom was a mine examiner. Mine examiners are, through training and experience, the individuals best able to identify the hazards associated with irrespirable atmospheres. The first accident occurred at the Arclar Mine in Equality, Illinois in 1989. Prior to implementation of the existing standard, a mine examiner, for unknown reasons, entered a worked-out area that was posted with a danger sign. Under the existing regulation, ventilation or sealing of this area, rather than posting, would be required. Because the area was not sealed, the existing regulation would require the area to be examined during the weekly examination. The proposal would require that the route of travel for the examiner would contain at least 19.5 percent oxygen. Had the proposal been in place when the examiner entered the worked-out area, there is a strong likelihood that he would not have died. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second accident, although not in a bleeder entry or worked-out area, is illustrative of what can happen when individuals, including mine examiners, are subjected to oxygen deficient air. In 1983 at the Bird No. 3 Mine in Riverside, Pennsylvania, an assistant mine foreman, a certified person, entered the mine for the purpose of conducting an examination. After traveling approximately 1100 feet, the examiner became dizzy, noticed that his flame safety lamp had extinguished and withdrew approximately 200 feet where he sat down and apparently became unconscious. A second individual upon entering the area in search of the examiner also became dizzy but was able to withdraw to a location that was not oxygen deficient. When the mine examiner regained consciousness, his cap lamp battery had discharged and he traveled in total darkness until he encountered a mine rescue team. Air samples collected in the area where the mine examiner first became dizzy indicated an oxygen concentration of about 16.8 percent, while other samples collected nearby indicated oxygen concentrations of nearly 20 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because mine examiners are required to work or travel in areas where oxygen-deficient air could occur without warning, and they normally travel and work alone, there must be a requirement that provides them the protection necessary for the performance of their duties under these conditions. It is important that the level for oxygen be established above that identified as resulting in impaired judgement because it is essential that individuals traveling in these areas remain highly alert. The hazards that can exist in bleeder entries and worked-out areas include elevated methane levels, poor footing, loose and unstable roof, and water accumulations. For this reason, the Agency is proposing to adopt a minimum level of oxygen of 19.5 percent as recommended by NIOSH. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSHA is also concerned with the effects of other gases often found in bleeder entries. Section 75.322 of the existing regulation limits the concentration of noxious or poisonous gases to the current (1971) Threshold Limit Values (TLV's) as adopted and applied by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Section 75.322 specifically excludes carbon dioxide since it is covered by &sect;75.321. However, in light of the Court's stay of &sect;75.321(a) relative to bleeder entries, the Agency is proposing a separate standard for carbon dioxide levels for areas where persons work or travel in bleeder entries and worked-out areas. The levels proposed, 0.5 percent TWA and 3.0 percent STEL, when considered in conjunction with the requirements of &sect;75.322 and the proposed requirement for oxygen, will aid in providing persons working or traveling in these areas with a safe and healthful working environment. The Agency recognizes that the effects of carbon dioxide are both chronic and acute and has therefore elected to propose both a time weighted average and a short term exposure limit. NIOSH, in recommending a standard for carbon dioxide, also recognized this and recommended a similar approach. The NIOSH recommendation, made in a Criteria Document published in 1976, proposed a TWA concentration of 1.0 percent and a ceiling value of 3.0 percent not to exceed 10 minutes. In making this recommendation, NIOSH states that there are ``additive stress effects of increased carbon dioxide concentrations and exercise *&blank;*&blank;*'' As support for this, the NIOSH document cites research that showed that healthy, trained subjects exposed to 2.8 to 5.2 percent carbon dioxide at maximum exercise levels experienced respiratory difficulty, impaired vision, severe headache, and mental confusion; three subjects collapsed. At or below 2.8 percent carbon dioxide combined with lower, but still strenuous, levels of exercise, no ill effects other than awareness of increased ventilation were experienced by the subjects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

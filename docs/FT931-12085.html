			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Books: Multi-cultural tales - FT Children's Book of the Month REALMS OF GOLD: MYTHS AND LEGENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD by Ann Pilling, illustrated by Kady MacDonald Denton Kingfisher Pounds 9.99, 96 pages IN THE recent past, collections of traditional stories have tended to be grouped in ways that have emphasised the set-apartness of different cultures. The long-established Oxford Myths and Legends series, for example, takes us through Yugoslav folk tales, Chinese myths and fantasies, Irish sagas, French legends, German hero-sagas and much else. What was required - and what the book under review provides - was a single book that brought some of the best stories together from all over the world so that children could enjoy an extended exercise in ancestral cross-fertilisation. In her introduction, the novelist Ann Pilling quotes the remark by CS Lewis, one of our great modern myth-makers, in which he tried to explain why it is that myths and traditional stories have an enduring hold over us. Myth, he said, is perhaps 'an unfocused gleam of human imagination falling on divine truth'. A more secular reading of that remark would make references to wisdom, poetry and human value systems that are held in common. In this book, for example, we find Midas, who must for ever re-learn his lesson about the greed for gold; Perseus, perpetually in thrall to the spirit of adventure; the two giants, one Scots, the other Irish, who, though mighty in arms, are dolts in the extreme; and the Norse god Balder, who must learn a painful truth about the relationship between love and death. Then there are the stories that were told and re-told in response to questions about the mystery of the natural world. Who put the moon and the stars in the sky and why? What is the origin of fire? These are as much questions asked of the imagination as of the reasoning mind. No matter what factual glosses may be put upon them, the answers given in story or fable are just as likely to provide us with equal amounts of heat or light. The book is divided into three sections: 'Earth, Air, Fire and Water', which deals with elemental mysteries and takes in tales from Africa, North America and the Pacific (the best of these is a Nigerian myth, Water, Moon and Sun, which describes how the moon and the sun, once happily married, came to suffer estrangement); 'Love and Death', which includes the touching Welsh legend, Bedd Gelert, about the terrible fate suffered by a faithful dog who is killed by his own master for protecting his baby from the wolf; and 'Fools and Heroes'. The Wishing Fish, a Russian tale in this last section, has surfaced in many different forms in the past. When Rumer Godden retold it as The Old Woman Who Lived in the Vinegar Bottle in 1972, for example, she gave it an Irish setting. Some of these tales, it seems, are as doughty, fearless and quite as full of wanderlust as the questing salmon.</p>

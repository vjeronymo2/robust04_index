			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Aston Martin to boost output with 'cheap' model ASTON MARTIN Lagonda, the maker of luxury sports cars taken over by Ford in 1987, yesterday unveiled a new model intended to quadruple production to 800 cars a year in 1995. The company said the car - named the DB7 - would cost 'less than Pounds 80,000,' which is some Pounds 50,000 less than the cheapest of Aston Martin's model range. First-year production is expected to be around 300 units. The DB designation - the initials of former company owner Sir David Brown - is being revived for the first time in 20 years. It re-establishes a link with a long line of previous DB models, the most famous of which was almost certainly the DB4 which starred alongside Sean Connery in early James Bond films. Aston Martin's 'cheap' DB7 model will mark a radical departure from its past on several industrial fronts. The new model will be built at a separate factory in Oxfordshire by a workforce of 250, instead of at the company's main facilities in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire. The Buckinghamshire plant now employs 260 people making 200 Virage and Vantage models a year at prices from Pounds 125,000 to Pounds 175,00. The main design and development work on the DB7, which has a top speed potential of more than 160mph, has been contracted out to TWR (Design), part of the TWR group run by Mr Tom Walkinshaw based in Oxford. It develops and manufactures Jaguar's high-performance sports and racing cars. Jaguar itself is wholly owned by Ford. A new company, Aston Martin Oxford, has been formed to operate the facility at Bloxham, Oxfordshire, in which TWR has taken a 25 per cent stake. The majority 75 per cent is held by Aston Martin Lagonda. The DB7's in-line six-cylinder 3.2 litre supercharged engine, although allocated to Aston Martin's use only, uses a block originally developed  - but not used - by Jaguar. It is expected to be assembled by Jaguar under contract at its Radford engine plant near Coventry. The car's bodies are to be supplied by Motor Panels, the Coventry-based components group. A wholly-owned subsidiary, Aston Martin sales, has been formed to oversee an expansion of Aston Martin's worldwide dealer network. Aston Martin has only 37 dealers at present, but several times this number are expected to be needed to handle the new model. The cars are to go on sale in Europe initially, starting in April next year, and will go on sale in north America in 1995. The Bloxham facility is being taken over from Jaguarsport, a joint venture company between Jaguar and TWR which has been responsible for building the Pounds 400,000-plus Jaguar 220 sports car. Production of these is scheduled to be completed by the end of this year. Aston Martin refused yesterday to comment on the size of investment required for the DB7 project. Mr Walter Hayes, the former vice-president of Ford of Europe who is now Aston's executive chairman, has made no secret of his ambitions to restore Aston Martin's position in the world luxury sports car sector. Before being bought by Ford it had several brushes with receivership, and lacked the resources for adequate new model programmes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lome, 13 Feb (AFP)--The Togolese Government  denounced acts of violence perpetrated by activists of the  Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] against pro-Eyadema activists  (of the Rally of Togolese People, RPT) on the evening of 12  February. The government did not give any details about the  nature of the violence.    Interior Minister Combevi Agbodjan said on national  television that "in certain cities and villages," of the Haho  Prefecture (98 km north of Lome), CAR militants have "accused"  President Gnassingbe Eyadema's supporters of not having voted  for their candidate.    Questioned by AFP, CAR deputy general secretary, Mr.  Togoatta  Apedoh Amah, denounced this "provocative act" by the RPT which  is trying to justify a repression against the activists of the  opposition before the second round of the legislative election  slated for 20 February.    At the end of the first round on 6 February, the opposition,  represented in the second round by CAR and the Togolese Union  for Democracy, was running neck and neck with the RPT, the  former sole ruling party.    The minister also called on traditional rulers "who are  making every effort to create a climate of hatred in their  villages" to remain neutral while awaiting the second round of  elections. He also called on political party leaders to "better  control their activists" so that the second round of election  would take place "in as good an atmosphere" as the first round.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Austria may deliver snub to EU in membership vote The European Union is threatened with another humiliation as Austrians vote in a referendum this Sunday on whether to join the Union. A positive outcome seemed assured only days ago, but the battle has suddenly become a cliffhanger. The latest opinion polls indicate voters are evenly split with many still undecided. As in the Maastricht treaty ratification referendum campaign in Denmark two years ago, anti-EU forces have won wide public support in the past few days by conjuring up images of a centralising, bureaucratic government in Brussels that would ride roughshod over Austrian interests. Brussels would force Austria to build nuclear power plants against its will and would allow other EU countries to siphon off water from its Alpine reservoirs, EU opponents say. Meanwhile, the pro-EU forces in Austria have been unable to find ways to paint the Union as an inspiring or effective organisation. For many Austrians there is evidence of the ineffectiveness of EU foreign policy in the large flow of refugees from the former Yugoslavia. Mr Alois Mock, the Austrian foreign minister who has campaigned passionately for joining, admitted yesterday that the vote would be close. Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor, was slightly more optimistic, saying he expected a clear and unambiguous vote, but acknowledging that it would 'not be an overwhelming result'. A rejection of the EU would be another snub for the centralising tendency of the Union that has been the hallmark of the presidency of Mr Jacques Delors. Such a snub would be magnified if a negative vote in Austria encouraged voters in Finland, Norway and Sweden, who face EU entry referendums in the autumn, to follow suit. The governments of Finland, Norway and Sweden have all watched the crumbling opinion poll lead of the pro-EU campaign in Austria with a mounting sense of alarm. With the opposition to the EU holding a solid lead in the opinion polls in Sweden and reaching 56 per cent - the highest level this year - in Norway this week, prime minister Mr Carl Bildt's right-centre coalition in Stockholm and Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland's minority Labour government in Oslo badly need an Austrian Yes to keep their campaigns on an even keel. In Finland, polls suggest most voters are in favour of joining the EU. But prime minister Mr Esko Aho's centre-conservative coalition is troubled by an internal EU-related row, which might be exacerbated after an Austrian rejection.

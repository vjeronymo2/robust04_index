			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once Western has determined the costs of those facilities which benefit the transmission customers, a further allocation of costs is conducted. This is due to the fact that the transmission system is utilized both by (1) the power customers to transmit their power entitlement from the powerplants to their loads and (2) by customers who utilize the transmission system for bulk power transfers. It is this allocation of costs which properly further allocates costs to power and transmission and ensures that within the rates charged to the power customers is a component for the use of the transmission system. This is why the power customers are not charged a transmission charge for their power entitlement. It is this final allocation which ensures that the power customers are always responsible for a portion of Western costs which are transmission related. As shown in the Apportionment of Cost Study, the power users are allocated approximately 16 percent of the costs of the new PAO facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Western assigns project use revenues as an expense offset to power costs. Inasmuch as the delivery of this power requires use of the P&hyph;DP transmission system, it is appropriate to assign these revenues (expense offsets) to power and transmission in proportion to the plant investments in each category (for step-one rates, the allocation would be 31.66 percent to power and 68.34 percent to transmission).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Customer believes the current allocation of both project use revenues and project use sales is correct in Western's apportionment study. Classification of sales (kilowatts) as power is acceptable, provided the firm power customer classification is directly credited with the revenues from the project use sales (kilowatts) as is currently done in Western's Apportionment of Cost Study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western believes the current allocation of project use revenues is correct in the Apportionment of Cost Study. Project use should be allocated to power because sales are also classified as power. Further, the costs associated with project use are contained in Reclamation's financial statement and budget documents which are also assigned to power. Project use costs and benefits have been consistently used in the Apportionment of Cost Study so that the benefits will offset the costs associated with project use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on restrictions on the power customers' use of capacity paid for in the power rate and significantly better benefits to all other users of the transmission system, we do not feel that the allocation of costs according to customer class is correct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western understands the power customers' concerns that the Apportionment of Cost Study treats  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> 1 kW of P&hyph;DP power transmitted over the transmission system the same as  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> 1 kW of non-P&hyph;DP power transmitted over the transmission system, even though the P&hyph;DP power is limited to approximately 56 percent capacity factor. However, Western believes that because the customers have complete flexibility to schedule their power and energy when they want, Western transmission must be available to handle the desired transaction. Western bases the Apportionment of Cost Study on the kW of ``reservation'' the customers have for use of the system and not on the actual kWh usage of the system. From this perspective, power customers and transmission customers alike pay to have the transmission system reserved for their use, regardless of the actual system use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western should consider a phase-in of what would be a significant shift in allocation of costs from transmission to generation if the cost apportionment study is adapted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the customer comments, Western has decided to implement stepped rates for the provisional P&hyph;DP rate schedules. The first steps of the provisional rates are effective from FY 1994&hyph;95 and the second steps are effective for FY 1996&hyph;98. Step-one rates reflect only the replacements and additions proposed by Western for FY 1994&hyph;95. Step two rates reflect the replacements and additions for FY 1996 through the end of the study period. Implementing stepped rates will lessen the impact on the customers by allowing them to phase-in the new rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

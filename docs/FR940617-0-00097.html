			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, the car lines listed as being exempt from the standard have previously been exempted in accordance with the procedures of 49 CFR part 543 and section 605 of the Cost Savings Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, NHTSA finds for good cause that notice and opportunity for comment on these listings are unnecessary. Further, public comment on the listings of selections and exemptions is not contemplated by Title VI, and is unnecessary since the selections and exemptions have previously been made in accordance with the statutory criteria and procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the same reasons, since this revised listing only informs the public of previous agency actions and does not impose any additional obligations on any party, NHTSA finds for good cause that the amendment made by this notice should be effective as soon as it is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Costs and Other Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has analyzed this rule and determined that is not ``significant'' within the meaning of the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. The agency has also considered this notice under Executive Order 12866. As already noted, the selections in this final rule have previously been made in accordance with the provisions of the Cost Savings Act, and the manufacturers of the selected lines have already been informed that those lines are subject to the requirements of part 541 for Model Year 1995. Further, this listing does not actually exempt lines from the requirements of part 541; it only informs the general public of all such previously granted exemptions. Since the only purpose of this final listing is to inform the public of prior action for Model Year 1995, a full regulatory evaluation has not been prepared. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has also considered the effects of this listing under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As noted above, the effect of this final rule is simply to inform the public of those lines that are subject to the requirements of part 541 for Model Year 1995. The agency believes that listing of this information will not have any economic impact on small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Environmental Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the agency has considered the environmental impacts of this rule, and determined that it will not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Federalism <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this final rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Civil Justice Reform <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule does not have a retroactive effect and it does not preempt any state law. Section 613 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2030) provides that judicial review of this rule may be obtained pursuant to section 504 of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2004). The Cost Savings Act does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 541 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Labeling, Motor vehicles, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 541_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR part 541 is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

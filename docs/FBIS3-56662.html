He said that behind his faction's  decisions was the wish to secure an additional vote in the State  Duma, not inner rifts. The principle of forming up the State  Duma's Council were preliminarily discussed by the leaders of  the parliamentary factions and State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin on  Saturday.    The Council is to consist of the speaker and his deputies,  and the faction leaders. Each faction will have one vote  irrespective of its membership.    The State Duma's biggest faction Russia's Choice has 76  members. The minimal number of members required for the  registration of a faction is 35. Some of the Russia's Choice  members believe therefore that Russia's Choice centrist and more  radical members may form up two independent factions, said  Yushenkov.    It is not ruled out that some of this faction's embers will  join the Union of December 12 faction, led by Moscow's Vice  Mayor Alexander Braginsky and entrepreneurs Irina Khakamada and  Viktor Bushmin. This group has only 23 members for the moment  and needs a replenishment of 12 members to get registered.</p>

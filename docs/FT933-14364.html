			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Banco de Portugal posts first loss THE Banco de Portugal lost Es81.8bn (Dollars 531m) in 1992 as it spent heavily to shore up the escudo and mop up liquidity in the domestic money market, according to the central bank's annual report. Only the transfer of Es71bn in reserves enabled the bank to record an official loss of Es9.8bn for 1992, the report said. This was the bank's first loss. The report said the bank had suffered losses since 1988 that had been covered by transferring provisions. In the autumn of 1992, the escudo came under strong speculative pressure and the bank was forced to spend foreign currency reserves on escudos at prices above the level to which the currency fell after a 6 per cent devaluation in November.</p>

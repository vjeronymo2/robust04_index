			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KUWAIT ESCAPE -- A PORTRAIT OF TERROR;  </P> <P> FREEDOM: SOUTHLAND BANKER WAS CONFRONTED BY IRAQI SOLDIERS ON HIS DESERT GAMBLE  BUT BLUFFED HIS WAY PAST THEM. HE IS REUNITED WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN AT  LAX.  </P> <P> Three weeks and one aborted escape after Iraqi soldiers seized his neighborhood  in Kuwait, Southern California banker Abdalla (Tony) Touny thought his gamble  for freedom would explode, literally, in his face.  </P> <P> It was shortly after 3 a.m. on Aug. 21 and Touny, a friend and two men he  described as Bedouin "guides" were driving northwest through the desert, bound  for the safety of Jordan.  </P> <P> "They stopped us," Touny said, referring to the Iraqi soldiers. "They almost  killed us. They surrounded us with machine guns. They were checking for  Americans and Kuwaitis. I told them (in Arabic), 'I'm a bookkeeper, I'm a  clerk.' I told them I was Egyptian."  </P> <P> After a few more harrowing minutes the Iraqis relented -- and Touny was headed  toward becoming one of only a few Americans in Kuwait to flee the grip of  Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> "It scared the hell out of me," Touny said Friday during an interview in  Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Aided by goodwill cigarettes he passed to Jordanian border guards, along with  the savvy and cachet of the Bedouins, to whom Touny said he paid a $750 fee, he  made it into the capital city of Amman, Jordan, at about 10 that same morning.  </P> <P> In the wee minutes of Friday morning, Touny was reunited at Los Angeles  International Airport with his wife, 13-year-old daughter and 18-year-old son.  A few hours later Touny recounted his odyssey to freedom at the family's  temporary apartment in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Touny, 46, provided a uniquely informed perspective on the Persian Gulf crisis.  An Egyptian by birth but an American citizen since 1974, Touny earned his  master's degree at New York University and for the last three years has been  the chief manager of operations for the Bank of Kuwait and the Bank of the  Middle East.  </P> <P> Touny said he has supervised the accounts of members of the Kuwaiti royal  family. The palace of the monarch of Kuwait, he said, was on grounds behind the  rented villa where he lived.  </P> <P> Based on his relationship with members of the royal family, Touny said he  thinks the Kuwaitis would be willing to pay Hussein "whatever money he wants"  to withdraw.  </P> <P> Touny's brush as a captive of the Iraqis was tinged with no small amount of  irony. The Touny family had been spending the summer in Newport Beach, as they  try to do every year, when he returned by himself to the tiny Middle Eastern  nation on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> "I was exhausted," Touny recalled, "I had not slept for about 24 hours. So,  when I got to my villa (at about 2 a.m.), I went to bed."  </P> <P> But two hours later, the phone rang. It was his wife, Abla, watching television  half the world away in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> "She told me there was a war," Touny said. "I couldn't believe it."  </P> <P> By daybreak, Touny had no doubt. He could hear the explosions and see the  flashes.  </P> <P> "I ran to the ATM machines (at the bank), and they were closed," Touny said,  adding that he had flown to Kuwait the night before with only the equivalent of  $36 American dollars in his pockets.  </P> <P> After borrowing money from friends, Touny said he was part of a surge of  immediate panic buying. He said he stood in line two hours that first day to  buy canned goods, rice, bread, powdered milk and cheese.  </P> <P> Because of the proximity of the Kuwaiti emir's royal palace, the Iraqi troops  were quickly a presence in his neighborhood, looting homes and controlling  access in and out at gunpoint.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of Iraqi actions in my neighborhood," he said. "I tried to be  low-key and stay out of their sight."  </P> <P> About one week later, when he and friends tried to escape by car to Saudi  Arabia, Iraqi troops stopped and ordered them back to Kuwait city. By that  point, he had long since lost phone contact with the United States and his  family.  </P> <P> "We kept calling the State Department every single day," said Abla Touny, a  chemist who had hoped to return to her job at Kuwait University. "I was really  going crazy. I mean, it was just a nightmare."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Tony Touny said he and other Americans kept in daily contact with  the American Embassy in Kuwait, whose officials warned them not to try another  escape through Saudi Arabia. Until the time he fled Kuwait, Touny said he saw  the results of car bombing and other anti-Iraqi, guerrilla-type activity.  </P> <P> "There was a lot of Kuwaiti resistance, even right before I left," Touny said.  </P> <P> From his perspective, Touny said, Hussein's motive for invading and occupying  Kuwait is simple. Iraq, he said, is "a bankrupt country. They're looking for  someone to bail them out. They want the money. And they want access to the  (Persian) Gulf."  </P> <P> As for himself, Touny said he will begin seeking a safe, stateside job.  </P> <P> "I can't risk my life anymore," he said.  </P></p>

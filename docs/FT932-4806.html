			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Keidanren chief rejects optimism: Japanese economy still weak, with depressed consumer and capital spending THE JAPANESE economy is still weak after a prolonged downturn, Japan's most powerful business leader warned yesterday. He was trying to counter mounting optimism among politicians about the economic outlook. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the country's federation of economic organisations, said consumer spending and capital expenditure were still depressed. The downturn was deepening in provincial cities and manufacturers were being hit by the yen's recent rapid appreciation.

Mr Hiraiwa's comments are a mild rebuke for government ministers who have been talking up prospects for the economy in the past few days. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, last week said he believed the downturn had reached its trough, and Mr Hajime Funada, minister responsible for the Economic Planning Agency, yesterday said the economy was bottoming out. The debate over the economy comes at the start of a week in which several closely watched economic reports will be published. On Thursday the EPA is due to release its monthly report which has been widely trailed as forecasting an imminent recovery. The following day sees the Bank of Japan's quarterly 'Tankan', one of the most comprehensive economic surveys. Mr Mieno, in evidence to the upper house of the Japanese parliament, said the economy's performance would be uneven in the next few months before a modest recovery in the second half of the financial year which began in April. He warned it was too early to say whether a pick-up in industrial production and sales of some products towards the end of the last financial year was the start of a sustainable recovery. Mr Yuji Tanahashi, Miti vice minister, said of Thursday's report: 'I do not think it will support the notion that the economy has bottomed out.'</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Unions at Ford to demand jobs for life A DEMAND for 'jobs for life' will be made today when unions representing Ford's 20,000 manual workers present their annual claim. Mr Tony Woodley, TGWU general union negotiator for the car industry, hinted yesterday that the unions are prepared to negotiate on the introduction of multi-skilling for Ford workers in return for a guarantee of employment security. But it was unclear last night whether the other unions at Ford, notably the AEEU engineering and electricians' union, will support this position. In spite of the recession Ford has managed to avoid any compulsory redundancies and has cut its workforce through natural wastage and voluntary severance. But union leaders are concerned that the company may not be able to continue this policy. 'Our top priority in these negotiations will be job security,' said Mr Woodley. He added that the unions at Ford wanted only what had been achieved at other UK-based car plants such as Rover, Nissan, Honda and Toyota. The unions will also be seeking a 'substantial' increase in basic wage rates for manual workers. 'Ford UK has a world-class workforce with the lowest labour costs in Europe,' said Mr Woodley. 'We want to see them have the same wages and job protection that the best has to offer.' He added that only Peugeot Talbot paid lower basic wage rates than Ford among car companies in the UK. The unions want Ford to drop what they see as its piecemeal approach to workplace change and take a more comprehensive view of what needs to be done. 'If they want to compete with the best, the company must provide job protection to its employees so they can deliver the goods,' said Mr Woodley. The company is expected to respond to the manual unions' claim when they meet again on October 28. Vauxhall shop stewards at Ellesmere Port on Merseyside have rejected the company's last two-year pay offer. The unions will decide next week whether to ballot Vauxhall's 9,000 workers for strike action.</p>

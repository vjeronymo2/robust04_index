Deputy Joao Fagundes (Brazilian Democratic Party Movement-  Roraima), who acted as rapporteur for the Constitution and  Justice Committee, bears the rank of colonel in the Army  engineering corps. Fagundes stated that Brazil cannot fail to  participate in this type of mission, which is internationally  significant and would show that Brazilian servicemen "are not  only prepared for war but also to engage in the permanent  battles for peace."</p>

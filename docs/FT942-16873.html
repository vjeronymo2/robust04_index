			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Output rise signals strong recovery: Figures suggest broad-based revival - Production growth brings inflation warning The recovery in British industry strengthened decisively in February, as robust manufacturing growth helped push overall production back above its pre-recession levels. The index of industrial production - which covers manufacturing and the energy and water sectors - rose to 100.7 in February, its highest level since a 102.1 peak in June 1990. In the three months to February the index was 0.6 per cent higher than in the previous three months, and up 3.7 per cent compared with the same period a year ago. Buoyed by healthy performances from the engineering and food sectors, manufacturing output rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 per cent on the month, well ahead of market expectations for a 0.4 per cent rise. This followed January's increase of 1 per cent. In the three months to February, output rose 0.8 per cent against the previous three months, to stand 2 per cent up on the same period a year ago. Signs of a clear revival in industry will hearten the government as new taxes on individuals - most of them effective this month - threaten to slow consumer spending, currently the strongest element of the economy. The Treasury said yesterday's figures were 'entirely consistent' with recovery across a broad front, and that it was particularly encouraged by a pick-up in output of goods used for industrial investment. According to calculations by the Central Statistical Office, manufacturing output is now rising at an annualised rate of about 3 per cent. But yesterday's news of accelerating output was accompanied by a warning on inflation. A report from Income Data Services, a research company, said the majority of pay rises this year were ahead of the current inflation rate of 2.4 per cent. IDS said that 'a modest upward shift in pay settlements has been under way since the start of the year' with some firms paying higher bonuses and offering more overtime to staff. On the London stock market, dealers took the view that the manufacturing output figures reduced the chances for a further cut in interest rates. However, a 2.5-point drop in the FT-SE 100 share index to 3,129.0 yesterday reflected a general weakness in the US stock market rather than fears that UK lending rates have reached their low point. According to the figures, much of the recent strength in manufacturing is due to higher output of investment goods rather than consumer goods. Investment goods output rose 1.1 per cent in February after a 4.1 per cent increase in January. In the three months to the end of February, it was 1.8 per cent up on the previous three months, boosted mainly by a sharp rise in the output of electrical goods. By contrast, consumer goods output rose 0.4 per cent in February, after a 0.1 per cent increase in January. It was up 0.6 per cent in the latest three months, with a drop in car production offset by rises in output elsewhere. Analysts said the official figures finally confirmed the optimism of recent industrial trends surveys by the Confederation of British Industry and others.

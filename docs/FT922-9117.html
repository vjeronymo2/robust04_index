Details of Midland directors' share options published by Hongkong as part of its formal offer show that when he joined Midland a year ago, Mr Pearse was given an option to buy 300,000 Midland shares at Pounds 2 each any time in the next 10 years. Both bids value Midland's shares at more than Pounds 4.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USA VOLLEYBALL CUP;  </P> <P> KIRALY, TIMMONS GO WITH A BANG; U.S. ROUTS SOVIETS  </P> <P> The final point went down Saturday night, and suddenly Karch Kiraly and Steve  Timmons were former members of the U.S. national volleyball team, on their way  to becoming full-time members of the beach volleyball tour.  </P> <P> "All the guys came up to me and said, 'Congratulations,' and, 'It was fun  playing with you,' " Timmons said after the United States won its sixth  consecutive USA Cup with a 15-9, 15-9, 15-5 victory over the Soviet Union at  the Forum, an event that was overshadowed by the retirement of two of the  greatest players in the world.  </P> <P> "Time slowed down a bit," Timmons said. "It was, 'Hey, that's it.' "  </P> <P> Fittingly, the night belonged to Kiraly and Timmons on the court, too, showing  why many say they are leaving while playing the best volleyball of their  careers.  </P> <P> But they are leaving nonetheless.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's hit me yet," said Kiraly, who, like Timmons, will be  competing in the Manhattan Beach Open beginning Monday. "It hit me the most  when I sat down for the (pre-match) ceremony. But it was just business as  usual. One more win."  </P> <P> It was the Americans' 19th consecutive victory over the Soviet Union in the  United States, only the latest episode in U.S. domination of the No. 2 team in  the world, which also includes a win in the gold-medal match of the 1988  Olympics.  </P> <P> Steadied by the return of Jeff Stork, the No. 1 setter who missed Friday's  victory over South Korea because of a shoulder injury, the United States  controlled the match from the outset.  </P> <P> The first game included a 9-1 run by the Americans, who came in having won all  five outings against the Soviet Union during a tour that preceded the USA Cup,  three requiring no more than four games.  </P> <P> Timmons, in particular, was dominant as hitter, wasting few opportunities to  drill the ball to the floor in the middle of the Soviet defense. When the  visitors had a chance to close the gap in the second game, trailing only 3-5,  they hurt themselves more than the Americans with mistimed passes and errant  spike attempts. The U.S. quickly built the lead to 8-3 and gave up little  momentum the rest of the way.  </P> <P> The 30-minute pre-match festivities to honor Kiraly and Timmons included a  standing ovation, a pair of round-trip tickets for two to Hawaii from the  Forum, speeches, plaques, and gifts from the three other teams in the  round-robin tournament. Among the hardware were two joint resolutions from  state legislators reciting their accomplishments through the years, a nice  touch even if Kiraly's did mention his career at USC, a mixup the former Bruin  no doubt could have done without.  </P> <P> Noting that so many friends and family were on hand, Timmons, who did attend  USC, motioned toward his fiancee, Jeanie Buss.  </P> <P> "Jeanie," he said, "we could just get married now."  </P> <P> That will wait until November.  </P> <P> For Timmons and Kiraly, more volleyball is the next order of business.  </P> <P> Brazil won the consolation title with a 15-9, 13-15, 15-6, 15-12 victory over  South Korea.  </P></p>

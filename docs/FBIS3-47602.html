In the period of the third seven-year plan (1987-1993), the  number of the fishing boats including stern strawlers of and  above 3,750 ton class increased by more than 1,100 and the  modernisation of aquatic products processing facilities was  energetically pressed ahead. And a powerful drive was launched  to expand sea culture, resulting in a considerable increase of  its area. Thus the material and technical foundations of  fisheries were consolidated and a prospect was opened for a  radical boost of aquatic production.    The fisheries of Korea made a fast development in the '60s,  reinforced with mother ships of above 10,000 ton class and many  5,000-ton refrigerator transports, 3,750-ton stern trawlers and  other kinds of fishing boats. In the decade, the bases of ship  repair and fishing tackle production, fishing ports and aquatic  products processing bases were streamlined on an overall scale  and bases of sea culture were built to round off the  departmental structures of fisheries and increase its  independence.    In 1970 the aquatic output increased 236 percent, the total  tonnage of fishing boats 409 percent and the output of frozen  products 319 percent above 1960.    Large-size, modern and universal-purpose fishing boats were  widely introduced in the period of the six-year plan  (1971-1976), too, to increase the HP [expansion unkwown] per  ship 1.5 times and the number of scientific and technical  apparatuses installed in them 2 times. In that period modern  plate-shape refrigerating factories were built at major fishing  ports to additionally create a daily fast-freezing capacity of  10,000 tons and cold storage capacity of 220,000 tons. The 1.6  million-ton target of aquatic production envisaged in the  six-year plan was fulfilled one year and seven months ahead of  schedule.    The independence of fisheries was immensely increased in the  period of the second seven-year plan (1978-1984).    The aquatic products processing bases were markedly expanded  and many large refrigerating factories and storages built at  fishing ports and consumer areas such as Pyongyang, Sinpo,  Yukdae, Wonsan, Chongjin and Nampo.    The aquatic output augmented 2.2 times during the fulfilment  of the plan.    Today the nation's fisheries with complete departmental  structures is developing constantly on the basis of the latest  science and technology.</p>

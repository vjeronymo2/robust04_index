			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Management: The uphill battle against change From Machiavelli's Florence to modern corporate America, it has always been clear that the biggest barrier to any organisational improvement is getting people to change. So there was little justification for the surprise expressed last weekend at a study of 200 British manufacturing companies which concluded that the greatest 'inhibitor' to their achievement of 'world class' performance was not government policy, but their inability to implement change quickly enough. The fact that the problem is neither new nor peculiarly British is illustrated with particular piquancy by events which have come to light at one of the world's best-known multinationals as it wrestles with one of the most wrenching forms of change imaginable: the political, behavioural and organisational upheaval associated with the 're-engineering' of its operations. As regular readers of this page will know from a series of articles which began last month, this involves breaking down the barriers between powerful departments, and getting people to work in different ways in various 'business processes', from order processing to product development. It represents a fundamental challenge to the power base of many senior managers. The company concerned is Xerox, the copier giant, which operates in Europe as Rank Xerox. The piquant part of the story is that it was the UK end of the group which was most ready to change, but which was hampered by the rest of Xerox. In 1987, before the term 're-engineering' had even been coined, Rank Xerox UK launched the first stages of a comprehensive programme of what it then called radical 'process redesign'. This was supposed to become a model for the rest of the group; in 1990 a much-enlarged blueprint for the redesign of all Xerox's business processes was given official blessing by the US top management. Yet until less than a year ago it was 'filed and forgotten' in the US and continental Europe, says one senior international manager. 'It just didn't engage the business managers,' says a second. A third, who left in frustration, says: 'It hit an invisible wall of all sorts of barriers: cultural, hierarchical, structural and functional.' Only in the wake of poor financial results was a round of frenetic re-engineering finally launched in Europe last autumn. In continental Europe and the US, the programme's influence until then had been minimal, except in 'logistics' (supply and distribution). Even in the UK the original programme had far less effect than intended; it laid the groundwork for several projects, the most recent of which has been the re-engineering of order processing and service calls; but these are less all-embracing processes than those envisaged originally. The fact that such a sophisticated company has found it so hard to turn re-engineering from theory into practice, in spite of the apparent commitment of top management, reinforces the change conundrum. Like so much in any kind of history, Medici or modern, Xerox's difficulties are open to two interpretations, depending on your vantage point - or, if you are a 'change management' groupie, where you have been schooled. If, like most re-engineering evangelists and a growing body of desperate top managers, you consider radical process change to be the key to transforming a company's productivity and commercial performance, you will interpret the long delay in purely political terms. You will see it as the temporary but costly triumph of Xerox's reactionary, centralist 'functional barons' (heads of manufacturing, marketing and even 'total quality') over multidisciplinary working by relatively independent teams, on which proper re-engineering depends. On the other hand, you may, like Paul Allaire, Xerox's chairman and chief executive, take a much wider view which considers the politics of change to be only part of the problem. Allaire has been influenced heavily by David Nadler, an academic-turned consultant who sees business processes as just part of an organisation's complex 'architecture' - virtually the whole of which must be redesigned if the company is to manage change successfully. If you are of like mind, you will consider that the 1990 re-engineering blueprint was ahead of its time, out of context and inadequate on its own to achieve the essential task of breaking down decades of functional dominance and costly staff overheads in Xerox and its European offshoots. As things have proved, the whole group has indeed needed a much broader initiative from the very top, plus last year's poor financial results in Europe, to begin breaking that functional stranglehold. This initiative, launched in the US in early 1992 and now cascading uncomfortably into Europe, treats the redesign of work processes as only one of four elements which need to be changed if the whole of Xerox is to operate more effectively. The other three elements are: first, the group's formal organisation structure; second, its people and skills; and third, its informal networks, behaviour and 'culture'. The first was changed in wrenching fashion last year, and a succession of measures has been launched to change the other two  -which Allaire recognises is a far harder task. Six long, painful years after its first stirrings, radical change is finally under way at Xerox. As Machiavelli warned Lorenzo de Medici back in 1514, 'there is nothing more difficult . . . than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things'. Rank Xerox's current process re-engineering drive in Europe will be examined next week.</p>

The bill would be paid at the end of the  embargo decreed by the United Nations after the invasion of  Kuwait on 2 August 1990. "For the moment, importing Spanish  medical supplies in the amount of 1.45 billion pesetas would be  sufficient to meet our needs," said Iraqi Minister of Health  Umid Midhat Mubarak in an interview with this newspaper. "We are  optimistic with respect to Iraq's future, but now we need our  friends. As the Orientals that we are, we never forget those who  are with us in difficult moments," Mubarak added.    Although the UN embargo allows Iraq to import medicines and  other civil goods essential for the population, the prohibition  against oil exports leaves Iraq without the hard currency needed  to pay for such imports. The funds that were frozen in several  Western countries under the embargo--with the exception of those  related to oil and its derivatives, which were transferred into  a UN account--have been slowly unfrozen to pay for exports of  goods of humanitarian nature, and in many cases these funds have  been exhausted.    According to Mubarak, there are more than 1.5 billion  pesetas  still frozen in Spain. The Iraqi Embassy in Spain reduces that  figure to "some 300 million pesetas," belonging to two Iraqi  banks. And Jose Ramon Baranano, assistant director of the  Spanish Foreign Ministry's International Economic Relations  Section, asserts that Iraq "now has not a single frozen peseta  left in Spain."  <H5>  Searching for Formulas </H5>   With or without funds, what the Iraqi government suggests is  that Spain "find formulas, because they do exist, to prevent  suffering by the Iraqi population." "We do not want to  manufacture weapons, we want to keep people from dying," asserts  the minister of health.    Data compiled by UNICEF are hair-raising: Infant mortality  has tripled; 80 percent of the children are born with less than  normal weight because of the mother's malnutrition. Hospital  occupancy has dropped to approximately 30 percent. "Without  medical supplies, people do better remaining home." And of the  200 ambulances existing in 1990, only 37 throughout the country  are in operation. "We have run out of tires and batteries, and  as one breaks down, we use its parts to fix another."    The Spanish Government says that it "understands" Iraq's  problems, but argues that the Security Council allows no margin  of maneuver whatever, forbidding any type of credit, even if it  is for humanitarian reasons. Diplomatic sources assert: "We are  complying with UN regulations, and we hope that Iraq continues  to show its willingness to cooperate, as it has been doing  lately, so that the embargo may be lifted the soonest possible."    Fearing that the United States may veto the lifting of the  embargo even though it may be fulfilling the requirements of UN  resolution 687 (forbidding Iraq to sell oil until the UN  ascertains the dismantling of its mass-destruction arsenal, and  to install an anti-arms warning system), Baghdad meanwhile is  seeking alternatives and is offering "large future  compensations" to those enterprises that may take the chance of  "delivering today and collecting tomorrow."    "We have already signed some substantial agreements with  several European enterprises. Spanish companies should not lose  this opportunity to cash in on lucrative profits in a not too  distant future," says Umid Midhat Mubarak.</p>

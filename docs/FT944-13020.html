			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Chrysalis in Dutch TV deal Chrysalis, the media and music group which has been building up its visual entertainment division, is to buy 49 per cent of a Dutch television production company. The deal, agreed in the early hours of yesterday morning, marks Chrysalis' first venture outside the UK. The target is IDTV Holdings, an Amsterdam-based company that has the rights to several popular European game shows, including Lingo and Boggle. Chrysalis will pay an initial cash consideration of Pounds 3.79m, followed by instalments of up to Pounds 1.74m a year for the next four years, depending on IDTV's profits. Further payments could be made under a share option scheme designed as an incentive for the TV company's management. IDTV made profits of Fl 4.2m (Pounds 1.5m) pre-tax in 1993 on sales of Fl 35.2m. Put and call options exercisable from 1999 could lead to Chrysalis acquiring the rest of the shares at a price based on IDTV's profits. The maximum total consideration for the entire share capital is capped at about Pounds 18m. Mr Chris Wright, Chrysalis chairman, said yesterday that serious negotiations had started last April after the merger of two other independent Dutch TV producers into a group called Endemol. Since then Endemol had decided to start its own TV station, which would soak up most of its own production. 'It's a very good deal,' he said yesterday. 'The way things have worked out it's even better than what we anticipated when we start-ed.' Mr Harry de Winter, the principal owner of IDTV, is selling because he felt vulnerable after the Endemol merger, and he saw a link with Chrysalis as a good strategic alliance. The Dutch television market is similar to that in the UK. It also provides a springboard into Scandinavia. However, Mr Wright said Chrysalis had no further plans to buy into European television companies.</p>

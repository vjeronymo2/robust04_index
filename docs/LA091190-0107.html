			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> AROUND THE NATION;  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME REPLACES MIAMI AS NO. 1  </P> <P> Brigham Young's upset of top-ranked Miami shook up the Associated Press college  football poll Monday. Notre Dame became No. 1, BYU No. 5 and Miami No. 10.  </P> <P> Notre Dame, which opens its season Saturday against Michigan, received 37  first-place votes and 1,451 points from a nationwide panel of sportswriters and  broadcasters. The Fighting Irish were No. 2 last week.  </P> <P> Auburn, tied at No. 3 with Florida State last week, rose to No. 2 after beating  Cal State Fullerton, 38-17. Florida State remained in third after beating East  Carolina, 45-24. Idle Michigan moved up one spot to No. 4.  </P> <P> The rest of the top 10: No. 6 USC, No. 7 Tennessee, No. 8 Nebraska and No. 9  Colorado.  </P> <P> Only two weeks into the college football season, injuries have sidelined  several standout players.  </P> <P>  -- Houston wide receiver Manny Hazard, who had an NCAA-record 142 catches last  season, will be out for three weeks because of a dislocated elbow suffered in  the Cougars' 37-9 victory over Nevada Las Vegas on Saturday. Houston is ranked  18th.  </P> <P>  -- Alabama running back Siran Stacy, the team's leading rusher, underwent  surgery on his right knee and is out for the season. Stacy's top backup,  Derrick Lassic, also was injured Saturday.  </P> <P>  -- Tennessee's Chuck Webb, who rushed for 1,236 yards last season, suffered  torn knee ligaments during a 55-7 rout of Pacific Sept. 1 and will be sidelined  for the season.  </P> <P> The Orange Bowl Committee rejected an offer to move to Joe Robbie Stadium and  decided to keep the New Year's night game in its namesake home of 55 years.  </P> <P> Some committee members argued that the rundown condition of the Orange Bowl  made necessary a switch to three-year-old Joe Robbie Stadium, located north of  the city limits but still in Dade County. Other members said moving out of the  Orange Bowl, near Miami's downtown, would cost the city money and harm its  image.  </P> <P> Greg Jones, starting quarterback for West Virginia, has been cleared for  practice after suffering a concussion against Maryland, Coach Don Nehlen said.  Jones, a fifth-year senior from Miami, Fla., backed up Steve Walsh and Vinny  Testaverde at Miami before transferring to West Virginia after the 1986 season.  He had backed up Major Harris the past two seasons.  </P></p>

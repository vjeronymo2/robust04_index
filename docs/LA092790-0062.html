			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOSTER EARNING SPOTLIGHT FOR AZTECS  </P> <P> The lights were never this bright at DeAnza Community College.  </P> <P> Lou Foster shifted his weight from one foot to the other underneath the stands  at Cougar Stadium on the campus of Brigham Young University, surrounded by  drab, gray concrete. Floors, walls, ceilings. All around him, concrete.  </P> <P> The stadium was practically deserted other than a dozen or so people. Voices  echoed, then hushed. Foster waited. His teammate, Dan McGwire, was being  interviewed by a couple of guys from CBS television as the network prepared to  beam SDSU-BYU nationally the following day.  </P> <P> The television lights seemed as if they were about two million watts.  </P> <P> This was last Friday, and in another day, SDSU would play the No. 4 team in the  country. And the TV guys had requested interviews with McGwire . . . and  Foster.  </P> <P> He stood alone. He worried that maybe he should be wearing his glasses rather  than his contact lenses, for the Mike Singletary look. He wondered what he was  going to say. A minute passed, and then another, and then the television crew  signaled that they were ready. Lou Foster stepped forward, into the lights . .  .  </P> <P> For two years, he had played football in the relative obscurity of a community  college program, DeAnza, just outside San Jose. He is a linebacker but stands  just 5-feet-11 (he weighs 230 pounds). There isn't much of a demand for  football players -- let alone linebackers -- at that height, so Foster ended up  DeAnza after his years at Oak Grove High School in San Jose.  </P> <P> That's where he caught SDSU Coach Al Luginbill's attention. Foster was chosen  second-team all-state last year, having averaged 17 tackles per game. He led  DeAnza in tackling both years.  </P> <P> Then he walked onto the SDSU campus last spring and promptly earned the  starting middle linebacker job.  </P> <P> Things were great for a while. He would be able to reach out and touch his  dream, just as soon as the season started. Division I football. The big time.  He would start.  </P> <P> He pulled his right hamstring during conditioning drills in mid-August, a few  days before SDSU began two-a-days. It took longer than expected to heal, and he  missed the season opener at Oregon. Finally, he got in for a few plays Sept. 15  against Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> Now, here came BYU. And the television cameras. Someone had put his life on  fast-forward, then turned the volume all the way up.  </P> <P> "That was the first time anybody ever asked me to do a television interview  concerning football," Foster said. "It was fun. I enjoyed it."  </P> <P> He would have enjoyed it all a little bit more if the Cougars hadn't raked the  Aztec defense for 62 points and 641 total yards. Foster had a decent game, but  he missed a few assignments. Like the rest of the Aztec defense, he is  learning.  </P> <P> Defending against the run has been the strength of an SDSU defense that is  ranked last in the country (106th) among NCAA Division I schools in total  defense (an average of 509.7 yards allowed per game). The Aztecs have allowed  101.3 yards a game on the ground, which puts them 21st in the country. Part of  that credit has to go to Foster, despite the practice -- and game time -- he  has missed. A year ago, the Aztecs gave up 181 yards a game rushing.  </P> <P> It is the middle linebacker's responsibility in the SDSU defensive scheme to  call out plays and lead pursuit. Foster caught on almost immediately last  spring.  </P> <P> "The middle linebacker is an extremely important player in our defense,"  Luginbill said. "We free him up to make tackles, and we expect him to make  tackles."  </P> <P> And with the Air Force wishbone coming to town Saturday, Foster and the rest of  the SDSU defense will get a chance to continue their improvement against the  run.  </P> <P> "Hey, I'm chomping my lips," Foster said. "We have an opportunity to show a lot  of people we're very good against the run."  </P> <P> The two things that give you the most insight into Lou Foster are these:  </P> <P> * He is starting at middle linebacker for a Division I football team despite  his height.  </P> <P> * His teammates look up to him.  </P> <P> Yes. There are jokes about his size, and this is where peanuts come in.  </P> <P> "Our coaches tease us all the time about being small," said Foster's roommate  and starting outside linebacker Andy Coviello, who is just 6-0, 215. "They  tease us about how people can eat peanuts off the top of our heads."  </P> <P> But that's about as far as the jokes go. When Foster wears his glasses, he  looks like Singletary. He plays as if he knows what he is doing.  </P> <P> Luginbill has said several times that the Aztec defense had nobody as intense  and fiesty as Foster last season. The thing about Lou Foster is that he loves  to hit.  </P> <P> Reporter: "What do you like best about football?"  </P> <P> Foster: Pause. Smile. "I get to hit somebody and not get sent to jail for it."  </P> <P> Said Coviello: "I've seen him hit people 20 yards downfield for no reason, but  the whistle hadn't blown yet.  </P> <P> "I've never seen him not hyped. Certain people go through the motions. Lou,  never. He leads by example."  </P> <P> Sometimes, this leads to late nights for the roommates.  </P> <P> "He's very serious," Coviello said. "We'll go home, and sometimes it's hard to  get our homework done because we'll talk about different ways to hit. He loves  football.  </P> <P> "A lot of times, we've stayed up until one or two in the morning talking about,  'Oh, man, I remember when I did this,' or, last week, 'I can't wait to hit Ty  (Detmer).' This week, it's 'I can't wait to hit the Air Force fullbacks.' "  </P> <P> Maybe this is why the Aztecs took an instant liking to their new linebacker  last spring. He's a physical nut on the field. He loves the game. And off the  field, he's got an easy-going, friendly manner.  </P> <P> "We're just a much better defensive team when he's on the field," Luginbill  said. "We don't have the same unification, we don't have the same overall unity  we have when he's not on the field."  </P> <P> Why?  </P> <P> "I don't know. It's his personality. He draws on kids, and our kids will follow  him."  </P> <P> Said Coviello: "I think everybody respects him for maybe this aura he has about  him. There's something about Lou. When you look at him, he has a look on his  face like he knows what's up. He means business and he's serious. We all kind  of look up to him in a way."  </P> <P> The hamstring, Foster said, is about 95% healthy. He played only about half of  the BYU game and hopes to play more Saturday. Luginbill says Foster is still  playing catch-up because of time missed with the injury. Still, Luginbill feels  better when Foster is on the field, even if Foster makes mistakes from time to  time.  </P> <P> "Everybody says he's too short to play," Luginbill said. "I think his belief in  himself and his confidence in himself as a football player, and his pride in  wanting to do what's right, is what's impressive about him. He's a very  coachable kid, and he wants to do what's right helping the team win. He just  exudes that all the time."  </P> <P> Sunday, Foster and Coviello arrived at the SDSU football offices to watch film  and see where they went wrong against BYU. It was an off-day for the Aztecs,  but they didn't want to wait until Monday to see what they needed to work on.  </P> <P> Foster saw his problem clearly. From time to time, he wasn't "snugging" the BYU  backs enough. In other words, he was a bit too far behind the line of  scrimmage, allowing the BYU backs an extra couple of steps head start. One  time, he saw where he could have gotten a sack had he been up a little closer.  </P> <P> The films moved along, and Foster sat there in the darkness. There were no  lights now, just the images flickering across the television screen.  </P> <P> There was work to be done.  </P></p>

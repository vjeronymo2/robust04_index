			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Living inside the hair shirt THE SOLE case for the policies that have driven the economy into a deep recession is that the UK may thereby gain the long-term benefits of low and stable inflation. The job begun at the beginning of the Thatcher era can now be completed. What has given force to the theoretical arguments for a zero-inflation economy is the UK's membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS at what even enthusiastic proponents would agree was a demanding (if not overvalued) rate. If ERM membership is not to end up as just another in the series of half-hearted expedients that pass for British economic policy, its implications for economic policy are still not thoroughly digested. The main implication is that inflation must fall below the lowest level of any leading country within the ERM and must fall to that level as soon as possible. It must fall below the levels of other countries because of the UK's poor initial competitiveness. Notwithstanding the deep recession, the volume of exports, excluding erratic items, between the three months to December 1990 and the same three months in 1991 grew by only 4 per cent. The current account deficit is over 1 per cent of gross domestic product at the moment and is likely to grow rapidly in any recovery. Lost competitiveness must be regained. The case for lowering inflation as quickly as possible is that the target for the UK must be not just a comparable rate of cost inflation, but a comparable level of costs. It would do little good to achieve the same rate of inflation as in France from, say, 1996 if in the intervening period there had been progressive erosion of competitiveness from what was already the demanding base set in October 1990. The quicker convergence of inflation is achieved, therefore, the shorter the period during which UK cost inflation will have to be lower than in competitor countries. Sole route A recession is, unfortunately, the sole route to the required disinflation. It may impose a high price, but it is also a unique opportunity. If the UK has not achieved full convergence by the time recovery is well under way, the whole process will simply have to be repeated. The objective has not yet been achieved. The consensus of forecasters, for example, is for about 4 per cent retail price inflation in the year to the fourth quarter of 1992, above levels in several European countries. Over the past year, earnings have risen by 7 1/2 per cent in the UK, still above the German increase of 6.7 per cent, viewed by the Bundesbank as a disaster. To be safe, British annual pay inflation must fall to about 3 per cent. It is only against this demanding disinflationary objective, therefore, that the chancellor's fiscal stance can be judged. In its estimable Green Budget, the Institute for Fiscal Studies argues that the chancellor might introduce a net tax cut of Pounds 1-2bn in the forthcoming budget. It also argues that such a cut can be justified by the need for fiscal reflation. Since the budget has swung from a public sector debt repayment (excluding privatisation receipts) of Pounds 7.4bn (1 1/2 per cent of GDP) in 1988-89 to the IFS forecast borrowing requirement of nearly Pounds 28bn (4.3 per cent of GDP) in 1992-93, nobody can argue that tax cuts of Pounds 1-2bn would make all that much difference. Macroeconomically speaking, the budget is an over-rated event, even though a discretionary tax cut now would make the government's promise to 'balance the budget over the cycle' still less credible than it already is. Fiscal fine-tuning Nevertheless, the return to fiscal fine-tuning, with incomes policy in the wings perhaps, brings back unpleasant memories. Fiscal fine-tuning has big disadvantages. It is always more pleasant to make discretionary tax cuts than discretionary increases, which is why such cuts are the fastest possible route from cyclical to structural deficits. Such cuts have, in the past, nearly always been mistimed. Fine-tuning also undermines the ability of the fiscal system to provide a stable structure of incentives. And, quite apart from these permanent disadvantages of fine-tuning, there is the immediate difficulty that the present recession has not yet done its work. Yet cuts in taxes can be defended. The best approach, however, would be to focus them on the aim of limiting the long-term costs imposed by the disinflationary recession. The objective should be to maintain investment, perhaps through temporary investment allowances. The case for cuts in the basic rate of income tax is political. But that policy might not even buy the election. It would certainly be irrelevant to the UK's principal macroeconomic task: that of lowering inflation to below Europe's best level. The UK has a chance of achieving this aim right now. It is unlikely to get another one for a long time.</p>

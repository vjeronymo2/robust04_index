			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>   [Text] The Xi Yang case has raised grave questions about  Beijing's policy on the control of information, the politicised  justice system, and the stepped-up campaign of intimidation  against the Hong Kong media. Since the Ming Pao journalist's  detention on September 27 last year the authorities have never  supplied evidence to support the claim that Xi had stolen and  made roundabout inquiries about state financial secrets. There  is little doubt, however, that the Beijing court could, in  time-honoured Chinese fashion, justify the incrimination and  even the 12-year jail term.    The key is what constitutes "state secrets," one of the  murkiest concepts in a very muddled legal framework. The State  Secret Law stipulates that anything having to do with "state  security and interests" constitutes a state secret, leaving the  authorities with arbitrary powers of interpretation.    In practice, the administration's definition of "state  secrets," like those regarding "counter-revolutionary crimes,"  "antigovernment activities" and other aspects of security, is  based on wartime considerations of the 1930's and 1940's, when  the fledgling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was under threat of  extinction through persecution by the Kuomintang and the  warlords.    Many in the party are aware these concepts have long become  obsolete. However, it serves the administration's purpose to  retain the archaic institutions. In the age of computers and  mass media, knowledge is power. And the CCP is convinced that  the less they let the people know about reality -- particularly  its seamier aspects -- the more secure its hold on power. Thus,  things every Chinese has a right to know -- ranging from the  health of patriarch Deng Xiaoping to the shady business deals of  the offspring of senior cadres -- are "state secrets." The  system also provides the administration with a handy weapon to  penalise foreign and Hong Kong journalists who might have got  hold of information that is too close to the truth.    The Xi incident is also disturbing because it provides yet  another illustration of the politicisation of the judicial  process. It is an open "state secret" that for major cases, it  was not the courts but the party Central Committee's Political  and Legal Commission, the Politburo Standing Committee, and  sometimes Mr Deng, who made the decision about guilt and the  kind of punishment to be meted out. It was the patriarch who  dictated the jail term of dissident Wei Jmgsheng as well as that  of the principal secretary of ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang,  Bao Tong, one of whose alleged crimes was "leaking state  secrets".    Mr Deng and politburo heavyweights, including Premier Li  Peng, had the final say over the treatment accorded the two  "black hands" in the 1989 democracy movement Wang Juntao and  Chen Ziming. Before the court cases on the two opened, Mr Li  had said in internal meetings "the party cannot let the tigers  go back to the hills."    General Secretary Jiang Zemin personally looked into the  circumstances of the "leaking" of his political report to the  14th Party Congress in October 1992. Xinhua (the New China News  Agency) editor Wu Shishen, who allegedly supplied the document  to Hong Kong reporter Leung Waiman, was given a life sentence  last year.    Sources said because the "state secrets" Xi allegedly  published in Ming Pao were based on an internal address made  last summer by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji to the People's Bank of  China (PBOC), Zhu was among several heavyweight politicians who  laid down instructions that the Hong Kong journalist and his  "informant," PBOC clerk Tian Ye, be mercilessly dealt with.    Only the politicised nature of Chinese justice could explain  the shockingly stiff punishment slapped on Xi and Tian, who got  15 years last week. Wei was given a 15-year term in 1979 --  when China was still recovering from the lawlessness of the  Cultural Revolution -- for allegedly obtaining military secrets.    Bao, who was charged with leaking Politburo decisions to the  student "rebels" at Tiananmen Square got seven years.    The "state secrets" Xi was found guilty of "stealing" were  reportedly confidential documents concerning Beijing's plans for  interest rate changes and its policy on international gold  transactions. According to the better connected among Western  bankers and brokers in Beijing and Shanghai, similar "state  secrets" are bandied about on a daily basis in fancy karaoke  bars in the coastal cities.    The severity of Xi's punishment is also obvious when one  looks at the dozens of Western, Asian, and Taiwan journalists  who were caught pilfering "state secrets" or engaging in  "antigovernment activities" since the early 1980's. They were  either given warnings or kicked out of the country after brief  periods of detention. None received jail terms.    There is no escaping the conclusion that, as Ming Pao, the  Hong Kong Journalists Association, and other press and human  rights watchdogs have pointed out, the Xi case is a deliberate  attempt by the CCP to gag the Hong Kong press. With the growing  accessibility of satellite and Hong Kong television and other  forms of broadcasts, news reported by Western and local  reporters is available to a fast- growing Chinese audience.  Because of language, culture, and connections, Hong Kong  reporters have an edge over their Western and Asian colleagues  in obtaining "state secrets".    Even more important is the 1997 factor. At a time when China  is engaged in psychological warfare with Britain over the hearts  and minds of Hong Kong, it is in Beijing's interest to ensure  that, to use a Chinese axiom, the guns of the Hong Kong media  are pointed in the right direction. After 1997, much of the  Hong Kong media will become domestic Chinese media. Beijing's  ideologues and censors are at a loss about policing hundreds of  irreverent, muckraking Hong Kong newsmen.    Beijing's campaign of intimidation against the Hong Kong  press began, of course, well before the June 4, 1989, crackdown  in Tiananmen Square. And quite a few local media have already  exercised ponderous self-restraint. The Xi case shows Beijing  is not content with self-censorship; what it wants may be total  control.    In a wider context, the Xi affair exposes not only the CCP's  dubious desire of honouring the "one country, two systems"  formula but its pledge to loosen its grip over the courts and  the media. More than the preferential terms offered foreign  investors, a developing country's track record in press freedom  is the best gauge of its commitment to modernisation. China,  along with North Korea, is among the few countries in the world  still bent on "killing the messenger with unwelcome tidings".</p>

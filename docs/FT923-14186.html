			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Revised scheme for Sutcliffe Speakman Sutcliffe Speakman intends to revise its proposed capital reconstruction scheme to incorporate a larger reduction of share premium account and the cancellation of deferred shares. That will enable the deficit on profit and loss at March 31 to be extinguished and clear the arrears of dividend on the preference shares as soon as possible. The plan will require shareholder and Court approval. Meanwhile, the half yearly dividend due on June 30 was passed.</p>

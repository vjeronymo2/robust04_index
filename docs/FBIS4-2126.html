			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of  China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met  with Dr. Kurt Waldheim, former U.N. secretary general and  president of the U.N. Association of Austria, here this  afternoon.    Waldheim, also former federal president of Austria, and his  delegation arrived here on Monday [4 April] for a 10-day visit  to China at the invitation of the U.N. Association of China.    During the meeting Qiao and Waldheim exchanged views on a  wide range of issues including the development of Sino-Austrian  relations and international issues of common interest.    On China-Austria ties, both expressed the hope for  furthering  bilateral cooperation in every field, especially in  infrastructure development.    They agreed that there exist great possibilities and broad  prospects for expanding such cooperation.    Qiao reaffirmed China's consistent adherence to the  principles of equality in handling state-to-state relations and  its stand for the settlement of international disputes through  peaceful means.    If these principles are departed from, he said,  contradictions will be accelerated and problems can not be  settled. This will contribute nothing to world peace.    Waldheim said he agreed with Qiao's view.    During the meeting the two also exchanged views on the  position and roles of the U.N. and the regional situation as  well.    This evening Huang Hua, as the first leader of the Chinese  delegation to the U.N., hosted a dinner in honor of Mr. Waldheim  and his party.</p>

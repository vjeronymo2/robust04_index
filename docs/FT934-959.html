			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Setback for Sky on pirate decoders British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, yesterday suffered a setback in the Irish courts in its battle against pirate decoder cards that unscramble BSkyB's subscription channels. Sales of the cards are illegal in the UK but not in most other European Union countries. BSkyB - in which Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, has a stake - failed to win an injunction pending a full hearing against Mr David Lyons, who has been selling unauthorised cards outside the UK.

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Diplomatic Brazilians respectful of hosts A classic mis-match? Three-times world champions Brazil are expected to meet the US in the second round of the World Cup in San Francisco next Monday - July 4 - and are trying to appear, like, humble. The Brazilians dot their comments about the American team with terms like 'much improved', 'very difficult' and 'respect.' But it is easy to suspect that the lofty Brazilians are being diplomatic about the World Cup hosts, who have reached the second round against most expectations. 'It is an opponent we respect like all the others. If they reached the final 16, they did so on merit,' said Brazil's coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira. Brazil drew 1-1 with Sweden on Tuesday to top Group B in the first round. The US team were third in Group A. What exactly does Brazil respect about the Americans, Parreira was asked. 'They are very determined to win,' he replied. 'They have two or three fast players up front.' On the other hand, odds-makers have made Brazil cramped favourites to win the title, and are quoting less than 2-1 against them in London, even though four knock-out stages remain. Brazil have won all five of their previous matches against the US. The last time the US scored against Brazil - during a 4-3 loss in 1930 - Herbert Hoover was in the White House. Worse, the Americans will be without mid-fielder and playmaker John Harkes (see story right), who got his second yellow card against Romania and will sit out a compulsory one-game suspension. The Brazilians still won't knock their hosts. 'They are a very difficult team, despite their lack of soccer tradition,' says mid-fielder Dunga. 'They are greatly improved, with players from Germany and England.' Team-mate Mazinho also predicted a tough match 'even though we have superior technique and tradition.' After Mexico's 1-1 draw with Italy on Tuesday, securing a second-round spot, two men died and many were hurt after celebrations in Mexico City led to violence. Youths, many drunk, roamed streets, smashing windows. Mexico's coach has pleaded with fans to celebrate peacefully.</p>

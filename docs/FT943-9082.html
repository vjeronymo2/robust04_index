			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / US agrees to Harrier successor project UK and US defence officials have signed an agreement to work together on a new generation of jump jet that could replace not only the Harrier but also other conventional naval attack aircraft. The agreement covers development and model testing of four possible designs of short take-off and vertical landing aircraft by consortia involving British Aerospace, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed, Boeing and Northrop, as well as aero-engine builders Rolls-Royce, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney. The programme aims to demonstrate that it is possible to develop an affordable, modular aircraft design which different services could adapt for different missions without too many compromises. The programme would produce a variant, with powered lift, that could eventually replace the Royal Navy's FRS2 Sea Harrier and the US AV-8B, also a Harrier. British officials said the technology developed could also be relevant to a replacement for the Tornado bomber. The UK will pay Dollars 12m (Pounds 7.8m), one-third of the cost of this phase of development.</p>

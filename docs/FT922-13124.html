			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Ford plans Dollars 3bn investment in North America FORD, the second largest US vehicle manufacturer, said yesterday that it planned to invest Dollars 3bn in North America over the next three years, partly to fund development of a new minivan. Ford, which reported a record Dollars 2.3bn loss last year, said that about a third of the funds - more than Dollars 900m - would go towards retooling and re-equiping its Oakville assembly plant near Toronto, where the minivan would be produced. Minivans, among which Ford's current Aerostar is a leading competitor, are one of the few North American light vehicle growth sectors, and have assumed critical importance for General Motors and Chrysler, as well as Ford. Ford's decision to make such large investments at Oakville serves to allay Canadian fears of an increasing withdrawal by US vehicle makers as a result of trade frictions between the two countries. Ford added that about Dollars 400m has been spent on a new paint facility at the plant. One production shift at the Ontario truck plant, next to Oakville, would be discontinued in 1993, and about 700 workers transferred to Oakville for production of the minivan. Eventually, some 400 additional employees would be required, and Ford said it would offer jobs to other workers on indefinite lay-off at other Ontario plants. Production of the minivan would begin in late 1993, and it would be on the market in 1994. A further Dollars 650m is to be spent on expanding the Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, for the production of F-Series trucks. There are plans for 1,300 additional jobs by 1995, when full production is reached. Close to Dollars 1bn will be spent on the equipping of the Windsor engine plant in Ontario, where a new family of truck engines is due to be produced in 1995. The Dollars 3bn investment, although large, is only a portion of Ford's annual expenditure on retooling and production-related changes. The Detroit carmaker, for example, said that it spent about Dollars 5.6bn last year on changes to production facilities in order to bring new products to the market.</p>

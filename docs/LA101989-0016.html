			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SELF-ESTEEM IS EARNED'  </P> <P> I am in agreement with Schmoker. "Groundless praise" may encourage complacency,  but more importantly this form of patronizing behavior has no place in our  educational system where it breeds contempt among its students. During the '60s  this contempt was concerned with the "hypocrisy" reflected in middle-class  values. It is disquieting to consider the ways in which our educators still  encourage these same attitudes.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the onus of failure permeates middle-class values and teaches  the young that "one can never do enough." The resulting stress leads many  students to drop out, or to set lesser goals for themselves. Most parents want  their children to go to college, and in particular those parents who never went  to college themselves. These same people confuse what is "great about America"  and what has been "good for Japan."  </P> <P> The most unfair comparison to date concerns the test-score differences among  Korean, and Japanese students, who score higher than American students in  mathematics. The fact being many Far Eastern countries start winnowing out  their lesser achievers in the lower grades. There is no room for the late  bloomer, or the quirky genius to flower, for the term "self" as used in the  Orient is something quite different from the "self" we refer to in Western  culture. The fact that Korean students ranked themselves last in mathematics,  when in fact they were first, demonstrates a lack of self-esteem by Western  standards.  </P> <P> What we call self-esteem is that quality which most often encourages a student  to rebel, and it is the ideal behind the student movement for democracy in  China. Self-esteem, in order to grow, must have self-expression. Yet many  school administrators, well-schooled themselves in crisis management, have  adopted a patronizing attitude which rewards mediocrity and breeds contempt.  Yes, tougher standards apply, but fewer constraints as well, which seems to me  to be the essence of the American experience.  </P> <P> DAVID C. REUTTER  </P> <P> Vista  </P></p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Bavarian hospitality: As They Say in Europe THE Economic Summit drew the familiar hangers-on and international financial groupies to Munich last week. The last occasion they had gathered in such an out-of-the- way place was when the IMF and World Bank met in Bangkok last year. The comparisons were odious. As Daniel Hofmann of the Neue Zurcher Zeitung put it: 'If they can get it right in a Third World country why can't they do it here?' 'Getting it right', in this context, meant organising everything smoothly for the media. That may be the ultimate test of a summit since reporters are more prepared to see it as a success if they are happy. Hence, the acclaim for last year's summit in London which was compact and slick and got everything wrong. In Munich, home of Siemens electronics, the electronics were what annoyed people. Deutsche Telekom is convinced it runs the world's best communications system, but it is short of modern phone systems and made few concessions to coupling systems which prevail elsewhere. The press room was too hot when the sun shone, too cold when it did not, with noise and ants. Electronic links between the two main centres were rare, so if you wanted to hear what the Americans were saying you had to travel the half hour needed to get there. Enough of complaints, so now for some compliments. The thing about German tabloids is that they have a go at everybody, not just those designated as political enemies. So they had a good summit. Bild Zeitung gave a fascinating account of the private tastes of the world's leaders. President Mitterrand, it seems, does not drink, so his bar was cleared of alcohol and filled with freshly-squeezed fruit juices. John Major, however, has an unexpected reputation - he was given a vast assortment of Bavarian beers and Franconian wine. Die Welt reported that the hotel where the Japanese prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, stayed, rented a large number of Japanese to stand around the lobby so the honoured guest would feel at home. The real test came on the first day. Munich Day had become what Bild called 'A mad house.' The authorities handled a few hundred anti-summit demonstrators with that rigorous intolerance of unorthodox opinion that most of the rest of Germany has overcome. The police formed a ring around the demonstrators in which they were held for hours. 'If only Franz-Josef had seen it,' was Bild's headline, a reference to the most famous of Bavaria's post-war leaders, Franz-Josef Strauss. It was this populist conservative who had decided that this summit should be held in Munich: perhaps he would have rather enjoyed it for he revelled in the confrontation it provoked. The headline in the tz, which is a local rival in the tabloid war, read: 'This is the Summit: Brass bands and beatings.' It continued, 'The 'World City with a Heart' shows the world two different faces.' When the Bavarian prime minister, Max Streibl, defended the police action, the paper shouted, 'A mistake, Herr Streibl] We Bavarians are not bullies.' Among German journalists this led to an outbreak of inter-regional contempt. As one noted hack told me, 'This could never have happened in North Rhine Westphalia.' The verdict of the tabloids on the summit came in a review in tz of a local production of Carmen - 'Just like the Summit: very expensive and not much in it.' The headline of the week came from another annual event, the Tour de France. When the Spanish cyclist Miguel Indurain took the lead, Liberation cried, 'Singing Indurain arrive au top.'

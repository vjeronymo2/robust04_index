			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Knin, 9 May (TANJUG)--Representatives of the  United Nations and the state leadership of the republic of Serb  Krajina [RSK] agreed in Knin today that the talks between  Croatia and Krajina resume on 18 May, when economic and  humanitarian cooperation will be discussed. The venue has not  yet been specified. Geneva and Karadjordjevo were proposed as  possible venues today. The UN mediation team was led by Yasushi  Akashi. General Bertrand Delapresle, the commander of the  peacekeeping forces for the former Yugoslavia, and Kai Eide,  deputy cochairman of the Geneva conference on the former  Yugoslavia, were also in the UN team.    The RSK delegation consisted of Krajina President Milan  Martic; Prime Minister Borisav Mikelic; Foreign Minister Milan  Babic; Defense Minister Rade Tanjga, and Interior Minister Ilija  Prijic. At a news conference, Akashi described the talks as  open, useful, meaningful, and productive. He said three key  questions in the peace process had been discussed--the  implementation of the cease-fire agreement, the resumption of  the RSK-Croatia talks on economic relations, and bilateral  issues between the RSK and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force].  [passage omitted]    At the end of the news conference, Akashi said that his  impression after the talks today was that the state leadership  of Krajina was "for cooperation with UNPROFOR in the process of  achieving peace and establishing economic relations".    "I am satisfied with the results of the talks today and am  optimistic about relations in the future," Akashi said.    President Martic also said the talks had been productive. He  praised Akashi as a man fighting for peace and stressed the need  to lift the sanctions against Krajina so that the forthcoming  talks with Croatia could take place on an equal footing. Martic  said he believed that the forthcoming talks between the RSK and  UNPROFOR would be fruitful and useful in the resolution of their  bilateral relations and obligations.</p>

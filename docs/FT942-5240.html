			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Media Futures: New billboard on the highway Mecklermedia, a US technology publishing group, last week launched 'MecklerWeb', an electronic communications and marketing system aimed at businesses that want to have a 'corporate presence' on the Internet. For Dollars 25,000 per year, MecklerWeb will provide companies with a billboard on the electronic highway; a place to present their product information, corporate messages and news. This is unlikely to cause offence in the anti-advertising culture of the Internet, however, because the group will not distribute promotional materials. Instead it will provide a commercial catalogue that users may choose to browse at will. 'Cyberspace is not a mass market,' says Christopher Locke, president of MecklerWeb. 'You don't have to target audiences, they self select. The real opportunity here is not traditional advertising, but rather a new method of building business relationships and achieving market presence.' MecklerWeb will be organised into broad topical areas of interest such as law, medicine, sports and technology. Within each, sub-groups and specialties will be arranged in an hierarchical structure. As well as the corporate information, MecklerWeb intends to create discussion groups that could lure potential customers. The group is inviting professional associations to serve as 'hosts' to the various subject areas, moderating discussions and organising multimedia content. Such groups will receive a share of the fees paid by companies that participate.</p>

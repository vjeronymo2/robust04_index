			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE JOFFREY ON CHANNEL 28  </P> <P> Invaluable but congenitally uneven, the PBS "Dance in America" series sometimes  meticulously preserves the form and content of stage choreography and sometimes  trashes it with disorienting camera work and incoherent editing. The newest  episode, "A Night at the Joffrey," includes samples of both extremes.  </P> <P> Studio-taped in Denmark, the hour-long telecast is scheduled for 9 p.m. tonight  on Channels 28, 15 and 24; Saturday at 9 p.m. on Channel 50.  </P> <P> Frederick Ashton's serene trio "Monotones II" (1965, music by Satie) and Gerald  Arpino's elegiac septet "Round of Angels" (1983, music by Mahler) are each  lovingly transcribed for television with astute camera placements, long  (unbroken) takes and near-perfect transitions between shots.  </P> <P> In contrast, William Forsythe's bitter, abrasive "Love Songs" (1979, set to pop  ballads sung by Aretha Franklin and Dionne Warwick) is flayed alive. Sometimes  the camera is so close, the dancers seem about to be bludgeoned by the lens --  and what they do is often cut into snippets that don't connect. The opening  section has even been photographically reprocessed to make the movement look  jerky and unnatural.  </P> <P> Interestingly, Forysthe himself was responsible for these innovations -- plus  adding loads of dancers, furniture and dramatic action to the work that aren't  in the stage version. There's also a new ending -- with clips from the previous  sections -- that's MTV to the max.  </P> <P> The dancers look splendid through every challenge, of course, especially Leslie  Carothers in the Forsythe and Arpino ballets and Beatriz Rodriguez in a "Love  Songs" duet. Incidentally, the program forthrightly treats the Joffrey as a New  York company, ignoring the illusion of bicoastalism that continues to linger  locally and nowhere else. Thomas Grimm directed the dance sequences, Judy  Kinberg the helpful choreographer interviews.LEWIS SEGAL  </P></p>

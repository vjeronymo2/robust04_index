			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Perez demands trial decision VENEZUELAN President Carlos Andres Perez has urged his country's Supreme Court to end uncertainty over his political future by deciding immediately whether sufficient cause exists to impeach him. In a letter released yesterday Mr Perez said: 'The nation's tranquillity and the development of its economic activities, in particular, make it urgently necessary that the decision on whether or not to try the chief executive be clarified immediately.' Since March 11, the court has been studying a petition filed by the attorney-general to impeach Mr Perez over alleged improper use of Dollars 17m in government funds. A successful impeachment would force a president out of office for the first time in Venezuela's 35 years of democracy. The matter came to a head this week when the local press revealed that Chief Justice Gonzalo Rodrguez Corro of the Supreme Court had drafted an opinion calling for impeachment, and that he had sent copies of it to the other 14 members of the court. The full court has not yet issued a ruling - it has about two weeks in which to do so - but publication of the chief justice's opinion pushed the president to write to the court. News of the chief justice's letter had appeared in the press on Wednesday, amid false rumours said that the president had resigned, pushing the Caracas stock exchange down more than 5 per cent. Venezuela's external debt bonds also weakened on international markets. Under the constitution, if a president cannot perform his duties, the chairman of Congress becomes acting president for up to 30 days. Mr Octavio Lepage, the chairman and long a leader of the ruling Democratic Action party, lost to Mr Perez in the 1988 race for the party's presidential nomination. Mr Lepage has opposed the president's free market policies over the past four years. During the 30-day period, the two chambers of Congress, the Senate and House of Representatives, are required by the constitution to choose from among themselves a president to serve out the rest of the current term. Mr Perez, elected to a five-year term by a strong majority, is due to reach the end of his term in February next year. Whatever happens, he is not allowed to succeed himself.</p>

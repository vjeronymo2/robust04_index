			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Thames Water lifts profits by 5%: Shares fall 7p despite 8% increase in interim dividend to 6.9p THAMES WATER demonstrated that utility companies are not immune to the recession when it reported half-year pre-tax profits up by only 5 per cent to Pounds 124m (Pounds 118m). It increased its interim dividend by 8 per cent to 6.9p (6.4p), but the stock market was disappointed that the rise was not higher and the shares dropped by 7p to 485p. Sir Roy Watts, chairman, said the board felt the dividend balanced the interests of customers and shareholders. Demand for water from businesses fell by 2.5 per cent or Pounds 5m in the six months to September 30 (compared with the first half last year). However, rises in water charges of around 8 per cent and this year's acquisitions of water services companies pushed turnover up by 15 per cent to Pounds 502m (Pounds 436m). Mr Mike Hoffmann, chief executive, said the company had seen an increase in bad debts in the recession and had disconnected 731 of its 5m customers in the half year, compared with only a few dozen in the first half last year. Pre-tax profit was also held back by the rise in interest charges to Pounds 15m (Pounds 3m) as the group took on debt to help fund the utility arm's 10-year Pounds 4bn capital spending programme. The London Ring Main, the huge new watercourse encircling London, and one of the largest parts of the programme, is due to be finished in 1995 ahead of schedule. But it has helped push net debt to Pounds 383m compared to Pounds 327m in March and Pounds 156m the year before. Mr David Luffnam, finance director, said that the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds, now 23 per cent, would probably rise to 30 per cent by the year end, but would then rise more slowly. Pre-tax profits from Thames's diversification into water services, which now make up half of turnover, fell from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 3.5m as UK industrial business weakened and US municipal business slumped ahead of the presidential election. Profits from UK property sales fell to Pounds 3m (Pounds 6m) due to the weak property market. Tax - almost entirely advance corporation tax on dividend payments - fell to Pounds 8m (Pounds 9m), allowing earnings per share to rise by 6 per cent to 30.1p (28.4p). Last month Thames agreed with Ofwat, the water regulator, that water prices would rise by 4.1 per cent on top of retail price inflation in the years to March 1994 and 1995. Sir Roy Watts said he welcomed the extra predictability of the two-year deal. Lex, Page 24</p>

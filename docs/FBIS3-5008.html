			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to Plotprasop Suratsawat, the Fishery  Department director, in the past three months Burma has sunk 50  to 70 Thai fishing boats and caused the deaths of over 200 Thai  fishermen by gunshot wounds or drowning. A number of Burmese  fishermen have also lost their lives.    Plotprasop said that although Thai fishing boats were guilty  of fishing in Burmese waters, Burmese punishment was excessive.  The Burmese Government is asked to look into the matter. There  should be a standard in punishing guilty Thai fishing boats, not  applying violent methods. It is believed that the violent  action was committed by low ranking sailors who were patrolling  the sea. In any event, Thailand has asked to negotiate the  fishing problem with the Burmese Government but there has been  no response to date.</p>

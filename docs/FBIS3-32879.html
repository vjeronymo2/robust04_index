			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Caracas, 8 Feb (PL) -- Cuban Vice President Carlos  Lage today reaffirmed Cuba's interest in promoting Latin  American capital investments in the island, which is adopting  measures to accommodate its economy to current world conditions.    Lage, who met with Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister  Miguel  Angel Burelli and other authorities, stopped in Caracas for a  short visit. He arrived from Brazil and will visit Colombia  tomorrow.    At a news conference, the Cuban leader said his country  welcomes foreign capital investments, preferably from the  region, with which Cuba hopes to strengthen political ties and  take steps toward integration.    In his meeting with Burelli, who is also Venezuela's  candidate for OAS secretary general, Lage explained his  country's situation, as well as the consequences of the U.S.  economic blockade against the island. Lage emphasized that the  so-called Torricelli Amendment, which tightens the blockade  through extraterritorial measures, is not only illegal but also  criminal because of its impact on the population.    Lage added that the accusations against Havana of human  rights violations are unjustified and just a part of  Washington's harassment policy.    Lage said Cuba has every right to participate in all aspects  of the Latin American integration process and that regional  organizations must accept all countries and respect the right of  each people to choose its own path.    As for the changes taking place in Cuba, Lage said that the  Caribbean nation does not intend to become a capitalist nation  but to adjust to current world conditions and to improve the  socialist model.    He added that it is very difficult to predict whether  conditions will improve next year due to the U.S. blockade, but  he did say that if the blockade tightens and creates even more  difficult conditions, Cuba will face them.    Lage also met with Abdon Vivas Teran, president of the  Venezuelan Investment Fund, and with Cesar Quintini Rosales,  transport and communications minister.</p>

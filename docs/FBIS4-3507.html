			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Manifesto" announcing the establishment of the Democratic </F> Party issued by the United Democrats of Hong Kong and Meeting  Point in Hong Kong on 18 April]    [Text] After serious deliberations, the central committees  of the United Democrats of Hong Kong and Meeting Point have  agreed in principle to jointly initiate a new political party --  the Democratic Party.    The major aim of the Democratic Party is to further unite  the  democratic forces in Hong Kong to shoulder the responsibility  for the future of Hong Kong.    At this crucial moment, we sincerely appeal to the citizens  of Hong Kong to unite together and support the Democratic Party  in its pursuit of a high degree of autonomy and an open and  democratic government for Hong Kong.    The Democratic Party believes that:    -- Hong Kong is an indivisible part of China. We support  the return of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China.    -- The practice of "one country, two systems," a high degree  of autonomy, and the establishment of a democratic government in  Hong Kong are the wishes of the people of Hong Kong. This will  help to contribute to the stability of Hong Kong, and foster the  development of China.    -- We care for China and, as part of the Chinese citizenry,  we have the rights and obligations to participate in and comment  on the affairs of China.    -- We will seek to represent and articulate the views of the  people of Hong Kong about Chinese government policies related to  or having an impact on Hong Kong.    -- Democracy is the prerequisite for Hong Kong to establish  a high degree of autonomy and is a natural consequence of the  termination of the British colonial rule.    -- Democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law are  the foundations for progress and prosperity in a modern society.  In Hong Kong, it is necessary to speed up the development of a  democratic system of government, to strengthen the protection of  freedom, human rights, and the rule of law.    -- That to maintain free and fair competition in our market  economy, it is necessary for Hong Kong to develop and maintain  appropriate monitoring systems, a reasonable and stable tax  system, a sound legal system, and a corruption-free and  accountable government.    -- Economic prosperity depends on the concerted efforts of  investors, labour, professionals, government, and all members of  society. The creation of wealth is the prerequisite for social  development, and the ultimate objective of the creation of  wealth is that all members of society may share the fruit of  their economic success.    -- That to foster the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong,  to promote social justice, and to eliminate all forms of  discrimination, Hong Kong needs to develop strong and healthy  education, medical, housing, labour, social welfare and social  security systems, and the assurance of equal opportunities of  participation and development of personal talents.    -- That to ensure continuous supply of natural resources,  long- term social development and the protection of the  livelihood of our future generations, we should protect and  develop our living environment.    The Democratic Party is a local political party which is  devoted to the affairs of Hong Kong and cares about China. Hong  Kong is our home.    We are willing to serve Hong Kong and China, and wish  democracy, progress, and prosperity for Hong Kong and China.    We firmly believe that public support is the foundation of  the Democratic Party and the public's will is our will. We  truly believe that to realise the basic principles of the  Democratic Party we must unite all citizens of Hong Kong, and  join with others who share this common goal to face future  challenges.    The Democratic Party welcomes all who share the same beliefs  to join with us in building a better future for Hong Kong.</p>

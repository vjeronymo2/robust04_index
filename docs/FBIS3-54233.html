			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There has been an upheaval in the Union of Local  Authorities in Israel. Karmi'el Mayor 'Adi Eldar has emerged  victorious in the struggle to head the union. Eldar belongs to  the Labor party. He won with a small margin of votes over his  predecessor, Likud activist Maxim Levi. The third candidate,  Eli Landau from Herzliyya, garnered 23 votes, later claiming  that by drawing votes away from Maxim Levi he had influenced the  results.    Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, who  directed Eldar's election campaign, said that it was the Arab  vote that had proved decisive. The voting turnout was 100  percent. 'Adi Eldar, the elected chairman, praised Maxim Levi  for exhibiting fair play. He said that he would enact changes  in the Union of Local Authorities in Israel, noting that from  now on all local council heads and mayors in Israel would work  together.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Detroit's wheel of fate spins once more History seemed to repeat itself yesterday for Mr Lee Iacocca, the flamboyant boss of Chrysler, in the corporate politics surrounding the naming of Mr Robert Eaton as his successor. In the late 1970s Mr Iacocca was the brash second-in-command at Ford, champing at the bit for Mr Henry Ford to step aside so that he could take over. In 1978, when Mr Ford demurred, Mr Iacocca left Ford for Chrysler. Mr Iacocca, now a slightly tarnished hero of 1980s corporate America, has lately found himself in the same role that Mr Ford was playing. Mr Robert Lutz, the Swiss-born Chrysler president hired by Mr Iacocca in 1986 from a languishing career in the senior ranks of Ford, seemed to many to be Mr Iacocca's heir apparent. But he has been at odds with Mr Iacocca for months, making no secret of his desire to succeed him. Mr Iacocca's reputation as the American folk hero who led Chrysler back from the brink a decade ago has been compromised by the company's renewed losses. That has not stopped him playing the same trick on Mr Lutz that Mr Ford had played on him back in 1978, however. The question now is whether Mr Lutz, effectively demoted, will stay on under Mr Eaton. Mr Lutz admitted he was 'disappointed' yesterday, but pledged to stay on. And Mr Iacocca, with characteristic hyperbole, called reports of a rift between him and Mr Lutz 'crap with a capital C'. A second issue is whether Mr Iacocca, 67, will be able to restrain himself when he retires at the end of this year. He will stay on as a board member and chairman of the executive committee, giving him a platform from which to keep an eye on his successor - and continue his trenchant criticism of Japan. Yesterday, Mr Iacocca promised he would not be 'a big force' after he hands over to Mr Eaton. It was noticeable, however, that at yesterday's press conference Mr Eaton embraced Mr Iacocca's protectionist views. He said he used to favour free trade, but now supports Mr Iacocca. Dealing with his predecessor is only one of Mr Eaton's problems. Chrysler lost Dollars 795m (Pounds 452m) last year, compared with 1990 earnings of Dollars 68m. By comparison with the Dollars 4.5bn lost by General Motors in 1991, this seems small. But it will not be easy for Chrysler to improve its financial health quickly. Much of this year's hopes are pinned on two new product launches: the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the LH series of mid-sized saloons. Mr Iacocca made clear last month that Chrysler expects to suffer a significantly larger first quarter 1992 pre-tax loss than the Dollars 74m deficit of the last quarter of 1991. The company's credit rating has been lowered to junk bond status. Its Chrysler Financial consumer credit subsidiary needs to refinance Dollars 2.9bn of maturing debt this year and a further Dollars 1bn in the first half of 1993.</p>

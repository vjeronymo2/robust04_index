			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Observer: Double act departs With the departure in May next year of Cazenove's joint senior partners John Kemp-Welch and Anthony Forbes comes the end of one of the City's more remarkable double acts. In the mid-1980s, when the pukka stockbroker stood stubbornly aside from the wave of mergers reshaping the surrounding landscape, many were inclined to write it off as a force in the City. Today, as old rivals such as Hoare Govett have been eclipsed, it looks stronger than ever. Forbes, whose beat was corporate finance, and Kemp-Welch, the broker of the pair, depart after 14 years atop a company that boasts more than 40 of the FT-SE 100 companies among its clients. 'We could have gone on for a few more years, but it really wouldn't have given our successor generation a fair crack of the whip,' explains the ever-correct Kemp-Welch who, at 58, is two years older then Forbes. Step up 49-year-old corporate finance specialist Mark Loveday. At Cazenove a mere 27 years, and godson of former senior partner Antony Hornby, he leapfrogs from seventh place on the letterhead, no mean feat in the status- conscious world of a broking company which to the outsider sometimes looks as if it has been stuck in a time-warp since the 1950s. Two of those further up that all-important letterhead are David Mayhew, head of the company's syndication department, and David Barnett, who runs the secondary market operation. Kemp-Welch seems to think both will work closely with Loveday, forming a virtual triumvirate at the top. Its dominance of the domestic UK corporate broking market may be unquestioned, but is Cazenove in danger of looking a shade anachronistic in a world where more companies are looking to sell shares internationally rather than in just one market? On past experience it would be wrong to write the firm off.</p>

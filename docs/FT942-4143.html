			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Groupe Schneider plans to call in outside auditor Groupe Schneider is to call in an outside auditor to examine its tangled relationship with Belgian and offshore subsidiaries, with a view to clearing its president of fraud and swindling charges, the company said yesterday. Attending his first board meeting since his release on bail from a Brussels prison on Tuesday, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne got the board's 'unanimous support and total confidence' that 'he had always acted in the interests of all shareholders', a company statement said. In an interview with Le Monde newspaper yesterday, Mr Pineau-Valencienne said that with the board renewing its confidence in him, he was resuming his functions as president and would be able to tell shareholders at next Thursday's annual general meeting that the group was in good shape. Expounding at length in the interview on his innocence of the charges levelled at him by the Belgian judge, Mr Jean-Claude Van Espen, Mr Pineau-Valencienne claimed that Schneider 'has never received, directly or indirectly, any money from offshore subsidaries, other than through the Belgian companies of Cofibel and Cofimines'. Minority shareholders in those two companies had complained that Schneider had cut them out of dividends due from Swiss and Panamian subsidaries, a charge central to the Belgian investigation. For the first time, Mr Pineau-Valencienne spoke publicly of the complicated arrangements that the Belgian part of Schneider had put in place to manage Zairean mining interests, involving a Swiss trust managing the Panamian companies of Mitraco and Tramico. But he said their net worth was virtually nil by this year, when they were apparently sold for a symbolic one franc. He admitted that Scheider had made a mistake in investing in a company called PB Finance, whose activities are the object of a separate investigation by Judge Van Espen. But this investment had been made by the late Mr Jean Verdoot, to whom Mr Pineau-Valencienne said he had left the running of Schneider's Belgian interests after 1985. The Schneider president protested at the way he had been initially questioned almost continuously from 10am on May 26 until 5am the following day, only then to be told that he was to be held in prison. This, he said, was 'neither necessary or justified'.</p>

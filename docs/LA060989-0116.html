			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET MIG-29 CRASHES AT PARIS AIR SHOW  </P> <P> As several thousand aviation specialists looked on, an advanced Soviet MIG-29  combat aircraft crashed in flames on a grassy apron of Le Bourget Airport  during the opening Thursday of the Paris Air Show.  </P> <P> The Soviet pilot, who had thrilled the crowd with a complicated series of  high-performance maneuvers just before the crash, managed to eject only seconds  before the plane slammed nose-first into the ground.  </P> <P> Although videotapes of the crash showed that his parachute had only partially  opened, Soviet officials said pilot Anatoly Kvotchur, 37, was in "more or less  satisfactory condition."  </P> <P> No immediate cause was given for the crash.  </P> <P> Air show spokesman Patrick Guerin said the plane seemed to have "a mechanical  problem with the left engine." He said the afterburner of the left engine  failed to fire during a low-speed turn at about 1,000 feet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 38th Air Show  </P> <P> The crash was a spectacular start for the 38th Paris Air Show, a huge biennial  event attended this year by more than 140,000 aviation industry representatives  from 34 countries.  </P> <P> The MIG-29, first shown in the West last September at the Farnborough Air Show  in England, was one of the star attractions offered by the largest Soviet  delegations ever to attend the air show. The Soviet air force has about 450 of  the combat aircraft in service, and it has been sold to East Germany, North  Korea, India, Syria, Yugoslavia and Poland, according to the respected  reference book "Jane's All the World's Aircraft" and other sources.  </P> <P> U.S. officials were miffed last month when Turkish authorities returned a  MIG-29 flown to Turkey by a defecting pilot without letting them have a chance  to examine the aircraft.  </P> <P> The accident Thursday occurred just as Soviet officials were holding a press  conference in the cavernous cargo hold of an Antonov 225, the world's largest  aircraft. The Antonov carried on its back the Soviet space shuttle Buran. Both  aircraft were making their first appearance in the West.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prime Trade Fair  </P> <P> The Paris show alternates with Farnborough as the industry's prime trade fair  at which buyers can compare weaponry and shop for new airplanes. About 350,000  visitors are expected to attend this year's show, jamming hotels and filling  restaurants with aviation engineers, aircraft salesmen and military officers.  </P> <P> The main American attraction this year is the Lockheed SR-71 "Blackbird"  reconnaissance airplane, making its first public appearance outside the United  States. The Mach-3 aircraft, first delivered to the U.S. Air Force in 1966, has  rarely been photographed. This year, however, the veil has been lifted and the  svelte, dark-green, spy plane stood naked to cameras on the tarmac of Le  Bourget.  </P> <P> Because the show occurs this year on the 20th anniversary of the first American  moon landing, several former astronauts, including Neil Armstrong, the first  person to set foot on the moon, are present and met with French President  Francois Mitterrand during the opening ceremonies.  </P> <P> The Paris Air Show has been the scene for a number of serious accidents over  the years, including the 1973 crash of a supersonic Soviet Tupolev 144 that  killed 13 people. American B-58 "Hustler" bombers crashed here in 1961 and  again in 1965, each time killing the three-man crew.  </P> <P> In 1969, an American Fairchild Hiller 1000 helicopter exploded and crashed,  killing the pilot. In 1977, a twin-engine Fairchild A-10 crashed after  performing a low-altitude acrobatic loop, also killing the pilot.  </P> <P> One of the worst air show accidents, however, happened last Aug. 28, at  Ramstein Air Base in West Germany. Seventy people died after three jets of an  Italian Air Force aerobatics team collided and one jet plowed into spectators.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ACCIDENT MARS AIR SHOW OPENING  </P> <P> Soviet fighter  </P> <P> Length: 56 ft. 5 in.  </P> <P> Wingspan 37 ft. 8 3/4 in.  </P> <P> Engines: Two Tumansky R-33D turbofans.  </P> <P> Top speed: 1,450 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Radius: 715 miles  </P> <P> Capacity: Pilot only  </P> <P> Armaments: Six air-to-air missiles and bombs  </P> <P> Source: "Jane's All The World's Aircraft"  </P></p>

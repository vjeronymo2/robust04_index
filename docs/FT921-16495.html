			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Whenever on Sundays THE DECISION by some supermarket chains to open their larger stores on this and subsequent Sundays into the new year presents the British government with an awkward dilemma. Widespread Sunday opening of shops flourished in the run-up to Christmas, contravening the Shops Act 1950 which makes it a criminal offence to sell most non-perishable goods on Sunday in England and Wales. Ministers hoped that that this law-breaking would die away at the end of the festive season, allowing them to shelve the divisive issue of reforming the shop hours legislation until after the general election. Those hopes have now been dashed, however, and the government must act to avoid condoning illegal behaviour by the large store groups. The preferred option must be to decriminalise Sunday trading - as has already happened in Scotland without damage to the social fabric. There are more important tasks for the courts than enforcing laws which permit the sale of pornography on the Sabbath yet threaten a Pounds 1,000 fine for anyone who sells a Bible. The most immediate argument in favour of repealing the law on Sunday trading is one of convenience for the customer. Most adults now work from Monday to Friday, yet they are compelled to join a scrummage on Saturdays to procure the staff of life. Shops should be free to open on the days of the week which are most convenient for customers. Lower prices That Saturday scrummage indicates a second benefit from seven-day trading: more efficient use of capital in retailing. If all shops opened on Sunday, the short-term effect of opening for an extra day would be higher costs. But in the longer term, spreading the shopping currently done in six days over seven will require fewer shops. If retail space is reduced, this should mean lower prices. Nor can it be assumed that the sole effect of Sunday trading will be to time-shift the current volume of shopping. Record shops and DIY superstores have long known that opening on Sunday brings in customers who will find something else to spend their money on if they cannot go shopping. While the arguments are strong in favour of legalising Sunday trading, this cannot be achieved simply by turning a blind eye to flagrant law-breaking. The current confusion arises from doubts over the validity of the Shops Act 1950 following a series of judgments by the European Court. The Act appears to conflict with article 30 of the Treaty of Rome which covers free trade within the EC, and Britain's Law Lords have sought clarification from the Court on the complicated rulings. But until clarification is given, Sunday trading remains illegal. 'Bizarre' legislation Those retailers who have exploited the confusion to flout the law deserve opprobrium. But it is the government which must enforce or reform legislation which the prime minister has described as 'bizarre'. If the government wants to retain the law, it should ensure that it is obeyed - and fines which are too low to deter should be raised. Instead, the buck has been passed to the local authorities which dare not seek injunctions to stop Sunday opening for fear that they will have to pay compensation for loss of earnings. Much better for the law to be repealed, perhaps with safeguards for those who work in shops. But it is unrealistic to hope - as ministers do - that a compromise can be found acceptable to supporters and opponents of Sunday trading. The government fears that reform would suffer the fate of an earlier attempt to liberalise shop hours, which was wrecked in 1986 by an alliance of sabbatarians and the shop workers' unions. But a quick bill could be passed through parliament before the special interest groups had set their word processors to work. And with the imminent election as an additional weapon in the whips' armoury, it should be easier to deter backbench rebellion. What cannot be allowed is for the present confusion over the law - and the law-breaking which goes with it - to continue.</p>

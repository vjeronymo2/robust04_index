			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow lurches downward with program selling Wall Street Blue chip stocks lurched downward yesterday afternoon after limping through an uneventful morning, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 14.47 lower at 3,837.13, after program selling sent the index reeling in the final half-hour. But the broader range of stocks held steadier, however. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended with a slender 0.19 loss at 461.27. Volume on the Big Board was a fairly heave 302m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up 0.14 at 454.91 while the Nasdaq composite was off 0.27 to 760.44. Investors spent the morning licking their wounds after the battering inflicted on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow industrial index, which had plummeted 86 points over the two days, crawled within a few points of its starting level for most of the session. The focus remained on monetary policy, with investors still trying to guess whether the Federal Reserve would lift interest rates next week or wait until after the November elections. News of a modest decline in initial claims for unemployment benefit was not very helpful in this regard, nor was congressional testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chair man. The central banker shed no further light on the policy outlook. Bonds were not much help either, though the benchmark 30-year issue managed to appreciate a little. Left to their own devices, most stocks meandered without direction until a computer-driven wave of selling left the blue chip index with a third big loss in a row. Among individual issues, NovaCare topped the NYSE's most active list, plunging Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 11 1/4 in heavy volume of 4.3m shares. JP Morgan downgraded the issue as the company, a provider of rehabilitative medical and social services, issued a profits warning. Borden added a scant Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 14 1/8 as its board considered an offer to buy up to 90 per cent of the company's shares for Dollars 16 to Dollars 18 each. The plan was presented by Mr Paul Kazarian, a former Sunbeam-Oster chairman, as an alternative to a takeover proposal from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. On the Nasdaq, shares in Lotus Development were trading briskly a day after concerns emerged over the software developer's European sales. The issue skidded a further Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 37 1/4 . Canada Toronto stocks were mixed in direction-less trading, as investors crowded the sidelines ahead of next week's meeting of the US Federal Reserve. The TSE 300 composite index added 4.03 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 4,362.65, but declining issues outnumbered advances issues 380 to 340. Volume was 56.81m shares down from Wednesday's 62.22m and trading value fell to CDollars 736.3m compared with CDollars 976.8m. Gold stocks continue to be bid higher, with the index closing 1.8 per cent higher today. Brazil Sao Paulo prices ended up 0.97 per cent in an extremely volatile session dominated by rumours about Brazil's presidential election polls. The Bovespa index of the 55 most-active shares ended up 516 at 53,952 points.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: Investments in energy Sir, David Porter (Letters, August 5) and I J Blakey (Letters, August 7), from both sides of the energy argument appear to be overlooking the fact that the Pounds 1.26bn subsidy paid to Nuclear Electric is intended to outlast the needs of the nuclear industry. It is part of the Non-Fossil Fuels Obligation, introduced to subsidise energy sources other than coal and oil to maintain diversity. If we are to move away from the burning of pollutants such as gas, coal, oil and orimulsion, we shall have to invest in building the structures, such as wave and offshore wind power stations along with tidal barrages, that will ensure all our energy futures. That must mean a continued payment of at least 11 per cent of electricity bills until the capital investment has been amortised. It may be some consolation to recognise that without diversity we would be dependent on world prices of finite fuels which are bound to increase as demand grows, resources diminish and a captive market competes for supplies. As to nuclear power, the French have shown that even with extensive development and serial production, it needs continued government subsidy.

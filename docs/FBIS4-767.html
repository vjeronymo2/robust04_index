			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Merton] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] commissioners are paid R25,000 [rand] a month,  in keeping with the Transitional Executive Council's principle  of "no gain, no loss", IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler  said on Thursday [14 April]. Speaking at a press briefing, he  said those seconded to the commission were paid by their regular  employers who could claim the salaries back from the commission.  However, some employers had volunteered to bear the costs of  seconded commissioners' salaries.    The two IEC advocates were paid a salary in line which what  they would have received in private practice, he added. American  commissioner Ms gaye McDougal was getting a salary equal to the  one she was paid in the United States, with an additional  subsistance allowance, he said.    Commissioners could also receive non-executive director's  fees. Nobody was entitled to benefits such as pension, medical  aid or leave pay, Mr Justice Kriegler said.    The IEC employs 16 commissioners, 11 from South Africa and  five from abroad.    IEC finance sub-committee convenor Rosil Jager said the  commission's preliminary budget was more than R696.5  million."The logistics of the elections are an enormous task,"  she said.    "The scope of our operations has been changed by external  circumstance," she added, referring to contingencies such as the  double ballot system. Mrs Jager said staff levels has also been  problematic. The commission had increased its staff from 200 to  about 200,000 within a very short time.    A source said the IEC was not yet certain how long it would  be in existence after the elections, but would cut its staff  back radically from April 29.    The greatest proportion of the budget, R375.8 million, was  allocated to election administration, which included salaries,  printing costs and building rentals.    IEC financial director Nonesi Ndungane said nearly R163.5  million was allocated to election monitoring. This would cover,  among others, monitors' salaries and transport. It was "the  price of the legitimacy of the elections", she said.    The commission's adjudication directorate received nearly  R29.5 million, most of which was used to pay legal staff. The  IEC's office received R5.5 million, the communication  directorate R29.5 million and voter education about R26.7  million.    Mrs Ndungane said the IEC would honour any liabilities  incurred when it cancelled April hotel bookings countrywide, but  the World Trade Centre rental dispute was a matter for the  public works department.    A Public Works Department spokesman recently refused to  comment on the issue, saying "legal representatives were looking  into the matter".    The IEC budget was approved by both the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC] and the State Finance Department. It  will be audited by the auditor-general.    Mr Justice Kriegler also announced the TEC had approved a  doubling of the election fund, to R44 million. He was hopeful  the increase would soon be approved by the state Finance  Department. This meant political parties qualifying for  assistance because they had collected sufficient signatures  could receive what he called a second dividend. The fund was set  up to help political parties finance their campaigns.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Belgium will take the necessary  measures to protect its nationals in Rwanda. [passage omitted]  We have just spoken to Deputy Prime Minister Elio di Rupo:    [Begin recording] [Di Rupo] First of all, I would like to  say  that we are more than indignant: We are shocked by what  happened, and our thoughts go to the families. [passage  omitted] Concerning concrete action, there are two types of  action. First of all, in the name of the government, the prime  minister and the foreign minister have asked the UN secretary  general to reinforce the security of our peacekeeping forces on  the ground. The secretary general has indicated that this  request will be answered with action. Secondly, we have taken  the necessary measures to guarantee the security of our  nationals on the ground. For all those who are concerned, a  crisis center has been opened, and there is a telephone number  which is 02-5014000.    [Unidentified correspondent] What do you mean exactly by  reinforcing the security of the blue helmets? Does this mean  that the nature of their mission will change, or will they be  receiving reinforcements?    [Di Rupo] I could of course answer this question, but please  understand that if our official statements are rather vague, it  is because we want to keep all the opportunities on our side to  ensure that our action can be as effective as possible, and  especially to ensure that we do not further endanger the lives  of our nationals. [end recording]    [Announcer] The situation of our expatriates, who our holed  up at home, seems increasingly precarious. According to a  number of eyewitness reports from Kigali, there have been  casualties among the foreign community in Kigali, in particular  among those with a Rwandan husband or wife.

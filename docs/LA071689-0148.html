			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BENNETT PITCHES ENCINO-CRESPI TO LEGION WIN  </P> <P> Encino-Crespi Coach Scott Muckey was casually engaged in postgame conversation  Saturday when his ace pitcher, side-arming right-hander Dan Carroll, wandered  by wearing shower clogs and mumbled something unintelligible.  </P> <P> "What was he talking about?" Muckey asked a pair of bystanders.  </P> <P> "Couldn't tell," they answered in unison.  </P> <P> "Damn side-armers," said a grinning Muckey, who is also the baseball coach at  Crespi High. "They're almost as bad as lefties."  </P> <P> And when you don't have any lefties, side-armers will have to suffice, and  nobody develops them better than Muckey, who used yet another side-arming  convert to beat Woodland Hills East, 6-3, in a District 20 Western Division  game at Taft High.  </P> <P> Encino-Crespi (12-8) and East (13-8) will play again at 5 p.m. today at Valley  College to decide which team will advance to the playoffs as the second-place  team from the Western Division. The second game of Saturday's scheduled  doubleheader was canceled when the umpires left after the opener was completed  and replacements could not be found.  </P> <P> Muckey's latest project at Crespi is right-hander Pat Bennett who, by his own  admission, "wasn't getting it done at all throwing overhand" and was converted  last fall. Bennett (4-2), however, has made definite progress since the switch  and he torpedoed East on eight hits to win for the second time in five days.  </P> <P> "He changed me over last winter," Bennett said of Muckey, who asked Carroll to  throw side-arm two seasons ago. "At the time, he didn't really know where I fit  in. I was doing some catching, playing third base, and as a pitcher, I didn't  have it."  </P> <P> Against East, Bennett had plenty, especially early when he faced only 10  batters in the first three innings. Even when East scored a run in the fourth  to close to within 4-1, Bennett didn't seem to be in serious trouble; the East  rally consisted of an infield single, a ground single up the middle, a bunt  single and a hit batter with the bases loaded.  </P> <P> With the help of two Encino-Crespi errors, East added two runs in the sixth to  cut the lead to 6-3, but Bennett, who will be a senior in the fall, retired the  side in order in the seventh to give his team its fifth win in six games.  </P> <P> Bennett's only jam came in the sixth. After nearly being hit by a pitch,  leadoff batter Glenn Nahmias tripled to left-center, then started jawing at  Bennett after arriving at third base. Thirty seconds later, the jawing stopped  and Nahmias was back in the dugout after being picked off.  </P> <P> As it turned out, East scored two runs in the inning, which finally ended when  Bennett got Rich Shapiro to ground into a 4-6-3 double play, the third of the  game for Encino-Crespi.  </P> <P> Red hot Vic Seper helped give Encino-Crespi a 3-0 lead in the first with a  run-scoring single to right. Seper drove in another run in the third with a  double to left-center to give him 10 hits in as many at-bats. The streak was  halted in the fourth when Seper grounded out with the bases loaded.  </P> <P> After allowing three runs on four hits in the first, right-hander Eric Rothman  (3-3) settled down and allowed only one earned run over the next six innings. A  fielding miscue in the sixth finally did him in.  </P> <P> With the bases loaded and two out, Encino-Crespi's Mark Maurizi lofted a fly  ball to shallow right field. Second baseman Mike Kimelman, center fielder Jason  Shapiro and right fielder Rich Shapiro converged, but Rich Shapiro dropped the  ball for a two-base error. Two runs scored to give Encino-Crespi a 6-1 lead.  </P></p>

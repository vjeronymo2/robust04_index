			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Ji Tao (4764 3447) and Li Botao (2621 3134 </F> 3447): "Foster Lofty Ideals, Study Knowledge, Improve Skills,  and Strive To Become Trans-Century Talented People"]    [Excerpts] The ninth day of December marked the 58th  anniversary of the "9 December" movement. The Beijing Municipal  Students' Federation ceremoniously held its seventh congress on  that date. Chen Xitong, Zhang Jianmin, Li Zhijian, Chen  Guangwen, Jiang Daming, Wang Tong, Ouyang Wenan, Yang Chaoshi,  Tao Xiping, Hu Zhaoguang, Feng Mingwei, Chen Dabai, and Yao Wang  attended the opening ceremony. [passage omitted]    The municipal students' federation now has 900 member units.  In the past four years, 160,000 college and high school  students in Beijing applied to join the party, 14,016 students  joined party organizations, and 2,817 students became national  or municipal three-good students.    Chen Xitong gave a speech at the congress. He said: I  attended the congress of the students' federation four years  ago. Rapid and great changes have taken place in these four  years. I would like to hold a heart-to-heart talk with you  students. I will speak on three questions for your discussion:  1) what is the most lofty and beautiful people's ideal, 2) how  should they turn this ideal into reality, and 3) how should  they work to achieve this ideal.    Chen Xitong said: These are important questions on why  people live. Everyone has his own ideal. In my opinion, rather  than the ideal to make a few people affluent and happy, no ideal  is loftier than the one to let all Chinese people lead affluent  lives. Such a lofty ideal is a communist ideal, and those who  fight for it are good youths. Of course, we should acknowledge  our backwardness, but never should we be resigned to it. Only  those who do down-to-earth work in order to change backwardness  comprise the backbone of China, and youths should embrace only  the idea of changing backwardness as the concept on life. Chen  Xitong also said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics clearly indicates the  road we should take. On the road of building socialism, young  students should acquire knowledge well and master skills. Only  by so doing can they have the strength to work hard. They must  never be "lazy in youth lest they regret in old age."</p>

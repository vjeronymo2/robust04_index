			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Government Fires ENEL Boss"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 29 -- Another top head rolled as  a result of the ongoing Clean Hands anti-corruption enquiries  with a communique Monday evening [28 March] announcing the  firing of 68-year-old Franco Viezzoli as chairman of ENEL  [National Electric Power Board], Italy's national electricity  board.    Viezzoli was one of 33 persons placed in preventive custody  on January 18-19 as part of investigations into contracts for  the power station at Gioia Tauro on Calabria's western coast, in  an area where the presence of 'Ndrangheta and some Mafia  organised crime gangs is heavy.    Other top ENEL executives were also detained in connection  with kickbacks allegedly paid for contracts at the still  unfinished plant. Charges levelled against some of their  co-defendants include Mafia association and ties because most of  the contracts were handed out to alleged Mafia companies.    Monday's communique said the Treasury, Industry and Budget  ministers met at the Treasury on Thursday and decided that  Viezzoli's judicial position was "not compatible" with his  position at the helm of the electricity agency -- now a  joint-stock company with the Treasury as the sole shareholder  and set for a market flotation some time in the not-so-distant  future.    For the near future, current plans see the signing of a  convention with ENEL SPA to regulate its role as heir to old  government agency. This would involve a new licencing  arrangement with the government and would pave the way for  creating a new authority to regulate electricity production.  The door would then be open for the placement of the first  stock, perhaps early next year, although some sources are still  hoping for the end of this year.    The removal of Viezzoli is just one step in this complex  process. Viezzoli entered IRI [Institute for Industrial  Reconstruction] in 1950 with a degree in economics and commerce  and rose to be the public-sector holding company's  director-general in 1964. In July 1976, he became chairman and  managing-director of Finmeccanica, the IRI manufacturing and  engineering arm, picking up a strategy to relaunch it in the  field of advanced technologies by aeronautical agreements  linking up with Boeing and Aerospatiale and energy production  cooperation with Westinghouse and General Electric. At  Finmeccanica, he was also responsible for the much-disputed sale  of Alfa Romeo to Fiat, the first case in which a major  public-sector company was sold off to the private sector.    He became ENEL's chairman in January 1987 and has run it  ever  since, steering what is billed as the world's second-largest  producer of electrical energy through shoals such as tariff  policy and the difficulties of building new power-stations in a  country where environmental feeling is strong enough to have  imposed a moratorium by referendum on the construction of  nuclear power-stations and other forms of power generation also  come under close scrutiny.    In a statement, Viezzoli said he was "obviously available"  to  fall in with whatever the government should see fit as regards  the top posts in the body.</p>

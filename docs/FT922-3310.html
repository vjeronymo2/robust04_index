			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Japan's May trade surplus up 89% on previous year JAPAN'S trade surplus continued to surge in May, rising 89 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 7.9bn (Pounds 4.3bn), and including the largest year-on-year growth in the politically-sensitive US surplus since 1986. The announcement of the surplus, which rose in seasonally adjusted terms from Dollars 6.9bn in April to Dollars 9.7bn in May, follows hard on the release of a controversial report condemning the US and European Community for their unfair trade policies. Japanese government officials indicated yesterday that they expect the rise in the surplus to prompt renewed demands from other leading industrialised nations for a commitment to stimulate the domestic economy. A slowing of domestic demand and stirrings of recovery in foreign markets led to a sharp 13.3 per cent fall in imports to Dollars 17.6bn and a 4.1 per cent rise in exports to Dollars 25.5bn. The 51 per cent increase on the year-earlier surplus was the largest since March 1986. The decline in imports reflected weaker industrial demand for raw materials and a slowing of consumer purchases of luxury goods. Exports to the US rose 3.3 per cent to Dollars 7bn and imports from there were down 16 per cent at Dollars 4.1bn, with the largest falls in imports of raw materials, chemicals, metals and semiconductor equipment. The country's trade with China continues to expand rapidly, with exports up 21.8 per cent and imports from China 12.6 per cent higher. The finance ministry, which has consistently blamed the surging surplus on 'special factors', conceded yesterday that the slowing of the domestic economy had blunted demand for imports, while external demand for Japanese goods remained strong. For example, car exports were 10.4 per cent higher, car components, most destined for Japanese-run plants, were up 10.3 per cent, semiconductor equipment showed a 10.7 per cent rise, in sharp contrast to the 18.4 per cent fall in imports in semiconductor parts. Stefan Wagstyl adds: A controversial bill to allow Japanese troops to serve on United Nations peace-keeping missions yesterday completed another stage of its turbulent passage through the Diet. Amid protests from opposition parties, it was approved by a committee of the Diet's lower house and referred to a full session of the chamber which will be held today. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party hopes to take a vote as early as today but the opposition social democratic and communist parties have pledged to delay proceedings through filibustering.</p>

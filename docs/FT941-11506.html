			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Finland split on choice of president The two candidates in Sunday's run-off election for the Finnish presidency - Mrs Elizabeth Rehn and Mr Martti Ahtisaari - are running neck-and-neck, according to an opinion poll published yesterday. A Gallup poll in the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat gave Mr Ahtisaari, a senior United Nations diplomat running for the opposition Social Democratic party, a slight edge for the first time since he won the first round of voting last month. The poll gave him 51 per cent against 49 per cent for Mrs Rehn, the right-of-centre defence minister. But the poll result was well within the 3 per cent margin for error and was weighted against the small Swedish-speaking minority to which Mrs Rehn belongs and which overwhelmingly supports her. A television poll on Wednesday also showed Mrs Rehn just ahead by 50.5 per cent to 49.5 per cent. Nevertheless, the polls appeared to confirm a trend of resurgent support for Mr Ahtisaari, who quickly fell behind in the polls after the first round of voting. Both candidates are strong supporters of Finland's application to join the European Union and have pledged to safeguard neutral Finland's security - related issues given added potency recently by the rise of nationalist forces in neighbouring Russia. But Mr Ahtisaari has criticised the government's economic policies, calling for more state action to combat unemployment, affecting 20 per cent of the workforce. His approach seems to have chipped away at the support for Mrs Rehn, whose candidacy has been the big surprise of the election campaign. As recently as December she was written off as a marginal outsider, largely because she represents the Swedish-speaking minority which accounts for only 6 per cent of the population. But many voters seeking a new style of leadership after three years of deep recession responded to her appeal as a plain-speaking woman with no obligations to the main political parties.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridnyova] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 20 April TASS -- The Tajik opposition is  preparing new provocations on the Tajik-Afghan border to  destabilise the situation in the region and foil the second  round of inter-Tajik talks due to take place either in Tehran or  Islamabad, competent sources in Dushanbe told ITAR-TASS.    The sources said that Tajik opposition forces based in the  Afghan provinces of Kunduz and Takhar are planning a series of  attacks on Russian border outposts and Tajik border villages.  There is also information indicating their intention to mine  one of the sections of the Tajik-Afghan border patrolled by the  Pyanj border troop unit. Mobile terrorist groups have been  concentrated near the Imam Sahib Province, and weapons and  military machinery are being brought in.    The sources claimed they had proof that the go-ahead to  proceed with acts of terrorism was given by the government in  exile led by Tajik national Sa'id Abdullo Nuri. The acts will  be carried out by field commanders from the so-called  Kumsangir-Pyanj resistance front.    The sources said all these activities are taking place in  the  districts controlled by the Afghan military whose leaders have  repeatedly confirmed their readiness to help stabilise the  situation on the Tajik-Afghan border and prevent provocations.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: L.A. GUNS "COCKED AND LOADED." VERTIGO/POLYGRAM ***: ALBUMS ARE  RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC) STARS.  </P> <P> The sassy title of L.A. Guns' second album tells you exactly what you're going  to get: a blast of hard rock, filled with broad references to girls, sex and  over-the-edge night life. The L.A.-based quintet's blatant disregard for  subtlety works, as long as you don't think too deeply. On songs like "Sleazy  Come, Easy Go" and "Showdown (Riot on Sunset)," the band sports an enthusiasm  for rock 'n' roll cliches that's either infectious or annoying, depending what  side of the generation gap you inhabit. However, the band does take a few  interesting turns -- "Magdalaine" burns with a '60s mysticism that hasn't been  heard for a while, and "Give a Little" is a delicious blend of Aerosmith and  Rose Tattoo. Although most of "Cocked and Loaded" is shallow and obvious  entertainment, that's all you need to get your body moving and your fist  pumping. JANISS GARZA  </P></p>

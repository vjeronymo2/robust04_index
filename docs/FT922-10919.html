			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Finance ministers appeal for swift trade liberalisation deal FINANCE ministers from industrial and developing countries yesterday issued an urgent call for a swift agreement to liberalise world trade. Meeting in the interim committee of the International Monetary Fund - the Washington-based organisation's principal policy-making body - the finance ministers said a rapid conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) was essential to restore dynamism to world trade and would contribute to economic recovery. 'All countries stand to benefit from the round, and would suffer from a failure,' the committee said in a communique. 'The success of the negotiations is a must.' Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's finance minister and the chairman of the committee, said it was not easy to negotiate in an election year, but expressed disappointment over the Gatt deadlock. 'It must be said that responsibility is not shared equally among the different members of Gatt. It lies mainly on the US and the European Community,' he said. Mr Solchaga said the failure to reach a new agreement put the IMF in the difficult position of asking developing countries to adopt 'perfectionist' economic policies and open up their own markets, while the industrial countries kept protectionist barriers to their goods. 'I feel that this situation isn't a very comfortable one,' he declared. In other comments the interim committee communique: Called for appropriate monetary and fiscal policies to assure recovery and sustainable growth, coupled with measures to eliminate unproductive spending and reduce public sector deficits. Welcomed signs of a stronger economic performance by developing countries and urged continued financial support for low-income nations from the IMF's enhanced structural adjustment facility. Praised the efforts of the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to reform their economies. Expressed its concern that the IMF's quota increase had not yet come into effect, and asked all members which had not agreed to the increase to do so 'as a matter of urgency'. This is not the first time the committee has issued a call for a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. But Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, last week acknowledged that such calls had little effect. 'One of the deficiencies, if there are any, of the interim committee is that you have there assembled distinguished ministers of finance but their trade colleagues are, well, out to lunch in their capitals.'</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED SOX MAKE IT EASY FOR CLEMENS;  </P> <P> ANGELS: BOSTON POUNDS OUT 17 HITS AS ERA LEADER WINS HIS 16TH GAME, 14-3.  </P> <P> In scoring two earned runs off Roger Clemens, the Angels accomplished just  about what most teams have done against the Boston right-hander this season. In  losing to him, they also kept up the trend.  </P> <P> Clemens, who had allowed only one earned run in his previous three games, was  charged with two runs Thursday, but that did little to jeopardize either his  bid for the American League earned-run average title or the Red Sox's bid to  increase their AL East lead to two games over Toronto. Clemens lasted 6 2/3  innings and left behind three runners -- two of whom scored -- but his  teammates' offensive support secured a 14-3 rout of the Angels.  </P> <P> Although his ERA rose .02 to 2.16, Clemens (16-5) struck out six to increase  his league-leading strikeout total to 164. He is second in wins to Oakland's  Bob Welch, who has 18.  </P> <P> Mike Greenwell drove in three runs with a two-run home run -- the first off Jim  Abbott by a left-handed hitter this season -- and a sacrifice fly. Ellis Burks  also drove in three to lead Boston's 17-hit attack against Abbott (7-10), Mark  Eichhorn and Cliff Young and give the Red Sox their eighth victory in 10 games.  Abbott allowed seven earned runs in six innings and has yet to win back-to-back  decisions this season. He is 1-6 at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> Jody Reed, Carlos Quintana and Wade Boggs, the first, second and third hitters  in Boston's lineup, ranked fifth, sixth and seventh in the AL batting race  before the game. All three improved their averages in the early innings  Thursday, as the Red Sox scored three times in the first and three more in the  third to take a commanding 6-0 lead.  </P> <P> Carlos Quintana, who has hit in 15 of 16 games, singled up the middle with one  out to begin the first-inning uprising. He went to second when Boggs singled to  left, extending his hitting streak to 12 games. Quintana and Boggs scored when  Burks, who took a .303 average into the game and was a few points out of the  top 10, lined a triple into the right-field corner. Burks scored when Luis  Polonia made a poor throw home on Greenwell's fly to shallow left.  </P> <P> That lead ballooned to 6-0 in the third. Reed touched things off with a single  to left. He took second on Quintana's single to center and went to third when  Boggs forced Quintana at second. Burks followed with a grounder to third, which  Rick Schu turned into a force on Boggs at second. Reed scored on the play.  </P> <P> Greenwell followed with his sixth home run of the season, hitting Abbott's  first pitch over the fence in right-center.  </P> <P> Clemens limited the Angels to two hits over four innings, the first being a  single to left by Chili Davis in Davis' first at-bat since being activated off  the disabled list. Davis, who had a lower back strain, last played on July 13.  </P> <P> Through five innings, Clemens had allowed three singles and had not permitted  the Angels to get a runner into scoring position. He had recorded five  strikeouts, getting Polonia twice and Lee Stevens, Dick Schofield and Max  Venable once each, and had not issued a walk.  </P> <P> Abbott had an easier time getting through the middle innings, holding Boston to  one walk and one hit through the fourth, fifth and sixth. But the Angels were  unable to make a dent in the Red Sox's big lead.  </P> <P> Clemens showed some vulnerability in the sixth, when the Angels put runners on  first and third with one out. Polonia led off with a grounder to deep short, so  sure a hit that shortstop Tim Naehring didn't bother throwing. After a  strikeout of Johnny Ray, Davis singled to left, moving Polonia to third.  </P> <P> Winfield, who entered the game with a .368 career average against Clemens,  flied to right, but the ball was too shallow for Polonia to risk tagging and  trying to score. Stevens couldn't get a run in, either, lofting a fly ball  caught on the run by Greenwell.  </P> <P> After yielding a leadoff double to Tony Pena in the seventh, Abbott was  relieved by Mark Eichhorn. Pena moved to third on a grounder by Reed and scored  on Quintana's third hit of the night, a single to right. The Red Sox broke it  open with five more in the eighth.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Conditioning coach Jimmie Reese, who underwent two angioplasty procedures after  experiencing heart problems earlier this season, continues to recover at his  Westwood home. It was initially hoped that the 85-year-old Reese, renowned for  his fungo hitting, would be back in uniform after the All-Star break but his  doctors have cautioned him against that exertion. He might visit Anaheim  Stadium next week as a spectator for the first time since his illness.  </P> <P> Chili Davis was activated off the disabled list and was in Thursday's lineup.  To make room on the roster, pitcher Joe Grahe was optioned to Triple A  Edmonton. Davis was placed on the DL on July 17 (retroactive to July 14)  because of a lower back strain.  </P> <P> Brian Downing was scratched from Thursday's lineup shortly before the game  because of a slightly strained right hamstring, an injury he suffered while  running to first base in the 11th inning of the Angels' 8-6 victory over Boston  Wednesday. Davis, who was originally to play left field, became the DH, Luis  Polonia moved from center field to left and Max Venable was inserted in center  field. . . . Bob McClure pronounced himself ready to pitch after throwing on  consecutive days without pain or stiffness. During his recovery from elbow  problems, he has added a forkball to his repertoire. "It's not like (Chuck)  Finley's or (Bryan) Harvey's," he said. "Theirs drop. Mine is more like a  screwball."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE OIL SPILLOVER EFFECT;  </P> <P> KEY CRUDE PRICES AT THEIR HIGHEST SINCE '87, BUT SURGE MAY BE SHORT-LIVED  </P> <P> The Alaskan oil spill sent shock waves through energy markets Monday, with  crude oil prices surging to their highest level in 19 months.  </P> <P> But the increases -- which stirred up an already ebullient oil market -- may be  short-lived if the Alaskan port of Valdez reopens this week and Alaskan oil  resumes its flow to the United States, analysts said.  </P> <P> "Today, especially in the futures market, you had a knee-jerk reaction," said  Dennis K. Winters, an economist with Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.  Winters said the longevity of the price rise will depend on "how quickly they  can restore delivery" of the Alaskan oil.  </P> <P> An often-used barometer of energy prices -- West Texas Intermediate -- shot up  38 cents to $20.53 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market  Monday, the highest closing price since August, 1987. Earlier in the day it  peaked at $20.95.  </P> <P> In addition, the most widely traded international crude -- North Sea Brent  Blend -- rose above $19 a barrel for the first time since October, 1987. Also,  unleaded gasoline for April delivery closed up 1.73 cents at 59.75 cents a  gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, an official at Chevron Corp. said the disruption was in effect  small change, barring unexpected delays.  </P> <P> "If you lose all the money you've got in your pocket right now you'll be  unhappy -- but it's not a big amount compared to your annual income, and that's  the situation here," said Thomas G. Burns, manager of Chevron's economics  staff.  </P> <P> The price surge was triggered by an accident late last week, when an Exxon  Corp. tanker spilled an estimated 10.1 million gallons of crude oil into Prince  William Sound in Alaska.  </P> <P> The spill forced the closing of Valdez, where freighters pick up oil from the  Alaska Pipeline and haul it to the rest of the United States, principally the  West and Gulf coasts. Despite expectations that the oil spigot would soon be  turned back on, analysts were following developments in Valdez closely.  </P> <P> The Alaskan Pipeline provides one quarter of domestic U.S. oil production, or  1.8 million barrels of oil per day. Of this amount, 1.2 million barrels go to  the West Coast and the remainder is consumed by states along the Gulf of  Mexico, according to DRI.  </P> <P> Moreover, Alaskan petroleum accounts for 40% of oil consumed in California,  said Dennis J. Eoff, senior energy specialist with the California Energy  Commission in Sacramento.  </P> <P> A sustained interruption would have serious ripple effects, pushing up prices  in other oil markets, and likely forcing California to use more distant oil  sources, such as Singapore, to supply its motorists. Such a move could cost  four to six cents per gallon in added transportation costs, Eoff said.  </P> <P> Thus, said Chevron's Burns, "if Alaska is going to be shut down for an extended  period of time, it's a different ballgame entirely."  </P> <P> Even if Alaska reopens soon, however, it remains that energy prices have risen  dramatically in recent months.  </P> <P> The pressures on energy prices have included brisk demand by robust economies  in the United States and Asia, production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries and production accidents.  </P> <P> For instance, difficulties in the North Sea, including a platform explosion  last year, have kept hundreds of thousands of gallons a day off the world oil  market. Global demand for oil is estimated at 65 million barrels a day.  </P> <P> These factors have combined to push up crude oil prices more than 50% since  last November, not even counting the Alaska problems.  </P> <P> "For the last several months it just seems like we've been having a run of bad  luck with supplies and that's been part of what's pushing prices up," said  Morris Greenberg, an oil price forecaster with the WEFA Group, economic  consultants in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.  </P> <P> Analysts on Monday were predicting that luck for energy consumers might change  for the better before the year is over.  </P> <P> "I know a lot of people are saying that prices are going to move higher, but  frankly it's a little hard to see how they can keep going farther up,"  Greenberg said.  </P> <P> In the case of new, unforeseen problems, at least one expert suggested that  OPEC, eager to regain its market share, might play a constructive role.  </P> <P> "My guess is they (OPEC) would tend to increase production rather than stand by  and watch the price skyrocket," Burns said.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES: Part I  </P></p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Republicans ponder Clinton plan: Little resistance to economic proposals among divided opposition on Capitol Hill PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday was due to hold hours of meetings with his Republican opponents on Capitol Hill. Given the extent to which they have attacked his economic plan for raising taxes too much and cutting spending too little, the visit might seem a foolhardy running of the gauntlet. However, the Republicans have had so little success in agreeing on a strategy to counter the Clinton plan that the president seemed likely to emerge unscathed. Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate, said he and his colleagues had no plans to insult or criticise the president, but were reluctant to offer specific proposals for amending Mr Clinton's plan unless they received some assurance that they would be considered seriously. 'If we come up with some alternatives, will he seriously negotiate those, or are we just playing games?' Mr Dole asked yesterday morning. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, responded that Mr Clinton would be more than happy to entertain specific ideas from the Republicans for spending cuts. 'There's obviously some philosophical disagreement between the president and the Republican leaders. That doesn't mean he is not willing to listen to their specific suggestions to add additional spending cuts or make the plan better,' she said. The White House has so far concentrated on ensuring a reasonable degree of party loyalty among Mr Clinton's Democratic supporters, who hold majorities in both the House and the Senate. This is likely to be enough, at least to secure an early budget resolution containing the broad outlines of Mr Clinton's plan. Mr Robert Michel, the Republican leader in the House, concedes that he will probably not be able to win over enough Democrats to block passage. But when Congress starts to consider the plan in detail this summer, Mr Clinton may need Republican votes to counter Democratic defections, particularly to ensure the survival of cuts in agricultural subsidies that are popular with many rural congressmen. The Republicans, however, remain deeply split over how to react to the Clinton plan. This split is partly over tactics, between those who believe that their job is to ensure that the Clinton plan passes in a form that is as unobjectionable as possible, and those who argue that the task of the opposition is to oppose. But it is also over ideology -between the traditional deficit hawks, who want to concentrate on proposing deeper spending cuts than Mr Clinton has included, and the supply side idealists, who insist that cutting taxes is the only answer. If they cannot come up with a persuasive response, they could be outflanked by public support for Mr Clinton's proposals, which have won the approval of 59 per cent of those questioned last week for a Washington Post-ABC News poll. Most of those questioned said the Clinton plan would hurt them personally, but 62 per cent believed, nevertheless, that it would help the economy. And although more than two thirds felt Mr Clinton was not doing enough to cut the deficit or reduce government spending, a majority also wanted him to go further in taxing the rich and stimulating the economy.</p>

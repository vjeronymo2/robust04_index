			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGIC IS THERE AT THE FINISH;  </P> <P> LAKERS: JOHNSON'S TRIPLE-DOUBLE PIVOTAL AGAINST ROCKETS, WHO ARE HANDICAPPED BY  OLAJUWON'S FOUL TROUBLE.  </P> <P> His enforced idleness on the bench finally over, Akeem Olajuwon rejoined Friday  night's game with the Lakers leading his Houston Rockets by five points. The  only problem was that only 5:17 remained and Olajuwon's next foul meant  expulsion.  </P> <P> Under those rigid circumstances, not even a center as dominant as Olajuwon  could overcome the deficit. At least, not on a night when Magic Johnson seemed  intent on a victory.  </P> <P> The Lakers, taking advantage of Olajuwon's foul trouble and letting Johnson  handle matters upon Olajuwon's much-anticipated return, recorded a 107-98  victory over Houston and improved their home record to 16-1 before 17,505 fans  at the Forum.  </P> <P> Although Olajuwon's absence for all but about 10 minutes in the second half  clearly was the critical development, Johnson certainly made his presence felt.  </P> <P> The Laker guard, overcoming a poor first half that plagued many of his  teammates, finished with 31 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. It was his  fifth triple-double of the season and the 117th of his career.  </P> <P> Johnson, in the words of Laker Coach Pat Riley, imposed his will upon the  Rockets after scoring only one basket in the first quarter. Olajuwon,  conversely, had six points and four blocked shots in the first quarter before  he started hearing whistles directed toward him.  </P> <P> The Rocket center, who finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds in 25 minutes,  was called for his fourth foul after only 1:29 elapsed in the third quarter.  Laker forward James Worthy, held to 10 points, was fouled by Olajuwon while  attempting a shot in the lane, although Olajuwon said he thought the ball  slipped from Worthy's grasp without contact.  </P> <P> At that point, Rocket Coach Don Chaney chose to stay with Olajuwon. Olajuwon  had already sat out part of the second quarter with foul trouble, but to that  point the Rockets maintained a six-point halftime lead.  </P> <P> "I thought we could get by leaving him in there," Chaney said. "It was just  going to be for about a minute or so. I thought the call on that (fifth) foul  was kind of chintzy."  </P> <P> Riley, whose team improved its record to 25-8, defended Chaney's decision to  keep Olajuwon in the game after the fourth foul.  </P> <P> "I'd do the same thing," Riley said. "I'd never second-guess. He had the  (replacement) at the scorer's table. To me, really, the responsibility is for  the player not to go out and get the foul in that situation."  </P> <P> Just over three minutes after Olajuwon's fourth foul, his fifth was assessed  when he dipped his left shoulder into Mychal Thompson while attempting a  baseline move. Chaney already had Larry Smith at the scorer's table when the  foul was called.  </P> <P> "No, I didn't," Olajuwon said, asked if he had fouled Thompson. "But it doesn't  matter now. It is too late. I was surprised by that call, especially when you  already have four fouls."  </P> <P> Thompson said he was not surprised.  </P> <P> "He fouled me," Thompson said. "I have the dent in my chest to prove it. Akeem  plays real hard on both ends. If a ref would really call them close, he'd be in  foul trouble more often. But I guess they don't want to do that to superstars."  </P> <P> Chaney, conversely, believes Olajuwon does not receive respect from officials.  </P> <P> "I'd like to see him get more respect from the refs," Chaney said. "Akeem has  had some real cheap fouls called on him."  </P> <P> Added Olajuwon: "Even at home, I don't get the calls, but I'm getting used to  it."  </P> <P> Friday, he left with 7:35 to play in the third quarter and did not return until  5:17 remained in the game. And when Olajuwon went out, the Rockets' chances of  breaking a regular-season Forum losing streak dating to 1985 went with him.  </P> <P> The Lakers, not coincidentally, took their first lead of the second half  immediately after Olajuwon's departure. With the Rockets shooting only 25% in  the quarter, the Lakers built as much as a six-point lead before settling for a  79-76 advantage going into the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Then, while Olajuwon fidgeted on the bench and Chaney went with the 6-foot-8  Smith and little-known Adrian Caldwell, the Lakers built a lead that proved  insurmountable.  </P> <P> The Lakers scored six points in a row to begin the quarter, Orlando Woolridge  starting the run by completing a dunk off a lob from Johnson after only 28  seconds had elapsed.  </P> <P> Chaney inserted Olajuwon with 5:17 left and the Lakers leading, 93-88. Johnson  made it a seven-point advantage by scoring inside, then Olajuwon countered by  scoring a basket on a goaltending call against Vlade Divac with 4:35 to play.  </P> <P> That was the only basket Olajuwon scored, and the Lakers pulled away thanks to  Johnson and a supporting cast that included Woolridge (17 points), Thompson (12  points and 11 rebounds) and Divac (six points, eight rebounds).  </P> <P> But Johnson was the reason the Lakers persevered on a night when they struggled  through a dismal first half. Johnson scored 22 of his 31 points in the second  half, almost single-handedly wresting control from the Rockets.  </P> <P> "The game changed when Earvin went into his 'Buck' attack," Riley said. "That's  when he forgets about all that passing. He put his head down, got aggressive  and challenged them. He imposed his will."  </P></p>

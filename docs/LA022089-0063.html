			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Rock star Jon Bon Jovi told students at a Raleigh, N.C., high school on Friday  not to let peer pressure or parental harassment push them into drug abuse. Bon  Jovi, who lapsed into four-letter words a few times while addressing the 2,500  teen-agers at Broughton High, told them not to ruin their dreams by using  drugs. He also took a potshot at parents who "come home after three or four  martinis" and give their kids grief. The rally was staged by Make a Difference  Foundation, an organization formed by Bon Jovi's manager, Doc McGhee, who  earlier this year pleaded guilty to helping smuggle 18.5 tons of marijuana from  Colombia to North Carolina.

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: US equity investors search for value overseas - The recent trend represents a significant change in investment attitudes Frustrated by sluggish economic growth, low yields and expensive stocks at home, US investors are pouring their money into overseas equity markets in unprecedented amounts. In doing so, they have provided foreign markets with a new source of liquidity, and driven share prices in Europe, Latin America and the Far East to new highs. The flood of US money abroad, however, is about more than a short-term search for higher returns. It reflects the growing sophistication of the once-parochial US investment community which, until recently, was reluctant to risk its money abroad. According to the latest data on overseas investments, net purchases of foreign stocks by US investors in the second quarter of this year were a record Dollars 13.2bn. It was the 20th straight quarter when US investors bought more overseas stocks than they sold, and it took net purchases for the first half of this year to Dollars 21.7bn, almost twice the amount recorded in the first six months of 1992. US holdings of foreign stocks now stand at Dollars 210bn, more than double the total of just two and a half years ago. Most individual investors have bought into foreign markets via mutual funds. In August, for example, 45 per cent of the net Dollars 12.1bn invested in US stock mutual funds went into funds that buy overseas equities. Institutional investors have also been snapping up foreign stocks, including the normally conservative public pension funds, which are being told by investment advisers to drop their usual reluctance to invest abroad and increase the size of their foreign holdings. Fund managers across the US have been amazed at the demand for foreign stocks. Mr Rick Mace, co-manager at Fidelity Global Balanced Fund, describes the recent interest among US investors in foreign stocks as 'phenomenal', and says that it dates back to about a year to 18 months ago. He says: 'Foreign markets are relatively so much more attractive. Comparable companies in foreign markets are trading at lower multiples of earnings, cash flow and book value, than US companies.' US investors are looking for those kind of bargains everywhere. Although the UK, Canada and continental Europe remain the most popular destinations for US money (primarily because falling or low interest rates are expected to stimulate local economies), investors are becoming more adventurous in their search for diversification and value. They have been especially keen on emerging markets in Europe, where the opportunities for investing in newly privatised industries in former Communist countries are growing, and in Latin America and the Far East. Hong Kong, for example, has proved very attractive to US investors. In the second quarter they bought Dollars 1.8bn of Hong Kong equities, almost as much as they invested in the far bigger Japanese market. For many, buying Hong Kong stocks is regarded as a relatively safe way of investing in the future of China, the world's largest country with one of the fastest growing economies. It is no surprise that US investors are rushing overseas when their home market has lagged behind the rest of the world. In Hong Kong, according to the FT-Actuaries World indices, stocks have climbed 56 per cent in dollar terms this year, in Japan 46 per cent, in Italy 28 per cent, in Spain 26 per cent, and in the UK 11 per cent. In contrast, the value of US stocks has risen by 7.5 per cent, the poorest performance of any country other than Mexico. US demand for foreign stocks has acted like a virtuous circle. By boosting prices in many overseas markets, they have lured more US money abroad. 'The better the foreign markets do, the more interest there is in them,' says Mr Mace. Although the recent growth in US investment overseas has been remarkable, there is a concern that it may be short-lived. In particular, some analysts believe a sudden upturn in US interest rates might stem the flow of money overseas, simultaneously by making domestic fixed-income securities more attractive, and by boosting the value of the dollar which would cut into the value of US investors' foreign assets. Among those who believe that US investors' love affair with foreign stocks may prove temporary is Mr Scott Black, a fund manager with Delphi in Boston, who says: 'It's the next gimmick. Everyone always buys into the next gimmick.' He is especially wary of those who have bought into markets they know little about. 'I'm not keen on Hong Kong. It's a crap-shoot. Who knows what it's going to look like in 1997?' Other fund managers, however, argue that growing interest in foreign stocks represents a fundamental change in investors' attitudes to non-US assets. Mr Mace of Fidelity says: 'The definition of overseas versus domestic stocks is going to blur. People want a diversified portfolio, that is diversified not just across one market but across countries.' Mr William Holtzer, a fund manager responsible for global funds at the New York investment group Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, sees the trend towards overseas investment in an even broader context. 'It's not a euphoria we are seeing, but a panic. People are panicking about their retirement income.' Mr Holtzer believes that a new generation of investors, desperate to build a portfolio that will provide enough income for their retirement, is moving into foreign equities in search of higher returns. He also thinks that investors' interest in foreign stocks will prove more resilient than critics think, even if they suffer the occasional setback overseas. 'The first round of international investing (in the early 1980s) was based largely upon growth in the Japanese stock market. Well, that market fell to bits, but it didn't knock the trend off the rails, just slowed it down a bit.'</p>

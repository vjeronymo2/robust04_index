			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWIMMING;  </P> <P> ZIKARSKY REACHES OUT FOR A WIN  </P> <P> The tallest swimmer in history, 6-foot-10 Bjorn Zikarsky of USC, won the  100-yard freestyle race Sunday night as the Trojans won the Grand Prix National  Invitational meet at Belmont Plaza Olympic Pool in Long Beach.  </P> <P> It was the first test against major competition in the United States for  Zikarsky, who came to USC this year from West Germany. He won the 100-yard  final in an NCAA qualifying time of 43.98 seconds, just off the pool record and  personal best of 43.90 he swam in trials earlier in the day.  </P> <P> Zikarsky also anchored the USC relay team, which edged California in the  400-yard freestyle relay.  </P> <P> "Most swimmers think I have an advantage, and that might be true," Zikarsky  said. "I should be a foot ahead after I take off, and it's easier for longer  people to glide. But no one ever says to me, 'You only win because you're that  tall.' "  </P> <P> Dan Jorgensen of USC, who won the mile freestyle Sunday in 15:01.57, was the  meet's top man with 123 points, followed by teammates Ray Looze with 115 and  Dave Wharton with 100.  </P> <P> USC was followed by California, Stanford, Arizona State and UCLA.  </P> <P> Lisa Summers of California was the women's overall winner with 158 points.  Teammate Katie Welch and Stanford's Karen Kraemer tied for second at 141. Cal  won the women's team title, ahead of Stanford, Tennessee, UCLA and USC.  </P> <P> Pool records were set by USC's Tara Shriner in the 200-yard breaststroke  (2:17.42), Terri O'Loughlin of USC in the 200-yard butterfly (2:00.18) and  Stanford's Barb Metz in the mile freestyle (16:23.93).  </P></p>

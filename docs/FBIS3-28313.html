			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa will urge U.S. President Bill Clinton in upcoming  talks to extend U.S. trade privileges for China and support its  early admission to the GATT world trade body, government sources  said Monday [7 February]. Hosokawa, slated to meet Clinton in  Washington on February 11, will point out that improvement in  Sino-U.S. relations will contribute to Asian stability, the  sources said.    The Foreign Ministry expects Beijing to retaliate should  Clinton refuse to renew China's most-favored-nation (MFN)  status, which guarantees Chinese goods low-tariff access to the  U.S. market, the sources said. Clinton has said he will not  extend MFN for China when it comes up for renewal in June,  unless Beijing makes significant efforts to improve the  country's poor human rights record, such as by releasing  political prisoners.    Washington was also not satisfied with the results of talks  between U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Chinese  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Paris last month, which  revolved around the human rights issue.    Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department in its annual  human rights report said that China, despite having made some  positive moves in 1993, still falls "far short" of  internationally recognized standards. Hosokawa will reportedly  tell Clinton that Tokyo considers it unlikely that Beijing will  improve human rights in response to U.S. pressure, the sources  said.    Chinese retaliatory measures in the event of the suspension  of MFN would also affect trade with other countries including  Japan, the premier will say, according [to] the sources.    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, during a recent visit to  China, assured the Beijing leadership of Japanese support for  China's GATT application.    Hosokawa will also advise Clinton not to upset China in  order  to gain its cooperation in peacefully solving the almost  year-long row over North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons  program, the sources said.</p>

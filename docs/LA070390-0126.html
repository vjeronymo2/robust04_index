			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: FOOTHILL TIES EXPECTED LOSS TO JUNK BONDS  </P> <P> Foothill Group said it expects to report a second-quarter loss of between $3.8  million and $4.3 million because it wrote down its investment portfolio to  reflect falling values for its junk-bond holdings.  </P> <P> Foothill, a financial services concern with executive offices in Agoura Hills  and Los Angeles, said the writedown would result in an after-tax charge of  about $5.4 million in the quarter ended June 30.  </P> <P> In the second quarter of 1989, Foothill had a profit of $3.24 million.  </P> <P> The writedown was needed "due to the continuing price erosion" in the market  for junk bonds, Foothill said, referring to the high-yield, high-risk debt  securities that have fallen out of favor with investors over the past year.  </P></p>

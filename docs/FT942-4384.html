			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Chile sees roads as route to growth: David Pilling on the awarding of concessions to upgrade infrastructure Mr Ricardo Lagos does not believe in miracles. 'Behind the Asian miracle, there are two principal factors,' says Chile's recently appointed public works minister. 'A radical reform of the educational system and a spectacular programme of infrastructure.' The fact that infrastructure is now the responsibility of such a high-profile minister - Mr Lagos is one of Chile's best-known politicians - indicates the new administration's desire to follow Asia's lead by upgrading and expanding a largely dilapidated transport network. Chile's road system has been starved of resources for decades and has hardly altered since the 1970s, though traffic flows have quadrupled. Mr Christopher Brown, executive director of the Chilean-British chamber of commerce, says run-down infrastructure could start to hamper growth. Unless action is taken, he says, 'export bottlenecks will emerge, and we just won't be able to get the products to the boats on time'. Chile, which has grown by an average 6 per cent a year over the past decade, is dependent on trade, exporting nearly a third of its gross domestic product. Mr Lagos agrees with Mr Brown's verdict. He proposes to double annual spending on infrastructure to Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) within four years, both to improve export competitiveness and to help the administration's broader aims of eradicating extreme poverty. Mr Lagos says a total of Dollars 33bn needs to be invested by 2010 and new ways, including an ample role for private sector financing, must be found to pay for public works. Projects built under concession, legislation for which was approved during the previous administration of President Patricio Aylwin, will play an important role, he says. The first such project - the Dollars 25m El Melon tunnel to the north of Santiago - is being built by Endesa, an energy holding company. Mr Lagos hopes to sign concessions for road projects worth Dollars 110m this year and for Dollars 220m in 1995. Mr Alejandro Fernandez, head of studies at independent economics consultant Gemines, supports concessions in theory, but says the new law is 'clumsy and bureaucratic'. Mr Lagos concedes that legislation is 'in need of perfection', for example by exempting tolls from value-added tax. He does not believe, however, that concessionaires should enjoy full ownership rights, favouring instead the eventual transfer of projects to the state. Tasc, a Santiago-based think-tank, has argued that this may act as a disincentive to adequate project investment. Mr Lagos hopes Chile will soon be able build an annual Dollars 300m-worth of infrastructure under concession; private analysts estimate Dollars 2bn could be raised in the next five years. Chile's private pension funds (AFPs), now worth Dollars 17bn, are another potential source of finance. Legislation passed this year allows AFPs to invest part of their portfolio in project-funding bonds and Mr Julio Bustamante, chief AFP regulator, believes they could soon provide 40 per cent of the private infrastructure capital. Some analysts, however, say risk-rating requirements will oblige them to proceed more slowly. The government also wants private sector involvement in the dilapidated railway system, part of which is due to be privatised later this year. Ten companies, including Renfe of Spain and Railtex of the US, have prequalified for the sale of 51 per cent of Fepasa, the railway cargo division. A number of Chilean forestry exporters, seeking cheap access to the coast, are also interested. Chile's ports, which handle nearly 95 per cent of exports, are split between the public and private sectors. Although efficient by Latin American standards, analysts say they fall far short of south-east Asian or European levels. Mr Lagos says he has no ideological objection to port privatisations, though he does not believe this should be an end in itself. Looking to the next century, Mr Lagos shares with many other analysts a vision of Chile as South America's gateway to Asia. 'Brazilian industrialists in Sao Paulo would find it much cheaper to be two days' lorry drive from Iquique or Antofagasta (northern Chilean ports) than to have to take a boat around Cape Horn or through the Panama Canal to get to Japan or China.' To exploit its 3,000-mile coastline to the full, Chile would need drastically to improve its links with Bolivia and Argentina. A tarmac road from Arica to the Bolivian border is due to open this year and plans have been announced for the possible construction of a sub-Andean tunnel to Argentina. Mr Lagos is not daunted by the task. As global trade expands and Latin American nations such as Argentina and Brazil begin to realise their export potential, he believes Chile will be in a unique position to act as entrepot port. 'I am convinced that our geographical location, looking out on the Pacific, is a resource that we have to exploit. The republic of Venice in the 15th century had one great advantage - its location. That is Chile's greatest asset too.'</p>

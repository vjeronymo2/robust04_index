			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Reorganisation and disposal costs put Aegis Pounds 1.9m in red AEGIS, the London-based holding company of Europe's largest media-buying and planning group, yesterday reported 1992 pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.9m, compared with restated profits of Pounds 54.4m. The group's figures - which were produced under FRS 3 - were badly hit by Pounds 22m losses through reorganisation, and another Pounds 22m cost on the sale of discontinued activities. Turnover increased 35 per cent to Pounds 2.84bn (Pounds 2.1bn). No final dividend will be paid, making 1.375p for the year (5.85p). No dividends on ordinary shares will be paid in 1993. Losses per share were 19.9p, compared with earnings of 20.4p. Net average debt was up from Pounds 35m to Pounds 68m at the end of the year. Excluding interest, operating expenses in 1992 were Pounds 138.6m, or 4.9 per cent of turnover, against Pounds 120.2m (restated under FRS 3), or 5.7 per cent of turnover in 1991. Aegis plans to reduce operating expenses this year to 1991's figure. Operating margins were down at 6.7 per cent (8.5 per cent). Staff levels are due to fall again in 1993, from 1,850 to 1,660, and it is planned to further consolidate the group's offices, reducing them from 59 to 46 across Europe. In June 1992 problems surfaced concerning Aegis' financial stability. Mr Peter Scott, its chairman, left and Sir Frank Law took over. Sir Frank said yesterday that while the reorganisation costs were high, financial control had been restored to the company and that no further sizeable restructurings were planned. Mr Charles Hochman, chief executive, said he believed the group had two distinct advantages over competitors, an established 'qualitative system' to assist advertisers buy media space more efficiently, and a genuine pan-European network. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 25m-Pounds 28m for 1993. COMMENT While new managerial controls have been put in place at Aegis, there are considerable uncertainties in its largest market, France, following the passage of the Loi Sapin Bill on March 31. In 1992 France was again Aegis' largest market by far, accounting for Pounds 791.8m of group turnover. But the Loi Sapin, aimed at bringing greater transparency to the French media-buying business, is likely to erode media-buying revenues by anything between 10 per cent and 40 per cent. The extent to which Aegis will suffer is as yet a matter of speculation. While analysts are forecasting a return to pre-tax profits in 1993, operating margins may shrink to just 2 per cent. However, 9 months ago it appeared that Aegis' acquisition-driven growth of the 1980s might result in the collapse of the company. That is no longer an immediate prospect.</p>

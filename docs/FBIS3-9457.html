			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marta Stolarova on interview with External </F> Economic Relations Minister Oleh Slyepichev in Prague; date not  given: "Practical Mechanisms Are Sought for New Revival of  Mutual Relations"]    [Text] "It is delightful that, despite all of the crisis  economic phenomena and our passing through a complex period of  transformation, our mutual relations have not significantly  suffered." Oleh Slyepichev, Ukrainian external economic  relations minister, stated this in an interview for HOSPODARSKE  NOVINY following his talks with the Czech economy ministers with  whom he signed, at the end of last week, treaties on economic  cooperation and support, and mutual protection of investments.    "Because mutual relations used to be centrally controlled,  we  are searching for suitable mechanisms for their revival," the  minister said. That was one of the reasons the two partner  institutions, the Ukrainian External Economic Relations Ministry  and the Czech Industry and Trade Ministry, agreed to create a  mixed, broadly conceived interdepartmental commission, which  would even include representatives from customs, the banking  sphere, and so forth, and devote itself to the building of  mutual relations.    The Czech Republic and Ukraine have already prepared a legal  basis for this, but we cannot avoid some problems in the near  future. According to the minister, these problems emerge  particularly in the sphere of payments. The volume of mutual  trade has markedly declined of late years to reach a current  turnover value of approximately $200 million. The trade is more  or less balanced. "We should try to keep up our trade, even  with the payment difficulties, because there are priorities,  feasible solutions to the payment difficulties that must be  sought. I assume that our banks will deal with this in the very  near future, perhaps in April," Slyepichev emphasized.    Of the specific priorities in mutual trade relations, the  minister pointed to the pressing need for restoration and  continuous supply of spare parts for the extensive pool of the  Czech trolleybuses and streetcars in Ukrainian cities. Ukraine,  for its part, used to supply the Czech Republic with iron ore,  and it would be difficult to find a replacement for this market.  "Hence, we are now looking at the possibilities of joint  enterprise and mutual investments, with the idea of not only  supplying our two markets but also penetrating third markets,"  the minister emphasized.    To a question regarding the financing options for the  planned  trade, the minister replied that such options exist--opening  accounts, clearing, and barter trade. At this time, according  to him, it is necessary, above all, to create favorable  conditions for direct cooperation between enterprises, the more  so because, in certain areas, a little effort could bear fruit  in a very short time. In this context, Minister Slepichev spoke  about his talks with the Association for Trade with Ukraine,  which collects bids for the supply of small bakeries, breweries,  and meat-industry-processing lines, and seeks contacts for  Ukrainian buyers. The representatives of the interested sectors  already agreed to help realize these deals through certain  mediating activities.</p>

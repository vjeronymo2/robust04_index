			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mirko Lauer: "Privately Owned Dollars, Public </F> Poverty"]    [Text] The image of Alberto Fujimori with money is a  nightmare for some sectors of the opposition. IU [United Left]  leader Cesar Barrera and APRA [American Popular Revolutionary  Alliance] leader Abel Salinas have said the thought of Fujimori  with privatization money has prompted the opposition to redesign  its electoral strategy.    While the details of this redefinition are not clear, we  must  recall that the opposition strategy was based on an insolvent  Fujimori, abandoned by voters who are fed up with the bruises of  five years of structural adjustment. But even Barrera and  Salinas seem convinced that the situation of Peruvians can be  improved with the $1.4 billion from the phone company  privatization.    They are right in that large sums of money always awaken  hope  and make imaginations fly. Even Barrera and Salinas are  beginning to feel it, in their own way. Many believe -- if only  subconsciously -- Fujimori was unable to improve the economic  situation merely because he did not have the resources with  which to do it.    From the very beginning, however, Fujimori did have the  funds  for improving the people's situation, but he did not do  anything. He preferred to repay the foreign debt at an  unnecessarily high rate, which caused the productive sector to  stagger. High interest rates, a low dollar rate, an open  market, and low income are the trademarks of his economic  program, which is still in foce.    It is true that the main issue is now the April 94-April 95  electoral year. Specialists know that channeling money to the  poor in this type of system is very difficult, if not  impossible. Governments that achieved this objective had to have  a radically changed identity.    The announcement to construct 50,000 houses clearly depicts  this situation. These houses are not for the homeless but for  those who earn enough to contract a mortgage at market prices,  or who want to move from a rented house to their own house.  Many of these people, who have a monthly income of $300, could  be longstanding Fujimori supporters.    But the construction of these houses may all the same help  to  reactivate the economy. What is not totally clear is whether a  reactivated economy can help the increasing number of people who  are choosing to vote for the opposition. Among other reasons,  they are doing this because the new part of the economy is  progressively becoming an enclave to strengthen internal  inequalities instead of soothing them.    Rather than changing its strategy, the opposition must  develop a strategy. We are sure Fujimori will not do anything  to improve the situation of a vast majority because that would  go against his very raison d'etre in the government. Fujimori  will try to make his spending look as if it is for the benefit  of the majority.    The best antidote against this might be to read the figures,  rather than the headlines, and look at the daily lifestyle of  the majority.</p>

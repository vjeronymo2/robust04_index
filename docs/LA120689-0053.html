			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MUIR EXONERATED IN ELIGIBILITY DISPUTE;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: PLAYOFF FOE THOUSAND OAKS CONTINUES TO RAISE DOUBTS OVER PLAYERS'  STANDING BASED ON LATE ACADEMIC REPORTS.  </P> <P> Suspicions by Thousand Oaks High officials that Muir's football team wrongfully  used certain players in its Southern Section playoff game Friday are unfounded,  according to Southern Section and Pasadena Unified School District officials.  </P> <P> Although seven members of Muir's team were ruled ineligible as a result of  grade reports received by Muir officials last Wednesday, school district policy  stipulates that no player had to be dropped from the team until Monday.  </P> <P> The grading situation was further muddled when the district computer system  failed to produce grades until more than a week later than usual. Had the  grades been released on time, those seven players could not have played against  Thousand Oaks. Muir won the Division II semifinal game, 9-3, in overtime, and  will play Santa Barbara in the final Saturday.  </P> <P> Acting on a tip, Lance Erie, Thousand Oaks' principal, voiced concerns about  the possible use of ineligible players to Southern Section official Bill Clark  on Monday and Muir Principal Alvin Fortune on Tuesday.  </P> <P> "The only thing we can rely on is the integrity of the school," Erie said. "And  I'm not going to question the integrity of a school unless someone steps  forward with some information."  </P> <P> However, when Erie learned that Muir knew of the players' standing two days  before the game, he said he would contact the Southern Section office today to  discuss "the interpretation and application of that rule." Because of delays  caused by computer difficulties, the players should have been immediately ruled  ineligible, according to Erie. "My sense of it," he said, "is that you don't  wait any longer."  </P> <P> Fred Bernthal, Muir's athletic director, maintains that the computer failure  was district-wide, also affecting Blair, Pasadena and Marshall Fundamental  highs, a contention supported by district officials. Bernthal added that he  also would have waited the extra four days had football players been awaiting  reinstatement.  </P> <P> Because of several recent run-ins with the Southern Section, including one in  the 1987 season that caused the Mustangs to forfeit eight games because of  ineligible players, Muir has earned a reputation for not policing incidents  such as these, Bernthal said.  </P> <P> Southern Section bylaws state that if a grading period ends and grades cannot  be distributed because of computer difficulties, a grade check cannot be made  just for athletes.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks Coach Bob Richards said that he felt hoodwinked by the loss and  the subsequent discoveries.  </P> <P> "This is a decision by the letter of some rule and maybe not the intent," he  said. "Knowing what I know, I feel our team has been cheated."  </P></p>

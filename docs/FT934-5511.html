			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Carmakers adjust to a rougher road Japanese carmakers are coming under increasing pressure to consolidate their activities, amid a continuing slide in personal spending at home, the impact of the high yen overseas and the increased competitiveness of Detroit's manufacturers in the US, Japan's biggest export market. In a deal revealed yesterday, Honda has agreed to supply Mitsubishi Motor with drive shafts for use in front-wheel-drive Mitsubishi cars. Neither company would reveal the volume or value involved. The deal reflects a growing trend for Japanese carmakers to seek alliances with each other in a bid to reduce costs, make more efficient use of facilities and survive the downturn. Honda will benefit from the economies of scale provided by a big buyer for its drive shafts, which the company has not sold to its competitors in the past. Mitsubishi, for its part, will be able to reduce its development costs. Statistics yesterday showed that Japanese vehicle exports last month suffered the largest year-on-year fall on record. Automotive exports in October, including parts, were down 25 per cent in unit terms, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association. In value, exports were down nearly 10 per cent. The largest falls came in exports to countries of the European Union, which were down 42 per cent in the ninth consecutive year-on-year decline. Exports to the US and Asia fell 21 per cent. In the domestic market, vehicle unit sales fell 9.5 per cent. Carmakers have been struggling to reduce costs and adjust production levels to meet lower demand. Mazda closed its factories yesterday for the second time this month to adjust inventories. Isuzu said it aimed to reduce its seasonal workers by 1,000, or 50 per cent, in a year. Earlier this year, Honda and Isuzu began providing each other with cars to supplement their ranges. Isuzu and Mazda also have an agreement to provide each other with engines.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Dewhirst advances to Pounds 3.51m at midway DEWHIRST Group, one of Marks and Spencer's main clothing suppliers, yesterday reported a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.38m to Pounds 3.51m in the six months to July 16. 'There are clear signs of increased activity on the high street. Operating costs are under tight control and the board expects progress to continue for the rest of the year,' Mr Tim Dewhirst, chairman since February, said. Sales rose to Pounds 95.4m (Pounds 81.3m). 'Ladies wear continued to perform very well during the six months,' said Mr Dewhirst. 'In Mens wear, the volume increases which started to come through in the autumn have continued. Childrens wear remains a difficult area, with sales static and margins under pressure.' Higher demand, stimulated by Marks and Spencer's 'outstanding value' campaign, had lifted productivity. Prices of three-quarters of the high street retailer's clothing lines were held, and the remaining quarter was cut, in the campaign which was launched last autumn. 'The campaign has been a great success for Marks and Spencer and for us, and it has helped us to produce these results,' said Mr Dewhirst. 'It's meant that we have seen volume increases in orders which has allowed us to plan the business more effectively and boost productivity.' But he warned: 'The campaign is not just about holding prices and reducing prices. We still need to see the newness and innovation of product coming through. It's got to be updated all the time.' He added that the company was focusing efforts on improving operating margins, which were up at 3.76 per cent (3.31 per cent). Net interest charges fell to Pounds 156,000 (Pounds 365,000) helped by lower rates. Net cash at the period end was Pounds 3.25m, compared with a net overdraft of Pounds 3m a year earlier. The interim dividend rose to 0.4p (0.32p), payable from earnings per share of 1.87p (1.28p).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Radical Civic Union [UCR] has adhered to the  Federal March, a mobilization that has been called by labor  sectors to protest over the official economic policy. It will  be preceded by four regional marches that will end in Plaza de  Mayo on 6 July.    The decision was announced on 22 June by Cordoba Provincial  Governor Eduardo Angeloz, who heads the UCR's Political Action  Commission.    The UCR's adhesion, which politically strengthens the labor  sector's call, was preceded by support from some internal  sectors of the UCR -- like the Convergence Sector, headed by  Federico Storani and Juan Manuel Casella; the Centennial  Athenaeum faction, headed by Jesus Rodriguez; and the Radical  Youth.    The decision announced by Angeloz has the support of UCR  President Raul Alfonsin, who is represented by Leopoldo Moreau  on the Political Action Commission.    The Cordoba provincial governor explained that the UCR  "adheres to and calls upon the people" to join the march because  "there is a legitimate demand by a society that has been crushed  by the economic debacle."    The Grand Front and the Social Unity also adhere to the  Federal March. The main leaders of these groups participated  last week in a meeting with the labor leaders that head the  mobilization: Victor De Genaro of the Congress of Argentine  Workers (CTA), and Juan Manuel Palacios and Saul Ubaldini of the  Argentine Workers Movement (MTA).    Cordoba (From our bureau) -- The Federal March will  apparently not have massive support in Cordoba.    The caravan coming from the northwest, which has been  organized by state workers of that region, will pass through  this city on the night of 4 July.    A leader of the Union Liaison Board, which coordinates all  Cordoba Province labor sectors, told CLARIN that it will  formally adhere to the march next week. Notwithstanding, the  degree of commitment to the march by members of the board, which  was created on the eve of the 10 June general provincial strike,  fluctuates.    The local leaders of the CTA, which is one of the organizers  of the Federal March, sounded out the possibility of launching  another general strike on 4 July. Their colleagues from the CGT  [General Confederation of Labor] Chacabuco faction, especially  those who belong to the Labor Organization and Action Movement  (MOAS), refused to go along. The Union Liaison Board on 22 June  decided to invite other intermediate organizations to join the  demonstration against the economic policy.    The weight of the mobilization will basically fall on the  Sanitary Works Union, the ATE (State Workers Association), and  the Printers Union, which are all grouped in the CTA, and on the  leftist political organizations. Other sectors of the Cordoba  provincial labor movement, which have an ample majority, will  only give their formal support.</p>

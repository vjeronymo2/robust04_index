			<p>BFN     [Text] The Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] criticized a  speech made by Kim Tae-chung, chairman of the Board of Directors  of the Asia and Pacific Peace Federation, during his visit to  the United States, suggesting that it is appropriate for  President Clinton to invite Kim Il-song to visit the United  States and that the United States should send a special envoy to  North Korea. He added that this may bring about confusion in our  reunification and diplomatic policy on the North.    Yi Se-ki, chairman of the DLP policy-making committee, said  that the remark by Kim Tae-chung was not appropriate because of  the delicate situation regarding the North Korean nuclear issue  at this time. He pointed out that this may bring about  confusion in the policy on North Korea.</p>

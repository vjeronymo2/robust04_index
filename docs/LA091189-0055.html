			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Ivan Drach, a Ukrainian poet and political activist, was elected to lead a new  grass-roots group fighting for greater autonomy for the Soviet republic,  according to a spokesman in Moscow for the Ukrainian Helsinki Group that  monitors human rights. He also said that Sergei Konyev, a member of the new  Soviet Parliament, was chosen as a deputy to Drach. The group, initially called  the Ukrainian Popular Movement for Perestroika, was renamed Rukh, Ukrainian for  movement, on the final day of a three-day meeting in the republic's capital,  Kiev. Konyev and another speaker at the meeting have called for removal of the  conservative Ukrainian Communist Party chief, Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky.  </P></p>

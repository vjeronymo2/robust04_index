			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Vardon opens at small premium SHARES IN Vardon, the leisure attractions group formed by Mr David Hudd and Mr Nicholas Irens, began trading yesterday at a small premium to their 45p placement price. In thin trading, the shares opened at 50p before slipping back to end the day at 47 1/2 p valuing the group, which owns the London and York Dungeons and eight Sea Life centres, at Pounds 23.3m. The group was formed in March when it acquired the Dungeons for Pounds 5.6m from Kunick, the nursing homes and amusement machines group, after Mr Hudd, chairman, and Mr Irens, chief executive, joined the board of Winchmore, restructured the company and changed its name. Last month Vardon bought Sea Life Centres for Pounds 9.9m in cash and stock, and announced plans for the share placement and listing, to help fund the acquisition. The placement of 23m shares, including 11.9m on behalf of Sea Life's previous owners, was handled by Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank. Last month the group reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 337,000 on turnover of Pounds 639,000 for the 27 weeks to July 5, and is forecasting annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m with earnings per share of 4p and a final dividend of 0.5p.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Top German official says Emu on track EUROPE remains on track for economic and monetary union, in spite of the August upheaval in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, Germany's top finance official said yesterday. Mr Gert Haller, the recently appointed state secretary in the Finance Ministry, said that all the EC member states which kept their currencies close together within the broad band ERM after August 2 had proved justified in resisting calls for rapid interest rate cuts. 'It proves that those countries are determined to pursue a sensible financial and monetary policy, even without the (narrow band) exchange rate corset,' he said in an interview. 'If we carry on like this to next year, we won't need this corset. Then it will be no problem to get back to narrow bands eventually.' He said he was looking for three conclusions from the special EC summit planned for October 29. The first was a statement that 'things are not going badly in monetary Europe'. The second was to allow the situation to 'develop calmly without any grand new schemes'. And the highest priority was for the EC member states to commit themselves to pursuing economic policies aimed at ever-greater convergence, which would allow the Emu programme to remain within its timetable, aimed at eventual union by 1999. Mr Haller, who was one of Germany's key negotiators for Emu in the Maastricht treaty, said it was impossible to predict what the situation would be like in 1999, and admitted that the second phase of Emu, due to begin on January 1, might last longer than foreseen. He said it was essential to keep the 'grey area' of monetary policy responsibility, when central banks will exist alongside the planned European monetary institute, as restricted as possible. At the meeting on Monday of the EC monetary committee, Mr Haller pointed out that long-term interest rates had fallen in all those EC member states which had kept their currencies close together since August 2, with the exception of Belgium and Ireland, which remained stable. 'That is also a sign that the market is convinced that the member states will continue to follow a reasonable stability-oriented monetary policy,' he said. He defended in particular the French government for refusing to cut its interest rates too swiftly. 'What would the French have gained if they had gone for short-term interest rate cuts?' he asked. 'They would have incurred exchange rate risks. The markets have a memory like an elephant. The French would have made a mess of their reputation for a very long time.' Mr Haller was given a baptism of fire as state secretary, when he had to attend the EC monetary committee on August 2 to resolve the ERM crisis. He confirmed he was the first to propose the move to a wider fluctuation band from the former 2.5 per cent band. The broad bands within the ERM meant that currency speculators now faced currency risk in the opposite direction to the former narrow bands. As a result they have been much less willing to speculate. He would not forecast when the narrow band 'corset' might be reintroduced, but insisted: 'It will not be a problem. It is actually a much more credible policy than by forcing ourselves into a corset. 'If the wrong policies are pursued, then the corset becomes a problem in itself. That is the lesson we have learned.'</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: OPERA  </P> <P> Rudolf Bing, the world renowned former Metropolitan Opera impresario, suffered  from advanced Alzheimer's disease two years ago and thought he was an office  worker, a psychiatrist testified Friday. Dr. Alan Tuckman, testifying at  proceedings to annul Bing's marriage to Carroll Douglass, 48, said that the  87-year-old Bing showed no recollection of the Metropolitan Opera, which he had  ruled over for 22 years, or of Douglass, his second wife. The annulment  proceedings were brought by Bing's court-appointed conservator, who contends  that Bing was suffering from the degenerative brain disease and did not know  what he was doing when he married Douglass at a hastily arranged ceremony two  years ago.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA has established a multiclass securities bulletin board, named ``gREX'', which is operated by GNMA's Information Agent, which at present is Chemical Bank. Financial information and offering circular disclosure information for multiclass securities transactions will be posted on gREX. Interested parties may obtain gREX software by contacting Chemical Bank at 1&hyph;800&hyph;2341&hyph;REX, or at the address set out in section II.B. above. Users must pay for their connect time and software.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Eligible MBS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The May 26, 1994 Notice identified eligible MBS as GNMA I MBS backed by single family mortgages that were issued on or after February 1, 1993. GNMA intends to expand the program to include other MBS and perhaps other securities. Announcements of additional eligible securities will be made on gREX.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Distribution Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With the expansion of eligible collateral and securities, GNMA may vary the distribution date, referred to as the ``Payment Date'' in the May 26, 1994 Notice, based on the type of multiclass transaction. Announcements of any changes in the distribution date of multiclass securities will be made on gREX.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Transaction Expenses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the initial stage, GNMA had no liability for payment of any fees or expenses, other than those of GNMA's Legal Advisor, in connection with the GNMA guaranty of multiclass securities. One commentor suggested that GNMA include the transaction expenses in its guaranty fee, citing the practice of FNMA and FHLMC. GNMA notes that these entities have different programs from GNMA in that both of these entities issue securities as well as guaranteeing the securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GNMA has decided to continue the initial stage approach. Therefore, GNMA will not be liable for transaction expenses, other than the Legal Advisor's fees. Subject to GNMA requirements, during the full participation stage, the Sponsors generally will select the program participants to be used for each transaction and negotiate the fees (other than those of the Financial Advisor) to be paid to the other program participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Combination of Outstanding MBS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are a large number of outstanding MBS in current principal amounts that are not large enough to be traded efficiently in the current MBS market. In addition, there are certain multiclass securities transactions that can be effected most efficiently if the trust issuing the multiclass securities is funded by GNMA MBS having large outstanding principal amounts. As necessary, to facilitate other multiclass securities transactions, to enhance the secondary market for MBS and to raise revenues through the receipt of guarantee fees by GNMA, GNMA is implementing a program to permit the combination of MBS into a new GNMA combined multiclass security entitled to the payments on the underlying MBS. The guaranty fees to be charged to effect combination transactions will be established by GNMA from time to time and announced on gREX.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

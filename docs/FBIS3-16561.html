			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At its closed session Wednesday [16 March] the  Federation Council started to discuss the situation in the zone  of the state of emergency on the territories of North Ossetia  and Ingushetia.    The Federation Council's commission which has visited the  conflict zone put forward a proposal to expand the state of  emergency over the entire territory of North Ossetia. At  present the state of emergency has been introduced only on a  part of North Ossetia's and Ingushetia's territories.    North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov disagreed with  this proposal and declared that "the commission has not even  tried to penetrate the essence of this problem." The Federation  Council can promote the conflict settlement "if its resolution  does not become another negative and illegal link in the chain  of decisions adopted earlier," he said in his interview with  journalists. Among these "illegal decisions" Galazov mentioned  the decree on rehabilitation of the repressed peoples and the  decree on the creation of the Ingush republic which, as he  believes, actually legalizes the territorial re-division.    During his conversation with journalists Ingush President  Ruslan Aushev supported the recommendations of the Federation  Council Commission on introduction of the state of emergency on  the territory of North Ossetia. He also does not rule out the  possibility of such a measure as establishing presidential rule  in the conflict zone.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Observer: Home for Gomes Brazil's finance minister Ciro Gomes promised to lower the job's profile when he took over in September. But so quickly? Gomes has annoyed so many businessmen and government officials that he has stopped giving media interviews for fear of starting any more rows. In Sao Paulo this week he ended up fleeing from the press. Gomes has made some vicious attacks on companies which raise prices. Nor has calling Brazilian consumers 'suckers' for paying high prices, and threatening to raise interest rates 'sky high' greatly endeared him to Brazilians. Gomes says he will stay in the job until his close ally, president elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso, takes office on January 1. What happens to Gomes then is anyone's guess; the portfolio for spreading goodwill and enlightenment is probably not available.</p>

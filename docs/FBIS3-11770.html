Today we are going to talk about the embezzlement  and theft of agricultural products in Havana Province.    Eloy, I recently read a commentary you had written in the  TRABAJADORES newspaper in which you talked about this topic, and  you pointed out some interesting facts. You said that  approximately 30 percent of Havana Province's agricultural  production was stolen or embezzled. I am thinking of last year's  production and that must be equivalent to 1 quintal of  agricultural products per citizen in Havana City. That means  that the average four-person family did not receive  approximately 400 pounds per capita. That is for a four-person  family nucleus.    Most likely, many of them had to buy these products from  these same thieves and unscrupulous speculators on the black  market and at the black market prices. If to this we add the  fact that last year approximately 1 million people from Havana  participated in agricultural tasks in Havana, we can say that  they have stolen twice from us, because besides stealing the  product that corresponds to us they stole the work we did.    Eloy, I would like to hear your opinion on this matter.    [Concepcion] Yes, this is a situation that besides being  caused through theft is caused through embezzlement and  misappropriation. It is a spider web and a complex network that  has a present effect, which affects the people and the country's  economy. It has a future effect in that it creates an atmosphere  of social indiscipline, it undermines values that correspond to  our society and, therefore, it has a double negative effect.    With regard to agriculture and the problems of theft,  embezzlement, and misappropriation of agricultural products in  Havana, we reached a point at which we needed to stop it dead in  its tracks -- to use words that are understandable. We had to  take measures that were a bit drastic and which have not been  accepted by the perpetrators of those crimes or by those who  allowed or have been allowing these immoral acts to happen.    In contrast, from information I have gathered during visits  I  made in the last few days, there is general acceptance among the  population in the two provinces: in Havana and Havana City.    [Santana] Nevertheless, you pointed out in your report that  for some irresponsible and undisciplined people the measures  taken have been bothersome.    [Concepcion] Yes, logically. What was happening here was the  following -- let me see if I can paint a picture for you so that  the listeners can understand where the problem lies. The problem  begins with the lack of control and demand by the administrative  leaders of the enterprises. Some of these have been accustomed  to being very generous with state resources.    There is a key element here -- and later on I will talk more  about the theft of products -- which is an exchange between  enterprises and organizations from Havana Province and Havana  City Province, which has created the philosophy of you scratch  my back and I will scratch yours. In other words, one enterprise  has welding rods and other resources that the agricultural  enterprise, the farm, or the Basic Cooperative Production Units  [UBPC] lacks. In exchange for these products that belong to the  state which are diverted from the capital to that enterprise,  that enterprise, which produces tubers and vegetables, gives  this enterprise, which provided those resources, agricultural  products.    [Santana] Eloy, you were talking about a very interesting  subject, the small-time peddler relationship among companies, a  relationship which basically is that policy of you scratch my  back and I will scratch yours. I think this emerged some time  ago during those big meetings among businessmen in Havana  Province and in Havana City. This is a sort of a barter, a sort  of liberty adopted by some directors, which if they did this for  their companies' benefit, they would be more efficient, but by  doing this they are only showing that they are small-time  peddlers [mercachifles], and not businessmen, and much less  socialist businessmen.    [Concepcion] Yes, and you know that over the past few years  there has been a process of change in the treatment of man. All  companies and organizations have been worried -- and they are  right -- about giving better service to their workers in their  cafeterias, and I think they have been classified as quality  cafeterias, and there are organizations which are examples  nationwide.    But we must say the following: Most of these organizations  and companies from the capital and nationwide have been given  some self-consumption plots. And many of the self-consumption  ploys of those organizations are a bit abandoned.    What happens is that one organization or company asks  another  agricultural company to provide a truck load of tubers for its  cafeterias -- and this is good -- but in practice what is  happening is that the truck load of tubers is not used just to  feed the workers, but many of those products are sent elsewhere  to feed the pigs, because it is easier to raise pigs than to  produce vegetables and tubers in those self-consumption plots  they have, it is easier than working, I would say.    [Santana] Is this the embezzlement you were talking about?    [Concepcion] Yes. Then they give better service to the  workers at the cost of others. That is, you will probably find  cafeterias giving good service but when you eat there you will  realize that what is consumed there is not produced by that  company or organization. So, good service is given to the men at  the cost of other workers who produce, or at the cost of a  product that should have been sent to the people and was not  sent because of that unauthorized appropriation.    [Santana] I think this is very interesting because people  always talk about theft, and those who steal or swipe those  agricultural products are always condemned. But you are  mentioning something new that has not yet been publicly  mentioned, or at least I have not heard it yet. This is an  interesting element because state companies obviously have an  influence on the fact that not enough food is reaching the  neighborhood markets.    Of course the worker is happy when in his cafeteria he can  receive all those products, but of course the businessmen and  the people who are involved in this type of embezzlement must be  punished and sentenced severely.    [Concepcion] The problem is that we have developed a bad  habit, and we have had this bad habit not only during the  revolutionary process but long before that, when people used to  violate the country's rules and laws. There are rules about what  companies, what organizations, and what cafeterias should  receive these products on a priority basis, but through the  established channels, that is, through the official channels.  But what happens is that this has become a regular practice,  that everyone is going to the fields to look for products for  their cafeterias, and they do this together. Thus, a false  relationship of partnership and friendship has been created -- a  false concept of interentrepreneurial or interorganizational  relations that violates the government-established regulations  -- and therefore rules must be established.    [Santana] The people will undoubtedly agree -- the workers  in charge of production who see this type of misappropriation  which Eloi mentioned. You were going to speak of theft. I  believe this is also something very important and irritating.    [Concepcion] Yes. That is a situation we had and still have  in certain cases in Havana and towns of the two provinces, as  well as nationwide. I do not want to limit it to Havana. This is  a national problem, not a problem of Havana City and Havana  Province alone. It is annoying not being able to get a product  in your local market, for example plantains, garlic, or  agricultural products in general, and have a neighbor sell it to  you at elevated prices -- a head of garlic for eight pesos, etc.  This exhausts the resources of the people who have to endure  this problem.    The state and government have the responsibility of stopping  this dead in its tracks, to take measures which might seem  drastic but are nothing more than what is necessary to put an  end to the romp and social indiscipline that has been corrupting  en masse the people who directly or indirectly had no choice but  to participate in it due to the situation we are experiencing.    There are people who, logically, disagree with these  measures. When you can establish order, those who prefer  disorder are not pleased. Certain organizations and enterprises  which were involved in this romp do not support the measures.  This is also the case with transportation drivers who have  directly or indirectly participated in this romp. Therefore, the  blatant theft....[pauses] There is the case of the 4,000 heads  of garlic on (Moscovits) cars in Matanzas, as a matter of the  fact, one of the actions taken was the confiscation of those  cars.    This was creating an unbearable situation, and the people  have been demanding that drastic measures be taken to put an end  to it. This does not mean that this is going to solve the  problem. These measures are being taken because in the next two  months at least 3 million quintals of potatoes and other crops  will be harvested in Havana Province. The goal of these measures  during these two months is to avoid and halt the theft and  ensure that the products reach the people and the cold storage  facilities and that the truck does not drive around leaving  sacks of products on the way, stealing and supporting a black  market that is impoverishing the people. The state has the  responsibility to take whatever measures are needed to solve  this.    [Santana] I believe that we also have to stress that there  cannot be extremes because we usually either fall short or  overshoot the mark. We have to avoid extremes with relatives or  friends of farmers returning home, not because they went to buy  from the farmer, and bring back home a small amount of  agricultural goods.    [Concepcion] The problem does not lie with the bicycle  riders  or friends who go to the farm to get a bag of products. This is  not a problem of small bags or bicycle riders. Many of them  might be involved in this as a business, but these measures are  not for these people. There might be certain injustices as is  logical. These measures are aimed at the agricultural profiteers  who have inundated Havana with products in an undertaking which  is already an unbearable problem.    [Concepcion] They do this on a large scale. I believe that  what you say is true. This is not aimed at people getting a bag  of products. It is aimed at large-scale profiteers.</p>

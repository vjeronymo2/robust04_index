			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / OFT probes music royalties THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has written to the Performing Right Society about changes to the society's live-performance royalty system, which have angered classical composers. Before January, the society paid live royalties to composers using a formula based on a full census of classical programmes. Now it makes its calculations according to data from about 550 'significant' venues and 50 arts festivals, selected on the basis of capacity and the number of concerts held each year. The Composers' Guild of Great Britain claims that little-known composers will lose when the first payments are made next July, because performances at small concert venues will not be taken into account. The society says the previous system was unfair, ineffective and inefficient. Non-classical writers earned only from performances in large venues and half of the classical performances went unreported in spite of the huge administrative cost of chasing every programme - nearly a fifth of the society's total revenue last year of Pounds 137m. Ms Sarah Rogers, who chairs the composers' guild, said: 'The new live music policy, far from creating a level playing field, has begun to reveal the uneven workings of a monopoly.' Ms Terri Anderson, the society's public-affairs controller, said composers could not keep track on their own of where their music was performed and the society could function only if its administrative costs were covered. The dispute is likely to come to a head tonight at the society's annual meeting. The OFT confirmed that it had written to the society, asking to see the directive on the collection of royalties and a copy of the society's memorandum and articles of assistance.</p>

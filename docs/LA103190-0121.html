			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LINCOLN S&amp;L FIGURE PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD;  </P> <P> CRIME: ERNEST C. GARCIA II ADMITS ACTING TO HELP THE THRIFT HIDE ITS OWNERSHIP  OF SOME RISKY DESERT LAND IN ARIZONA.  </P> <P> A key figure in the failure of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan pleaded guilty  Tuesday to bank fraud and agreed to cooperate with the continuing federal  investigation of the thrift's collapse 18 months ago.  </P> <P> Ernest C. Garcia II, a 33-year-old Tucson developer, admitted that he  fraudulently obtained a $30-million line of credit in a series of transactions  that also helped Lincoln hide its ownership in risky desert Arizona land from  regulators.  </P> <P> Garcia is the first person charged with a crime in the federal probe of  Lincoln's collapse. A federal grand jury in Los Angeles has been investigating  Lincoln's failure for more than a year. Charles H. Keating Jr., a Phoenix  developer whose company owned Lincoln, is the central target of the probe.  </P> <P> Garcia entered the plea Tuesday before U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman  after federal prosecutors filed an information -- essentially an indictment  agreed to without going through a grand jury.  </P> <P> Garcia, free on a $5,000 personal bond, is scheduled to be sentenced April 19.  The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of five years in prison, a $250,000  fine and restitution.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Garcia said he entered the plea "with tremendous  feelings of remorse."  </P> <P> "After careful consideration of all the facts, numerous consultations with  legal counsel, and, most importantly, consideration of my family, I felt it was  best to try and put the circumstances and mistakes of the last three years  behind us," he said. "Given the benefit of hindsight, I would have done some  things differently."  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors said the plea agreement requires Garcia to cooperate in the  continuing Lincoln probe, but they declined to detail what would be required of  him. Lincoln's failure is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion.  </P> <P> Garcia's testimony could be damaging to Keating, former American Continental  chairman. Keating is awaiting trial in state court on 42 counts of securities  fraud relating to the sale of American Continental bonds.  </P> <P> Neither Keating nor his lawyer could be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Early this month, lawyers for Keating identified the deal with Garcia as one of  three activities they said the federal grand jury was concentrating on.  </P> <P> The bank-fraud charge alleges that Garcia was a "straw borrower" used by  executives at Lincoln and its parent firm, American Continental Corp. in  Phoenix, to hide the true ownership of 1,000 acres of desert land outside  Phoenix, according to federal prosecutors.  </P> <P> "This type of white-collar scheme -- using 'straw borrowers' -- is of  particular concern because it is designed to conceal the true nature of the  financial transactions involved," said U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh in a  prepared statement from Washington. "In the process, federal regulators are  deceived, the institution is defrauded and the taxpayers are left to foot the  bill."  </P> <P> The convoluted arrangement involving Garcia and a partnership called  Westcontinental Mortgage &amp; Investment Corp. was the first of 10  transactions regarding property in a planned development called Hidden Valley  Ranch.  </P> <P> Garcia is accused of obtaining a $30-million line of credit from Lincoln by  "creating the materially false and misleading impression" that the borrowing  was not related to the simultaneous purchase of the desert acreage.  </P> <P> The Hidden Valley property was bought in 1987 by Westcon, a partnership with  few assets created and run by a friend of Garcia to accommodate the  transaction.  </P> <P> The information charges that, instead of being an arms-length transaction, the  sale of the desert land for $14 million actually was an illegal "quid pro quo"  for Garcia's line of credit. Westcon put $3.5 million down -- money regulators  claim came from Lincoln through Garcia -- and borrowed the remaining amount  from a Lincoln subsidiary.  </P> <P> Regulators, who had been pressing Lincoln to rid itself of risky holdings in  undeveloped Arizona desert land, doubted both the values Keating put on the  land and the arrangements he used to sell some of it.  </P> <P> Westcon never repaid the $10.5-million loan it received from Lincoln for the  balance of the purchase price. In a letter, the company asked that the property  be returned to its rightful owner, suggesting that the partnership was a straw  borrower.  </P> <P> In civil lawsuits, regulators allege that Lincoln claimed "phantom profits" of  $82 million from the 10 deals -- including $11 million on the Westcon deal --  and improperly paid American Continental $31 million for income tax on the  deals. Lincoln, however, didn't owe any taxes, regulators said.  </P> <P> Junk Buyers  </P> <P> Columbia Savings has narrowed the list of buyers for its bond portfolio.

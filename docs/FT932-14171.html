			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Bonds: Republic of Austria returns to the Dutch guilder sector THE Republic of Austria returned to the Dutch guilder sector yesterday after a five-year absence, attracted by the narrowing of the yield differential between Dutch and German government bonds. A year ago, Dutch bond yields were 30 to 40 basis points higher than bund yields, but Dutch bonds are now trading roughly flat to the German market, depending on which area of the yield curve is taken. Since the policy of the Austrian federal financing agency is that exposure to D-Marks or guilders does not create foreign exchange risk, the decision to tap the market was based on interest rate levels. Yields in the Austrian market are 20 to 30 basis points higher than in Germany or the Netherlands. Although the financing was 'slightly more expensive' than a comparable deal in the German market, according to Mr Helmut Eder of the financing agency, the issue allowed the borrower to diversify. Austria has now completed about two-thirds of its planned foreign borrowing programme of Dollars 3bn this year. This is the largest deal launched in the guilder market for some time. Lack of swap opportunities has discouraged foreign investors, and Dutch companies have been waiting for further declines in rates. Austria's Fl 1bn six-year issue was priced to yield 8 basis points over the comparable Dutch government bond. The yield looked attractive against D-Mark bonds, as six-year Dutch government bonds yield about 10 basis points more than comparable bunds, while at the 10-year area, Dutch bonds trade five basis points through bunds. In the Italian bond market, Eurofima launched a L300bn 10-year deal, the third issue at that maturity in the last week. The deal was arranged by Banca Nazionale de Lavoro. Activity in the dollar market is likely to take centre-stage for the rest of the week, if a number of transactions under discussion go ahead. Abbey National, the UK bank, is in discussions with banks over a Dollars 1bn, 10-year offering, expected to be priced to yield 60 basis points more than the comparable US Treasury. Goldman Sachs and UBS are tipped as likely underwriters. Officials in Abbey National's treasury department were unavailable for comment yesterday. Also expected to emerge in the next few days is a five-year offering totalling at least Dollars 500m for Canada's Export Development Corporation. Credit Suisse First Boston was said to have won the mandate to arrange the deal.</p>

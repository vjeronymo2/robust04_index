			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUCCESS STORIES  </P> <P> Rodriguez's interview with corporate attorney Elsa Banuelos was dismaying.  Banuelos states that she is "tired of translating" when called upon by client  or other attorneys to assist them with the busboys. Would Banuelos feel just as  tired, or rather, embarrassed, to translate while negotiating a contract with  another attorney or a Spanish-speaking client? I think not. It is unfortunate  that Banuelos is not proud of her ability to converse in Spanish, even if it is  only used to ask the busboy for another glass of water.  </P> <P> TINA ARRANAGA KUBASEK  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Disclosure of share options urged COMPANIES should be required to disclose their directors' share options, three academics said yesterday. Mr Don Egginton, Mr John Forker and Mr Paul Grout of the University of Bristol told a conference on corporate governance at Nottingham University that disclosure would be inexpensive and could probably be introduced simply through an accounting standard. Annual reports could show in a simple table the rights of executives to acquire shares, and the options granted, exercised and lapsed during the year. The academics said existing disclosure requirements were complex, erratic, incomplete and met with imperfect compliance by companies. They added that options that could be satisfied with existing shares offered the greatest tax concessions and yet had the least demanding disclosure requirements. They found that options to subscribe for shares were most commonly used by British companies. Their conclusions came shortly after the US Securities and Exchange Commission issued tough new disclosure guidelines on stock options for company executives. The profit-and-loss account should also be debited to show the cost of the options, with a corresponding adjustment in reserves on the balance sheet, they recommended. Large quoted UK companies in which the directors own a small proportion of the shares are more likely to create audit committees voluntarily, the conference heard. In an analysis of 142 companies, Mr Paul Collier of Exeter University found clearly differing characteristics between companies with and without voluntarily formed audit committees. Companies with committees tended to have a higher level of gearing, more non-executive directors and an internal audit department. He concluded that as a result businesses with low gearing and high levels of share ownership by directors would disproportionately face the costs of introducing audit committees. Extending auditors' liability to parties other than their clients would not improve the quality of auditing, Mr Noel O'Sullivan told the conference. Auditors would adopt risk-avoidance strategies rather than making their audits more extensive, said Mr O'Sullivan, an Association of British Insurers' research fellow. They would be likely to avoid clients in high-risk industries, he added. His analysis goes against critics who have called for a re-examination of the Caparo judgment in the Lords which restricted an auditor's duty of care to the existing shareholders of a company collectively.</p>

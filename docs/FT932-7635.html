			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Building society inflow up to Pounds 1bn BUILDING SOCIETIES had a net inflow of deposits from savers of Pounds 1.07bn in April compared with Pounds 249m in March, enjoying their best month for two years. The last time building societies had a comparable monthly inflow was April 1991, when net receipts totalled Pounds 1.3bn. Net inflow was Pounds 820m for the whole of the previous three months. Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said the rise represented 'a significant departure from the modest inflows experienced over recent months'. He attributed the increase to 'the specific marketing efforts of individual societies and seasonal factors rather than a general trend. As such the inflow of savings may well fall back next month'. Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi Securities said the figures indicated that people were saving more of their discretionary income, which had been rising as a result of the fall in mortgage rates. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, said: 'Building societies will find it more difficult to whinge against National Savings as a result of these figures.' The increase in mortgage activity recorded in March was sustained in the April building society figures. Gross mortgage lending was Pounds 2.71bn in April, up fractionally from March.</p>

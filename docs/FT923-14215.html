			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Row over youth training places A ROW broke out yesterday between the government and the Labour party over the number of unemployed young people waiting for places on Youth Training, the scheme for people aged 16 to 19. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, dismissed as 'absolute fantasy' a claim by Mr Tony Blair, her Labour shadow, that a survey of careers services showed 55,000 young people waiting to go on YT. The survey, drawn from a majority of the 107 careers services, showed that almost 40 per cent of those waiting were 1991 school leavers. A third had been waiting for more than eight weeks. Some had to wait up to eight months for a training place. Mr Blair said the government claimed it had no information on the number of young people without training places. He claimed the government was 'deliberately with-holding information' because the Department of Employment had compiled figures for waiting lists as part of an official survey earlier this year. According to the department, no full survey has taken place. However, it is understood that civil servants estimated that about 20,000 people were on careers services' books in March. The government guarantees a training place to all those aged 16 to 19 who want one - a promise restated by Mrs Shephard this week - and any breakdown in that is politically embarrassing. Last year, the government had to spend Pounds 15m more than it forecast on upholding the guarantee. YT cost about Pounds 850m last year.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: Paramount costs leave Viacom Dollars 454m in red An after-tax charge of Dollars 332m to cover costs involved in the takeover of Paramount Communications has left Viacom, the US entertainment group, with a total net loss of Dollars 454m, or Dollars 3.59 a share, for the first quarter. The charge stems from the merger of some of its businesses with those of Paramount, as well as 'related management and strategic changes', Viacom said. Some Dollars 224m of the charge was taken in the entertainment division, which has been created by bringing together Paramount's movie and television operations and Viacom's production businesses. The company said it had adjusted the value of some of its programming assets, 'based upon new management strategies and additional programming sources'. Without the charge, Viacom's net loss for the period would have amounted to 94 cents a share, slightly more than most analysts' expectations. The first-quarter figures include just one month of Paramount's results. If Paramount's results for the full period had been included, the net loss would have been Dollars 332.9m, or Dollars 1.67 a share, before the one-off merger charge, Viacom said. The results reflect a poor performance from Paramount's movie division, with revenues from the company's feature films below expectations. The inclusion of one month of Paramount figures contributed an operating loss of Dollars 51m, Dollars 35m of it in entertainment and Dollars 15m from publishing. Viacom's pre-merger businesses, by contrast, reported operating earnings of Dollars 83m for the quarter, Dollars 66m of it from the MTV and Showtime networks. MTV continued its growth of recent quarters, with revenues up 30 per cent from a year ago, at Dollars 174m, and operating earnings up 21 per cent to Dollars 55m. Commenting on the results, Mr Frank Biondi, president and chief executive, said: 'The main structural issues and associated costs are clearly behind us and we are poised for excellent performance and growth.' The sale of the company's one-third interest in Lifetime Television, for a pre-tax profit of Dollars 267m, will appear in the current quarter's figures. Viacom has already announced it is exploring the sale of other assets in a move that would reduce the debts taken on with the acquisition of Paramount.</p>

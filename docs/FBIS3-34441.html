The meeting was attended on the Egyptian side by Ambassador  to Israel Mahmud Basyuni and Foreign Ministry spokesman  Ambassador Naji al-Ghatrifi and on the Israeli side by  Environment Minister Yosi Sarid and Ambassador David Sultan.    Musa met earlier today for one hour with Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat.    'Arafat, Peres, and Musa are expected to get together at a  working luncheon Musa is hosting for the Palestinian and Israeli  delegations.    In another development, Avi Gil, Israeli Foreign Ministry  deputy director general, stated that at noon today President  Husni Mubarak contacted Shim'on Peres. The Israeli foreign  minister informed Mubarak of the real stand regarding the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations so far, Gil said.    He added that President Mubarak invited Peres to attend a  meeting with him at 1830 this evening.    The spokesman noted that the Israeli minister will also meet  with the Austrian president at 1930 today.    In other developments, sources close to the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations stated to MENA that the general  atmosphere of the talks is good.    The Palestinian delegation sources said that the Palestinian  and Israeli negotiators will continue their negotiations today  and tomorrow. Peres will not leave Cairo until late on  Wednesday evening or early Thursday morning after finding a  solution to the obstacles to signing the agreement.    The same sources clarified that the minutes of the  negotiations, including all the points of difference and  agreement, will only be initialed by the two sides. The points  of difference will be left for President 'Arafat and Yitzhaq  Rabin to resolve later.    The sources said that the points of difference revolve  basically around the issue of the crossings and Israel's  insistence on maintaining its security control over them.    The news agency has also learned that the paper being  discussed currently is the Davos document, which is based on the  Cairo paper. The Davos document consists of three main pages in  addition to a special and a separate eight-page section on the  minutes regarding the crossings.    The Israelis made some changes to the Davos document which  the Palestinians reject, insisting that this matter should be  seen as a comprehensive deal that includes the Davos and Cairo  documents.    It is worth noting here that the Palestinian delegation to  the talks includes Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', Nabil Sha'th,  Akram Haniyah, and Faysal al-Husayni; the Israeli delegation  includes Uri Savir, Foreign Ministry director general; Yo'el  Zinger, the legal advisor to the Foreign Ministry; and Uzi  Dayan, chief of military planning.</p>

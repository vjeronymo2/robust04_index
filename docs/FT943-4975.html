			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft more optimistic Metallgesellschaft expects to earn more than DM100m (Dollars 64m) in operating profits in 1994-95 after last week's agreement to staunch the flood of losses on controversial oil purchase contracts with Castle Energy of the US. Current risk provisions of DM1bn already set aside to cover these deficits would have to be increased, the group said last night, although no significant new burdens had arisen from the deal with Castle. The metals and engineering group, which came close to collapse this year before being rescued by creditor banks, also announced it had signed an agreement in principle with an unnamed buyer for its Frankfurt headquarters. It expected the disposal to yield 'considerable extraordinary profits'. Unofficial estimates have valued the site at DM750m. A 'solution had come closer' in efforts to sell a 47 per cent stake in the Kolbenschmidt automotive components company. The group, which is known to be negotiating with Dana Corp of the US and T&amp;N of the UK, recently instructed Deutsche Bank to draw up plans to place the stock as an option to an industrial sale. In a statement issued after a meeting between the banking consortium which raised a DM3.4bn salvage package and the company's supervisory board, Metallgesellschaft said it would seek further fresh capital at the end of the current year on September 30, and was confident its proposals would be approved by the banks and shareholders. The tone of the statement contrasted sharply with a recent warning the company issued at the time of the announcement of terms for its most recent capital-raising move: the offering of 5.6m new shares to raise DM1.4bn. The prospectus said the success of restructuring measures could not be guaranteed, and there was no chance that dividend payments would be resumed in the foreseeable future.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Carol Pui-yee Lai] </F>   [Text] After the initial fury from China over a decision  by the Governor, Chris Patten, to put forward an unamended  version of his political reform bill, senior Chinese officials  yesterday began toning down the official response. However,  Wang Fengchao, the deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, warned Britain that "it is difficult to see how  Sino-British co-operation will not be affected on other matters  in the absence of a co- operative atmosphere". Wong Po-yan, the  chairman of the airport consultative committee, said yesterday  in Beijing he believed work on the new airport would be affected  by the current political rift between Britain and China.    At a Preparatory Working Committee reception in Beijing, the  Chinese Premier, Li Peng, urged members to speed up their work  because they faced what he called a "heavier burden". Without  naming Britain or Patten, Li said it should be recognized that  China was no longer the China of 1840, but of 1994. The wheel  of history will roll forward, not to be stopped," Li said.  "China is enjoying political stability and economic prosperity."    Wang accused Britain of "going further and further" in  undermining co-operation between the two countries. He said  that although economic affairs should not be mixed with  politics, it would be difficult to separate the two because  China could not help "feeling emotional".    In Tokyo, Chinese Vice Premier, Zhu Rongji, told Japanese  investors that there would be no change in Hong Kong's law and  overall system after 1997. "In fact, it would be even more  profitable for foreign investors after 1997," he said. Zhu, who  is also governor of the central bank, was replying to a question  on how he would allay fears of Japanese investors.    The softening of China's position failed to comfort Hong  Kong  investors, who are worried about possible interest rate rises.  These concerns sent share prices plummeting as much as 5 per  cent at one point in yesterday's trading, leaving the Hang Seng  Index at 9,892 -- a fall of 540 points during the morning  session. The market picked up later in the day, closing at  10,100 points, a fall of 3.2 per cent.    Zhang Junsheng, a deputy director of the New China News  Agency (Xinhua), last night hit back angrily at the British  government for its account of the Sino-British talks -- released  on Thursday -- by revealing part of the Chinese version of the  negotiations. Zhang said Britain had misled the Hong Kong  public by not revealing details of an agreement between Britain  and China made before the talks were opened on April 22. Zhang  said that after Patten gazetted his political reform bill on  March 22, Alastair Goodlad, the British Foreign Minister in  charge of Hong Kong affairs, sent a message on March 30 to  request talks with China. Jiang Enzhu, China's Deputy Foreign  Minister, agreed conditionally to talks and sent a reply to Sir  Robin McLaren, the British ambassador to Beijing, on April 7.    Jiang's letter said it was always China's position to  resolve  Sino-British discrepancies through negotiation. He said if the  Hong Kong government gazetted the political reform bill too  early it would in effect terminate the talks. Jiang wrote that  negotiations should be in line with the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, the Basic Law and other related Sino-British  agreements and the memorandum. He said the two countries would  hold talks in order to guarantee a smooth transition in Hong  Kong. He wrote that the talks should be conducted with only one  Chinese and one British official present at the meetings. Other  members should act as advisers or experts. Jiang said the Hong  Kong government's tabling of the reform bill in the Legislative  Council would terminate the talks.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Improvement at F&amp;C Smaller Cos Over the six months ended October 31 1992 net asset value of Foreign &amp; Colonial Smaller Companies recovered from 107.3p to 109.2p. At end-October 1991 it stood at 109p. Sir Peter Hordern, chairman, said in all the principal markets of the world smaller companies had been under pressure. But the company outperformed the stock market indices. On the income side, dividends from investments had been better than expected although there was a few reductions. Benefit came from the fall in sterling and foreign currencies were borrowed at low interest rates. Total revenue improved from Pounds 2.83m to Pounds 3.28m while earnings per share came to 1.66p (1.45p). The interim dividend is lifted to 0.68p (0.65p) and it is intended to pay a final of 1.16p (1.1p).</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Lands where rich and poor are furthest apart: Poverty in Latin America - As the IADB meets in Hamburg, FT writers look at the plight of individual countries LATIN America's governments have won wide praise for economic reform programmes credited with restoring growth and lowering inflation. Investors have responded enthusiastically. Net capital inflows to Latin America last year exceeded Dollars 50bn (Pounds 35.2bn), suggesting much of the region is at last emerging from the debt crisis of the 1980s. Yet the recession induced by the debt crisis may have left a more lasting legacy that could yet thwart the aspirations of these new investors and reverse the pro-market economic policies that encouraged them. The shift to democracy in much of the region may also be at risk. The problem is poverty and the related issue of income inequality. Income is more concentrated in the hands of the rich in Latin America than in any other region of the world. In the 1980s, inequalities worsened significantly and poverty increased. Meeting last year in Washington, the region's finance ministers decided this could undo all their good work. Social objectives - to enable the poor to benefit from growth - were pushed up their agendas. Partly as a result, social issues are a high priority at this year's annual meetings of the InterAmerican Development Bank, starting today in Hamburg. Yet raising national income is a complicated task; adding specific policies to improve income distribution makes it more so. As a two-year round of presidential elections approaches in the region, the question arises of whether both issues can be tackled in the framework of economic policies still regarded favourably by investors. 'Spending more is easy; spending better is difficult,' says Mr Gustavo Marquez, a Venezuelan expert on poverty. A study from the World Bank underlines the deterioration in social conditions in the 1980s. It suggests the number of people in poverty - defined as a household income in 1985 dollars of Dollars 60 monthly - in Latin America grew from 27 per cent of the population in 1980 to 32 per cent in 1989. Other estimates suggest a more dramatic increase in poverty through the decade from 130m to 180m, two-fifths of the population. The study also suggests income inequalities grew in all except four countries: Colombia, Costa Rica, Paraguay and Uruguay. In the 1980s, the study indicates, poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean became a mainly urban rather than rural problem. More of the poor now live in cities (69m) than in the country (64m); in 1980, most of the poor lived in rural areas (53m) rather than in urban areas (39m). Most poverty is concentrated in a few countries. Brazil alone, with one-third of the population, accounts for 44 per cent of the poor. Mexico had 11 per cent and Peru 9 per cent. A further 19 per cent lived in a small group of countries including Bolivia, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras and Nicaragua. As much as 44 per cent of the total increase in poverty in the 1980s was in Brazil, and 14 per cent in Peru. Resolving the poverty issue is on the face of it simple, but in practice hugely complicated. Wealth is so concentrated in Latin America that a relatively modest sacrifice could apparently address the problem. As the World Bank's 1990 World Development Report suggested: 'Raising all the poor in the continent to just above the poverty line would cost only 0.7 per cent of regional GDP - the approximate equivalent of a 2 per cent income tax on the wealthiest fifth of the population.' Even if such taxes were levied - and, even less likely, paid - social programmes would still have to be implemented. These fall into two categories: trying to provide support to alleviate immediate suffering; and aiming at longer-term objectives, such as improving education and health standards to provide a way out of poverty. Yet Latin American experience has been that little of the money aimed directly at the poor reaches them, raising the question of how to manage poverty programmes. Furthermore, attempts to deal with issues such as health and education founder usually against the opposition of powerful vested interests such as teachers' and health workers' unions.

In the report, the  mayor expounded the guiding ideology for the Shanghai  government's legislation work in the next few years, its work  target, and main tasks.    Huang Ju said: Our basic principle for doing various fields  of work in Shanghai is to take reform as the motive force,  development as the target, make stability the foundation, and  legislation serve as the guarantee. He said: With the further  deepening of reform, economic construction in Shanghai has been  upgraded to a new level. As laws are the guarantee for the  operation of a modern market economy, we should begin from a  high starting point to undertake a project for securing  Shanghai's socialist market economic structure. Huang Ju  stressed: To carry out this "guarantee project," we must  concentrate on three tasks. This means we must draw up a plan,  establish standards for 10 areas of work, and fulfill the tasks  of drafting approximately 100 laws and regulations, enacting  them, and revising them each year. This year, Shanghai will  draw up a fairly scientific and feasible government economic  legislation plan suitable to the establishment of a socialist  economic market structure, and strengthen overall guidance and  coordination in connection with this plan. The standards for  the 10 areas of work are: 1) The establishment of a modern  enterprise system and adjustment of the relationship among the  main bodies in the market; 2) the administration and management  of state-owned assets; 3) cultivating and developing all types  of commodity markets and markets for production elements; 4)  improving and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and  control, and promoting coordinated development of the economy;  5) establishing a rational individual income distribution system  and improving the social security system; 6) opening wider to  the outside world and utilizing foreign capital; 7) accelerating  the opening up and development of the Pudong New District; 8)  developing and administering the markets intermediate  organizations; 9) accelerating urban construction and  strengthening urban administration; and 10) developing and  administering such social undertakings as science, technology,  education, culture, and public health.    Huang Ju pointed out: To strengthen the building of a legal  system by the government, we must handle the following four  relationships well: First, we must handle the relationship  between legislation and administrative law-enforcement well.  Legislation and law enforcement must not be separated because  they form an entity. While stepping up legislation work, the  government must concentrate on administrative law enforcement  and overcome the failure to abide by the law, lax law  enforcement, and letting law-breakers go free. Second, we must  handle the relationship between transforming government  functions and strengthening government law institutions well.  Third, we must handle the relationship between government law  administrative work and the launching of theoretical research on  the government's legal system. We should take advantage of  Shanghai's superiority in professional personnel to conduct a  study and exploration with the help of experts and scholars to  determine what problems need urgent solution in the course of  Shanghai's reform and opening to the outside world. Fourth, we  must handle the relationship between legal work and other  government work well. In carrying out government legal work, it  is necessary to listen to opinions from all quarters, and to  fully embody and reflect the will of the people to find a new  way of conducting government-level work by relying on social  forces. Huang Ju said: In carrying out government legal work,  such as the drawing of legislation plans, studying of problems,  and exposition of laws and regulations, it is necessary to give  full play to the role of experts. He said he welcomes more  experts to participate in government legislation work.    The conference was presided over by Vice Mayor Xu Kuangdi.  He set some requirements for implementing the guidelines of the  conference and for further strengthening government legislation  work. Xie Tianfang, director of the Office of Legal System  under the municipal government, delivered a speech on the  government's legislation tasks and legislation plans for 1994.  Shi Zhusan, vice chairman of of the municipal committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended the  conference.</p>

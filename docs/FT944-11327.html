			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Palestinian enterprise fund would aid stability Sir, I read with interest your editorial, 'White House and Casablanca' (October 31), regarding the Middle East/North Africa economic summit. I was present at the summit in Casablanca and agree whole-heartedly with the thrust of your comments on the difficulty of creating a large regional structure when there is not a consensus of opinion among the key participants. Political solutions are insufficient. Grandiose development plans will take too long. In a just and perpetual peace, the powers have to ensure there is individual economic opportunities at the grassroots level of society. This need is most acute in the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians need capital to develop their own small businesses and create jobs. The most effective vehicle I have seen in this regard has been the Enterprise Fund the US government set up to help eastern Europe's transformation. That is why I presented a proposal for a Palestinian Enterprise Fund to the leaders attending the economic summit. This concept can be put in place quickly and contribute to the stability essential for the region to attract the larger investments that will cement regional relations. Adnan M Khashoggi, Paris</p>

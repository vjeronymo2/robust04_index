			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government's view of the North Korean nuclear  issue seems to have become more optimistic than ever this new  year. Establishment of diplomatic relations between the United  States and North Korea and between Japan and North Korea has  emerged to be a new issue under the precondition of solution of  the North Korean nuclear question.    The government believes the North Korean nuclear issue will  be resolved no later than the end of the first half of the year.  Accordingly, it considers North Korea's establishment of  diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan to be the  most important issue for this year and is preparing various  measures for this.    This viewpoint of the government is based on the situation  providing three amicable conditions [segaji uhojok sanghwang].  First, the United States and North Korea have nearly reached an  agreement on the point at issue, that is, nuclear inspections by  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and resumption of  South-North dialogue. North Korea has reportedly decided to  allow the IAEA's ordinary [tongsang] inspections of its seven  reported facilities and to accede to South-North dialogue.    The United States and North Korea have already agreed to the  method of lump-sum solution which requires, along with nuclear  inspection, North Korea to resume working-level contacts for the  envoy exchange between South and North Korea, the United States  to release its schedule for the third high-level talks with  North Korea, and the ROK to announce the suspension of the Team  Spirit exercise in this new year. This means no further revised  proposal is available as the sides have extremely narrowed their  differences.    Second, North Korea has recently shown a series of changes  in  its reaction. In Kim Il-song's New Year address following the  North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's 30 December statement,  North Korea considered an agreement between the United States  and itself to be an established fact. The government analyzed  this as North Korea's new attitude that it had never showed in  the past.    Secret changes inside North Korea are worth watching in  connection with this. In particular, North Korea admitted the  failure of its economic development plan in the Supreme People's  Assembly's [SPA] meeting held last month. It has also  rearranged its internal system by deploying key members for  South-North dialogue at the front. The government attaches  significance to this fact. It believes that North Korea has  closely analyzed the effectiveness of the nuclear card during  the meeting. After the SPA meeting, North Korea changed its  inactive attitude toward dialogue with the United States, which  was just aimed at avoiding sanctions by the United Nations, and  is now very active in dialogue with the United States. The  government noted that this change was a result of North Korea's  reflection on its nuclear policy.    A senior official of the government analyzed, "The North  Korean nuclear card ends in failure. If North Korea had not  used the nuclear card, it could have achieved an earlier  establishment of diplomatic ties with the United States and  Japan." He views that as North Korea came to know this well,  the nuclear issue will be resolved after passing its final  crisis in the first half of this year. No matter what the  reason was, the United States and North Korea have reached an  agreement to resolve the issue by making mutual concessions at  the critical moment that required them to choose dialogue or  sanctions. Observers say that a U.S.-North Korean agreement has  been made though it has not yet been announced, and anticipate  that things will go on in the following order: negotiations  between the IAEA and North Korea on the nuclear inspection, an  IAEA inspection team's visit to North Korea for the nuclear  inspection, suspension of the Team Spirit exercise, an envoy  exchange between South and North Korea, and the third round of  U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. Further, it is expected  that South-North summit talks will be held when the nuclear  issue is nearly resolved.    President Kim Yong-sam said that "the North Korean nuclear  issue will be resolved early this year," and that "an important  turning point will be prepared in the new year," based on this  viewpoint.    It is true that the North Korean nuclear question has now  entered a stage of a smooth solution. It is a prevailing  observation that the Korean peninsula will ride on the thawing  tide. However, how long this trend will be maintained is still  unclear because many potential obstacles still remain. In  particular, the special [tukpyol] inspection issue to be  discussed in the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks is  delicate enough to bring North Korea's withdrawal from the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 FORMER FUJITSU SYSTEMS EMPLOYEES FILE BIAS SUIT  </P> <P> Three former Fujitsu Systems of America employees have filed a wrongful  termination lawsuit against their former employer and its Japanese parent,  alleging that they were discriminated against on the basis of race and national  origin.  </P> <P> The suit seeks up to $70 million in compensatory and punitive damages and was  filed in San Diego County Superior Court by Frank Ensign, 59, the company's  former chief financial officer; Terence Turnbull, 53, the former vice president  of marketing, and Esther White, 64, who was Ensign's executive secretary.  </P> <P> All three of the plaintiffs are Caucasians who say they lost their jobs because  they were not Japanese, their attorney, Nicholas Boylan, said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The three were among 45 Fujitsu Systems employees who were laid off in April,  1989, in what a company source described as a reorganization. The job cuts  brought the total Fujitsu Systems of America payroll down to 655 employees, of  whom 378 work in San Diego.  </P> <P> A subsidiary of Japan-based computer giant Fujitsu Ltd. with worldwide sales  off $18 billion, Fujitsu Systems of America makes point of sale terminals,  hand-held accounting systems and automated bank teller machines.  </P> <P> Boylan said his three clients were in effect subsequently replaced by Japanese  employees of Fujitsu and thus were the victims of "pernicious and malicious  race, age and national origin discrimination."  </P> <P> A Fujitsu Systems of America official who asked not to be identified said the  suit was without merit, but added that the company had not yet had a chance to  review it.  </P> <P> "(Discrimination) would be hard for them to substantiate with the new  reorganization and new job responsibilities," the official said.  </P> <P> Boylan said Ensign and Turnbull were both recruited by Fujitsu from other  companies and that both were earning salaries in excess of $150,000 at the time  of the layoff.  </P></p>

The purpose of this document is to lay the foundations for  close and long-term cooperation in studying radiation hazards to  human health and to the environment.    Russia and the United States will jointly study the  aftermaths of the exposure of humans to ionising radiations,  will organise the collection and processing of data on radiation  hazards, will study the environment, and will conduct  corresponding scientific research.    A joint coordination committee will be set up to study the  after-effects of radiation. The document notes that the sides  shall ensure an adequate and effective protection of  intellectual property, created or handed over under the current  agreement, and conclude corresponding accords on its  implementation.    The agreement will remain in force for five years, subject  to  repeated prolongation for the same term.</p>

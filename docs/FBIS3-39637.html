			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Meanwhile the satellite war between  Norway and Sweden continues. We've reported before on Norway's  purchase of Britain's Marco Polo-2 satellite, which was  repositioned at 1 degree west and renamed Thor. [passage  omitted]    On the other hand, the Swedish Space Corporation and Swedish  Telecom have succeeded in buying the Marco Polo-1 satellite and  is moving to position it together with Sweden's Tele-X at 5  degrees east. The Norwegians tried to block the sale in the  British courts, since the two Marco Polo satellites operate on  the same frequencies, and being placed so close together there  may be interference. Since Sweden holds the rights to the  frequencies and Norway doesn't, that's also a problem for the  Norwegians. The move even prompted Norway to shift from the  obscure D-MAC system for the Thor channels to the much more  common D2-MAC system.    Now, a consortium in Malaysia is threatening to sue British  Sky Broadcasting for selling the satellite to the Swedes. The  Malaysians say they offered more, but Sky wouldn't sell because  the satellite would have been competition for Star TV, the huge  Asian satellite broadcaster owned by the same company that owns  Sky.    So far, the Swedish Space Corporation hasn't said what  channels may be on its new satellite, which has been renamed  Sirius. It's been moving from its old position and should have  passed Thor yesterday and should be in its final position on 20  February.    And now, the latest crazy twist to the story. The four  largest Nordic cable operators, including Swedish Telecom's  cable company, and counterparts in Norway and Denmark, and the  Helsinki Media Company from Finland, have started a joint  company to distribute satellite channels via the Intelsat  positioned with Thor. The new company is called Nordic  Satellite Distribution, and hopes to compete with Astra. Claes  Gustavsson is information director at Swedish Telecom's cable  subsidiary.    [Begin recording] [Gustavsson] Well, what we're doing is  we're trying to bring the four largest companies in Scandinavia  together, actually the largest cable TV operator in each country  together, and form a large company that will be stronger, a  stronger unit in every sense, to just get a better programming  out for everybody and see if we can work together.    [Unidentified correspondent] So you'll be picking up TV  channels and relaying them over the Intelsat-702 satellite which  is being launched later this year?    [Gustavsson] Yeah, that's what we're going to do. And  actually we're trying to, you know, we're entering into this, to  the DTH [direct to home] (?or) satellite dish market with this,  and see if we can get everything to come out from just one  position. So, today, probably most households of Sweden needs  probably at least three different dishes or one motorized one,  to get probably the 10 most popular channels, but by doing this  they can get everything from one position.    [Correspondent] How many channels are you planning on  relaying?    [Gustavsson] Oh, as many as possible -- we're not, you know,  we don't know at this point, but this, of course, is also  looking into digital compression and what's going to happen with  that.    [Correspondent] What channels are you planning on?    [Gustavsson] Actually everything we carry now, whatever is  available in Sweden or in Denmark and Finland, plus the largest  channels there are, CNN, BBC, etc., the movie channels, probably  the 30 most popular channels in Scandinavia.    [Correspondent] So you must be taking the entire capacity of  that satellite, if you're going to carry 30 channels?    [Gustavsson] Well, that has to do, of course, with digital  compression and how that's going to work and how long this will  take.    [Correspondent] So, you're putting all this in at 1 degree  west, but there's already a satellite at 1 degree west, Thor,  which is actually owned by Norwegian Telecom, who offer a packet  of channels, so you'll be competing with them.    [Gustavsson] Well, the way we look, at this point we're not  looking at competing with anybody, we're more looking at as, as,  well, as trying to widen or broaden the market and get much more  households involved, that's what we're trying to do right now,  so we're just basically meeting with everybody and see how we  can work together to get more people to either have, you know,  satellite dishes or cable TV.    [Correspondent] (?Because) meanwhile over at 5 degrees east  we've got Sweden's Tele-X satellite and Swedish Telecom and the  Space Corporation have bought and are moving the Marco Polo-1  satellite there, they're going to call it Sirius and offer a  satellite package as well. So it seems like we've got two  different Scandinavian hot bird positions competing against  themselves here.    [Gustavsson] Yeah, that's how it looks right now, but what  we're doing is just basically meeting and discussing how to, you  know, how to make this as, as possible for the customers and  just trying to look at it as a way of developing the market and  take a step forward there, instead of looking at it as a  situation of competition at this point.    [Correspondent] When are you planning on actually beginning  operations?    [Gustavsson] Well, we're hoping for this fall at the latest.  But right now, well, like I said, we're meeting with everybody  and then negotiating and then (?talking), getting through (?to  your) additional parts etc, and trying to see where we stand.

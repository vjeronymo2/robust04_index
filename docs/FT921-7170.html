			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Arts: A test for taste and political judgment - The debate on the future of London is only just beginning / Architecture Who is on the side of the angels? At this time politicians of all parties would like us to believe that they have hot lines to the Almighty and that the future of the country will be safe with them. When it comes to architecture and the environment there is one body which is supposed to be apolitical in its dealings and that is The Royal Fine Art Commission. It has arranged an exhibition* to commemorate the work of the Commission since 1924. The title of the exhibition, On the side of the angels? at least poses the question. From the evidence selected for the exhibition, sometimes the Commission has been on the side of the angels and sometimes it has not. The RFAC inevitably suffers from the heavy presence of architects on its panels who are often unwilling and, when you think about it, unlikely to want to criticise their fellow professionals. The current chairman of the Commission, Lord St John of Fawsley, seems to have emphasised the 'Royal' rather than the 'Fine Art' side of the Commission. In his foreword to the exhibition catalogue he lists with positive glee the number of times he has entertained members of the Royal family - speaking of their visits as 'unforgettable days'. This is no doubt part of his job, but the actual grind of raising standards and awareness is a more boring and less gracious activity. The Commission has no real powers and so the catalogue of its achievements makes interesting but not crucial reading. What is far more crucial is the work and thought that are going on in the offices and think tanks of our political parties. If it is true that the environmental and architectural quality of the capital can be seen as a sort of litmus paper - a test for taste and political judgment - then it is worth considering how the parties see London and its future. In a slightly covert way the Labour party has produced its thoughts on London as a private enterprise Penguin book rather than part of a political manifesto (A New London by Richard Rogers and Mark Fisher, Penguin Books, Pounds 8.99). It is the second contribution from Mr Fisher, the MP for Stoke on Trent, who also recently edited a series of essays on the state of our cities (Whose Cities? edited by Mark Fisher and Ursula Owen, Penguin Books, Pounds 5.99). The red rose joins the penguin in promoting Labour's ideas; how long will it be before the rose is firmly held in the penguin's beak? The Conservative party is preparing its answers about London and to date the most convincing statement of its intentions for the capital remains the lecture arranged by London Weekend Television and given by Michael Heseltine last December, entitled 'The Future of London'. The evidence of Conservative thinking of the last decade about the capital is, of course, also all around those of us who live in or visit the capital. By any standards the results of the free market and the political effects of the abolition of the Greater London Council in 1985 are decidedly mixed. The creation of the Enterprise Zone in London's Docklands and the establishment of the London Docklands Development Corporation provide the best visible evidence of Conservative policies for the capital. The results in visual and planning terms, especially if judged as contributions to improving the standards of life for ordinary mortals living in east London, are pretty disastrous. In their book Richard Rogers and Mark Fisher offer a powerful contribution to the debate about cities. They offer the intriguing scenario of a Europe dominated by what would amount to a series of city states. As national boundaries change overnight and politicians and their followers swing in eastern Europe with the abandonment of monkeys, perhaps the future of civilisation will return to powerful urban fiefdoms run like the old Venetian Republic. The opportunities are certainly there in Berlin, Prague, St Petersburg and Warsaw, not to mention the beautiful old towns of the Baltic that were once part of the Hanseatic League. London, however you compare it with other European cities, has a lot to offer. What it lacks at present is any clear vision for its future. Michael Heseltine sees that as a financial centre London is well ahead in Europe, although it lags behind New York and Tokyo. As a civilised city to live in London certainly scores higher than either New York or Tokyo. As an architectural and cultural city London is still outclassed only by Paris. No one can claim that any of the new developments in Docklands have significantly added to our architectural heritage. Those who praise the American-style Canary Wharf should realise that it offers what should be the basic minimum standards for any commercial development. What is so exceptional about marble and fountains? Londoners should demand them, not be asked to praise them as gifts from god-like developers. The Rogers/Fisher book and the Heseltine offering both share certain objectives while disagreeing about how to reach them. More attention to be paid to the River Thames? - this is an area where all could agree. New commercial developments to the east of the city? - surely only if the quid pro quo is an incredible improvement in the deplorable housing stock in too many London boroughs. New transport policies? - all agree that these are needed, but who is to pay? A new London government? - is there a place for another GLC that was spending one billion pounds, when it was abolished, on only seven per cent of the capital's services? Again, who is to pay? One perpetually recurring but relatively minor problem has been the need for a new life for Somerset House, one of the great public buildings in the city yet at present still mainly occupied by civil servants. Heseltine has asked for ideas and a prompt response came last week from a newly formed Somerset House Group. This is a gathering of cultural, educational and business organisations brought together under the auspices of King's College and The Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture to prepare exciting plans for this wasted palace on the Thames. Their initial offerings for multiple cultural use look promising. The debate about the future of London is just beginning. The important thing is that the subject is now high on the political and architectural agenda - where it belongs. *The Royal Fine Art Commission, 7 St James's Square, until next weekend.</p>

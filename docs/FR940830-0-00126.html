In such cases, the payment of the $5 service charge per claim or site is due upon filing the certification statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Payment of the maintenance fee for mining claims covered by a deferment of assessment work granted by the authorized officer pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 28 (b)&hyph;(e) and subpart 3852 of this title may be deferred during the period for which the deferment is granted. Deferments are governed by the following rule. If a petition for a deferment of assessment work, as required by &sect;3852.2 of this title, is filed with the proper BLM office on or before August 31 for a given year, the maintenance fee need not be paid on the claims listed in the petition for deferment until the authorized officer has acted upon the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If the petition is granted, maintenance fees for the claims are deferred for the upcoming assessment year. At the expiration of the deferment, all deferred fees shall be paid within 30 days of the end of the deferment, unless the claimant/owner qualifies as a small miner. If the claimant/owner qualifies as a small miner, all deferred assessment work shall be performed as provided in &sect;3852.5 of this title upon expiration of the deferment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the petition for deferment is denied by the authorized officer, the maintenance fees shall be paid within 30 days of receipt of the decision of the authorized officer denying the petition for deferment. Failure to pay the maintenance fees owed will result in the forfeiture of the claims contained within the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) On mining claims for which an application for a mineral patent has been filed, and the mineral entry has been allowed, the payment of the maintenance fee is excused for the assessment years during which assessment work is not required pursuant to &sect;3851.5 of this title. However, no refund of previously deposited maintenance fees will be made to the mineral patent applicant. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 30.

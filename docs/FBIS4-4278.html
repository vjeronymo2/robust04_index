			<p>BFN     [Text] Taipei, April 28 KYODO--Taiwan's Transportation and  Communications Minister Liu Chao-shiun on Thursday [28 April]  said that the government will instruct China Airlines to  sufficiently improve its safety measures in the wake of its  jetliner crash at Nagoya airport in central Japan, which killed  263 people.    Liu, speaking at a cabinet meeting, said if the national  flag  carrier fails to implement the instruction demand within a  specific period, the government may suspend some of its routes.    Li also said the government will take some disciplinary  measures against China Airlines in connection with the Tuesday  crash.    Earlier in the day, President Li Teng-hui reportedly told a  meeting of the Central Committee of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist  Party (Kuomintang) that a special committee has been set up  within the Transportation and Communications Ministry to  supervise corrective measures to be undertaken by China Airlines  in the aftermath of the crash.    All but eight of the aircraft's 271 passengers and crew,  mostly Japanese and Taiwanese, were killed in the crash of the  Airbus A300- 600R, arriving in Nagoya from Taipei. Two of the  survivors are Taiwanese.    It was the fifth China Airlines crash since 1986 and the  11th  since 1969, giving the airline a significantly higher ratio of  crashes per flight hours than the world average.    Many of the crashes, in which a total of 410 people have  died, involved human error.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG REGULATION BALANCES OVER FLIMSIER SAFETY NET  </P> <P> In the early 1960s, popular magazines were full of complaints about the  regulation of prescription drugs. Saturday Review demanded that "a  disinterested agency" take charge of judging "the 'cures' that flood the  market." Harper's warned of inadequate clinical testing, attacked lax standards  and corruption at the Food and Drug Administration and expressed the hope that  tighter regulation "may lead to a substantial reduction in the number of new  preparations marketed every year."  </P> <P> This month's Reader's Digest also has an article complaining about the  regulation of prescription drugs. It's headlined "Why Can't We Get the Medicine  We Need?" Excessive bureaucracy and caution -- even corruption -- at the FDA  are keeping vital drugs off the market, the author charges. She demands that  Congress "repeal the agency's authority to review drug efficacy" because "the  relative merits of drugs . . . are . . . personal decisions."  </P> <P> There's just no pleasing some people. Widespread sentiments like the ones  quoted above, plus the Thalidomide scandal, led in 1962 to a law requiring the  FDA to certify that new drugs are effective as well as merely safe. Now, led by  AIDS activists, popular sentiment is swinging back the other way. And the FDA  has responded by drastically short-circuiting its approval process for some  drugs.  </P> <P> America's elephantine drug-approval policy is an example of our society's  immature attitude toward risk. Life is inherently risky; reducing one risk  often increases others, yet at any given time we tend to focus on only one side  of the equation. In order to reduce to absolute zero the risk of a Thalidomide  catastrophe, we have created a system that denies sick people helpful  medicines.  </P> <P> This happens in three ways. First, people suffer and die needlessly while  medicines go through the FDA process (which until recently took an average of  eight years). Second, medicines that could meet FDA standards never get the  chance because the process is too costly (typically $100 million). Third, the  government's standards are simply too high. Once a drug is established as safe,  why should it also have to be proven effective before people can get it? In the  case of fatal diseases, why must a drug even be proven perfectly safe?  </P> <P> Washington VIPs, when struck with some serious disease, often seem to surface  in experimental programs at the National Institutes of Health. Sometimes they  undergo miraculous recoveries. More often, probably, they die anyway. But that  doesn't stop others from trying to get in. And why not? Under the  circumstances, clutching at straws makes perfect sense. Still, if the rules  that keep these experimental drugs off the market are for our own good, why is  it that political big shots are getting them at the NIH rather than, say,  prisoners or real estate agents?  </P> <P> And yet these days the above complaints are old hat. At least in the case of  AIDS drugs, virtually anybody can get into an experimental treatment program.  There is something called "treatment IND," which means a vastly expanded  official testing program. And both the FDA and the NIH have endorsed the  concept of a "parallel track" of "community-based" testing, which is little  more than letting doctors give the drug to their patients in the ordinary  course of treatment.  </P> <P> In short, the FDA is managing to get risky drugs to desperate patients without  having to admit that it is lowering its standards. Obviously, however, an  elaborate testing program becomes largely superfluous if every potential  customer gets to participate in the test.  </P> <P> By evading its own excessive standards instead of simply lowering them (or  asking Congress to lower them), the FDA is helping us all to keep avoiding a  sensible decision about the risk-benefit trade-off. It is still too hard to get  a new medicine with a normal prescription, but it may be getting too easy to  get one as part of an "experiment." Some day there will be another Thalidomide,  and the public, which is now clamoring for increased access to new drugs, will  clamor with equal passion for increased protection from them. I would not want  to be the FDA commissioner forced to explain that the thousands of victims were  simply voluntary participants in a testing program.  </P> <P> By all means, let's amend the law to get rid of the efficacy requirement. But  understand that this means billions of dollars will be wasted on useless  remedies, and that some people will be enticed to forgo better alternatives.  Let's even relax our standards of safety a bit, so drugs can get to market  quicker and cheaper. But understand that a flimsier safety net means that more  dangerous drugs will fall through it. Above all, let's stop going from one  extreme to the other.  </P></p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Books: A right royal background THE QUEEN by Kenneth Harris Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 341 pages Walter Bagehot was a lucky man. When he wrote The English Constitution, in 1867 including the famous section on the monarchy, he could have had no idea that Queen Victoria would go through a period of intense unpopularity, yet survive to be mourned as a supreme national symbol in 1901. Still less could he have known that succeeding kings and queens would take his words as holy writ. In 1894 the future George V was given a Cambridge tutor in constitutional history. Bagehot was almost the sole text. The king-to-be wrote in his notes that kingship in Britain is 'still a great political force and offers a splendid career to an able monarch'. George VI was steeped in Bagehot too and so, in those years before close heirs to the throne went to school, was the present queen. The key passage is that the sovereign has three rights: the right to be consulted, the right to encourage and the right to warn. Those rights have remained gospel, accepted by monarchs and prime ministers alike. At least until the late 1980s, when family troubles began to beset her, Queen Elizabeth II was a very lucky woman. She was named Elizabeth not after Elizabeth I, but after her mother. Probably she would not have become queen without the abdication of Edward VIII, and she would not have reached the throne so young without the premature death of her father George VI. She did so at a time of hope. 'It may well be', prime minister Churchill said of her Commonwealth coronation tour in 1953, 'that the journey the Queen is about to take will be no less auspicious and the treasure she brings back no less bright than when Drake first sailed an English ship around the world.' Over 40 years later, at the very least she has stuck to the Bagehot rules when much around her has changed or collapsed. One of the biggest changes of all, Kenneth Harris points out, has been in the royal family itself. 'When she became Queen, there were only her mother, her sister, her husband and herself. By the mid-80s there were at least 20 royals.' It is the proliferation of lesser royals, rather than the monarchy as part of the constitution, that has caused problems. Harris suggests that his book, simply called The Queen, is not so much a biography, more a way of life. 'The Queen: her background and times' might be a more pretentious title, yet it would be more accurate. The book falls into three unequal parts. The first, best and longest covers her upbringing and her recent ancestry and family influences. The second is a summary of what has happened in the last 30 years or so. The third is a fairly anodyne epilogue of the author's thoughts on the monarchy. To a retentive memory, there will be little that is new, though even good memories need to be jogged. I had forgotten, for example, that there is still an unanswered question about how much the Queen was told of the preparations for Suez in 1956. She might have been expected to warn against the operation. As for judgments, Harris treads successfully what Kenneth Baker once called 'the narrow strip of land that lies between sycophancy and rebellion'. 'So long as she is there,' he concludes, 'the monarchy seems secure.' Then he predicates a new lease of life from Prince Charles. That seems to me dangerous ground. Practically all predictions about the future of the British monarchy have been wrong and, like Victoria, the present queen may last a very long time.</p>

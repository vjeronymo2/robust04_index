			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin's address to the parliament has opened  a new page in the mutual relations between the head of the state  and the legislative power, believes presidential aide Georgiy  Satarov.    In his exclusive interview with Interfax he pointed out that  coordination of these structures' activity has actually begun.  "The main thing which is being carried out in this aspect is  coordination of economic platforms contained in the address and  developed at the hearings in the State Duma's Economic Policy  Committee."    Satarov reported that a joint work, being fulfilled by  leader  of the group of presidential economic experts Aleksandr Livshits  and head of the parliament's lower chamber Sergey Glazyev, has  started. In addition, other members of the "presidential team"  also undertake joint moves together with representatives of the  Duma's other committees.    Following the analysis of the situation after the adoption  of  the State Duma resolution on amnesty, the parliamentary  structures have found a new model of interaction, noted Satarov.    "There is an agreement to create permanent working groups.  Their task is to make active the initial stage of preparation  of the most important legislative acts," he said. The question  concerns, for example, federal constitutional laws, he explained  and added that, as a rule, contradictions preventing efficient  work appear at the initial stage. "We have discussed the new  model of interaction with the Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin. I  highly appreciate his statement during his recent meeting with  Yeltsin when Rybkin said that the presidential and legislative  structures have never before worked in such a close  coordination," stressed Satarov.    In his opinion, "this spirit of a team" should become a  norm.  "The cliche -- president plus parliament equals confrontation --  is left in the past. The barricades on the way to a normal work  have not been entirely removed, however, they do not appeal to  anybody any more," underlined Satarov.    The democratic society on the way to formation can propose  quite unusual "scenarios," said Satarov. For example, there may  be situations when such forces as the president, parliament, and  government will be forced to bar by some other means than  earlier. [sentence as received] For example, the president and  Duma will be forced to oppose the government on several issues,  said Satarov.    Satarov also reported that in the near term the State Duma  would receive a package of bills, 50 in number, which Boris  Yeltsin proposes to consider in the parliament's lower chamber  this year. As he said, these documents can be divided into three  blocks.    The first one is connected with the continuation of the  juridical reform and includes the Civil and Criminal Codes,  several decrees on labor, magistrates, etc. The "economic"  block is devoted to the bank system, to problems of securities,  exchanges, and audits. The third package of documents concerns  measures connected with building of a democratic society and, in  particular, with legislature on political parties.    The president offers to the State Duma not only the list but  the priority to consider these documents, explained Satarov. In  the first block Yeltsin draws attention of deputies to the need  to consider the Civil Code and legislative initiatives closely  related to crime fighting.    Satarov said that among priority problems of the economic  reform Yeltsin enumerates a package of acts connected with  reformation of the bank activity and creation of Federal reserve  system.    "If we could judge from the sharpness of debates to be waged  around the contents of the third package, the draft decree on  political parties will obviously become the central one,"  believes Satarov. Uncontrolled growth of parties, peculiar to  Russia, becomes "a destabilizing factor in the life of the  society," he said. The lawmaking itself should stimulate such a  development of multiparty trends which will channel the process  along the way of formation of a small number of strong parties,  said Satarov.</p>

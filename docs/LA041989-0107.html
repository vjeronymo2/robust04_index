			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLAN PRESENTED TO RECRUIT, RETAIN MINORITIES AT UCI  </P> <P> Latino students, faculty and staff at UC Irvine on Tuesday presented a 43-point  plan for recruiting and retaining under-represented minorities at the  university and vowed to work with administration officials to diversify the  campus.  </P> <P> The plan, which stressed cooperation, calls for better communication between  university officials and Latino organizations to identify prominent minority  candidates for jobs, add a Chicano Studies major to the curriculum, and  increase grant and fellowship help for Latino graduate students.  </P> <P> "What we are doing is not idealism anymore. . . . It's not 'Chicano Power,' "  said Gerardo Mouet, president of the La Raza Assn., a Latino organization  established in 1976. "It's practical and good for everyone because of the  demographic realities of the state of California."  </P> <P> The 23-page report also suggests ways to "personalize" recruitment and  competition for qualified minority high school students.  </P> <P> "The most important part of this effort is faculty involvement," Mouet said.  "For example, if we have a black high school senior with a very good  grade-point average who has applied for mechanical engineering at UCI, we hook  him up with a professor in the area he's interested in. If one of our top  professors calls this young man and says, 'I would be interested in seeing you  work in my lab,' we've got that kid."  </P> <P> Another Latino student organization, MECHa, joined in a news conference to  present the report Tuesday. MECHa co-chair Luis Chavez, who also took part in a  minority student protest last week at UCI, said La Raza's report is more likely  to prompt action by UCI administrators.  </P> <P> "Last time, it was a protest," Chavez said Tuesday. "Now, we're asking to be  incorporated into the process."  </P> <P> Other recommendations by La Raza included:  </P> <P> *Establishment of an endowed Latino chair that would go to a different faculty  member and a different college or department within the university each year.  </P> <P> *Creation of a UCI Library special collection in Chicano-Latino studies.  </P> <P> *Establishing goals for recruitment of Chicano-Latino doctoral students by  every academic department.  </P> <P> *A requirement that corporations invited to build facilities in UCI's planned  research park should be required to pass an affirmative action test in their  hiring policies.  </P> <P> *Establishing mentor programs linking graduate students with freshmen and  sophomore minority students in each academic department.  </P></p>

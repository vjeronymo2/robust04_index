			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ho Chinming; from the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] In answering an interpellation at the Legislative  Yuan, President of the Executive Yuan Lien Chan yesterday [25  February] said there are many possibilities for the  reunification of China in the future. A federation [lien pang]  or confederation [pang lien] should be considered as a way.  However, he believed that, under the condition that Communist  China still takes an ossified policy toward Taiwan and  disregards the fact that we are a political entity, Communist  China will not be ready to leap one hundred steps and instantly  discuss the system of a federation or confederation.    Legislator Chao Shao-kang expressed his view during an  interpellation at the Legislative Yuan yesterday that, under the  situation of close economic and trade relations between the two  sides of the strait, with the amount of bilateral trade  exceeding the amount of trade with the United States and Japan,  it is extremely unwise for the two sides to contend with each  other in diplomatic and military affairs. He asked the  government to change the current conservative, shrinking, and  defensive policy toward the mainland and to readjust our  strategy and adopt a positive and active mainland policy so our  side can take an offensive as well as a defensive position in  dealing with Communist China. Therefore, he advocated  establishing the Republic of the Chinese Federation [chung hua  lien pang kung ho kuo] through cross-strait talks. Although  Communist China may object, we can at least shift the problem to  Communist China.    Premier Lien Chan said the relationship between the two  sides  of the strait is a crucial political issue for the country at  present and in the future. Judging from the view of our country  and nation, the present vicious contention between the two sides  of the strait in the political, economic, military and other  fields and the situation of a life-and-death struggle [ni su wo  huo ti chu mien] are merely squandering away the resources of  the country and is very unsatisfactory. Therefore, he held that  taking the initiative to design a political structure, planning  national development in the future, and thinking about the  future path of the Republic of China are all good ideas. He  also affirmed Chao Shao-kang's suggestion on forming a  federation. He held that it is quite creative.    In addition, in answering an interpellation, Premier Lien  Chan also said that the so-called summit meeting is merely for  stressing each other's stand and cannot solve practical  problems. Therefore the problems between the two sides of the  strait should still be handled in a rational and good-will  manner, and in this way we can naturally have a bright future.  Meanwhile, he held that the idea of a federation or  confederation is not the direction for reunification in the  future. In answering an interpellation by Chao Shao-kang,  Premier Lien said:    [Begin recording] [Lien] The future reunification of China  may take many forms. However, a confederation [pang lien] or  federation [lien pang] may be accepted after all as a way for  consideration. The Soviet Union was an example of the  unification of states in modern times. In past decades, we have  seen many such examples in the United Nations. [end recording]    In fact, the policy toward the mainland became the  legislators' focal point of concern in the general  interpellation of government administration on 25 February.  Earlier, Legislator Ting Shou-chung had a wonderful dialogue  with Premier Lien Chan on the possibility of holding a summit  between the two sides of the strait.    [Begin recording] [Ting] I solemly suggest that the  president should immediately hold a cross-strait summit with  Deng Xiaoping. To go out to the world, Taiwan's leader must  first have the courage to face Communist China. We have seen  that President Li can avoid sensitive questions, disregard  status and formalities, and go abroad to hold talks with leaders  of the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand and exchange  experiences on national construction. Why can he not hold  dialogs with leaders on the mainland with the same sentiment and  tolerance and in the same informal way?    [Li] I personally always think that summit meetings cannot  solve problems. The government leaders only express their  stands and stress their own particular viewpoints in summit  meetings. They cannot possibly solve any practical thing. [end  recording]    Generally speaking, Premier Lien's view on a policy for  cross-strait relations is still consistently the same, that is,  the relations between the two sides of the strait should be  two-sided. Our side has already shown enough sincerity, but so  far the government still has not felt any goodwill from  Communist China in response. Therefore, the current policy  toward the mainland still should not be changed rashly.</p>

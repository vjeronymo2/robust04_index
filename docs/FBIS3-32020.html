In a press communique, the  Senate, [especially] the ACP and the members elected 18 January  [1993], has ordered the executive to choose a new prime minister  within 48 hours after the 28 January publication of the  communique.    The Senate of the Republic reminds the Haitian nation that  on  15 December 1993 the government of former Prime Minister Robert  Malval officially tendered its resignation. The courageous  Haitian citizens battling with misery and all kinds of  calamities have vainly expected the designation of a new head of  government who would truly look into their problems. The  communique says that up to now, instead of constitutional  actions aimed at putting the Republic back on track, our  brothers who are our official representatives at the parliament  have experienced trickery designed to perpetuate the unhealthy  situation in which the country is still immersed. An example is  Colin Granderson's letter of 12 January, sent to Robert Malval  to inform him of his decision to have the initial elements of  the UN/OAS International Civilian Mission return to Haiti.    The Senate of the Republic energetically protests these  tricks that Haiti's so-called friends have had fun playing, and  focuses on Article 98.3 of the Constitution that requires  international treaties and conventions to be submitted first to  parliament for approval or rejection.    The Senate reaffirms its determination as a responsible  institution to control closely the actions taking place in the  country, especially in this period of executive power vacuum. It  believes it must also point out to the other powers and  concerned authorities that if the executive power does not  designate, within the next 48 hours, a new prime minister, who  will have to be received shortly by parliament, the latter will  be obliged to make the necessary decisions to safeguard national  sovereignty.    This note is signed by 14 senators, including ACP members,  and 18 elected parliamentarians, excepting Senator Serge Gilles.</p>

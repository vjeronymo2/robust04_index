			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Ashdown's heartland voters remain unconvinced: As the Liberal Democrats finished their annual conference this week Roland Adburgham visited the party's stronghold area of south-west England. He spoke to a cross-section of people in the Somerset town of Bridgwater to gauge their views on the performance of the party THE BATTLE of Sedgemoor was fought near Bridgwater in Somerset in 1685, and the town's pub names such as Cross Rifles, Volunteer Arms and the Rebels' Retreat keep the memory alive. The town is as good a place as any from which to view the ebb and flow of British politics during the conference season. A small cross-section of the more politically interested Bridgwater voters assessed the Liberal Democrat performance this week. All accepted that Mr Ashdown's message was that there was a 'dangerous gulf' between the government and the governed in Britain. But the conference left most of the panel unconvinced that Mr Ashdown could turn protest into power. Mrs Beatrice Forber, who lives in retirement with her lieutenant-colonel husband on the edge of the Quantock Hills, described the conference as 'the best and most professional they've ever had - brimming with self-confidence'. But it won't shake her support for the Conservatives. 'There are so many holes in their rhetoric,' she said. 'They only see the dream and not the long-term cost.' Mr Ian Weston, a former RAF pilot who runs InterWorld Travel, a Bridgwater travel agency, thought the conference dull. 'There was a lot of rhetoric we've all heard before: 'We're on the verge of a breakthrough, come on chaps, one more push.' It hasn't happened before and probably won't' Only the converted thought the party would move forward. Mr Hugh Barran, a Bridgwater solicitor who supports the Liberal Democrats, said: 'Paddy Ashdown spoke very well. He used to speak in long-winded sentences, but now he speaks very well.' Mr Allan Challenger, a psychiatric social worker, was more sceptical. 'On the surface he is the most attractive of the three leaders, but he is not a man of great principle. My impression of all the party conferences in the last four years is that they are very stage-managed.' Ms Glen Burrows, who works for the county social services and is a shop steward for Unison, the public services union, was even more dismissive. 'Paddy Ashdown is prepared to sacrifice any principles for political power, which is typical of the Liberal Democrats,' she said. 'When Mr Ashdown talks of his party's councillors behaving responsibly, it means accepting underfunding and cutting jobs. It means playing to the government's tune.' Mr Challenger thought it 'a real trap' that the Liberal Democrats had to try to win votes from both Conservative and Labour camps. Like most of the others, he thought Mr Ashdown's attack on waste and council overstaffing was a sop to seek Tory votes. Mr Weston thought it was inconsistent with some Liberal Democrat policies which would increase bureaucracy. 'It is wholly electioneering,' said Mrs Forber. Mr Weston was also dubious about the Liberal Democrat bandwagon in Somerset in parliamentary terms. 'People in Somerset are very parochial and there is a big gap in consciousness between a local council and parliament,' he said. 'I have an open mind on how I will vote,' he added. 'But, from what I've heard this week, I am not persuaded that the Liberal Democrats are sensible people to run the country.' Roland Adburgham will visit the same panel of voters to gauge their reaction to the Labour party conference.</p>

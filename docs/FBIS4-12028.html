			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 29 March  issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Report on Violence in Asyut    2. Alexandria University Teaching Club Elections    3. Article by Muslim Brotherhood Official Dr. Ahmat  al-Malat    4. Criticism of the Movie "The Terrorist"    5. Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali Column    6. Reaction to Ban on Shaykh 'Abd-al-Kafi Sermons    7. Article on Land Day  <H5>  REPORT ON VIOLENCE IN ASYUT </H5>   On page 4, the newspaper publishes a 2,000-report by Qutb  al-'Arabi on the ongoing confrontation between the security  forces and the Islamic groups in Asyut. The report notes that  violence has escalated in Asyut in the past three months, with  armed operations against the police increasing from six  operations in January, to nine in February, to 18 operations in  March. Over 50 people, including policemen, citizens, and  Islamic group members, have been killed and over 70 others have  been wounded in these operations. The report then tries to  explain the reasons for this escalation, putting the blame  squarely on the government's heavy-handed policy. The report  says "the leaders of the Islamic current in Asyut (Labor  Party-Muslim Brotherhood) believe that the reduction of violence  in Asyut must take place within the framework of a comprehensive  solution that will establish real pluralism and democracy and  allow and decriminalize freedom of political action."  "Moreover, moderate Islamic leaders believe that the haphazard  arrest of citizens in Asyut, their detention as hostages, their  harsh treatment, and the blockade of residential quarters  encourage the escalation of violence and the formation of a  strong front supporting it." The report notes that these  government tactics "feed the industry of violence" in Asyut. It  calls for lifting the blockade on al- Walidiyah quarter and  allowing freedom of movement for its inhabitants.  <H5>  ALEXANDRIA UNIVERSITY TEACHING CLUB ELECTIONS </H5>   In an 800-word report on page 4 by 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad,  the  newspaper says that "despite strong government pressure and  overt rigging", the Islamists won 6 seats in the elections for  the board of directors of the teaching club of Alexandria  University. The government ticket won the remaining eight seats  while the leftist ticket won no seats. The report identifies  the elected Islamist members of the teaching club as Dr. 'Umar  al-Barbari, Dr. 'Abd-al- 'Aziz Salamah, Dr. Mustafa Abu-al-Huda,  Dr. Mustafa Abu-al-'Aynayn, Dr. al-Masiri, and Dr. Nabil  al-Mulukhiyah.  <H5>  ARTICLE BY MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD OFFICIAL DR. AHMAD AL-MALAT </H5>   On page 5, the newspaper publishes a 1,500-word article by  Muslim Brotherhood official Dr. Ahmad al-Malat. Referring to  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron, al-Malat deplores the  weakness of the Muslims who now receive "blow after blow" and  "slap after slap," without doing anything. He adds that  "regrettably, the media, including the Egyptian media, have not  paid any attention to this tragedy, as if it was an earthquake  that happened in a remote place and did not harm us in any way."  The media have maintained their "trivia" and their "deliberate  defiance of Islamic values." "The last days of Ramadan were  celebrated with dancing, nakedness, and entertainment. The  Koran's share on the radio were a few minutes every day while  'Adawiyah [a folklore singer] got the lion's share." The  writer goes on to say that all the Arab governments without  exception have become "defeatist", running after the "mirage of  peace" which they are worshiping instead of God.  <H5>  CRITICISM OF THE MOVIE "THE TERRORIST" </H5>   On page 9, the newspaper carries a 900-word critique by  Sharif Samih of the movie "The Terrorist," played by famous  Egyptian actor-comedian 'Adil Imam. Samih says "the movie  represents the Interior Ministry's view of terrorism. It deals  with this issue "very superficially" and without trying to  identify the roots of the problem. He goes on to say that if  the movie's message is to entertain and kill two hours of time,  then it has succeeded, but of its message is to fight terrorism,  then it has failed. Samih says the move has no relation to  reality and is based on a fabricated scenario. The audience are  only attracted by 'Adil Imam's acting abilities and by the  "sexual jokes" in the movie.    Also on page 9, reader Muhsin Mahmud Amin Sarhan from the  College of Sciences says the movie "The Terrorist" offers an  alternative slogan to the slogan "Islam is the solution. The  alternative slogan is "Corruption is the solution" because the  movie urges us to emulate the "immoral and dissolute Western  civilization."  <H5>  SHAYKH MUHAMMAD AL-GHAZALI COLUMN </H5>   In his 800-word column "This Is Our Religion" on page 12,  Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali criticizes an article headlined  "Religion and Ideology" by counselor Muhammad Sa'id al-'Ashmawi.  Al-Ghazali notes that al-'Ashmawi's article is "vague" and  "deliberately creates confusion" between heavenly and  terrestrial religions. He says al-'Ashmawi equates Buddhism and  Hinduism with Islam and Christianity. Wihout offering a  counteropinion, he also takes al-'Ashmawi to task for saying  that "Islam is a religion, while the doctrines embraced by some  groups are ideology." Referring to the British Parliament's  passage of a law reducing the age of consent among homosexuals  to 18, al-Ghazali asks whether the religious people who oppose  this legislation do harm to God or interere in politics. He  also asks if this "abnormal" legislation is adopted in the Arab  world, will we blame the pious youths if they oppose it? He  then says that the Koran is an immortal book that specifies the  following punishment for those who commit adultery: "Flog each  of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in  their case, in a matter prescribed by God, if ye believe in God  and the last day."  <H5>  REACTION TO BAN ON 'ABD-AL-KAFI SERMONS </H5>   On page 12, the newspaper publishes an 800-word article by  writer Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus entitled "Blatant Injustice."  The writer says the ruling regime has committed grave mistakes  in fighting the "entire Islamic current," thus winning the  enmity of wide sectors of the people. Giving an example, the  writer says the "police rule was blatantly manifested in the  decision to prevent Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi from delivering  sermons, although he never attacked the government." The writer  notes that the government caved in to the demands of the secular  people and haters of Islam and adopted this measure against the  popular preacher, who used to attract large crowds of worshipers.  <H5>  ARTICLE ON LAND DAY </H5>   On page 12, the newspaper publishes a 2,000-word article by  Dr. Mahjub 'Umar on "Land Day," celebrated by the Arabs of  Israel on 30 March of each year. The article reviews the events  of that day on 30 March 1976 when the Arabs of Israel staged  strikes and demonstrations to protest the seizure of their lands  by the Israeli Government. Six Arabs were killed by the Israeli  forces during these protests. The writer notes that the Arabs  of Israel are a force to be reckoned with and will have the  "final say" in the long conflict with Israel over the land.</p>

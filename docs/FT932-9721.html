			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME traders warned over feared nickel squeeze THE LONDON Metal Exchange executive yesterday added its voice to warnings from traders and analysts about a potential squeeze in its nickel market at the end of this year by announcing it was 'closely monitoring' the situation. Traders said the LME's action had an immediate effect and that the backwardation (premium for immediate delivery) between November and December, which has been as wide as Dollars 100 a tonne in recent weeks, narrowed to Dollars 15. Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural resources group, said the potential options-related squeeze was having some near-term impact by underpinning the price of nickel for delivery in three months because 'people are wary about being short'. He said the build up of option positions suggested that some traders were confident of significantly firmer nickel prices towards the year-end. 'But it is difficult to get too bullish with LME nickel stocks at a record 91,980 tonnes. We will need to see those stocks being drawn down before we know that the market fundamentals are really changing.' Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said that the groundwork for a potential squeeze had been in place for some time and 'the LME was probably right to sound the alarm bells sooner rather than later'. The exchange's announcement might not have detered those behind the potential squeeze, 'but the rest of the market started to behave in the way the LME would wish'. For most of last year the LME zinc market was gripped by a squeeze and the executive was forced to intervene. In 1991 it took similar action to restore order in the copper market.</p>

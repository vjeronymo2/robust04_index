			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Free trade will benefit steel Sir, If the Inland Revenue is buying steelwork from Poland, this is not against British interests, except in the very short run (Letters: 'Steel subsidised at high cost to UK', September 16). I run a company which represents British and American producers of auto-ID equipment in Poland, and we are bidding for a contract from the Katowice steel mill which will help raise productivity and cut costs. Such sales depend on relatively free trade. Protectionism against efficient, low-cost Polish producers is short-sighted, because it threatens the expansion of trade through which incomes will rise, east and west. If free trade is allowed, Poland will export more to western Europe, and be a larger market for the useful and competitive things that western Europe has to offer. Let consumers decide which goods and services meet their needs, and not leave it up to bureaucrats. Richard Lucas, general manager, Systemy Kodow Kreskowych, 31-068 Krakow, Ul. Stradom 13/3A, Poland</p>

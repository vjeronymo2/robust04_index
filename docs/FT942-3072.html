			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / China signals thaw in dispute with Britain over Hong Kong China has signalled an easing of its dispute with Britain over Hong Kong's political development, which has hindered commercial negotiations between the two countries and clouded the future of the colony. It emerged yesterday that Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, had told a group of Hong Kong trade unionists that the dispute with Britain was 'past' and that relations between the UK and China should be 'corrected and improved'. Mr Qian's remarks, made on Tuesday, come at a time when both governments are making efforts to repair relations after a bruising two-year dispute about Hong Kong's political development. The row culminated late last year with Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, pushing ahead with his blueprint for political reform. Mr Qian repeated on Tuesday Beijing's threat to call fresh elections after it resumes sovereignty in 1997. The apparent thaw in relations will face a test at the end of this month when Hong Kong's legislature votes on Mr Patten's democracy plans. Most of the proposals are expected to be accepted. Since the spring, Chinese officials have indicated a willingness to proceed with practical matters concerning the transfer of Hong Kong. However, some Hong Kong government officials suspect Beijing has started a charm offensive of little substance. Another sign that a thaw in relations is under way is an invitation China extended last week to Mr Alastair Goodlad, a foreign office minister, who will visit Beijing next month. This is the first British ministerial visit to the Chinese capital for a year. In September a top British business delegation will go to China to improve trade relations. In a related move, it was announced yesterday that the Sino-British joint liaison group (JLG) would meet from June 21 to June 23. The JLG - which oversees the transfer of Hong Kong to China and should have met last in March but failed to do so - has a large backlog of technical work to complete. The forthcoming meeting is expected to seal the terms of a deal whereby the Hong Kong government will refit some military sites in the colony for the use of China's armed forces in exchange for the release of surplus military land for civilian development.</p>

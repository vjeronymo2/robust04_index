			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: S African golds advance 4.5% Gold shares closed sharply higher in Johannesburg as domestic investors were heartened by the bullion price, which broke out of its narrow trading range to trade just short of the Dollars 388 an ounce resistance level. The golds index, which jumped more than 3 per cent in the first half-hour of trade, ended 94, or 4.5 per cent, ahead at 2,185 in spite of some mild profit-taking near the close. The rest of the market was mixed in quiet trade after Wednesday's gains, with a stronger financial rand depressing some prices. The overall index gained 27 at 5,774 while industrials receded 13 to 6,744. De Beers closed 75 cents off at R115.25 but Anglos added R1 at R242. Among golds, Vaal Reefs forged ahead R15.50 to R430 and Kloof put on R2.75 at R56.25.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Labour dispute may put hockey season on ice: Owners threaten to lock out players if new deal is not hammered out Already deprived of the most exciting part of the baseball season, North American sports fans now face the prospect of no ice hockey as a result of another labour dispute between owners and players, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Owners of the 26 US and Canadian teams which make up the National Hockey League (NHL) have threatened to lock out the players if a new collective agreement is not hammered out in time for the scheduled opening of the season on Saturday. Hopes were slim yesterday that the protracted and increasingly hostile negotiations would be concluded before the deadline. As in the six-week-old baseball strike, the public is venting its anger on both sides, especially in Canada, where hockey is the national sport and Hockey Night is the longest-running programme on television. One Toronto newspaper columnist yesterday pinned the blame for the impasse on the 'cowboy mentality' of the two American lawyers who represent the owners and the players' union. The issues in the hockey dispute are similar to those which brought the baseball season to a premature end. In both cases they reflect the degree to which the entertainment element of sport has been overshadowed by business. The NHL posted revenues of about CDollars 700m (USDollars 522.3m) in 1993, and expects a substantial increase in coming years thanks partly to a CDollars 155m five-year contract signed recently with Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox television network. But the owners are demanding various concessions from the players to hold down spiralling salary bills, and to secure the future of financially strapped teams in relatively small markets such as the Canadian prairie city of Winnipeg and Hartford, Connecticut. The players are concerned however, that the owners are moving towards a cap on salaries. The owners have already proposed a limit on first-year players' pay of about CDollars 275,000 a year. With the exception of a few superstars, notably Wayne Gretzky of the Los Angeles Kings, hockey salaries are generally well below those in baseball. But 75 players now earn more than CDollars 1m a year - led by Mr Gretzky's CDollars 8.4m - compared with just three players five years ago.</p>

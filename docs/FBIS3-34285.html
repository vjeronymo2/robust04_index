He said that the detentions were made "in the course of the  continuous daily efforts of the Lebanese security organs which  have recently succeeded in capturing an Israeli sabotage ring  run by elements spread between Beirut and the occupied border  strip."    The source emphasized to AL-HAYAH that the work of the  Lebanese security organs "is not linked to any particular date,  time, or place. Their task is to maintain security and ward off  any threat to internal security, and it covers all security  violations." [passage omitted]    He said that the pursuit and storming operations "have,  contrary to the claims made by some, not been targeting any  particular group. We tackle security issues on the sole basis  of security and we let justice take its course and pronounce the  verdict. The proof is that the security authorities have in  recent weeks carried out a number of operations not restricted  to any particular area but covering most Lebanese provinces."  [passage omitted]    He said that the position recently taken by the Lebanese  Forces' Central Information Bureau regarding the detentions and  maintaining that they undermined national accord and the law  "came after the security authorities detained some individuals  who divulged some information in connection with the explosion  targeting the Lebanese Army camp in Rumiyah years ago. Some  admitted that they had been instructed by certain security  officials to gather information regarding the movements of state  officials, foremost among them President Ilyas al-Hirawi."    The source asked: "Are we the department which decides  whether the general amnesty law should cover these people or  should justice take its course and determine their fate,  particularly as some of them have confessed that they were  instructed by a special security organ to gather information for  we know not whom?" [passage omitted]    He referred to the ring which worked for Israel, most of its  members having been arrested before the end of last month. They  used to gather information and move between Beirut and the  security belt. He asked: "Are the security organs not supposed  to interrogate those people or refer them to the military  investigating magistrate, bearing in mind that some of them made  clear and frank confessions?"    The source urged all parties "not to pass haphazard  judgements and to wait for the truth to come out before taking  stands harmful to themselves and before requesting dismissal of  the charges, release of the detainees, and discontinuation of  the pursuit of wanted persons."    He said that any charge made against any detainee "should  not  be taken as a charge against the party he belongs to." [passage  omitted]</p>

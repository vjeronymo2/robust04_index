			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (7): The survival of the fittest - Industry, especially in the Vale do Ave region, faces a difficult period of transition CHARLES DARWIN's theory of natural selection is catching up fast with Portuguese industry. Threatened by the single European market and fast-growing competition from newly industrialised countries and eastern Europe, industrialists are increasingly talking about the survival of the fittest. Extinction looms over many companies in Portugal's traditional sectors - clothing, textiles and footwear - whose competitiveness has relied for too long on depressed prices, low wages and a exchange rate policy geared to keeping prices competitive despite high inflation. 'That era is definitively ended,' Mr Luis Alves Monteiro, secretary of state for industry, states emphatically. 'Portugal's integration into the European Community means turning a page in our economic history to a period when quality will be selected over quantity.' His words are echoed by exporters who today complain of the effects of a strong escudo, high interest rates and economic recession in their main markets. Average Portuguese wages, Dollars 4.16 a hour in 1991, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, may be only a fifth of those in Germany. But they are being undercut by Europe's increasing openness to textile and other imports from the Third World. Portugal faces a difficult transition from traditional industries afflicted by low value-added products, inefficient management and outmoded technology, to a diversified industrial base where the competitive factors are high quality, advanced technology, modern management and aggressive marketing. It will be a costly change that is expected to lead to the closure of a third of the country's plants in the textiles, footwear and clothing sectors with the loss of 60,000 jobs over the medium term. In regions dependent on a single industry, such as garment making, the country faces acute social problems. The hardest-hit area is likely to be the northern Vale do Ave textile region, where some 120 firms with more than 30,000 workers are in difficulty. Special EC funds are being channelled into this crisis area in the hope of rehabilitating viable companies. Incentives will be used to coax alternative industries into the area. South Korea's Samsung is currently one of the prime candidates. The government is to discuss a recovery plan for the Vale do Ave region prepared by Mr Miguel Cadilhe, former finance minister. The scheme's main points are: an Es50-100bn (230-460m) risk capital fund for capital reinforcement, financial restructuring and investment by viable companies; tax incentives, including investment tax credit and contractual tax incentive schemes to attract new industries and interest-rate tax exemptions for banks on medium- and long-term loans; a reduction of the red tape involved in mergers, closures and company formation and new training and research bodies focused on technology, design, marketing and management. Added to these assets are a trained workforce that can be easily adapted to new skills through vocational training, industrial plants ready for adaptation, greenfield sites and relatively good infrastructure. Officials are trying to bring about a change in the Vale do Ave region similar to the one wrought in the Setubal peninsular, south of Lisbon. Massive foreign investment, mainly in the automobile sector, has transformed Setubal from a depressed shipbuilding and fish-canning area into the modern hub of Portuguese industry. The jewel in Setubal's crown is the Es450bn Ford-Volkswagen plant that from 1994 will begin producing 180,000 multipurpose vehicles a year. The plant will account for a massive 30 per cent of Portugal's exports. But its value also lies in the incentive it will provide for Portuguese automobile component producers and other suppliers. Suppliers for the Ford-VW project have to meet stringent quality requirements. Despite the poor reputation for quality of much of Portuguese industry, companies are responding well to the challenge. By the end of the year about 30 suppliers are expected to be given Q1 status by Ford-VW, which requires a reject rate of under 2 per cent over a 12-month period. Another 40 have a strong possibility of meeting the required standard. Other Portuguese suppliers are fulfilling similar requirements for other multinational investors in Setubal, such as Ford Electronics, General Motors and Valmet Tractors of Finland. But officials are aware that most Portuguese companies are not up to Q1 standard. 'Many enterprises don't yet possess the elementary instruments required for the management of quality,' says Mr Luis Morales, deputy chairman of the Portuguese Association of Industrialists. 'They don't use standards, they don't certify products, they don't use test laboratories or carry out adequate quality control. They are not sensitive to the costs of non-quality.' But, ultimately, it is the transition from struggling garment producers to Q1 suppliers to Ford-VW that Portugal hopes to make. 'Our industrial structure is engaged in a great effort of transition and specialisation, says Mr Alves Monteiro. Economists agree that the main areas where changes are needed to achieve that objective are: Education and professional training: Portugal has a chronic shortage of skilled workers, technicians and managers. More than 60 per cent of workers have only primary education and 15 per cent of the population is illiterate. Infrastructure: Considerable progress is being made, but poor telecommunications handicap companies, the road and port network is still inadequate and the railways are inefficient. Research and development: Links need to be forged between science and industry. More investment in research is needed to improve competitiveness. Regionalisation: Portugal suffers from marked regional imbalances. Political power remains centralised and the government has not yet determined a programme of regional power structures. Bureaucracy: Despite improvements, red tape remains a hurdle for investors and hampers business. Government departments lack co-ordination.</p>

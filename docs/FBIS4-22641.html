			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yu. Arkhipov, by A. Bayduzhiy, under the </F> rubric "Problem": "Russia Has Become a Mecca for Illegal  Migrants: According to Yuriy Arkhipov, Head of the Foreign  Migration Administration of the Federal Migration Service, This  Benefits the West"]    [Text]    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] One of the tokens of recent times has  been the mounting flow into Russia of citizens of states that  only recently were called Third World countries. How many  refugees from the far abroad are there on Russian territory?    [Arkhipov] Here we need to clarify concepts. From the legal  point of view, it is not refugees coming to Russia but people  wishing to claim refugee status. They can become refugees only  after the appropriate procedure, which assumes submitting a  petition to the migration services, lodging of the petitioner at  a temporary housing center, and verifying the data given in the  claimant's declaration. Only after this can the individual be  recognized a refugee and be issued a refugee certificate for  Russian territory. Foreigners who have not gone through all  these steps are not considered refugees and are on the country's  territory illegally. According to data from the health care  organs, such immigrants from the far abroad here number more  than half a million, and their number continues to grow. Every  day up to a hundred new illegal migrants arrive in Russia.    As for official refugees, here the situation is somewhat  confused. Before Russia joined the 1951 UN Convention on the  Status of Refugees in 1992, there were a significant number of  foreigners on Russian territory who flooded in uncontrollably  due to the openness of our borders with certain new states of  the Trans-Caucasus and Central Asian regions. At the same time,  the office of the Administration of the UN High Commissioner for  Refugee Affairs (UVKB OON), which without the consent of the  Russian organs of power began to undertake the massive reception  of immigrants from the far abroad, issuing its own certification  as "requiring asylum in the Russian Federation," began  operations in Moscow. Most of the migrants had counted on the  assistance of the UVKB OON primarily to move to the developed  countries of Western Europe and Scandinavia.    There are about 50,000 such UVKB-registered individuals in  Russia. Since our country joined the convention, all of them,  according to this organization's office, must be recognized  almost automatically as refugees on Russian territory.  Naturally, we cannot agree to this.    Right now the Federal Migration Service is carrying out a  reregistration of those registered by UVKB representatives, and  in the process many violations have been uncovered: some of the  migrants have two certificates; others' documents have changed  hands more than once; and certificates have been issued without  dates or numbers and without individual files being opened on  them.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Which means, if you don't count the  individuals registered by the UVKB, there are officially still  no refugees from the far abroad in Russia?    [Arkhipov] Absolutely correct. The Russian law "On Refugees"  provides that an individual who has arrived on our territory  must immediately declare himself as seeking asylum in Russia. We  have many migrants who entered the country three or four years  ago and have been living on Russian territory in the hopes of  leaving by any means possible for other countries and who are  involved in semi-legal business operations. They make themselves  known only when they have dealings with the lawkeeping organs,  or if they are unsuccessful in getting to the West. So in what  capacity can we consider them? As people seeking asylum,  refugees, or, more likely, as illegal migrants? However, the  Western states and the UVKB OON ignore the nonstandard situation  in Russia, believing that we are intentionally dragging our  heels about giving these individuals refugee status. Here it  should be noted that as soon as Russia joined the convention,  literally a week later, seven Western states tightened up their  visa procedures. That is, they made our country virtually the  last. The West profits if this great mass of refugees from the  Third World stays in Russia, which protects the West from their  penetration.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] So joining the convention was a  mistake  on Russia's part?    [Arkhipov] When it was being signed, we were evidently  counting on the West beginning to assist the Russian-speaking  population that had started to arrive on Russian territory in  massive proportions. However, these hopes were not vindicated.  According to the Western states, the Russian-speaking citizens  arriving here were not refugees, unlike the Somalian, Kurdish,  and African migrants, for example. That is, in joining the  convention, we did not take into account the political,  economic, social, or moral-psychological consequences of this  step. According to our assessments, the cost of maintaining a  single family of migrants from the far abroad from the moment  they cross the border until the decision is made on whether or  not to present them with refugee status (according to the law,  this should take three months) comes to more than 3 million  rubles. Naturally, that kind of money is nowhere to be found.  Our country's doctors have proved unfamiliar with many of the  diseases from which the African and Asiatic refugees suffer, and  it is difficult to control them. For instance, as a result of  tests on migrants registered by the UVKB, several people  infected with the AIDS virus were discovered who later  disappeared and whom we have never been able to locate.    One more miscalculation turned out to be the fact that  Russia  has become nearly the sole state in the world to join the  convention on refugee status and its protocol in full. The  United States joined only the protocol; other states signed the  convention after setting many qualifications, thanks to which  they can refuse to implement some of its conditions. Moreover,  Russia has gone even further. The law "On Refugees" passed in  Russia is broader than the convention, which has evoked surprise  even among international experts. Much more developed countries  would not have permitted themselves this.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But at one time passage of the Russia  law "On Refugees" was offered up to us as a major accomplishment  in the sphere of guaranteeing human rights. Now it is judged  differently?    [Arkhipov] By the law's appearance, yes; but by its content,  not entirely. The law proved more declaratory than really  effective. A certain hastiness in its passage in the existing  edition led to many legal gaps and disparities. It lacks any  reference whatsoever to a mechanism for offering refugee status.  It turns out that in order to obtain the latter, a foreigner  only has to submit a statement. Imagine the cost of the standard  implied by the law providing for offering refugees housing "from  a special housing fund designated for refugees," which no one  had created at the time the law came out! And so forth. Right  now we have prepared, based on the experience we have, and sent  out for approval, amendments to the law "On Refugees" and forced  resettlers. The excessively expansive--in comparison with the  convention--interpretation of refugee status has been deleted, a  procedure for offering that status has been introduced, and not  only the rights of refugees but also the rights of the state  with respect to them have been set forth more precisely.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Does Russia have centers for work with  refugees from the far abroad?    [Arkhipov] Not yet. So far we have not managed to create  them, not only for economic reasons but also due to the sharply  negative attitude of local authorities and the population. Right  now preparations are being completed for opening the first such  center in Perm Oblast, and altogether there are plans for up to  10-12 regional centers for temporary lodging. This is a  half-closed institution, where foreigners will be located to  ensure their safety under guard. We cannot allow huge masses of  people who do not know the languages or rules of the country and  who, it has to be admitted, treat our laws with extreme  negligence to resettle at will across Russia. But here another  problem arises. The majority of the migrants from the far abroad  are concentrated in Moscow and under no circumstances do they  wish to leave it. Recently we suggested that a group of Kurds  resettle in Tver, and en route half of them ran away. Are these  refugees? If the police have to be sent to catch someone, then  this is not a refugee but an illegal migrant, and adequate  measures must be taken, up to and including deportation.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] For some reason I haven't heard  anything about even a single case of such deportation or  expulsion.    [Arkhipov] For this you have to ask the passport and visa  service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is supposed  to deal with the deportation of citizens found illegally on  Russian territory. Although, as far as I know, in 1993, there  were a few instances of citizens of China and Vietnam being  expelled from Russia. In general, the deportation process right  now in many ways makes no sense: you can spend millions of  rubles on the expulsion of foreign citizens, but tomorrow, given  our open borders, they will turn up in Moscow again.  Deportations are not going to solve the problem of illegal  migration. We must come to an agreement as quickly as possible  with the states of the former USSR, either on establishing  strict visa control along the perimeter of the CIS, or else on  stopping the transit of migrants to Russia through those  countries. And naturally, Russian passports must be introduced.</p>

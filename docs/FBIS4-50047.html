			<p>BFN     [Text] The 14th annual meeting of the Sino-Japan  Association for the Exchange of Economic Knowledge ended in  Jinan on the afternoon of 11 May after completing all items on  the agenda. In the past 2 days, members of the Chinese and  Japanese sides made a profound analysis of the current economic  situation of the world and the trends of economic development in  East Asia, extensively explored the channels and prospects of  cooperation between China and Japan in multiple spheres, and  offered some valuable views on the multilateral economic  cooperation. This association has paid high attention to the  economic development of Shandong Province. At the meeting held  on the afternoon of 11 May, this association specially discussed  on Shandong's economic development.    Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party  Committee, and Zhao Zhihao, governor of the province,  respectively delivered speeches at the meeting. They profoundly  discussed and exchanged views on the issue of further expanding  the friendly cooperation between Shandong and Japan. Jiang  Chunyun and Zhao Zhihao maintained: Japan is a major economic  and trade cooperation partner of Shandong. The convocation of  this meeting will bring about a new opportunity for the economic  cooperation between Shandong and Japan. The vistas of the  economic and trade cooperation between Shandong and Japan are  vast.    Jiang Chunyun and Zhao Zhihao pointed out: Looking forward  to the future of the economic and trade exchanges between  Shandong and Japan, there are many favorable conditions and  great potentials. First, the exchanges between Shandong and  Japan have a long history and a good cooperation foundation.  Second, from the view of optimizing the setup of productive  forces, Shandong and Japan are much complemented with each other  in the economy. Third, both China and Japan are located in East  Asia and thus there are geological advantages in the economic  and trade cooperation between the two countries. So long as we  persist in the principles of mutual benefit and making up for  each other's deficiency with one's advantages, much can be  accomplished in the economic and trade coopratrion between the  two sides.    On the evening of 11 May, Comrade Gu Mu hosted a banquet to  warmly entertain members of the Japanese and China sides. He  congratulated the annual meeting on its successful convocation.</p>

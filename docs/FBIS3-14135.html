A Syrian military source meanwhile declared illegal any  attempt to carry weapons in the town.    Witnesses said the soldiers set up checkpoints in Ba'labakk,  searching cars and arresting anyone with weapons.    The measure came 10 days after some 300 armed members of the  Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement deployed in Ba'labakk as part  of a demonstration by thousands of people in support of  Jerusalem Day, in response to a call by Iran.    Lebanon's military prosecutor Nasri Lahhud denounced the  presence of armed Hezbollah militants and issued warrants for  their arrest, saying they had violated the law.    Some 35,000 Syrian troops are deployed in Lebanon.</p>

He disclosed in an  exclusive interview with Interfax at a Moscow airport before his  departure that during the trip he would sign an agreement for  military and technical cooperation between Russia and Romania  covering a five year period.    In his words, this "framework" accord provides for exchanges  of defense delegations, information and other types of contacts.    He reported plans to meet with Romania's president, premier,  foreign and defence ministers. In his talks with Romanian  politicians Grachev intends to discuss "the military and  political aspects of bilateral cooperation and ways to ensure  security in Europe."    He did not rule out that the situation in Moldova and  Russia's military presence in Transdniestria would be looked at  during the talks with the Romanian leadership.    On Russo-Kazakh military and technical contacts, Grachev  revealed that "final touches are being put to the documents  agreed to by the two presidents" and voiced hope that the  accords would be signed by the two leaders in Moscow at 18:30 on  Friday.    In his words, the most complex issue at the negotiations  with  the Kazakh leadership in Moscow is that of the use of the space  center at Baykonur. "So far the issue has not been resolved in  full," he remarked.    However, he noted that the issue on Kazakhstan's strategic  nuclear forces had been settled once and for all. In his words,  according to understandings on this matter, a time-table is to  be drawn up within a month for moving nuclear ammunition out of  Kazakhstan to Russia and for partial compensation to be paid by  Moscow for the nuclear fuel.    Nor has there been any problem to withdraw nuclear warheads  from Ukraine to Russia. As Grachev put it, "there have only  been a few minor points of disagreement."</p>

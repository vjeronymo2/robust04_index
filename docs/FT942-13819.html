			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigerian oil on slippery slope, warns Shell Nigeria's oil industry is in a downward spiral as the government's payment arrears to its joint venture partners lead to cuts in international investment and reduce production capacity, the managing director of Shell Nigeria has warned in a bleak assessment of the industry which provides 95 per cent of Nigeria's foreign earnings. 'As production goes down, so does the Opec production quota, leaving even less revenue for investment in future production,' said Mr Brian Anderson. Speaking at a seminar in Lagos, Mr Anderson suggested that one way out was for the government, which owns 60 per cent of the joint oil operations, to pay in crude oil for its cash arrears to the oil industry, which have been at least Dollars 500m for the past six months. 'Extra crude would make payment more certain, which would increase investment and more revenue would flow,' he said. 'This would also provide more revenue for compensation in the disputes with local communities.' Shell lost 1,400 production days in 1993 because of violent attacks by communities in the Niger delta, and employs one security man for every two members of the workforce at a cost of Dollars 18m a year. Under joint venture agreements the oil companies can take cash arrears from the majority partner in the form of extra crude oil, but only with the government's consent. Shell produces about half of Nigeria's 2m barrels a day of oil, but worsening payment arrears and the recent cut in the joint ventures' budgets could push down production capacity to around 1.5m b/d by the end of 1995. The cash crisis has been aggravated by the foreign exchange restrictions imposed in the January budget. All the oil companies have suspended development projects, have stopped drilling wells in existing fields and are spending the bare minimum to maintain their operations. At the recent Opec summit Nigeria was rebuked by other members for proposing a reduction in quotas while its industry was the only over-producer apart from Iran. Nigerian oil minister Mr Don Etiebet has ordered the oil producers to stay within quotas. He has warned of penalties against any producer exceeding its quota, which the government had not enforced since last September. Analysts say that Nigeria's over production was around 100,000 barrels a day but the figures are unclear because of condensate production, which is outside Opec quotas. The government has also been forced to cut the price of its oil by traders who were awarded term contracts earlier this year to lift two-thirds of Nigerian export output. Severe shortages of domestic fuel affect most of Nigeria. Two out of the three oil refineries are out of action, the other is operating at half capacity and the government says that there is not enough cash to import the products. This week former oil minister Mr Philip Asiodu repeated his criticism of Nigeria's fuel price subsidy, which costs the state downstream oil industry about Dollars 40m a month, while fuel is smuggled to francophone Africa or sold on the black market for more than three times its official price of less than 10 cents US a litre of petrol.</p>

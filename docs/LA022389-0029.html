			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 PORTS WEIGH PRESERVING LAGOON; COUNCILMEN ASSAIL 'BEING IN DARK'  </P> <P> The possibility that the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach will preserve and  develop a lagoon between Interstate 5 and El Camino Real in the San Dieguito  River Valley received its first public airing Wednesday, amid some complaining  by San Diego City Council members that they had been kept in the dark about it.  </P> <P> The proposal, which has been quietly discussed in government and private  circles for nearly a year, would have the two ports, which want to double the  size of their facilities in San Pedro Harbor, offset the environmental damage  they would cause there by developing -- at their expense -- a wetlands habitat  just east of the Del Mar Fairgrounds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Final Site Undetermined  </P> <P> The ports have not yet decided whether they want to target the valley for the  project, and, if they do, they will eventually need the approval of a host of  federal, state and regional government agencies, not the least being the city  of San Diego. The ports are not expected to make a decision until summer.  </P> <P> Proponents of the lagoon construction say it would fit hand-in-glove with a  larger proposal, shepherded by both the city and county of San Diego, to  develop a 43-mile-long regional park and wildlife habitat stretching from Del  Mar to the foothills of Julian.  </P> <P> Planning agencies have already identified the lowlands between the coastal  freeway and El Camino Real as the most critical component to the park, and its  development by the two port districts would be a windfall to the local park  development. If the project is completed, the more than 500 acres being  considered could end up in public ownership, providing the western gateway to  the regional park.  </P> <P> The ports' proposal surfaced Wednesday before the Public Facilities and  Recreation Committee of the City Council at the request of Roy Collins, manager  of the San Dieguito Trust, the largest of the private-property owners who would  be affected by the plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wolfsheimer Against Hearing  </P> <P> Collins' presentation was opposed by Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer, who said  she is not only concerned that the public discussion might jeopardize private  negotiations among her office, other city officials and the port districts  about the plan, but also that the proposal should be aired by the council's  Transportation and Land Use Committee.  </P> <P> The Public Facilities and Recreation Committee is chaired by Councilman Bruce  Henderson, who at one time was an attorney representing the San Dieguito Trust.  But he deflected criticism Wednesday that it was improper for him to chair the  meeting during the presentation, countering that, because of the public  hearing, he is keeping the discussions aboveboard and public.  </P> <P> Two other council members welcomed the presentation because they had not  previously known of its details -- and said they were bothered that Wolfsheimer  indicated that she had been involved in private talks about the ports'  proposal.  </P> <P> "I don't know what negotiations are going on," Councilman Robert Filner  complained. "It sounds like there are private discussions going on that the  council is not aware of."  </P> <P> Added Councilman Ed Struiksma, addressing Wolfsheimer: "You're alluding to all  sorts of things. We have no idea what you're talking about."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Great Deal of Mystery'  </P> <P> Wolfsheimer conceded: "There seems to you all to be a great deal of mystery  here." She explained that she and several city staff officials had met with  property owners and officials from the port districts on the issue.  </P> <P> "All the information we'd normally give you is not ready to emerge," said  Wolfsheimer, who also sits on a committee organized by the San Diego Assn. of  Governments to coordinate the regional park proposal. "We don't want to discuss  fair market value and negotiations" in public.  </P> <P> But Filner and Struiksma said they were still confused by what negotiations  Wolfsheimer indicated were being conducted.  </P> <P> "I ask you not to get impatient," Wolfsheimer responded.  </P> <P> Retorted Filner: "There's something about the process here that is bothering  me. I don't understand the process in which we're interacting with the ports. I  don't know by what criteria the city manager and the city attorney are even  involved in negotiations. I don't know what policy you're working under."  </P> <P> Wolfsheimer said the matter had come up briefly at an executive session last  week, involving the possible acquisition by the city of private land in that  same valley region.  </P> <P> The discussion was not resolved except that an update report on the proposal  will be presented to the committee when it meets March 8.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by E.Cz., E.K., and J.T.P.: "A Game or War"] </F>   [Text] The coalition deputies' clubs will decide at their  next meetings whether or not to support a bill amending the  Small Constitution. Many coalition deputies have expressed the  opinion that the amendment bill is an element of the game in the  current conflict with the Belweder, not a desire to limit the  powers of Lech Walesa. However, no one denies that this is what  may really happen. There are rumors that the coalition will  abandon the idea of amending the Constitution in return for the  nomination of Dariusz Rosati.  <H5>  What for What </H5>   The deputies who signed the bill to amend the Constitution  explain officially that the Small Constitution played its role  well when all of the authority centers came from the same  political camp and the decisions they made showed the goodwill  of all of the parties. At a moment when power in the state is  wielded by political opponents at the same time, the  constitutional provisions make it impossible to find solutions  to conflicts. Coalition politicians unofficially admit,  however, that the bill is an element of a political game in  which various methods are being used.    "From a political and moral point of view, this ploy is not  the worst one possible," admits one of them, who stresses that  right now the dispute between the coalition and the president is  not over people but over the political system. "It is being  decided whether we will have a presidential system, which the  president is trying to achieve through facts, or a  parliamentary-cabinet system, as it is stated in the Small  Constitution."    According to one of the leaders of the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD], the dispute may only be resolved by a  gentlemen's agreement with the president: consent to the  nomination of Rosati in return for the coalition's abandoning  the idea of introducing its own people into the presidential  ministries. If the president "bids higher," the coalition might  also introduce into this game the National Council of Radio and  Television, even though it is not interested in that for the  time being. A bargaining chip is also the bill to amend the  Constitution itself. Irrespective of the opinions of the clubs,  if two deputies withdraw their signatures from the bill, the  bill is no longer valid. For this reason, as was suggested by  the SLD's Ryszard Grodzicki, who is supposed to be the reporter  of this bill, the initiators did not allow more people to sign  this bill. In his opinion, journalists now should not ask the  initiators of the bill about its chances in the Sejm or try to  figure out what constitutional ploy the president may use to  neutralize parliament; they should first of all be interested in  the opinion of the ministry on Rakowiecka Street [probable  reference to Ministry of Internal Affairs] on this bill.    The signatories of the bill stress modestly that it is a  bill  submitted by some deputies, not the coalition, and it did not  have to be agreed on with the clubs' leaders. The SLD's  Wladyslaw Zbikowski admits, however, that, in line with the  club's regulations, before the bill was actually submitted, the  Presidium of the club was informed about it; the Presidium did  not oppose it.    Grodzicki also suggested that such an initiative would not  have been possible without the approval, or at least the  knowledge, of the clubs' Presidiums. He also said that the bill  was signed by 16 deputies, who are said to be the most  recalcitrant deputies in their clubs and who most frequently  breach the clubs' discipline. The list of names on the bill  suggests, however, that this is not a very accurate opinion. As  for the SLD deputies, the bill was signed primarily by deputies  from Warsaw, and, as for the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], by  those who happened to be in Warsaw.   <H5>    Chances of the Coalition </H5>   According to the SLD's Bogdan Krysiewicz, there is no  definitely antipresidential atmosphere in the club; the  possibility of collective madness is also out of the question.    "We do not make a decision on supporting or rejecting a bill  very hastily. It would be good if the discussion in the club  were made in the presence of the president and if both sides  submitted their arguments clearly," he claims.    Zbikowski believes that the bill will be backed by a  definite  majority of the club. His parliamentary colleagues are rather  critical of the president's statements and decisions.    Opinions in the PSL Club are divided, as well. Jan  Komornicki believes that the amendment bill will either be  rejected in the first reading or be forwarded to the  Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly and utilized  during work on the new Constitution.    "No one in the PSL, including the prime minister, wants a  war  with the president," says Komornicki. Janusz Piechocinski adds  that the PSL merely wants stable conditions for the functioning  of the government and that the president has not been ensuring  that recently. On Wednesday [20 April], during the club's  session, Piechocinski will try to persuade the leadership of the  club to empower Deputy Speaker Jozef Zych, who is known for his  ability to reach compromises and who has not said anything that  might offend the dignity of the president, to take on the role  of mediator between the coalition and the Belweder. Unlike SLD  politicians, Piechocinski claims that the dispute is related to  ambition: on whose terms the talks will start. If the bill is  voted on, the club will have to take into account the opinion of  the PSL Chief Council, which will convene on Saturday.    However, if we assume that the bill submitted by the  deputies  is merely an element of a game, it would be too early to  evaluate its chances of being passed. This is confirmed by the  opinion of one leftist politician, who said that "if the  president manages to persuade two people to withdraw their  signatures," the entire issue will no longer be valid. The same  politician doubts, however, that the president will accept the  invitation to the SLD Club.  <H5>  What Is Going On? </H5>   The authors of the bill propose amendments to two articles  in  the Small Constitution: Article 4 and Article 68. The change  of the former links the end of the term of office to the day of  the first sitting of the new Sejm and obliges the president to  order elections no earlier than three months and no later than  four months from the dissolution of the Sejm. Deputy Grodzicki  claims that, in the case of amending the law, the regulations  would probably still include solutions that would make it  impossible to launch new legislative initiatives; they would  merely allow the work that has already been started to be  completed and set in order. The second change would lie in the  following: If the president did not change the composition of  the Council of Ministers or if he refused to make such a change  within seven days of the submission date of the prime minister's  motion, he could request such a change--approved by an absolute  majority of votes. As a result of the present state, the  justification is that key posts may not be filled, which causes  negative results for the activities of the government and for  its efficiency. According to the authors, this amendment does  not aim to limit the president's powers; it makes it possible to  overcome a difficult situation, in which the president does not  make a change in a ministerial post within seven days or refuses  to make it.</p>

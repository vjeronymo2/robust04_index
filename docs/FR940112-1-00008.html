The current Class D airspace encompasses Killeen Municipal Airport and with airspace reclassification, aircraft operators at Killeen Municipal Airport are now required to establish two-way radio communication with Hood AAF Air Traffic Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) or when Hood AAF ATCT is closed, Robert Gray AAF ATCT. This notice proposes to remove the airspace surrounding Killeen Municipal Airport from Hood AAF's Class D airspace and to establish Class E airspace around Killeen Municipal Airport. The intended effect of this proposal is to maintain adequate Class D airspace and two-way radio communications at Hood AAF and Robert Gray AAF, to remove Killeen Municipal Airport, TX, from the current Class D airspace, and to establish Class E airspace around Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen, TX. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before February 11, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to Manager, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Southwest Region, Docket No. 93&hyph;ASW&hyph;55, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Fort Worth, TX 76193&hyph;0530. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The official docket may be examined in the office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Southwest Region, Federal Aviation Administration, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Fort Worth, TX, between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

The proposal would remove that portion of current Class D airspace which surrounds Killeen Municipal Airport and would establish Class E airspace around Killeen Municipal Airport. The intended effect of this proposal is to maintain adequate Class D airspace and two-way radio communications to contain instrument flight rule (IFR) operations at Hood AAF and Robert Gray AAF, TX, to remove Killeen Municipal Airport from the Class D airspace, and to establish Class E airspace at Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen, Texas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published in Paragraph 5000 and Class E airspace areas designated as surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

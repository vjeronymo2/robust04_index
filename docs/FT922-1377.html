			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: National Bank of Kuwait regains vigour after surviving Gulf crisis - The first full set of results since the invasion suggests NBK is stronger than ever WHEN Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the emirate's banking system was shattered. But within a few months of the invasion, National Bank of Kuwait (NBK), the largest Kuwaiti bank, was up and running again. In May this year, NBK published results for the combined years of 1990-91, its first full set of figures since the invasion. They are impressive by any standards. Though group assets have fallen by 21 per cent since 1989 to Dollars 10.17bn, profits of Dollars 155.5m are 32 per cent higher and - to judge by the strength of its capital base - NBK looks even more muscular than it did before the invasion. Its risk-to-assets ratio has risen from 14.4 per cent before the invasion to 15.2 per cent in May. By the standards of most banks in North America and Europe, this suggests almost excessive caution. But NBK takes the view that it lives in a hazardous part of the world and needs a stronger capital base than western banks. Just how hazardous was shown on August 2 1990 when Iraqi troops marched into Kuwait City. By a happy coincidence, NBK's chairman, Mr Mohamed Abdul Mohsin Al-Kharafi, and most of its directors were in London that day, as was Mr Ibrahim Dabdoub, its chief general manager. As a result, there was never any question about the validity of decisions taken in exile, and lines of authority inside the bank were never in question. By 10.20am on the morning of the invasion, the bank's board had sent out messages worldwide, revoking all the powers of the Kuwait-based operations. At that point, about half the bank's assets and 65 per cent of the loan portfolio was outside Kuwait. Even so, in the immediate aftermath of the invasion, the bank's management had to battle desperately on three fronts. One was the struggle to get freezing orders against Iraqi and Kuwaiti banks in western countries lifted so that its branches outside Kuwait could function normally. It took three days to get the US authorities to lift their order and a week before a similar order in the UK was removed. Meanwhile, the bank's staff had to cope with thousands of customers stranded outside the country with traveller's cheques and credit cards which no longer worked. Not surprisingly, many of them quickly switched to banks based in western countries. NBK's branches never formally closed down during the days of the freeze, but they were at a considerable disadvantage when handling customer needs. 'We lost quite a few customers in the first few weeks after the invasion,' NBK says. Since then, it has regained much of the lost business and taken on new customers, largely as Kuwaiti customers of the country's other banks shifted to it. The third and trickiest problem was to regain access to its records housed in its head office in Kuwait City. Computer records were quietly collected and driven out of Kuwait and into Jordan via Iraq by courageous employees. Within a few months, all the bank's records were reunited at its temporary headquarters in London. There followed months in which NBK's prime concern was to remain liquid and ensure that the rest of the international banking system could see that it was making its payments on time. Cut off from its traditional funding base of customers' deposits, it sold assets furiously, shedding much of its loan portfolio and commercial paper to keep up with commitments. In December 1990, NBK published interim results. These showed that the bank in exile had total assets of Dollars 5.6bn, about 43 per cent of its pre-invasion size. By then, NBK had two strategies in place. The first strategy was designed to ensure it could operate indefinitely in exile if Kuwait remained under Iraqi control. The other was to start making tentative preparations for the work that would be needed once a return to Kuwait City took place. As it turned out, there had been little physical damage to its Kuwait head office. A new mainframe computer was installed and the bank began functioning again in its old headquarters. But the environment in which it operated had changed dramatically. The Kuwaiti government confiscated Kuwaiti banks' hidden reserves and collateral. Along with other banks, NBK had to accept government bonds in exchange for its domestic loan portfolios. It also lost about 100 staff as part of the general exodus of Palestinians from Kuwait after the war. Mr Dabdoub, the chief general manager and the driving force in the bank, is Palestinian. He remained in London until eight months after the war's end. A post-war strategic review of its future concluded that NBK's existing strategy as a regional niche player should continue unchanged. 'We are fully back to normal, even if we are a bit smaller,' NBK says.</p>

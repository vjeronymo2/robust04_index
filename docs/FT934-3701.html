			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Peres predicts renewed talks with Syria Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said yesterday Syria was ready to renew peace talks after successful shuttle diplomacy by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. The claim came as Syria said it had rejected an Israeli proposal to withdraw in four phases from the occupied Golan Heights in return for immediate peace. Mr Christopher is expected to announce the resumption of Middle East peace talks in Washington in January after a break of seven months when he returns to Damascus tomorrow for a second round of talks with President Hafez al-Assad. In Bonn Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, renewed his demand that Israel stick to a deadline five days away for starting to withdraw Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho. Mr Arafat said the December 13 date was sacred and if it was not met 'it would reflect negatively on the credibility of the peace process'. In Israel officials reiterated that the deadline could not be met although some symbolic gesture might be made. A meeting between Mr Arafat and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, is one option being considered. Mr Arafat is due to meet Mr Peres in Spain tomorrow. Palestinian and Israeli negotiators remain deeply divided on a number of economic and security issues. In Cairo, where talks are being held on military and security issues the two sides have yet to agree the size of the Jericho area, who will control border crossings and the number of Israeli troops who will remain in Gaza-Jericho to protect Israeli settlers. Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said however that the two sides would exchange draft agreements today which would be subject to further negotiations. Some progress has been made in Paris, where the two sides are negotiating future economic relations. Mr Yacob Tsur, Israeli agriculture minister, said yesterday agreement had been reached on a phased entry of Palestinian agricultural produce into Israel starting with 70,000 tonnes of vegetables and 100m eggs in the first year. Mr Tsur also said the Palestinians had agreed to prohibit import of produce from third countries currently prohibited in Israel. Officials also said the two sides had largely agreed on money and banking for the Palestinian economy. Disagreement remains over an Israeli proposal for a customs union with harmonisation of taxes and duties. Meanwhile, Israeli settlers all across Israel demonstrated, blocked roads and shouted anti-government slogans protesting against Monday's killing of two Jewish settlers in an ambush by extremist Palestinians in Hebron. Thousands took part in the funeral procession from Bnei Brak through Jerusalem to Hebron.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Moorgate changes Pep fees - At a Glance Moorgate Investment Management has altered its personal equity plan charging structure from a percentage to a flat fee basis. Instead of a 2 per cent initial and 1 per cent annual charge, the equivalent fees will be Pounds 35 plus VAT and Pounds 30 plus VAT. Those who invest the full annual allowance of Pounds 6,000 should be better off as a result of the change. Moorgate manages three investment trusts: General Consolidated, Moorgate and Moorgate Smaller Companies.</p>

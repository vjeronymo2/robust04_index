			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of the </F> Republic of Kalmykia, by Yelena Dikun; place and date not given:  "Initiative; Ilyumzhinov Is on Top Once Again"]    [Text] On Tuesday the Kalmykia Constitutional  Assembly supported the initiative of Kirsan Ilyumzhinov,  republic president, who replaced the present constitution of  Kalmykia with a "great steppe code." The "code" recognizes the  indissolubility of the relations of Kalmyks with Russia, the  impossibility of the republic's secession from the Federation,  and a single citizenship of the Russian Federation; that is, it  disavows the previously claimed state sovereignty of the  republic. What compelled Ilyumzhinov to surrender to Moscow the  dearest gain of the former Soviet autonomies?    [Ilyumzhinov] I did not surrender any kind of sovereignty.  In  fact, we did have semisovereignty, a condition in which it is  impossible to stay very long. It is equivalent to being half  pregnant or half hanged. There are only two solutions here:  either full independence, separation from Russia in the Chechen  or Tatar variant, or the opposite, unification. After analyzing  the situation, I preferred the second scenario, because under  conditions when everything is falling apart, we will not  extricate ourselves by ourselves. For the sake of preserving  Russia, and its unity and indivisibility, we are taking a step  not away from the center, but toward the center.    [Dikun] It is being said that the laurels of "gatherer of  Russia" are enticing you...    [Ilyumzhinov] I have no such ambitious designs--to go down  in  history. This is a course that is dictated by life itself... I  am frequently asked, why did you go with a white flag to the  White House during the days of the October events? Was it really  in order to save Rutskoy's little suitcases, or to resolve some  of my own affairs? I behaved then not as the president or a  politician, but as an honest man: When two brothers are  fighting, it is necessary first of all to stop the bloodshed.  And my behavior today, once again, is not a political act, but  the step of a normal manager who should call things by their  names. Many run to the Kremlin now, and they swear: They say, we  are with you, we are for a "united and indivisible" Russia, but,  as a matter of fact, they are breaking away from it. But I  declare openly that we cannot live outside of Russia.    As for the rumors that allegedly I intend to reduce Kalmykia  to the rank of a province, they have nothing in common with  reality. I emphasize, I am not changing the state structure; on  the contrary, this would denote an encroachment on the Russian  Constitution. As before, Kalmykia will remain a republic with  all of the pertinent attributes, with its own president and its  own national khural [parliament].    [Dikun] You, evidently, know that there is also another  version that explains your behavior. The MVD [Ministry of  Internal Affairs] and the FCS [Federal Counterintelligence  Service] allegedly have compromising material on you that they  did not circulate as long as you were loyal to the Kremlin, but  all it would take would be for you to desert to the side of the  opposition, for them to threaten you: Either sacrifice  sovereignty, or we will institute a criminal case.    [Ilyumzhinov] I am completely fed up with all of this talk  about the shady origin of my capital. The appropriate services  checked me out numerous times, when I was running for national  deputy of Russia, and when I ran for president--and nothing was  found. And think about it yourself, how can the Kremlin pressure  a republic! This is unrealistic, and even not in the interests  of the Kremlin. Incidentally, even after the October events, I  did not sense any kind of pressure on me on the part of Moscow.    [Dikun] Do you want to say that the attitude of the Moscow  authorities toward you has not changed even a little since  October?    [Ilyumzhinov] Not entirely so. Previously in the Kremlin, I  was, as the saying goes, on a white horse. And even the first  person who eliminated Soviet authority! But after the October  events, a certain coolness emerged in relations, and  misunderstanding: They said, Kirsan betrayed us, deserted us.  But, after all, I never belonged to anyone's team, I always made  my own policy, that which I consider necessary for my own people.    [Dikun] Meanwhile, many interpreted your latest initiative  as  national betrayal. The opposition, with which you assured you  are completely finished, has once again raised its head. A  committee for the protection of the constitution and the state  was organized, and it is demanding from you that you reject your  intentions.    [Ilyumzhinov] In fact, there is no opposition, it is simply  a  handful of people who always come out against everything. In the  main, these are former communists and ex-deputies of the  dissolved parliament who want to get into power at any price.  The so-called parties and movements are not registered anywhere,  just like the committee that they organized. I met with its  representatives at one time, and I understood that it was a  futile matter. They only want to kick up a row.    We took a public opinion poll that showed that 74 percent of  the population supports my initiative, 61 percent of the Kalmyks  are "for." For the most part, it does not matter to the  people--Russians, Kalmyks, Tatars, Jews--under what constitution  and under what citizenship they live. The main thing is that  they have a good wage and filled stores.    [Dikun] Thus, perhaps, this explains everything? Inasmuch as  the transition from socialism to capitalism is proceeding in the  republic with a squeak, do you expect to exchange sovereignty  for Moscow subsidies?    [Ilyumzhinov] If it was a question of money, I would not  undertake all of this. When primary emphasis is placed on  mercantile interest, this does not lead to anything good.    [Dikun] It is known that your colleague presidents have  interpreted your step, to put it mildly, without particular  enthusiasm.    [Ilyumzhinov] Actually, they treated it with caution. Some  of  the regional leaders even began to say that I betrayed someone  and something. I considered myself one of the leaders of the  regional movement, and I came out with the initiative to  establish a Council of Components of the Russian Federation.  Moreover, I was elected its cochairman. And I was treated  accordingly. But, after all, I remained the very same "regional  supporter," and I think that Russia is not restricted to the  walls of the White House and the red Kremlin.    I will not hide the fact that I was even happy, when I heard  on television the statement of the Russian Federation  president's press service of his negative evaluation of my  initiative. This somehow rehabilitated me in the eyes of  colleagues. And they indeed began to call me up from the  republics: They said, we thought that you were playing some kind  of a clever game behind our backs with Yeltsin, but you, it  turns out, are not welcome there.    The other day, I was in the Kremlin, and I talked for a very  long time with Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press  secretary. It became clear that I was not understood quite  correctly there, and they decided that I, in a unilateral order,  without discussions with Moscow, decided "to abolish the  republic." But inasmuch as, I repeat, we do not intend to  "abolish" the republic, then the Kremlin also has no complaints  against me.</p>

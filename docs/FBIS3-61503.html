Ayrapetyan, </F> Biophysics Department at the Armenian Academy of Sciences,  Yerevan; UDC 577.352.5:612.822.6]    [Abstract] The earlier study which showed that low  acetylcholine (AKh) doses stimulate the Ca[.sup]2+[/] influx  into the Helix pomatia neurons and increase the  intracellular cAMP level is continued, and it is noted that the  effort failed to establish the neurotransmitter concentration  threshold at which the Ca[.sup]2+[/] exchange changes in the  neurons. To bridge this gap, an attempt is made to ascertain the  minimum acetylcholine concentration which no longer affects the [.sup]45  [/]  Ca[.sup]2+[/] influx into the Helix  pomatia neurons. To this end, nervous ganglia of  Helix pomatia incubated in 2 ml of physiological  solution containing 10 l of the [.sup]45[/]Ca isotope with  or without addition of 10[.sup]-10[/]-10[.sup]-18[/]  mole/l of acetylcholine during a 1-120 min time span are  investigated. The experimental procedure consisting of two  series of tests is outlined. During the first, the effect of low  acetylcholine concentrations was studied on snails in a  physiologically active state (Jun-Jul) and in the second  (involving two sessions)--on snails preparing for hibernal  hibernation (late November). The effect of various concentration  of acetylcholine on the [.sup]45[/]Ca influx into the  Helix pomatia neurons after various incubation  periods is plotted. The study shows that an increase in the  incubation period shifts the acetylcholine triggering threshold  toward lower concentrations; below an acetylcholine  concentration of 10[.sup]-18[/]-10[.sup]-19[/] M even  after 90-120 min of incubation, acetylcholine no longer affects  the [.sup]45[/]Ca influx. The findings warrant a serious  reevaluation of existing notions of effective neurotransmitter  concentrations and open up the possibility of utilizing  homeopathic doses of biologically active substances in treatment  practices.

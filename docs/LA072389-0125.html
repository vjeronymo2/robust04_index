			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICO RIVERA ACTS TO PUT PARK UNDER PRIVATE MANAGEMENT  </P> <P> Caught in a budget crunch, city officials are proposing to turn over control of  a public park and equestrian center to its manager because of the park's track  record of financial problems.  </P> <P> Without asking for public bids, the city is negotiating with James Gandara, who  has been manager of Bicentennial Park and its 168 horse stalls for 11 years.  Under the plan he would quit his $44,000-a-year city job to become the private  operator of the park complex.  </P> <P> The proposal, which could be approved by Sept. 1, has come under sharp attack  by horse owners who claim Gandara would be forced to cut staff and general care  in an effort to streamline the 11-year-old operation. The horse owners also are  criticizing the city for not allowing others to bid for the control of the  park.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Move Seen as Easing Budget  </P> <P> City Manager Dennis Courtemarche said he has recommended shifting control of  the park to private management as a way to ease ongoing budget problems.  </P> <P> He also has suggested that all department heads trim programs and services to  balance the $22.5-million budget for fiscal year 1989-90. The budget is  expected to be passed Monday night.  </P> <P> "It's getting tougher and tougher to make ends meet," Courtemarche said. "Each  year we spend more money than we're taking. What we need to do is focus in on  how to cut costs."  </P> <P> Courtemarche has made across-the-board budget trims the centerpiece of the  proposal he presented to the City Council recently.  </P> <P> In a letter to the council, Courtemarche said spending in recent years has  outpaced revenue, and city reserves have been threatened.  </P> <P> "We must live within our revenue structure or we may have to drastically cut  our day-to-day operations," he wrote in the June 29 letter. "We have chosen to  deal with the issue now."  </P> <P> And by allowing a private manager to operate the campground and stable, the  city will have more control over its budget, Courtemarche said.  </P> <P> "We've had tremendous fluctuations," Courtemarche said, adding that the city  unexpectedly had to boost the stable's budget by $80,000 last year. "(Now) we  can predict how much money we can get, and don't have to worry about coming up  with additional funds."  </P> <P> Courtemarche estimates that the city will save up to $500,000 by hiring private  managers to run the park and the Pico Rivera Golf Course, near the Whittier  Narrows Dam.  </P> <P> City officials are asking for bids from private management teams to run the  golf course.  </P> <P> Courtemarche defended the proposal to hire Gandara without opening the job to  public bidding because, unlike the golf course, qualified managers would be  hard to find, he said.  </P> <P> Although Gandara operated the facility at $80,000 beyond budget projections  last fiscal year, Courtemarche believes the longtime stable manager could turn  the operation around.  </P> <P> "We have a known quantity," Courtemarche said. "He has knowledge of the  facility and we won't miss a beat when we go to the private sector."  </P> <P> A group of disgruntled horse owners, however, disagree that Gandara could make  the park profitable without either raising stall fees or laying off employees  and cutting back on services and the quality of horse food.  </P> <P> Owners pay between $175 and $225 monthly for food and board for each horse.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is that (Gandara) wants to make money," said Carol Palmer, who  boards five thoroughbreds at the small city-owned stable along of the San  Gabriel River. In fact, she said, "He wants to make a killing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contract 'Is the Pits'  </P> <P> "I know he's going to cut corners," said one horse owner who asked not to be  identified for fear of losing stall space. "(The proposed contract) is the  pits."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Gandara said that the equestrian center and  campground have been fiscally unstable for the past four years. He said that  under a private agreement, he would have the power to make the operation  profitable.  </P> <P> "If I am awarded the contract," he said, "We will keep a very close eye on  expenditures."  </P> <P> Gandara denied charges that animal care will suffer under his private  management. He said nothing will change immediately if the contract is approved  in September. But he hinted that changes may take place in the future.  </P> <P> "I am guaranteeing the same quality of service and management and feed," he  said, "contingent on the financial feasibility." He declined to elaborate when  questioned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Security Guard Concerned  </P> <P> Some employees already fear a layoff is imminent under Gandara's contract, said  Andy Acuna, a park ranger and night security guard at the complex.  </P> <P> "He is just leading people on," Acuna said. He also said that employees who  stayed with Gandara would not receive benefit packages to replace the city  benefits that they have now. The city provides the stable's 12 full-time  employees with full benefits.  </P> <P> Courtemarche expressed confidence that the quality of the center under  Gandara's leadership would not deteriorate.  </P> <P> "(Gandara) could run it more efficiently than we could," Courtemarche said.  </P> <P> Courtemarche said he and Gandara are negotiating the terms on a two-year  contract, which is expected to be voted on by the council in September.  Courtemarche said that under the tentative agreement, Gandara would operate the  stable rent free for the first year as long as he made at least $24,000 in  improvements to the stable and campground.  </P> <P> The second year, Gandara would pay $2,000 in monthly rent, Courtemarche said.  The contract will be renegotiated at the end of 1991.  </P> <P> By the end of this year, the city plans to hire contractors for other  departments and services, from tree trimming to janitorial services,  Courtemarche said. He said this could save the city another $300,000.  </P> <P> It is not the first time city officials have cut spending by turning public  facilities over to private contractors. In 1980, the city turned over  management of the Pico Rivera Sports Arena, next to the equestrian center, to a  private management team.  </P></p>

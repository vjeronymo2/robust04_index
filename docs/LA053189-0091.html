			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC BELL USERS WILL GET $5-MILLION REFUND  </P> <P> Thousands of Pacific Bell's rural customers are expected to share about $5  million in refunds this summer under a quietly negotiated tentative settlement  of a complaint accusing the company of charging customers for push-button  telephone service that it never provided.  </P> <P> The California Public Utilities Commission approved the proposed settlement in  secret session on Friday but issued no press release, apparently at Pacific  Bell's request. The action comes less than three years after the PUC ordered  the phone company to refund millions of dollars to customers pressured into  buying services that they neither needed nor wanted.  </P> <P> For the $5-million settlement, Pacific Bell customers can thank George Sawaya,  a retired senior auditor in the Downey office of the State Board of  Equalization. A resident of the Sierra foothill hamlet of Pollock Pines since  1981, Sawaya has led the three-year battle for compensation for the wrongly  charged phone customers.  </P> <P> As Sawaya explained Tuesday, he decided to sign up for Pacific Bell's "Touch  Tone" service in 1985 after the company sent him, along with his monthly phone  bill, a list of available extra services and their prices. The mailing said  Touch Tone service "places your calls faster than a rotary-dial phone can," a  feature that Sawaya wanted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Marketing Abuse' Charged  </P> <P> But after Sawaya paid a $5 sign-up charge for the service and agreed to pay an  extra $1.20 a month for it, he found no improvement. After calling Pacific  Bell's local office, he learned that the older, non-digital switch serving much  of El Dorado County could not provide full Touch Tone service. He cancelled the  service and Pacific Bell refunded his payments.  </P> <P> Then, Sawaya said, he thought about his neighbors served by the same  electromechanical switch, along with the 30% of Pacific Bell customers then  served by similar equipment. So in January, 1986, he filed a class-action  complaint with the PUC.  </P> <P> At the subsequent hearing, Sawaya described the literature describing Touch  Tone as "deceptive or misleading." He called it "a form of marketing abuse not  unlike others which have recently been under consideration by the Public  Utilities Commission."  </P> <P> Sawaya was referring to a PUC finding in August, 1986, that Pacific Bell had  intentionally engaged in abusive sales techniques. Among other things, its  agents, working under a quota system, improperly sold basic telephone service  with such extras as call-forwarding and call-waiting. Some customers claimed  that the Pacific Bell sales pitches misled them into believing that such  services were not available individually or that they could not get basic  telephone service without them.  </P> <P> The PUC made Pacific Bell offer refunds, at a cost to the company of more than  $40 million, to affected customers. It also was required to contribute to a  consumer-education fund.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sawaya Persevered  </P> <P> A major difference between the marketing-abuse case and the recent one, Sawaya  pointed out, was that in the first case the company was at least providing the  services for which it was billing customers.  </P> <P> At Sawaya's 1986 hearing, a senior Pacific Bell engineer, Loren Wedel,  testified that there was no physical change in Sawaya's service as a result of  his having signed up for Touch Tone service. Only billing records were changed,  the engineer confirmed.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the PUC dismissed the case on the technical grounds that because  Sawaya had obtained a refund, he could not intervene on behalf of other  customers in a class-action complaint. Undeterred, Sawaya asked for a  rehearing.  </P> <P> That rehearing petition was dismissed behind closed doors on Friday. But in  exchange, Pacific Bell assured the commissioners that it would submit a plan to  refund "about $5 million" to customers in Sawaya's circumstances -- a  settlement Sawaya viewed "positively." It also agreed not to charge them in the  future for Touch Tone service, which is now available to Pollock Pines  customers.  </P></p>

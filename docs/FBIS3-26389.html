Business leaders say the territory will benefit as Vietnam  enters a new era of opportunity and prosperity. Hong Kong is  already the second-biggest investor in Vietnam, while many U.S.  and other foreign firms investing there will use Hong Kong as a  springboard.    U.S. President Bill Clinton announced the end of the embargo  yesterday. It was imposed in 1975 when U.S.-backed South  Vietnam fell to the communist North.    Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey said the lifting of  the embargo would show the 27,000 Vietnamese boat people in Hong  Kong that "their future lies in Vietnam, not in a detention camp  in Hong Kong. It will help get home the message that the  Vietnam they left perhaps four, five years ago is different to  the Vietnam today," he said. Mr. Asprey said he expected more  Vietnamese to volunteer to go home, but cautioned it could still  take two years before all were repatriated.    Since 1988, Hong Kong has given refugee status to only the  15  percent who could prove a justified fear of persecution. The  rest are kept in closed camps and given cash incentives to go  home. More than 41,000 boat people have volunteered to return  home from Hong Kong. Nearly 13,000 more have been forcibly  repatriated.    Meanwhile, Hong Kong traders were advised to move fast as  the  country opened up. Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC),  executive director Francis Lo said: "Now is the time for Hong  Kong companies to position themselves in that market so they can  be ready to take full advantage of the lifting of the embargo."  He said consumer products were especially in demand.    Mr. Lo said it would mean a new and important era of  opportunity and prosperity in Vietnam. Despite the fact  competition was bound to become more intense, Mr. Lo said the  outlook for Hong Kong companies was encouraging. He stressed  that the territory must move quickly in Vietnam to stay ahead of  competitors from other Asian countries.    Hong Kong is Vietnam's biggest source of investment after  Taiwan, after rising 51 percent to $296.4 million in 1992. Hong  Kong's domestic exports to Vietnam increased another 14 percent  in the first 11 months of 1993 to reach $319.8 million.    The Vietnamese trade representative in Hong Kong, Dao Tran  Nhan, said Hong Kong would benefit from an end to the embargo  because many American firms already had their regional  headquarters here. He said the Hanoi government was drafting  laws to protect foreign investors.    Foreign companies would use Hong Kong as a springboard,  though some would invest directly, Mr. Nhan said. Mr. Nhan also  said Hong Kong entrepreneurs who had already invested in Vietnam  would not lose out because of competition from the Americans.  He said most Hong Kong investments were in the tourism industry.    The Hanoi government hailed the decision yesterday and vowed  to keep cooperating with efforts to account for Americans  missing in action (MIA) from the war. Deputy Foreign Minister  Le Mai also said Vietnam accepted Mr. Clinton's proposal that  the two countries exchange liaison offices, but stressed that  Hanoi still sought full diplomatic relations with Washington.    He said the opening of liaison offices should come soon, but  he would not guess how long it would take to normalize  diplomatic relations. "That depends on the goodwill of the two  sides," he said, adding that Vietnam wanted "normalization  without preconditions".    But Mr. Mai bristled at Mr. Clinton's comment that his  decision was not irreversible, saying that trade embargoes  violated international law and so did threats to reimpose them.  He would not be drawn on his personal reaction to the news: "I  think the Vietnam issue is a very emotional one in the United  States. We, the Vietnamese, are less emotional about it."</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: HL&amp;H tumbles 51% on fall in consumer spending THE deteriorating state of the South African economy and the country's severe drought saw attributable earnings at Hunt Leuchars &amp; Hepburn (HL&amp;H), the industrial company in the Rembrandt group, fall by 51 per cent in the six months to end-September, compared with the same period a year earlier. Turnover rose marginally to R331.9m (Dollars 114.4m) from R325.7m, but pre-tax profits fell to R33.1m from R48.05m. Attributable profits dropped to R23.6m from R47.8m due to a sharp turnround in income from associated companies where losses of R1.8m were incurred against profits of R12.1m in 1991. Mr Neil Morris, chief executive, described the results as 'very disappointing', saying all the companies were affected by the continuing decline in consumer spending. Of the subsidiaries, Robertsons increased its contribution to attributable profits to 62 per cent from 31 per cent in 1991. However Transvaal Sugar's performance was hit by the drought and expects it will only produce 140,000 tonnes of sugar this season compared with 220,000 in 1991/2. Its contribution to profits dropped to 34 per cent from 36 per cent. Mr Morris said the two associates, Rainbow Chickens and HL&amp;H Timbers, performed unsatisfactorily. Rainbow recorded attributable losses of R18.9m against profits of R5.7m. Rainbow's share of HL&amp;H earnings fell to a negative contribution of 32 per cent against a 9 per cent contribution in 1991. HL&amp;H Timber suffered from local demand sinking to its lowest level in 20 years. Mr Morris said although trading conditions in the short term were expected to remain difficult, second-half earnings should improve, based on the continued good performance of Robertsons, the expectation of a return to profitability at Rainbow and an improvement in the timber operations. Overall earnings for the year to March are likely to be below those of the 1992 financial year.</p>

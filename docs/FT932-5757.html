			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Faber Prest declines to Pounds 1.65m midway on reduced volumes FABER Prest, the industrial and distribution services company, reported half-year pre-tax profits down at Pounds 1.65m compared with Pounds 1.84m in the previous period. The board declared an interim dividend up 16 per cent to 5p (4.3p) out of earnings per share down at 10.25p (11.69p). It said the company now had a sound base from which to take advantage of growth opportunities. Turnover for the six months to end-March fell to Pounds 32.5m (Pounds 34.7m) with the company, which has adopted the FRS 3 accounting standard, citing reduced volumes and margin pressure across UK markets. The directors stated that overseas activities, now some 10 per cent of total sales including contributions from associated companies, were performing 'satisfactorily'. Operating profits, with the contribution of associated companies, amounted to Pounds 2.11m (Pounds 2.31m). There were net exceptional charges for the six months of Pounds 218,000 (Pounds 64,000 credits) relating to reorganisations and discontinued operations. The directors said that net borrowings were 'significantly lower' at Pounds 4m, attracting net interest of Pounds 237,000 (Pounds 530,000).</p>

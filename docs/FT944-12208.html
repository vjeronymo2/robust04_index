			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sumitomo Metal Mining tumbles Sumitomo Metal Mining, one of Japan's leading gold and nickel mining companies and ranking third in copper, yesterday reported a big fall in pre-tax profits for the first six months to September 30, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. However, the 49 per cent decline to Y355m (Dollars 3.6m) from Y692m a year ago was broadly in line with expectations. The net profit of Y158m was 29 per cent lower than last year's Y122m, and was scored on sales of Y182.43bn, down 5.1 per cent from Y192.33bn last time. The company maintained its forecast of a slight recovery in pre-tax profit in the full year ending March 30 1995. Sumitomo said that although the market for copper and nickel recovered somewhat during the six-month period, contract-currency prices of both gold and nickel were lower than a year before because of the yen's strength. A company official said Sumitomo saw an average rate of Y101.00 to the dollar during the period. The company said volume sales of gold and copper declined from a year before. Copper sales, for instance, fell 8.2 per cent to 94,841 tonnes, while gold sales were down 4 per cent to 10,828kg. As a result, overall sales in the company's metals division dropped 10 per cent to Y145.58bn from Y162.52bn. On the Tokyo Stock Exchange the company's shares closed Y7 down at Y953.</p>

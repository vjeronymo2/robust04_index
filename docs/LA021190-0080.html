			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: CALMER SEAS AHEAD?  </P> <P> When "The Love Boat: A Valentine Voyage" sets sail on CBS Monday night at 9,  Lauren Tewes won't be aboard with her many former co-stars. Tewes, who played  cruise director Julie McCoy on the hit series -- a lucrative role derailed, in  part, by her admitted cocaine addiction -- says she was offered only a small  cameo on the reunion show.  </P> <P> She turned it down.  </P> <P> "I've done that," says Tewes, who says she's now drug free. "I didn't want to  go back to such a small part. It really didn't interest me."  </P> <P> (Fred Grandy, now a Republican congressman from Iowa, is the only other  original cast member missing from "A Valentine Voyage.")  </P> <P> In 1985, Tewes confessed her drug problem to TV Guide. There were also reports  of a salary dispute. "Love Boat" co-exec producers Aaron Spelling and Douglas  Cramer let her contract run out. Neither producer wished to comment on Tewes'  history.  </P> <P> Although her acting career never fully recovered, she's been getting work,  including a small role in the recent USA Network suspense-drama "The China Lake  Murders." Married to musician Paolo Nonnis, Tewes has also been active in local  theater -- currently directing "The Head" at the Matrix Theatre.  </P> <P> "I hope and pray that that's all past now," Tewes says of her troubles. "I  think I made the right choices by trying to stay in the business while it was  trying to keep me out, by following my own heart and my own drive, and by  making the choice to stick it through."

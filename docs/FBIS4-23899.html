			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Louise Flanagan and Chandre Gould] </F>   [Text] Defence Minister Joe Modise has inherited a covert  intelligence-gathering unit -- the Director of Covert Collection  [DCC] -- riddled with dirty tricks operatives from the total  onslaught era.    Last week Modise moved to interdict the MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN  [WM&amp;G] from publishing further details about the workings of  the  DCC, which was partially purged after being raided by Mr Justice  R Goldstone in late 1992.    Since last week Modise has improved on his technique in  dealing with the press. When the WM&amp;G asked the military to  confirm that 62 people had been members of the DCC he both  responded to our request and called a press conference on  Thursday after the newspaper's deadline.    A long-term investigation has established that:     -  The DCC's director is Brigadier Horace William Doncaster,  alleged former head of the Johannesburg City Council spy ring.    -  Second in command Colonel Gerry Borman was the handler of  former CCB [Civil Co-operation Bureau] Transvaal chief Staal  Burger.    -  Two of its operatives were still collecting information on  the  ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress as late as March this year.        The DCC contains former Rhodesian security agents, one of  whom worked for the South African Military Intelligence [MI]  unit responsible for running Renamo [Mozambique National  Resistance] and Unita [National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola].    -- One of its key front companies, Pan Afrik Industrial  Investment Consultants (PAIIC), is apparently still operating,  despite South African Defence Force [SADF] assurances a year ago  that it was being de-registered.    A Defence Ministry spokesman said the company was currently  in the final stages of being wound up, but did not explain the  delay.    The Goldstone raid unmasked the DCC head office front  company  Africa Risk Analysis Consultancy (Pty) Ltd (Arac). A year later  the M&amp;G exposed PAIIC, which was used to employ 62 DCC  members.  As happened with the military's now disbanded Civil  Co-operation Bureau [CCB], these people were ordered to "resign"  from the SADF and work for PAIIC so that their connection with  the SADF would be hidden.    About 20 former CCB members were hired by PAIIC. This  enabled the 62 to operate within South Africa's borders, which  was not part of their brief as MI agents. PAIIC catered only  for those operating within South Africa. Operatives based  outside the country would have fallen under other front  companies which are still unknown. The use of front companies  was an officially authorised strategy.    Former DCC member Jan Anton Nieuwoudt stated in court  documents filed during 1993 that he joined PAIIC on the orders  of General Joep Joubert, General Witkop Badenhorst and Brigadier  Tolletjie Botha.    Immediately after the Goldstone raid then-president FW de  Klerk announced that 23 officers had been suspended from duties  and might face charges in relation to criminal activities.  Despite promises by De Klerk, few further details were revealed  and the 23 -- about half of whom have never been named, despite  De Klerk's assurances that they would be -- simply lost their  jobs and dropped out of sight.    The results of inquiries by both General Pierre Steyn and  Judge Goldstone into DCC were never made public nor handed to  the attorney-general's office. Nobody from the organisation was  ever charged. At least two former DCC members, Nieuwoudt and  Commander Jack Widdowson, sued the SADF for unfair dismissal and  won substantial settlements. Some have quietly been given their  jobs back.    A group of 23 of the PAIIC members are appealing to  President  Nelson Mandela to clear their names. It was the representatives  of this group, Gerhard Jansen van Rensburg and Clive Brink, that  Modise briefly interdicted from speaking to the press. Van  Rensburg and Brink have emphasised that their aim was never to  expose either their fellow officers or their sources as Modise  claimed in the interdict.    "Contrary to the allegations contained in the SANDF's [South  African National Defense Force] application for the interdict,  we have not revealed the names or identities of sources,  collaborators or informers of former colleagues, neither is it  our intention to do so now, or in the future," said the PAIIC  group.    "We joked about contacting our old sources (now) in senior  positions and asking them for jobs, but decided against it  because it's an issue that needs to be dealt with by the new  government," said PAIIC group member Wally Wilsenach this week.  "We are not prepared to sacrifice them for our own selfish  gain."    As Wilsenach was not affected by the gag, he was able to  talk  to the press. He also emphasised that he would not identify  colleagues. The PAIIC group believes their dismissal points to  a conflict between intelligence agencies within the country.  They allege that the Counter-Intelligence directorate  identified them as a way of shifting attention from themselves.    Wilsenach claimed Counter-Intelligence had information about  DCC members' links with MI6 and Zimbabwean CIO [Central  Intelligence Organization] as well as information about illicit  diamond deals and fraud.    The Defence Force has restricted access to the public files  on Arac and PAIIC -- a restriction which still seems to be in  force. More ominously, PAIIC appears to be operating despite  official SADF claims that it closed down in February 1993.    Goldstone found that Arac was set up in 1988 with the sole  director an Eric Johan Pelser. The address Pelser gave turned  out to be false. A public register indicates that PAIIC was set  up in January 1986 with the sole member a Ernst John Panzhorn, a  name interestingly similar to that of Arac's director.    This week Penzhorn, a Pretoria lawyer, denied having any  links to the Defence Force or any of its front companies. He  said his legal firm had registered PAIIC during the 1980s: "If  I am indicated as a director/member it could have been for  purposes of initial registration only, as often happens,  whereafter the interest in the company or CC is transferred  after registration," he said, adding that he could not say  whether PAIIC was still in business.    The public records clearly indicate that, although the PAIIC  file is restricted, the corporation is still in business.  Penzhorn is also named on public records as linked to MI front  Global Capital Investments cc, which was finally deregistered in  1992. Penzhorn says he sold Global Capital Investments as a  dormant company during the 1980s and no longer had any interest  in it.</p>

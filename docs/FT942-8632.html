			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Crabtree makes 69% advance to Pounds 1.3m Crabtree Group, the Tyneside-based manufacturer and supplier of printing machines for cans and computer stationery, yesterday announced a 69 per cent increase in interim profits. The rise for the six months to March 31, from Pounds 768,000 to Pounds 1.3m, came on turnover ahead 27 per cent at Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 8.92m). Earnings per share doubled to 5.8p. An interim dividend of 3p is declared. Mr Karl Watkin, chairman, described the performance as 'outstanding' and said the full year would show an improvement on last year's Pounds 3m profit, achieved on turnover of Pounds 23.4m. Credit Lyonnais Laing, the company's broker, yesterday forecast profits of Pounds 4m pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 26.5m for the current year, for pros-pective earnings per share of 18.9p. The current 6p dividend forecast is to be revised. The group came to the market in June last year at 150p via a Pounds 19.4m shares and cash reverse takeover of Crabtree Holdings by Somerset Trust. The shares yesterday rose 6p to 354p. It continues to look for a suitable acquisition; serious negotiations with several companies are in progress, but Mr Watkin said; 'We aren't going to be rushed into any acquisition just because people expect us to.' The group, comprising Crabtree of Gateshead, which claims to be the world's biggest supplier of printing and coating machines for the three piece can market, and Crabtree Morgan, which manufactures printing equipment for computer stationery, exports about 95 per cent of output to more than 50 countries; growth markets include Vietnam and Mexico.</p>

The prosecutor's office is expected to seek an arrest  warrant  for Han, 58, Saturday after further questioning him on the  alleged misappropriation of the slush fund, its exact amount and  its use.    Officials at the prosecutor's office said Han built up the  slush fund by misappropriating NACF budgets set for local  branches between April 1991 and October 1992. The officials  said their investigation showed that the fund amounted to 300  million won, of which Han allegedly embezzled 180 million won.</p>

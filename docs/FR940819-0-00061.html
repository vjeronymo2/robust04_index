			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix B to Subpart F_Performance of Refrigerant Recovery, Recycling and/or Reclaim Equipment was mistakenly referred to in the introduction of appendix B as ARI Standard 740&hyph;1991. However, this is incorrect. Appendix B is based upon ARI Standard 740&hyph;1993. Through this action EPA will correct the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference in the introduction to appendix B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Appendix D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix D to subpart F_Standards for Becoming a Certifying Program for Technicians includes reporting requirements for approved programs. Certifying programs are required to submit to EPA activity reports every six months, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first to be submitted six months following the date the program was approved. Since EPA has been approving programs on a continual basis, these reports are due at various times, instead of being submitted simultaneously. In order to maximize EPA's ability to review and respond to the information supplied by the programs, EPA is standardizing the reporting dates. Certifying programs will submit reports to EPA on January 30 and June 30, beginning with the first full six-month period for which the program has been approved. This means that if a program is approved on March 31, that program is required to submit its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first activity report to EPA on the following January 30.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Removal of Parenthetical Statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is deleting the parenthetical notes in the individual sections of 40 CFR part 82, subpart F. The Agency consolidated its display of OMB control numbers in 40 CFR part 9 (see 58 FR 18014, 58 FR 24724, 58 FR 34198 and 58 FR 34369) including the control number for 40 CFR part 82, subpart F; this consolidated display makes the parenthetical statements in the individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections of Subpart F duplicative. The information collection request (ICR) was previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Effective Dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final action will become effective on October 18, 1994 unless EPA is notified by September 19, 1994 that any person wishes to submit adverse comment. Should EPA receive such notice, EPA will publish one subsequent action in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to withdraw this final action and another action proposing this action and requesting comments. In such a case, following a public comment period, the Agency will draft the final regulation to be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary of Supporting Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether this regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a rule that may:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affect a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or tribal governments or communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been determined by OMB and EPA that this amendment to the final rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review under the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;602, requires that Federal agencies examine the impacts of their regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking, it must prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). Such an analysis is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Embassy of Ukraine in Austria--date not </F> given]    [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Speaking at a plenary  session of the special forum committee of the CSCE for  cooperation in the area of security in Vienna on 19 January,  Ambassador Yu. Kostenko, head of the delegation, informed the  participants about the signing of the tripartite statement in  Moscow by the Presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and  Russia on the problem of nuclear disarmament. The  representative of Ukraine noted that this statement, the text of  which was disseminated at the CSCE forum on behalf of the  delegations from Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, crowned  a long political and diplomatic marathon and is a result of  intensive and complex work. It confirmed a well-known truth:  Any problem, even the most complex ones, can be resolved only  by way of compromises. The ambassador drew attention to the  fact that the tripartite statement mentions political guarantees  of Ukraine's security too -- that is it confirms its  independence, sovereignty, and existing borders.    The representative of Ukraine emphasized that the Ukrainian  Government is counting, in connection with the elimination of  nuclear weapons located in Ukraine, on receiving from the CSCE  the necessary assistance and support in ensuring Ukraine's  national security on the basis of the principles of the Helsinki  Final Act.    On behalf of the European Union, the head of Greece's  delegation read out an EC communique in connection with the  tripartite statement. The communique evaluates highly the  accords achieved and expresses the hope that the legislative  procedures necessary for them to come into force will be carried  out without delay.    Speaking at the session, representatives from the United  States and Russia also evaluated highly the tripartite accords,  emphasized that they are opening the way to nuclear disarmament,  and expressed the hope that they will come into force and be  fully implemented in the near future.

Addressing the inaugural ceremony of the National  Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering in  Faisalabad today, he said Pakistan's nuclear program is purely  peaceful and we have no intention to develop a nuclear weapon.  The president said we will welcome and cooperate on any  proposal from any quarter to make South Asia a nuclear-free  zone. However, Pakistan will not accept unilateral restrictions  on its peaceful nuclear program on the pretext of  nonproliferation.    Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said Pakistan has acquired  political stability after a long time. The government is now  concentrating on promoting industrial infrastructure by  advancing science and technology in the country.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 Apr (MENA)--The Sudanese Ummah Party has  announced that the Sudanese security agencies rearrested  al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, leader of the party and former prime  minister, 24 hours after releasing him, without giving any  reasons.    The party said in a statement in Cairo today that the day  before yesterday, security authorities asked al-Mahdi about the  party's activities at home and abroad, his 'Id al-Fitr sermon,  and his continuing refusal to reconcile with the ruling regime.    The statement said: "The arrest reaffirms the confusion and  tension experienced by the regime after losing every  justification for survival."    The statement appealed to the world community, human rights  organizations, and Arab and non-Arab media to pressure the  Sudanese regime to release al-Mahdi and all Sudanese prisoners  immediately.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / CSCE set for fresh effort on Karabakh AN INTERNATIONAL effort to settle the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh is due to be made at a ministerial meeting in Helsinki today of the 48-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), writes Robert Mauthner in Helsinki. The dispute over the region, which is part of Azerbaijan but the majority of whose inhabitants are Armenians, has so far defied the conciliation efforts of several mediators. Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the Czechoslovak foreign minister, given a mandate by the North Atlantic Co-operation Council, has delayed his departure to give CSCE ministers a chance to discuss the problem.

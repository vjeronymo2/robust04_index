			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Making the most of investing abroad - The best ways to take advantage of financial opportunities outside Britain THE FALL in the pound's value has highlighted the attractions of overseas investment for British investors. Not only is there the possibility of a windfall gain in the case of a sterling devaluation, but overseas bond and share markets often can outperform their UK equivalent. So how does an investor venture abroad? Currency funds These invest in foreign currency money market instruments, and so offer a return which reflects the general level of interest rates in the overseas country. Earlier this week, for example, Rothschild's Deutschemark fund was yielding 8.6 per cent, the peseta fund 11.86 per cent, and the dollar fund just 2.23 per cent. Caution is needed, though. There are no hard and fast rules in foreign exchange markets, as the past few weeks have shown. But a good guide is that the higher a country's interest rates, the weaker the currency. So, the higher yield available from a peseta fund might easily be cancelled out by a decline in the currency. Conversely, those UK investors who switched into a dollar fund a few weeks ago, when the exchange rate was Dollars 2 to the pound, had to accept a very low yield. But they have already made a capital gain of around 17.5 per cent. Currency funds can be used to postpone tax, which is payable only when money is brought back to the UK. So, money can be left to 'roll-up' within the fund, compounding at the gross rate. An investor paying tax at the higher rate, and who expects to retire in a few years, might use a fund to postpone tax until he retires and drops to a lower tax band. Bond funds. Non-British investors traditionally have held a good part of their investments in bonds, but the concept has been slower to catch-on in the traditionally inflation-ridden UK. The appeal of an international bond fund is that interest rates should fall (and bond prices, therefore, rise) as the world economy tries to escape from recession. The investor might also benefit from any depreciation in the pound. Of course, the two effects could cancel out each other. Bond prices might fall, even if the pound declines, and a bond rally could be offset by sterling appreciation. The long-term performance of such funds has been only moderate to date. The nine funds that have been running for five years have achieved an average growth (with income re-invested) of 19.9 per cent, a performance beaten easily by a building society although far superior to international equity growth funds. But some experts believe that the 1990s will be the 'decade of the bond,' so returns might improve (see page VI for fund launches in the sector this week). Equity funds If you want to invest in overseas shares, you have a very wide choice. There are 166 unit trusts in the international growth sector, a further 19 classed as international equity income, 125 North American funds, 132 European, 88 Japanese, 106 Far Eastern and eight Australasian. In addition, there are 45 international investment trusts, 22 European, four North American, six Japanese, 26 Far Eastern, and a further six concentrating on 'emerging markets' (see article below). But the caveat which applies to bond funds is even more apposite for equities. Stock market movements can be both rapid and substantial - and can wipe out a currency gain easily. A UK investor might have decided correctly in August 1990 that the yen was due to strengthen against sterling. But if he had backed that hunch with an investment in Japanese equities, the 40 per cent fall in the Tokyo stock market would have wiped out his 15 per cent currency gain. The risks and rewards are greatest with a single country fund. The average Australasian unit trust, for example, fell 40.1 per cent over the five years to September 1. But the Gartmore Hong Kong fund showed an 106.7 per cent gain over the same period. A broadly spread international equity fund should reduce the volatility  - although the 1987 crash showed that the world's major stock markets were quite capable of all falling together. Indeed, international growth unit trusts failed to live up to their name in the five years to September 1 - the average fund in the sector fell by 15.9 per cent, and only 13 of 103 showed any gain at all. International general investment trusts did rather better with an average gain of 12.6 per cent, helped by a narrowing of the discount over the period. When choosing an overseas unit or investment trust, there are two important factors to consider. One is income. Other markets traditionally have traded on a lower yield than has been available in the UK. At the beginning of September, the average yield on European investment trusts was 1.7 per cent, and 0.9 per cent on Japanese trusts, compared with 6 per cent on the average UK general trust. The second factor is the personal equity plan rules. Trusts committed to keeping 50 per cent or more of their assets in the European Community qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 PEP allowance. But other trusts - including the biggest in the sector, Foreign &amp; Colonial - qualify only for a Pounds 1,500 allowance. Some readers may want to invest directly in overseas equities. This can be cumbersome, with brokers forced to impose additional charges to reflect settlement costs and dividend collection procedures. But Fidelity launched a specialist service recently for those interested in overseas investment, with a minimum commission of Dollars 38 for US stocks and Pounds 100 for European equities.</p>

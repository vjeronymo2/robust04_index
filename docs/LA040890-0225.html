			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> TUSTIN;  </P> <P> KELLY CALLS SALVOS OF FOES 'CHEAP SLIME' AS CITY COUNCIL CONTEST HEATS UP  </P> <P> Now that the City Council election has cleared lengthy legal hurdles and will  be held Tuesday, some campaign forces have come out swinging, and most of the  last-minute round of mudslinging is aimed at incumbent John Kelly.  </P> <P> "I've been campaigning in Tustin for a decade, and I've never seen the cheap  slime that these desperate candidates are generating," Kelly said.  </P> <P> He has been criticized in anonymous campaign flyers and posters that have  recently appeared on trash cans and telephone poles in the Old Town area, where  he runs a family-owned tuxedo shop. Because the flyers were posted rather than  mailed, the Political Reform Act does not require that they carry  identification, a state Fair Political Practices Commission spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Anti-Kelly forces have also cited, among other things, two-year-old internal  police documents that accuse Kelly and Councilman Earl J. Prescott, his  political ally, of harassing precinct workers on the night of an election in  November, 1988.  </P> <P> Kelly has said no impropriety occurred, pointing out that he and Prescott were  never arrested or issued citations. But leaders of the Tustin Residents Action  Committee insist that the documents, obtained through a public-records request,  show an abuse of power and unprofessional conduct by the councilmen.  </P> <P> TRAC, which is led by presidents of the city's powerful homeowners  associations, has vowed to oust Kelly and endorsed three other candidates:  Leslie Ann Pontious, Charles E. (Chuck) Puckett and Jim Potts.  </P> <P> Kelly and Prescott said a city employee must have leaked the existence of the  police accusations to TRAC. The group's chairman, Carl Kasalek, denied the  allegation.  </P> <P> This weekend, TRAC began distributing a flyer entitled "Tustin Tomorrow," in  which the group asks, "What happens if John Kelly wins?" The flyer criticizes  past Kelly actions, including his opposition to a redevelopment project, his  taping of a conversation with a city staff member and his run for Congress  during his first council term.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, five of the candidates -- Puckett, Pontious, Potts, Dennie E.  Pederson and John Norman Butler -- have declared that returning respectability  and order to the City Council is the No. 1 campaign issue.  </P> <P> The candidates all said they want to alleviate traffic, reduce crime and  maintain the quality of life in Tustin. However, some issues split them into  two camps. While Kelly, Carole Bryant and Berklee A. Maughan would opt to move  City Council elections to November and reduce the power of city staff members,  the other candidates disagreed.  </P> <P> Until last week, when a Superior Court decision cleared the way for Tuesday's  election, the vote remained uncertain. Kelly and Prescott filed two  unsuccessful lawsuits, alleging that the ordinance was invalid on the grounds  that former Councilman Ronald B. Hoesterey was not a resident of Tustin when he  voted for it.  </P> <P> There are five candidates vying for two four-year terms:  </P> <P> * Kelly, 28, the only incumbent. In his first reelection bid, Kelly is  advocating a change in council leadership and has pledged to fight taxes and  traffic.  </P> <P> * Puckett, 47, district sales manager for Beatrice-Hunt/Wesson and former  planning commissioner. Puckett, who ran unsuccessfully for the council in 1982  and 1988, said he wants to fight traffic and expand the Police Department.  </P> <P> * Bryant, 41, an accountant and owner of a manufacturing company. She calls for  strengthing police and solving traffic problems, which she links in great part  with car-pool lanes on freeways.  </P> <P> * Pederson, 42, construction manager for Northrop Electronics Systems Division.  Pederson said he would try to keep the city's growth and expansion at a slow  and steady pace.  </P> <P> * Pontious, 44, co-owner of a Tustin travel agency and former planning  commissioner. Pontious said she wants to encourage redevelopment projects to  raise money for the city and help pay for important road projects.  </P> <P> There are three candidates competing for a two-year term left vacant by  Hoesterey's resignation:  </P> <P> * Butler, 34, a real estate broker, wants to try to alleviate traffic  congestion by routing traffic around the city rather than through it.  </P> <P> * Maughan, 52, a retired financial executive, wants to see more everyday  involvement by residents and less power for the city manager and city attorney.  </P> <P> * Potts, 37, a business owner and sergeant with the Irvine Police Department,  would work toward a moratorium on high-density building, start citywide  recycling and build more bicycle and jogging trails.  </P></p>

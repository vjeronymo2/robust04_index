			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Two Japanese trust banks establish securities units MITSUBISHI Trust and Banking and Sumitomo Trust and Banking, the Japanese trust banks, yesterday took advantage of the country's financial deregulation to establish securities subsidiaries. Japan's five other trust banks are either planning new securities arms or have shelved plans to establish new companies. This highlights the effects on the banking industry of reduced asset values and the upsurge in non-performing loans. Three banks said yesterday that securities subsidiaries were 'under consideration'. Toyo Trust and Banking said it had other priorities, including dealing with non-performing loans. Nippon Trust Bank said it had no plans to enter the securities business. Before the collapse of Tokyo stock prices and the downturn in trading volume, most Japanese banks had welcomed the opportunity to enter the securities business provided by the Financial System Reform Act, effective from April this year. The entry of the two trust banks follows the opening of securities units in July by two long-term credit banks, the Industrial Bank of Japan and the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, and by Norinchukin, the central agricultural bank. However, the banks are strictly limited in the services they can offer. They can underwrite and trade in straight bonds, but only underwrite convertible bonds and warrant bonds, while they are excluded from the stock market. Both Mitsubishi Trust and Sumitomo Trust will capitalise their subsidiaries, Mitsubishi TB Securities and STB Securities, at Y20bn (Dollars 188m). The former will have 35 staff, rising to 65 next year, and the latter will begin operations with 38 staff. Mitsubishi Trust intends to concentrate on dealing in Japanese government and corporate bonds, but will review the operations if the Ministry of Finance further relaxes the limits on the subsidiaries' dealings in the next two or three years. The ministry has indicated that the restrictions will be gradually relaxed, but the timing will depend on the health of existing Japanese brokers, which oppose the banks' entry into the stock market.</p>

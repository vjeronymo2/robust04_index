The attack on the  National Party was launched to disguise the dilemma currently  facing the ANC. This dilemma concerns the fact that the ANC,  campaigning for the withdrawal of the Internal Stability Unit of  the South African Police [SAP], now suddenly criticizes the SAP  for its absence during the shooting incident. The dilemma and  embarrassment of the ANC is worsened because their leaders are  not repudiated when they instigate their supporters to turn  their rifles and bullets on the SAP. To criticize the National  Party in order to disguise one's own shame is scandalous and  laughable. The ANC's double-talk is already absolute proof that  the electorate will not trust their vote and their future to a  party characterized by a culture of double-talk.</p>

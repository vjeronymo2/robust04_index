			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Leave the green shoots alone When an economy is at long last on the path of non-inflationary growth the wisest course would be to leave well alone. The worst act of folly would be to push interest rates down and tax rates up, both of which have their advocates among the chancellor's forecasting panel. Panicky and wrong-headed measures to tackle the notorious Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement would be worse than leaving it to be eroded by recovery, and by the tax increases already put in place by Norman Lamont before he was booted out at the prompting of the Tory party chairman and chief whip. It would have been astonishing if the extremely large reduction in UK nominal short-term interest rates from 15 per cent to 10 per cent inside the exchange rate mechanism and a further drop to 6 per cent outside it, had not ultimately stimulated domestic spending. In spite of the prevailing obsession with the debt overhang, interest payments have plunged as a proportion of personal and corporate income. Because they have been humiliated by too many earlier optimistic forecasts, economic officials have been careful to downplay the strength of recovery. But the evidence is pouring in, thick and fast, that for once growth is faster than was expected. The most comprehensive indicator is real gross domestic product, excluding the erratic oil sector. This was rising in the first quarter at an annualised rate of almost 3 per cent - well above most estimates of the growth of productive capacity. In itself that could be erratic. But look at the most surprising indicator of all, unemployment. Nearly all forecasters agreed it would continue to rise for the first few months of recovery. Instead it has been dropping since last January. This is too long a period to be explained away by distortions such as end-year efforts by officials to get people off the unemployment register. The most popular explanation is that employers are now quicker to hire and fire - which means that unemployment is now more of a coincident indicator. This confirms the impression that output is rising faster than productive capacity, and thus making inroads into unused resources both of capacity and of labour. The labour market turnround is occurring much earlier than after the last recession, when output reached bottom in 1981, but unemployment did not turn down until 1986. Another feature is that the recovery seems in part to be export-led. This is remarkable, considering that the UK's principal customers on the European continent are now moving into deep recession themselves. There has been no comparable improvement in the balance of payments, because after a devaluation import prices normally increase faster than export prices. In any case we are back with a monster 'balancing item' of unrecorded receipts. In every upturn there will always be lagging sectors, where companies 'cannot see any recovery'. Even for the whole economy, we cannot rely on present luck continuing quarter by quarter to the same extent. There could well be periods of slower export growth, and thus slower overall growth. Those who take the economic temperature every day will then no doubt join those already urging the government to cut interest rates. But any resulting sterling depreciation will risk stoking up inflation, and provoke beyond endurance Britain's trading partners. The latter just about tolerated the 15 per cent devaluation of Black Wednesday, but would regard anything further as beggar-my-neighbour policies with a vengeance. On the external side, few realise quite how revolutionary the turnround in UK competitiveness has been. British labour costs per unit of output have been falling by some 2 to 3 per cent a year - due in equal measure to a sharp slowdown in pay settlements and a rise in productivity. On top of that has been what some regard as the bonus of devaluation. If you look at the trade-weighted sterling index and not just at the D-Mark alone, you will see that this has hardly been eroded in recent weeks. With luck rather than foresight, the UK managed to devalue when there was a large amount of slack in the economy, and domestic inflationary pressures were at their lowest for decades. There are always some mysteries about the British economy, The first mystery now is: how much slack is there in the economy - or more accurately how far is output below the equilibrium or sustainable rate? The second question is: how rapid is the underlying trend rate of growth? (I suspect that it is rather faster than the Treasury's estimate of 2 to 2 1/4 per cent a year.) A third and related question is: how much of that Pounds 50bn deficit represents recession? Fourth, how sensitive is the deficit to the business cycle. These are not small questions. If we take the common estimate that one third of the Budget deficit is structural, this amounts to, say, Pounds 17bn. The sum is within the Maastricht guideline of 3 per cent of GDP. But this is not the only way in which the Pounds 50bn figure gives the wrong impression. Letter after letter used to arrive saying that the Treasury did not know how to run a whelk stall because it confused current and capital spending. Yet since Norman Lamont promised to make this distinction in the November Budget, there has not been a flicker of interest in the subject. Still, if we take the distinction seriously the Treasury's attempt to separate the capital from current spending - to which it is committed in the Budget due in November - the current deficit comes down to about Pounds 30bn, or less, as I stated on this page on May 27. If we put the cyclical and capital spending corrections together the result is an adjusted current Budget surplus. If you want to criticise the Treasury for something, it is for the belief of too many (although not all) of its high officials, that the UK is under-taxed. This does not survive a second's scrutiny of the record. During the 10 years of office of the supposedly anti-spending Thatcher government from 1979 to 1989 the tax-burden rose from less than 35 per cent of GDP to more than 37 per cent. The reduction of nearly 3 percentage points since then is nearly all the result of recession. Taking national insurance and consumer taxes properly into account, the marginal rate for most taxpayers is still well above 50 per cent. The last chancellor had to introduce phased tax increases, not because the tax burden is too low, but because of discretionary increases in spending which crept in when the government guard was down in the pre-election period. The main reason why Treasury officials itch to increase the tax burden has nothing to do with wider political economy. It is because fundamental 'curbs' - rarely real cuts - have to be phased in a long way ahead to avoid breaking previous commitments. Moreover, the effect of many expenditure measures is difficult to quantify in advance. By contrast, under the British apology for a constitution, the chancellor can get up and announce precise tax changes which become law the same day, and with which Treasury computers can get to grip. Nevertheless if further tax increases are the best that the party which is supposed to believe in holding down public spending can achieve, then the long-term prospect is of handing more and more of the national income to the state, and having to visit the Czech Republic to see limited government in operation.  ---------------------------------------    COMPANIES AWARE OF 'GREEN SHOOTS'  --------------------------------------- Only in domestic market        18% Only in export markets         28% In both                        24% No                             28%  --------------------------------------- Source: Trade Indemnity  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

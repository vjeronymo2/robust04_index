			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Strong European demand for World Bank's yen deal the first of its kind - was launched yesterday to a strong reception from investors, particularly in Europe. Lead managers of the Y250bn, 10-year issue said the bonds could have been sold two and a half times over at the indicated price range, of 17 to 19 basis points below the yield on the benchmark No 129 Japanese government bond. Demand for the issue was particularly strong from the UK and continental Europe: early indications there suggested the bonds could have been sold at a yield of more than 20 basis points below the benchmark yield. The slightly more generous pricing range was chosen to give the bonds wider distribution. About half of the issue has been sold provisionally in Europe, with 20 per cent going to Japan and 10 per cent in other Far East centres. US investors are expected to take 15 to 20 per cent. Bankers said there was little switching out of Japanese government bonds to take up the issue, though the yield on the No 129 rose slightly on the day. For international investors, the bonds are more attractive than those in the government market. They are free from withholding tax and there is no need to switch between issues to keep abreast of the current Japanese government benchmark. Given the strength of demand for the bonds the formal pricing, to take place today, is expected to result in a spread of 19 basis points below the No 129. At that level, the bonds would yield 5.37 per cent with interest calculated on a semi-annual basis, compared with the 5.435 per cent yield on the No 129 yesterday when calculated on a simple basis. That would put the yield around seven basis points below the Japanese Development Bank's Y120bn Euroyen benchmark issue last summer, accounted for by the greater liquidity and broader distribution of the World Bank issue. The scale of demand for the issue is likely to flush out other Euroyen issues in the coming days, bankers said. 'There is no way all the yen demand is fulfilled by this issue,' one said. Elsewhere, the European Investment Bank came with a tightly-priced CDollars 500m issue which, at a yield of just 13 basis points over the relevant government benchmark, appeared to be targeted once again at the traditional Italian buyers of the EIB's paper. The spread on the 10-year issue was well below that on other Canadian dollar issues - Ontario Hydro's global bond, for instance, which is yielding some 60 basis points more than the EIB paper. The pricing appeared to have been determined largely by the familiar popularity of EIB bonds to Italian investors, whose freedom from withholding tax on the borrower's issues is expected in some quarters to disappear at some stage this year. Also, the bonds have the added attraction of a coupon close to current interest levels, at 8.875 per cent, and so benefit compared with high-coupon existing issues, which trade at a premium and so carry an implicit capital loss. In other issues, Deutsche Bank stepped in to launch an Ecu300m, seven-year issue, taking advantage of the continued delay in the rumoured Ecu1bn issue for Denmark, which has yet to appear. Demand in the sector had built up to a level which allowed Deutsche, issuing in the name of Deutsche Bank Finance NV, to sell the paper with little apparent resistance at a yield of 8.4 per cent, around the level of an EIB issue with a coupon of 9 per cent also due 1999. Two floating-rate note issues from Italian financial institutions - Cariplo, the AA1-rated savings bank and Isveimer, the unrated credit institution - were launched with widely different spreads. At a spread of 37 basis points over six-month Libor, Isveimer's Dollars 150m, three-year issue was said to have sold out during the day. Cariplo's Dollars 200m, five-year deal was launched with a spread of 17.5 basis points over Libor In yesterday's report on the new agreement on exchange of clearing information between Cedel and Euroclear, the two European clearing houses, it was reported that Cedel had initially 'resisted' the concept of delivery versus payment (DVP). In fact, the disagreement between Euroclear and Cedel was over the definition of what constitutes DVP. Cedel had always advocated that the concept of DVP, which is absent from the original 1980 agreement, should be included in the new bridge agreement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 4 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] In relation to the administration's plan to  introduce the national welfare tax, Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura indicated strong opposition on 3 February to  the decision made despite the disagreement of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. It is very unusual for a  chief cabinet secretary, who serves as the prime minister's  "head clerk," to contest the government's policy. Apparently,  Takemura had thought that the prime minister's final decision  would not indicate the rate of tax increase or the period of  implementation, and that it would be acceptable to the SDPJ. He  seems to be increasingly unhappy with Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, who acceded to the wishes of Ichiro Ozawa, secretary  general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] -- who represents the  Finance Ministry's views -- as in the recent case of the Diet  deliberations on the political reform bills.    At a general meeting of Sakigake's [Harbinger] Diet members  held in the early hours of 3 February, strong criticism of the  prime minister flared up. Takemura seemed to believe that "What  happened was so abrupt that we were all baffled. There are many  Diet members who do not approve of this. If we let things go on  like this, the situation is going to become very serious." Some  Sakigake members expressed the opinion that "You should (ask the  prime minister to revise his plan) with a determination to  resign [if he refuses]."    Takemura also spoke at the gathering. One Diet member  attending the meeting said, "Our leader [Takemura] thinks that  if the plan is not revised, the coalition government will  collapse. He was dead serious." He disclosed that if the prime  minister does not revise his plan, Takemura is determined to  resign as chief cabinet secretary.    However, Takemura himself denied this at a news conference  in  the early evening of 3 February, saying: "I have not expressed  any intention to resign. I am not thinking of leaving my job  half done." Nevertheless, he seemed to have definitely given  the impression at the Sakigake meeting that he would resign.    Takemura visited the prime minister at the latter's office  on  the morning of 3 February to ask him to revise the tax plan. At  a news conference held later, Takemura said: "There are no  absolutes in politics. There is also the saying that the best  thing to do with a mistake is to correct it. There are  instances in which it is not right to take the attitude that  what has been decided cannot be changed." He thus indicated  that an agreement has been reached at his meeting with the prime  minister to revise the tax plan. It seems that a rebellion from  the very core of the administration, on top of the bitter  opposition from the SDPJ, the No. 1 ruling party, has succeeded  in accelerating moves to effect a revision.    Takemura had commended the flexible attitude taken by the  SDPJ before the prime minister made his decision. He was,  therefore, taken by surprise by the subsequent decision of the  prime minister, whom he had expected to take the SDPJ's position  into consideration, to accede 100 percent to the suggestions of  the Finance Ministry.    In this connection, Takemura said during the news  conference:  "The prime minister had been fully informed of developments in  the SDPJ. He might have taken the optimistic view that somehow  things would work out in the end." Other senior government  officials gave a different version of what happened. They  claimed, "Because top- ranking SDPJ officials had said 'The  government can do as it likes,' there could be various  interpretations of this." In any case, the influence of Ozawa,  in speaking for the Finance Ministry, can undeniably be felt  behind the prime minister's decision. Takemura, who was not  able to participate directly in the decisionmaking process  leading to the plan to introduce the national welfare tax, must  have had very mixed feelings.</p>

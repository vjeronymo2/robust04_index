The demonstration lasted about one and half an  hours at Gate No. 1 of the Eighth U.S. Army compound.  Protesting drivers said that Chong Yang-han, age 48, was  driving his "Arirang Taxi" along a back alley near Hannam  Village, Hannam-dong around 11:20 a.m. when an American M.P.,  identified only as Cpl. Harrison, who was following the taxi in  his patrol car, stopped Chong. An argument ensued between the  two over whether Chong violated a lane. In the quarrel,  Harrison all of a sudden handcuffed Chong and took him into the  Eighth Army compound, the drivers said. Learning of the  incident, about 100 "Arirang" drivers drove their taxis to the  gate to stage the protest until Chong was set free around 3 p.m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin/Cologne (DPA) -- After years of negotiations,  the restructured national radio station Deutschland Radio will  begin broadcasting on 1 January. In the future, two channels  concentrating on information and culture will be broadcast on  VHF and medium-wave. Deutschland Radio is an amalgamation of  three stations and will be based in both Berlin and Cologne.  The new public broadcasting corporation will receive more than  300 million German marks annually from radio licence fees (75  pfennigs per month).    Cologne-based Deutschlandfunk, which has been financed by  the  federal authorities, will change very little. In Berlin,  however, RIAS, which was financed by the United States and then  by the Ministry for Intra-German Relations and the former GDR  station DS-Kultur, will merge. The Berlin part of Deutschland  Radio will be based in the RIAS building. The directors of the  new radio will be based in Cologne. The ZDF director Dieter  Stolte is currently in temporary control until a new director is  appointed. The most likely candidate is Ernst Elitz, television  chief editor at Sueddeutscher Rundfunk.</p>

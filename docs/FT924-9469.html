			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Managers buy out ex-Foseco unit CELMAC, one of Britain's leading manufacturers of toilet seats, was yesterday bought out by its management from Burmah Castrol for Pounds 3m. The company, which employs 135 in Manchester and 45 in Wicklow, Ireland, was part of the Foseco group, which Burmah Castrol bought last year. The lavatory seat company was losing money at the time and was being restructured by Mr David Coveney, managing director and leader of the buy-out team.</p>

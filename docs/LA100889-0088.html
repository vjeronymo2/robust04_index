			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUMANE SOCIETY AWARDED CUSTODY OF SEIZED FOXES  </P> <P> A Pasadena Municipal Court commissioner has refused to return eight Arctic  foxes to an Altadena woman who was arrested last January for keeping the wild  animals in her back yard.  </P> <P> Commissioner Warren C. Haas on Tuesday awarded custody of the foxes to the  Pasadena Humane Society, where they have been living behind a chain-link fence  in a concrete-floored kennel for the last nine months.  </P> <P> Steve McNall, executive director of the society, said he would try to place the  gray-and-white kits, which are native to Alaska, in a zoo or wildlife education  program.  </P> <P> State game officials seized the animals on Jan. 24 from the home of Cheryl  Moraga, 36, who said she had purchased two adult foxes as pets from an animal  broker about five years ago. She said she never intended for the foxes to  breed, but when they did, she said she cared for the kits as if they were her  own children.  </P> <P> Although the foxes are not endangered or particularly rare, they are classified  as exotic animals in California and are illegal to keep without a permit, state  game officials said.  </P> <P> Moraga, who was also charged with possessing marijuana after game wardens saw  about a dozen plants growing in her back yard, was fined $235 and sentenced to  one year probation.  </P></p>

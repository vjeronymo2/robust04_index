			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The House of  Representatives committee on discipline voted Thursday [23 June]  to order former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi to formally  apologize in the Diet for his unruly actions at a lower house  budget committee meeting last Friday.    Yamaguchi, a legislator without party affiliation, threw  water at the seat of budget committee chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi  to protest the committee's decision to summon former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for questioning over his financial  affairs. Yamaguchi is not a committee member.    "His behavior essentially deserves barring from the house,  but he also expressed some feelings of regret," Yoshio Yatsu, a  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) legislator, said in explaining  the light punishment.    All committee members from the two main opposition groups,  the LDP and the Social Democratic Party, voted for the motion.    The lower house is expected to adopt the committee's order  for Yamaguchi to apologize at its next plenary session, which  may be held as soon as Friday.    The House of Representatives decided earlier in the day to  bring Yamaguchi before the committee on discipline for his  misbehavior.    The last time disciplinary measures were taken against a  lower house member was in June 1973, when Japanese Communist  Party legislator Masako Kobayashi was barred from the chamber  for 20 days.</p>

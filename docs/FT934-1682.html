			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Last orders at a movable feast: Robert Peston examines a report that criticises a European development bank No one talks or knows about this institution.' So said Mrs Paule Dufour to explain why the Council of Europe's Social Development Fund strayed from its original purpose - financing projects to help resettle or absorb refugees in Europe - towards generating profits from money markets and giving generous rewards to staff. Sitting in her elegant 19th-century Parisian office, a few hundred yards from L'Etoile, she said that even when she became president of the fund's governing body in 1990 she had difficulty obtaining information on its work. Partly as a result, she commissioned Castel Jacquet Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, to carry out a wide-ranging audit of its activities. Its report, which has not been published but has been obtained by the Financial Times, is a lesson in how multinational development banks should not be managed. Set up in 1956, the social fund, with assets totalling Pounds 10.5bn at the end of 1992, became a rich gravy train for staff and provided a pleasant sinecure for the former politicians and officials who comprised its twin supervisory boards, the governing body and the administrative council. According to Ernst &amp; Young, the bulk of its loans - which totalled Ecu6.7bn (Pounds 5.1bn) at the end of 1992 - were made without properly monitoring where the money was going. There was often no way of telling how borrowers used the relatively cheap loans. The problem was particularly acute in Italy. Because it did not know where money was going, there was also a risk that it could face unforeseen losses on loans - though Mr Roger Vanden Branden, who resigned as governor last month, pointed out that to date the repayment record of borrowers had been good. But it was in its staff remuneration practices that Ernst &amp; Young says behaviour was encouraged that ran 'contrary to the ethics which should govern the professional life of an international official'. Executives were given big expense allowances without proper checking to ensure expenses were actually incurred. They were also granted subsidised loans totalling FFr16.9m (Pounds 1.94m) at a 3 per cent interest rate, but there were no effective controls to ensure loans were being used as intended for mortgages on principal residences. The report says some of these loans were used for property speculation. Probably the most unorthodox practice was the withdrawal of substantial sums from the pension fund by executives who had completed 10 years of service with the social fund, though they remained in office. The main beneficiary was the governor, Mr Vanden Branden. But if what the fund did was dubious, Mr Vanden Branden cannot take all the blame. As he said in a statement to the FT, Ernst &amp; Young does not say that he broke institutional or pension fund rules. However Ernst &amp; Young lists examples of rules which were imprecisely drafted and liberally interpreted. Mr Vanden Branden also said in his statement: 'Management accounts were . . . approved . . . by the administrative council, which each year commended the governor (Mr Vanden Branden) for his management.' In the words of Mrs Catherine Lalumiere, the secretary general of the Council of Europe (a parallel organisation to the European Union) under whose umbrella the fund falls, it was a 'child abandoned by its parents'. What she means is that it was given too much autonomy by its shareholders: 21 Council of Europe members, including France, Germany and Italy but not the UK. Perhaps out of embarrassment at their negligent stewardship, the shareholders did not want public disclosure of the Ernst &amp; Young report although they have been quietly trying to reform the institution via representatives on the supervisory boards. But earlier this autumn, rumours about the report's content circulated at the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly in Strasbourg and eventually details appeared in the French newspaper Le Monde. Soon after came the resignation of Mr Vanden Branden, a Belgian who has been associated with the fund since 1962 and has been governor since 1979. Mrs Dufour said she believed he should have left earlier: 'The first lesson to learn from what happened at the fund is that, in an international organisation where controls on management are never as strong as in a national organisation, it is wrong to allow executives to keep their jobs too long.' Another lesson is that the responsibilities of the two supervisory boards, consisting of government appointees, were imprecisely drafted when the fund was set up. The two boards met no more than a few times a year and in practice delegated considerable power to Mr Vanden Branden and executives. Any desire among board members to subject the fund to stricter controls may have been tempered by the fringe benefits they enjoyed, which were generous for a public institution. As listed by Ernst &amp; Young, they included liberal expense allowances for meetings, per diem payments for senior board members, cash advances and automatic reimbursement of travel expenses at the highest ticket price. Until they received the Ernst &amp; Young report, European governments had taken comfort from the fund's profitability, much of it derived from playing the international money markets. The fund raises money from money markets which it then lends to projects that meet its social objectives or invests in securities and complicated financial derivative instruments, such as swaps and options. The question raised by the Ernst &amp; Young report is whether the balance of its activities is tilted too much towards making short-term profits from financial markets. Though the shareholders have guaranteed to provide capital resources of Ecu1.14bn, they have injected only Ecu20m of cash. From this tiny investment, the fund has generated profits of almost Ecu800m since its creation, including Ecu109m in 1992 alone. This income is in effect distributed to the shareholders in the form of special loans at the highly subsidised interest rate of 1 per cent, well below the fund's normal lending rate. Yet despite its profitability, Ernst &amp; Young warns the fund was taking 'significant' risks in generating money market profits which could 'compromise the fund's financial stability in the medium term'. The fund also departed from the established practice among multinational development banks of organising an open competitive tendering process among securities firms when raising money from bond markets. Two lesser-known German and Swiss banks were regularly awarded the mandate for issuing bonds on the fund's behalf. 'The principle of no competition is very bad,' said Mrs Dufour, though she added the fund had been able to raise funds at competitive rates. The worst flaws were in the fund's management of staff and in its lending practices. Though many executives benefited from lax controls over subsidised loans and expenses claims, Mr Vanden Branden appears to have profited most, according to Ernst &amp; Young, though he insisted that his remuneration package and other benefits were worse than for the heads of comparable development banks. Ernst &amp; Young gives a catalogue of questionable practices: In 1991, his undisclosed salary for the whole year was paid in advance at the start of the year. His travel expenses of FFr111,314 in 1991 and similar amounts in 1990 and 1989 were reimbursed on the basis of an annual travel expense account filled out by himself. In 1991, they included seven weekend trips to Brussels, for some of which no reason was given. As overseer of the pension fund, he allowed executives to make withdrawals totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds after completing 10 years of service. He 'made his 10-year withdrawal in 1989 and since 1990 has indulged himself with an annual withdrawal (which was FFr865,000 in 1991), made at the beginning of the year'. The report criticises this policy as a 'compliance breach' which 'hurts the APF's (the pension fund's) portfolio management, so hurting the interests of other officers'. He set up representative offices of the social fund in Brussels and Rome without getting the approval of the administrative council. In response to these criticisms, Mr Vanden Branden said in his statement that the 'equilibrium' of the pension fund had not been 'prejudiced' by the withdrawals. The bulk of the report concentrates on the fund's drift away from its original aim of financing schemes providing work and accommodation for refugees and other displaced persons, or assistance in relocating them. In a 'de facto and unplanned way', according to Ernst &amp; Young, it started to commit money to many other socially motivated developments, such as general housing construction projects in Italy, an irrigation scheme in Spain and an electricity project in Turkey. According to Mrs Dufour, the fund even financed the construction of a Sheraton Hotel in Milan. Ernst &amp; Young says that, whatever the nature of the projects, the fund did not take steps to ensure budgeted costs were reasonable and that the best construction methods were used. More seriously, it did not employ sufficient staff to verify the money was being used for the intended purpose - nor did it receive sufficiently detailed information from applicants to allow effective monitoring to take place. Ernst &amp; Young comments: 'We believe this situation is worrying; the sample tested did not show the fund was able, using the information received from the beneficiaries, to verify that the loans granted were indeed used during the period from issuance of the funds to completion of the project for the projects approved.' A shortage of information on use of funds is most marked on loans to Italy and Turkey, the two biggest borrowers, which between them have received more than Ecu4bn from the fund since 1981. Italian projects benefited from a special exemption such that there was no monitoring of any loans under Ecu3m dating before January 1992. Ernst &amp; Young says that 'according to the head of monitoring, the beneficiaries are unidentifiable, the co-operatives involved are dissolved after completion of the project and the managing banks are incapable of providing supporting documents'. Meanwhile large 'global loans' have been made to the Turkish government  - Ecu597m in 1991 and 1992 alone - based on a list of approved projects but without precise allocation of funds to individual schemes. So in effect these have been additions to Turkey's foreign currency resources - though if Turkey had tried to raise the funds directly on international markets, the cost would have been far greater because its credit rating is worse than the fund's. Mrs Lalumiere of the Council of Europe said that, for all its apparent shortcomings, 'more than ever, the fund is useful'. Because of the war in the former Yugoslavia and the turmoil in the former Soviet Union, Europe is facing its biggest refugee problem since the creation of the eastern bloc after the second world war. She hopes that changes in the fund's rules which come into effect in the new year will rejuvenate it. Executives are to be subjected to stricter control by the supervisory boards and an increased emphasis has been placed on the fund's original purpose of helping refugees and displaced persons. Further reform of the monitoring procedures for project loans are likely once a successor to Mr Vanden Branden has been found. As for Mrs Dufour, her fiercest criticism of the fund is not directed at what it did in the late 1980s and early 1990s but rather at what it did not do. Because of its penchant for making short-term profits, it avoided making loans to parts of Europe where the needs and risks were biggest. Mrs Dufour said: 'The greatest scandal is that we did not lend a penny to Yugoslavia.'</p>

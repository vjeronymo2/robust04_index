			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The May 1993 study addresses the long-term geological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal of high-level waste (spent fuel) and is not directed to the short-term interim storage of spent fuel at nuclear power plants. The report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluates processes over 10,000 years of repository performance for geological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal. The conclusions of the report are not applicable for the interim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage period of a 20-year cask certificate during which spent fuels stored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the DSC have to meet the NRC's criteria to ensure that cladding is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protected. Under normal operation of the ISFSI, leakage of radionuclides is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not expected to occur. The design and the double-seal welding of the DSC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covers are checked and tested to provide structural integrity throughout the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved storage period. During normal storage conditions, the licensee is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to conduct a radiation monitoring program to ensure protection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workers and the safety of the general public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. A number of comments were related to broad policy and program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues in connection with the storage and disposal of high-level radioactive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste, including the DOE repository program. Some commenters questioned the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of dry cask storage and technology in general. Some commenters stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that only dry storage casks that would be compatible with DOE interim or final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repository operations, including transportation, should be approved for use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under a general license.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G.1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . One commenter does not want any more casks approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until a permanent Federal repository is opened. The wet fuel pool is a proven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology that has been successful in containing radioactivity. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter stated that dry storage is dangerous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The NRC, in implementing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1982, has an obligation to review dry storage technologies and to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether to approve the use of these technologies for the storage of spent fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if they meet applicable safety requirements. The July 18, 1990, 55 FR 29181,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking found that spent fuel stored in dry storage casks designed to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NRC regulatory requirements can safely contain radioactivity. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking adds one cask design that meets the safety requirements previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed to the list of approved casks. The previous responses to comments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as the detailed safety and environmental analyses underlying this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking (and described elsewhere in this notice), all reveal that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS will conform to the NRC requirements and that its use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not pose the potential for significant environmental impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE is required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to accept spent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel for ultimate disposal. Moreover, the Commission made a generic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination in its waste Compliance Decisions (September 18, 1990,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 55 FR 38474 and August 31, 1994, 49 FR 34658) that safe disposal is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technically feasible and will be available within the first quarter of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21st century.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dry cask storage has significant advantages over wet storage in that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system is passive and requires minimal human intervention. No pumps, filters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or water quality monitoring are needed to maintain the conditions necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for wet storage. The only monitoring required for the Standardized NUHOMS is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> daily temperature monitoring and visually checking inlet and outlet vents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G.2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . A number of commenters wanted a full formal trial-type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public hearing on the use of the NUHOMS cask.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

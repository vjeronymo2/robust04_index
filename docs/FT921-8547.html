			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (10): Handheld system helps cut costs - Application case study IF NOTEBOOK computers are the thoroughbreds of the portable computing stable, handheld machines are the workhorses. Limited in functionality but easy to use, light in weight and low in cost, they are suited to a range of business purposes for which larger machines are either too sophisticated or too expensive. Or perhaps too bulky and inconvenient for easy use by a salesperson. Gallaher, the UK-based international group with its origin in the tobacco business, thinks so, anyway. Its involvement with handheld computers for its sales force stretches back 13 years and it is already debating plans for its next generation of systems. The company is one of the world's largest tobacco enterprises but it also has extensive interests in spirits - Vladivar vodka is one of its brands - optical products, retail distribution and houseware. It is a sophisticated user of computer systems for conventional data processing; its involvement with handheld machines, however, takes it into more controversial areas - strategic use of information technology for competitive advantage and alignment of IT strategy with business strategy. The tobacco business is on the decline but that is not, according to Mr Michael Friend, general sales manager, reflected in Gallaher's performance. It has about 40 per cent of the UK marketplace and is selling more cigars and cigarettes than ever before - but in a different fashion. Tobacco is not immune from the sweeping changes that have changed the face of retail distribution. Independent retailers now tend to obtain their stocks from cash and carry operations or from wholesalers, while the large chains are increasingly turning to centralised warehouses. Evidence of the change comes from the decline in the number of Gallaher's direct accounts: from 50,000 ten years ago to around 19,000 today. Gallaher's response was to look for a better way to deploy its 250-strong sales team. It believed it could improve efficiency and service by combining the roles of direct and indirect sales in a single force. The precedents were not encouraging. Gallaher's competitors had tried similar moves with only limited success. It made sense, therefore, to carry out a large-scale trial in a single region before rolling out the new approach nationally. The region chosen was Western Division; the trial began in 1989. Gallaher's first experience of handhelds was with a simple device, the M55 , marketed by Unilever Computer Services, since taken over by Electronic Data Systems of the US. Interestingly enough, the group's move into handheld computing was not driven by one of the company's young turks, but by Mr Tony Goodburn, a sales engineer of mature years who has since retired. Today it is using a more sophisticated machine developed by Victor Technologies part of the Tandy Group based in the US. Victor was a pioneer in the personal computer business, but lost its way in the 1980s. Under Tandy's ownership it is recovering its bounce; it is, for example, one of the leaders in portable computer systems in which keyboards are replaced by handwritten input. The Victor machines allows sales people on the road to place orders from customers and print invoices as well as receiving messages through electronic mail. Printing the invoice is a big plus, saving hours of paperwork. It also calculates VAT automatically. At the end of the day, the sales people send the result of their endeavours to the company's main computers at Northolt, Middlesex, over the telephone network. There is no cabling or interfacing to worry about; the computer is laid on a 'plinth' - essentially, a telephone terminal equipped to receive information from the computer through an infra-red link. Mr David Adams, sales programme manager, notes the importance of a lack of obvious or complex equipment where salepeople are working from home. The trial has been a success; Gallaher executives say it would not have been possible to combine the two sales forces in one without the computers. The reason, Mr Adams says, is the amount of paperwork necessary for each kind of account. Different order and invoices are used for direct and indirect sales. Both are stored in the computer and called up at the press of a key. Without electronic help, the salesperson would risk drowning in paper work. The system has now been implemented across the country at a cost of some Pounds 500,000. That represents a large chunk of Gallaher's data processing budget. Mr Adams said it was justified to senior management on grounds of cost-cutting. Delivering order data automatically over the telephone meant that fewer staff were needed to handle mail orders. There were, inevitably, teething problems with the system and not always obvious ones. The units are battery powered and at one stage Gallaher found it was going through batteries at a remarkable rate. It discovered that unbeknown to Victor, the composition of the springs which retain the battery had been changed by a supplier. The result was a reaction which drained the battery. Every set of springs had to be changed to solve the problem. Then there was the tiny printer which sits on top of the computer to issue invoices operates by leaving an image on thermal paper. The sales team was issued with plastic wallets to file the copies. Again, a chemical reaction between the plastic and the paper meant that in weeks the invoices faded. Leather replacements for the wallets solved the problem. The company is measuring the success of the trial by improvements in service to its customers. It believes it has shaved 24 hours off the average delivery time. In today's fiercely competitive markets, that is an advantage well worth having.</p>

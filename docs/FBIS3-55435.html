The party's main social aims are that each family in  the Dniestr region should enjoy modern housing with full  amenities with at least 20 square meters per person, a car, a  telephone, good furniture, and television and video recorder.  Creators of this party believe their action program is similar  to those of President Boris Yeltsin's team, Yegor Gaydar and  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, as well as programs of democrats and  reformists in Ukraine and Moldova. Its leaders stated that  their party will strive for the Dnestr republic achieving a  status that would guarantee conditions for civilized democratic  development, irrespective of what happens in the main territory  of Moldova. The party's efforts will be directed to achieving  the lasting peace in the region.</p>

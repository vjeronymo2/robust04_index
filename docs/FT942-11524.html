			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Cost cuts lift Philips 150% in first quarter Philips, the Dutch electronics group, raised profits by more than 150 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 in spite of the recession that continues to plague its main European markets. Net profit rose to Fl 260m (Pounds 93m) from Fl 103m a year earlier, thanks mainly to cost-cutting and further declines in group financing expenses. Turnover was virtually flat at Fl 13.7bn, with strong rises in Latin America and Asia helping to compensate for a decline in sales in Europe, where Philips generates slightly more than half of total sales. 'Business remains extremely difficult in Europe,' said Mr Dudley Eustace, finance director. The improvement in operating profit to Fl 695m from Fl 560m a year earlier was due chiefly to cost-cutting. At the same time, a further reduction in group debt enabled Philips to lower its financial expenses nearly 30 per cent to Fl 254m. Mr Eustace said the repairs made to Philips' balance sheet over the past year meant that it did not need to issue shares, but a share issue might be possible if Philips were presented with a substantial acquisition. The company is keen to grow by acquisition in the media sector to complement its position in consumer electronic 'hardware'. Despite the first-quarter rise, Philips remained cautious about the extent of improvement in net profit from normal business operations in 1994. The company's best-performing sector in the quarter was components and semi-conductors, where operating profit nearly doubled to Fl 372m. Consumer electronics, the company's single-biggest business, swung into an operating profit of Fl 42m from a loss of Fl 28m. Grundig, the German consumer electronic manufacturer that is 32 per cent owned by Philips, reduced losses slightly, but it continues to suffer from its narrow focus on Germany, Spain and Italy. Mr Eustace said Philips had started setting aside DM10m (Pounds 4m) per quarter to pay for the planned DM400m acquisition of the remaining Grundig shares in the year 2004, as agreed with the Grundig family in 1984. Professional products as a whole posted a Fl 47m operating loss, against a Fl 9m loss.</p>

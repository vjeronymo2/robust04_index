			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / CBI expects growth in manufacturing orders to continue Orders placed with manufacturers rose at the fastest rate for nearly six years in the past quarter, as increased export demand boosted business recovery, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. Its latest quarterly survey of industrial trends predicts that this growth will continue in coming months, although at a slightly slower rate. The survey notes, however, that investment growth remains slow, and warns that hints of inflationary pressures are emerging in industry, albeit from a very low price level. The CBI surveyed 1,151 companies about their performance in the past four months and expectations for the next four months. It says that the proportion of companies reporting an increase in orders, compared to those reporting a fall, rose to a positive balance of 18 per cent in July. This trend is expected to remain broadly stable in the next four months, although output is expected to moderate slightly after surging in the past four months. The report suggests that this rise is spread across most sectors. The aerospace and the food, tobacco and drink sectors reported relatively weak performances. Most engineering sectors reported a strong performance, with the proportion of companies reporting an increase in output running at a positive balance of 45 per cent for the mechanical engineering sector, and about 30 per cent for the chemicals, metal products and electronics sectors. Exports are providing a large boost to activity in most sectors, with a 19 per cent balance of companies expecting exports to rise in the next four months, compared with 18 per cent in the April survey and 1 per cent in July last year. This rise is expected to boost employment, with the proportion of companies reporting that they expect to increase staff in the next quarter, compared to those which expect to shed it, at a negative balance of 11 per cent - the least negative figure for almost five years. The report highlights significant discrepancies between sectors, with companies employing fewer than 500 people the main source of increased employment. These size differences affect unit costs and productivity. Overall, a positive balance of 6 per cent of companies expect unit costs to rise. Only companies employing fewer than 500 reported a rise in the past quarter, and only companies employing fewer than 200 and manufacturers of intermediate goods expect costs to rise sharply in the next quarter. Companies employing more than 5,000 and those producing intermediate goods expect the greatest increase in productivity in the next four months, not least because they continue to reduce staff. The survey notes that capacity utilisation has risen, with the proportion of companies working below capacity running at 54 per cent last quarter - the same proportion as in October 1990, just before the recession. But only 19 per cent of companies say plant shortages will limit demand in the next four months.</p>

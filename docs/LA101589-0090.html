			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARALYZED U.S. AWAITS PERFECT CLARITY;  </P> <P> PANAMA: IN MESSY FOREIGN-POLICY SITUATIONS, REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAINTY AND  CONTROL ARE OFTEN TANTAMOUNT TO A COMMITMENT TO INACTION.  </P> <P> Some have blamed "wobbly diplomacy" for U.S. failure to take effective action  during the Panama coup attempt. Some have blamed the absence of an effective  crisis-management process, while others have cited "excessive prudence" or  "timidity." Still others have concluded that a "profoundly anti-interventionist  mood" in Washington was the basic reason that the United States did not act to  assist Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega and his fellow officers in trying to topple  Manuel Noriega.  </P> <P> I believe the culprit was failure to understand the fundamental characteristics  of violent events -- a failure widely shared in our time by the executive and  legislative branches of U.S. government.  </P> <P> Comments of some senators and top Administration officials reveal that U.S.  foreign policy and policy evaluation are driven by the desire for clarity,  certainty and control, even in situations that are intrinsically and  necessarily doubtful, ambiguous and volatile.  </P> <P> Again and again, Administration spokesmen -- responding to questions about  their inaction -- have explained that information was inadequate, that sources  were of unknown reliability, that plans for the coup attempt were unclear and  the United States' ability to control the situation unsatisfactory.  </P> <P> Typical of such statements: "All through the day, the President was getting all  these different sets of facts from different sources, and none of the sources  was that good, anyway."  </P> <P> "Unless it's your coup, it's hard to know what is really going on."  </P> <P> "We were not sure Giroldi was the real thing."  </P> <P> "It was not our timing."  </P> <P> "We didn't know if they would hand him over."  </P> <P> "We didn't know if it was a set-up."  </P> <P> Thus were lack of reliable information and control of timing cited repeatedly  by the Administration.  </P> <P> Many on Capitol Hill share the belief that a U.S. commitment to act in a  foreign situation should require a higher level of specific, reliable  information than was available in Panama.  </P> <P> One Republican senator said, "Before the President commits U.S. troops  anywhere, he should know at least three things: What is the reliability of the  individual involved? There was doubt about that. What was the adequacy of the  planning involved? There were great doubts about that. What was the likelihood  of casualties, should the U.S. go in? . . . You should not commit U.S. military  forces unless you've got a very clear objective."  </P> <P> And a Democratic senator demanded, "Why weren't the contingency plans in place?  I believe the Administration was right not to act without more information."  </P> <P> Clearly, the Administration was acting (or failing to act) from the criteria of  clarity, certainty, controllability and explainability that have been imposed  by Congress on Presidents.  </P> <P> Not only has Congress increasingly imposed restraints on the conduct of foreign  affairs, it has articulated standards that are impossible to meet and, for this  reason, are incompatible with the effective conduct of U.S. foreign affairs.  But it is not simply Congress' fault.  </P> <P> By accepting detailed oversight, review and prohibitions on presidential powers  and the domain of foreign policy, Presidents have made Congress' standards  their own. They have acquiesced in demands incompatible with the  responsibilities of the presidency.  </P> <P> Today, there is a broad consensus in Washington against the use of American  power in most situations. There is a consensus against U.S. intervention in  almost all places, under almost all circumstances. There is a consensus on the  need for clarity, certainty and control if U.S. forces are to be committed  anywhere. There is a consensus against taking risks.  </P> <P> As National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft noted, that consensus was shared  by Administration officials during the Panama situation.  </P> <P> But, as recent events have once again demonstrated, the requirements for  clarity, certainty and control are often tantamount to a requirement for  inaction by the United States, making it impossible to take advantage of  fast-breaking, unplanned opportunities.  </P> <P> As Karl von Clausewitz noted: "From the outset there is a play of  possibilities, probabilities, good and bad luck, which spreads about with all  the coarse and fine threads of its web, and makes war (or any use of violence)  of all branches of human activity the most like a gambling game."  </P> <P> There will never be a coup attempt about which the United States will have  enough advance notice to permit an Administration and Congress to satisfy  themselves about the reliability of the plotters, the viability of the plan and  the chances for its success.  </P> <P> By their very nature, coup attempts are perpetrated in deep secrecy by persons  trusted by the dictator (therefore not trusted by us). They are swiftly  undertaken and their outcome is uncertain. No one knows the attitude of forces  confronted with the choices created by the attempt.  </P> <P> These are the conditions of the game. Either the United States accepts them, or  stays on the sidelines -- as the Bush Administration decided to do in Panama.  </P></p>

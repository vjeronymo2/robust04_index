			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BANDLEADER RECALLS DREADED BUNNY HOP;  </P> <P> MUSIC: RAY ANTHONY AT 68 LOOKS BACK AT A LONG MUSICAL CAREER. HE'LL OPEN AT  DISNEYLAND ON CHRISTMAS DAY.  </P> <P> Lest anyone think that concert-noise problems began in the rock era, consider  the dreaded Bunny Hop: "3,000 people pounding on the floor at one time makes a  pretty thunderous sound, besides what it can do to the structure of the  building," says bandleader Ray Anthony, who popularized the hopping dance in  the early '50s. "We were recently asked to do it in Santa Cruz, but we didn't  dare. We were on the second or third floor, and we didn't know what was holding  the building together after the earthquake."  </P> <P> Anthony's 1952 recording of "The Bunny Hop" became the biggest hit in a 50-year  career that includes more than 100 album releases, and it still sells between  5,000 and 10,000 copies a year, he reports. The 68-year-old trumpeter begins a  six-day engagement at Disneyland's Carnation Plaza on Christmas day and won't  feel slighted at all if no one requests the tune.  </P> <P> "That's because there's nothing to it," he said, reached by phone recently at  his Beverly Hills home. "The music is not very inventive. It's just a very  simple riff that would fit the dance. So you do get tired of it, just the way  most bands get tired of playing 'In the Mood,' but the demand is still  fantastic, so you have to play it."  </P> <P> At age 18, Anthony began two years of as a member of "In the Mood" originator  Glenn Miller's band. Though Miller's sound was to have a significant influence  on Anthony's own bands, the two, to quote George T. Simon's "The Big Bands"  jazz history, "never hit it off especially well."  </P> <P> Simon "knew what he was talking about when he said that," Anthony agreed.  "Glenn Miller fired me twice. I was 18 years old when I joined him and he was  at his peak, so he wasn't about to put up with some young upstart. The reason  he rehired me after he fired me the first time was that I obviously did a job  for that band. I had a lot of energy and I played lead trumpet, and when he  fired me he heard the difference in the band, and it was just about four days  later that he rehired me. I don't know to this day what the reasons were in his  mind when he fired me (a second time), but sometimes enthusiasm and excitement  can be misinterpreted."  </P> <P> In the Navy during World War II, Anthony formed his own band to entertain the  troops, which in turn voted it the hottest band in the Pacific islands. After  the war, he started a civilian outfit which became popular while incorporating,  he said, the sax sound of Miller's band with the trumpet sound of Harry James  and trombone sound of Tommy Dorsey's band.  </P> <P> Over the years, Anthony's sound became more defined by his own trumpet style,  which was noted for a gutsy emphasis of the horn's lower register. "My  musicians sometimes kid me that the high register on my trumpet is still brand  new," he said with a laugh. In further describing his sound, he said, "I always  like to think that I play a melodic kind of jazz rather than just putting out a  lot of notes and energy. I like to feel that I play a very warm, emotional type  of ballad."  </P> <P> Whatever he does, it pulls in a loyal following. Anthony said that a number of  hard-core fans invariably see him every night of his regular week-long  Disneyland engagements, arriving hours before show time to secure seats. "And  to do that at the ages of some of these people, that's really a tribute," he  said.  </P> <P> Along with his old-time fans, Anthony pulls in younger listeners with the sound  of his music, making for an age spread that's also reflected on his bandstand.  </P> <P> The oldest member of his 18-piece outfit is 78-year-old alto sax legend Marshal  Royal, and the band also includes Anthony's brother, Leo, and other members who  go back several decades with him. Others are vets of the bands of Count Basie,  Harry James, Tommy Dorsey, Miller, Woody Herman and Buddy Rich. Anthony said  there is also no shortage of good young players available to swing bands.  </P> <P> His group regularly features a number of 30-ish players, including Orange  County saxman Eric Marienthal, who also has a steady gig with Chick Corea and a  successful solo career (Marienthal isn't expected to make the Disneyland  shows). "Eric is sensational. To find a guy as good as he is at our kind of  music as well as at everything in the current crop of music -- obviously what  he does with Chick Corea is not what he does with us -- he's an example of the  more outstanding young players."  </P> <P> Citing the new listeners that Linda Ronstadt brought to big-band music with her  Nelson Riddle-orchestrated albums and the recent success of Harry Connick Jr.,  Anthony thinks the big-band scene is looking brighter than it has in many  years. He also has played no small part in increasing its audience. A decade  ago he formed "Big Bands '80s," an operation run out of his home that is  dedicated to promoting the music. He claims it has greatly increased the amount  of radio play that big-band music receives, and Anthony now has a sizable  cottage industry on his hands, making the often hard-to-find music available to  listeners by mail order.  </P> <P> "We've got up to about 1,000 stations playing big-band music as part of their  format now. Then the people that heard those programs wanted to buy records and  the shops weren't carrying big band music to any extent. Most stores only had a  small area for it, and the people that enjoyed the music wouldn't go into those  stores, because they were being handled by young kids who knew more about rock  'n roll. So we thought we'd start a sort of one-stop (record distributor) where  they could get just that particular type of product. We started with a couple  of shelves and cabinets, and now we have our whole studio enveloped in compact  discs, LPs, cassettes and what have you."  </P> <P> Tired of dealing with youth-bent record labels that would rather "gamble to  sell either millions or nothing than take a sure shot at selling 200,000  albums," Anthony instead releases his albums on his own label, Aero Space  Records. He recently issued a CD, "Swing Back to the '40s," that contains 19  standards of the era.  </P> <P> In his heyday, Anthony also was in a number of films (including some with  current Newport Beach resident Mamie Van Doren, to whom he was married for  three years) and several television programs. He bore a strong resemblance to  Cary Grant then, and he says he still keeps in shape. He never drank or smoked,  and has an unforgiving method of keeping himself on track: "My bathroom is  completely mirrored, so I can see what I look like all the time. That keeps you  aware of yourself, and I think as a result of that you just don't overeat or  over-do."  </P> <P> His lip, he says, is in top shape, and, "fortunately for me, I'm the leader,  and if anything goes wrong, I can just point to one of the guys and say 'Take  it.' "  </P> <P> It's good that he's so fit, since Anthony has no plans of leaving music. "Until  death do us part, I guess, because anyone who has retired in show business,  particularly the musical part, has regretted it. Remember when Frank Sinatra  retired? After one year, he couldn't stand it any longer, and as you can see,  he's still going now and he's celebrating his 75th birthday.  </P> <P> "As long as you're able to keep doing it, I don't think there's any point in  retiring. I know in my early days I thought I'd retire at 30, then it's 40,  then 50, and after that, you just sort of say 'Forget it.' "  </P> <P> Ray Anthony and his orchestra appear Tuesday through Sunday Disneyland's  Carnation Plaza, 1313 S. Harbor Blvd., Anaheim.

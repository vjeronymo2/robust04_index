			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Opportunists in waiting The Liberal Democrats are the scavengers of British politics. These are not my words; I take the observation from Mr Jack Straw, a Labour frontbencher. The Lib-Dems, says he, are politically promiscuous. 'They form casual relationships of convenience with whatever party offers them the prospect of power,' he writes in Renewal, a quarterly journal of Labour politics. Mr Paddy Ashdown, scavenger-in-chief, must be delighted. He would not use Mr Straw's imagery, but he would have to agree, possibly with pleasure, that the insight is perfectly accurate. Since the April 1992 election, Mr Ashdown's strategy has been to advertise his party's moral superiority, while waiting to see which way history would take him. So far the answer is: further than anyone might have imagined in 1989, when the reincarnated soul of the old Liberal-SDP Alliance was struggling for survival in a new body. How long ago that now seems. First Sir Norman Fowler, chairman of the Conservative party, identifies the Liberal Democrats as the principal threat to perpetual Tory rule, and sends the prime minister scurrying around the country to stop the rot. Then along comes a senior Labour politician to argue, as does Mr Straw in his Renewal article, that in many of the Labour heartlands, the Midlands apart, the Lib-Dems have replaced the Tories as Labour's main opponents. It would be neat, would it not, if during the 1990s the everlasting third force in British politics cleft the Conservative party in two, destroying it as the Alliance did Labour in the 1980s. Perhaps this is the kind of fancy that leads Mr Straw to reject pacts or co-operation with the prince of scavengers. The fools who advise Labour that 'one more heave' is all that is required for Mr John Smith to become prime minister in a government commanding a socialist majority will be heartened by his analysis. There is another view, often rehearsed in centrists' dreams: that the Liberal Democrats will become the alternative party of government by the end of the century, as were the Liberals at the beginning. When this thought-bubble rose above Alliance leaders' heads in the mid-1980s it was based on the likely demise of Labour; today it is the Tories who seem to be crumbling. We may hear some heady talk of the Liberal Democrats be-coming the party of government during their annual conference in Torquay next week, although Mr Ashdown has warned his followers, who are flushed with local and by-election success, not to crow. The truth is that most people are more fed up with traditional politicians, and the two main parties, than they have been for many years. The new right has outplayed its hand; the old left has become an anachronism. The market for Ashdowns is wide open. Any leader who is untainted by office, or the prospect of an immediate ascent to power, is in a position to attract attention, as is any interesting-looking new non-socialist party. This is not a uniquely British phenomenon, as we can see from the rise of Mr Ross Perot in the US and the Northern League in Italy. Mr Ashdown has particular advantages in riding this historic wave. The Labour party is beginning to look unmodernisable, at least to the degree sufficient to make it palatable to the southern voters it must win over if it is to form a government on its own. The Conservatives are led by the least popular prime minister on record. Since their fourth general election victory last April, they have governed only in the sense that the Marx Brothers once ran an opera house. Mr John Smith is uninspiring. Mr John Major is cursed by a worse affliction. He is unlucky. His latest torture is to endure the wrath of Mr Norman Lamont, the man who less than three years ago ran his campaign for leadership of the party. The former chancellor does not enhance his own dignity by his persistent efforts to justify his past. He should let future historians do that. They may be kinder to his tenure of the Treasury than are most contemporary commentators. He missed his chance for glory a year ago, when he allowed himself to be persuaded not to resign following the departure of Britain from the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system. He should have insisted on resigning. It is Mr Major's humiliation to have such a man for an enemy. From the Liberal Democrats' point of view, nothing could be sweeter. The message the public is being given about the Conservatives is that they are not only incompetent, they are tearing one another's eyes out. Every new snippet of political or economic news is analysed for its likely effect on Mr Major's future. The betting is turning against his survival in office until the next election. I am not sure how far the Tories have thought this one through. Throw out a leader every few years and a party may get a name for inconstancy. You may protest that none of this is serious. What matters is policy, not personalities. We shall hear a little about political programmes and values during the next three weeks, as first the Liberal Democrats, then Labour, and finally the Conservatives meet in conference. The British polity being what it is, however, we shall hear far more about personalities. Will Mr Smith defeat the unions? Will Mr Lamont topple Mr Major? The policy divide is between the anarchists of the new right whose thought still predominates among Tories and the conservatives in the other two parties. The latter want the re-establishment of a structured society governed by familiar institutions, including local authorities, and new regional parliaments. They regard individuals as citizens, not mere consumers. They are greener and more pro-European than the Conservatives. Labour is encumbered by a persistent dependence on trade union links and a nostalgic hankering after equality of outcomes. The Liberal Democrats favour competition, intervention only where markets fail, and equality of opportunity. In short, Mr Ashdown's philosophy is what Labour's could be if the party was genuinely modernised. He even has the great merit, regarded with a jealous sigh by some Labour frontbenchers, of leading a party untainted by the word 'Labour' in its name. This may not be enough. When the Tories are really up against it, we shall learn the true meaning of the phrase 'political scavengers'.</p>

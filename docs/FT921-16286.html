			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / A diva devoted to Hollywood dottiness GINGER MY STORY by Ginger Rogers Headline Pounds 16.95, 390 pages JOSEPH LOSEY by Edith de Rham Andre Deutsch Pounds 18.99, 304 pages PRESTON STURGES ON PRESTON STURGES edited by Sandy Sturges Faber Pounds 14.99, 344 pages 'I AM a thorough softy when it comes to animals. I love them. Dogs and cats are my passion. Their love is unchanging, unconditional and unbounding in warm kisses and wiggling bodies.' What ever happens to screen goddesses when they retire? Like pet-lovers Doris Day and Brigitte Bardot, whom no journalist today can approach without a written affidavit that he is dotty about moggies or doggies, Palm Springs-based Ginger Rogers has given up humanity for a larger love. Make that two larger loves; for she also has religion. 'I owe my health and happiness to it,' she confides. And she says farewell to the reader with the single word 'Blessings.' Thinly disguised as an autobiography, Ginger My Story is a guide to the dottinesses, woolly thinking and PR postures a screen diva is encouraged to subscribe to during a long, long career. They give her by retirement age an understandable readiness to retreat from humanity. Between 1930 and 1965, in which time she made 70 films, Rogers lived in a world where the adulation of others was her daily bread and where make-believe kept edging off the screen into her life. Her book alternates well-polished mythopoeic anecdotes, like the one about the blue ostrich-feather dress that got up Fred Astaire's nose in Top Hat's 'Cheek by cheek' number, with a screen diva's usual have-I-missed-anyone-out roll call of males in her life. These seem to have included absolutely everyone: from silent star Lew Ayres (first husband) to Cary Grant (unrequited love) to the indefatigable Howard Hughes (late of Katharine Hepburn's autobiography). I wish I liked Miss Rogers in print as much as on screen. Her early film career, before a Best Actress Oscar for Kitty Foyle gave her delusions of grandeur, was a delight. She was a fresh, mickey-taking presence. But this book is ponderous when it is not fluffy. Much goody-two-shoes complimenting of her peers goes together with bits of unattractive bitchery. (Do we need two stories of Fred Astaire's toupee falling off?) The final pages savour of valedictory smugness as our heroine passes from one award ceremony to the next, thanking her fans, waving at her autograph-hunters and moving at last towards the uncritical love-glow of her cats and dogs. Edith de Rham's Joseph Losey shows how one distinguished American film-maker dealt with all that Hollywood flummery. He walked out on it. Losey left America in the 1950s, banishing himself to England with a little encouragement from the House Un - American Activities Committee. HUAC had been showing an unhealthy interest in Losey's supposed Communist sympathies. If he had such sympathies, the Wisconsin-born director soon transmuted them into something rich and strange. He found the perfect screenwriting partner in Harold Pinter and produced a series of baroque, sardonic visions of the British class system in films like The Servant, Accident and The Go-Between. Miss de Rham does not exactly warm to Mr Losey, but then who did? He presented a morose and misanthropic exterior that brightened up only on the film set. But he was a movie artist of beguiling mystery. The obliquity of his work was its richest feature - making one regret that he never realised his cherished project of filming Proust - and Losey's move to Britain and later Europe added subtle layers of old-world enigma to the new-world idealism with which he was born. Miss de Rham is scanty with source notes and relies on clippings more than confidants. But she provides at least one revealing witness. Losey's favourite actor Dirk Bogarde testifies to the human Losey by recalling everything from crying fits to an illness bout that made the film-maker hand over directing reins for ten days on The Servant to Bogarde himself. What are the auteur theorists going to say about that? Some auteurs have cast-iron claims to the title. If a man writes his films as well as directing them, like the 1940s screwball comedy specialist Preston Sturges (The Palm Beach Story, The Lady Eve), no one can deny him authorship. But what about Preston Sturges On Preston Sturges? Did Preston Sturges write that? Not quite. Edited and arranged into autobiographical shape from Sturges's diaries and letters, the book is a pretend-memoir devised by his widow Sandy. It is still a pacy, delightful read, full of detail and persuasively modelled on the whipcrack-witty style of PS's own movie dialogue.</p>

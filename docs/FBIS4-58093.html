			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi, April 30 (AFP)--A decline in imports by  key Arab oil producers and economic reforms by non-oil states  slashed the Arab balance of payments deficit by nearly 65  percent in 1992, an official report said on Saturday [30 April].    The deficit, which was non-existent during the oil boom,  stood at seven billion dollars in 1992 compared with 20 billion  dollars in 1991, said the report released by the Abu Dhabi-based  Arab Monetary Fund (AMF).    The report divided the 22-member Arab League into two  groups:  the first comprising the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council  (GCC) plus key oil producers Iraq, Libya and Algeria, and the  second the 13 members, which have little oil.    It showed exports of goods and services by the first group  increased slightly to 114 billion dollars from 113 billion  dollars while exports by the second group jumped to 34 billion  dollars from 29 billion dollars.    "What helped this positive development in exports by the  second group is the policy of freeing prices of goods and  exchange rates, easing government restrictions on foreign trade  and supporting export activities by the private sector as part  of economic reforms," the report said.    Imports by the second group rose to 47 billion dollars from  41 billion dollars while the first group slashed imports to 108  billion dollars from 121 billion dollars in the same period, it  said.    Experts said the combined Arab balance of payment deficit  was  caused by a sharp decline in crude prices over the past decade  as oil exports account for more than 70 percent of the total  Arab exports.    In 1980, when oil prices shot above 30 dollars, exports by  the first group peaked at 235 billion dollars. With imports  standing at 114 billion dollars, the balance of payments  registered a record surplus of 121 billion dollars before it  started to deteriorate in the following years.    Such exports plummeted to 108 billion dollars in 1985 when  oil prices went below 20 dollars then recovered slightly to 113  billion dollars in 1991.    The report said the improvement in exports of goods and  services by the second group pushed their ratio to the Gross  Domestic Product to 27 percent in 1992 from between 18 and 24  percent in the first half of 1980s.    A breakdown showed members of the first group, except Kuwait  and Iraq, had a surplus in their balance of payments in 1992  while all those in the second group were still suffering from a  deficit.    The biggest surplus was recorded in the United Arab Emirates  (UAE), standing at 4.47 billion dollars. It stood at 1.12  billion dollars in Algeria and between one billion and two  billion dollars in Oman and Qatar.    In Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil producer and exporter,  the surplus was only 693 million dollars due to a surge in  imports, the report said.    Kuwait, which had enjoyed a persistent surplus before the  1990 Iraqi invasion, suffered from a small deficit of 30 million  dollars because of a sharp rise in imports and a decline in oil  exports.    Iraq, still under a UN embargo, had a deficit of 728 million  dollars, with exports standing at 413 million dollars and  imports at 1.141 billion dollars. The report did not give  details of the Iraqi trade.    The report, which covered economic developments in the Arab  world for 1992, showed public and private investment in the  region totalled 112 billion dollars during that year compared  with 98 billion dollars in 1991.    Around 83.6 billion dollars were invested in the first group  and Saudi Arabia received the lion share, with investment of  29.5 billion dollars. The report showed investment in Iraq  stood at 14.2 billion dollars while no investment was registered  in war-torn Somalia.    It estimated the combined Arab Gross National Product at  478.9 billion dollars, of which the first group accounted for  347.7 billion dollars.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Little progress at Bosnian talks The leaders of Bosnia's warring sides yesterday congregated in Geneva for a second day of talks on a proposed ceasefire but did not meet face to face promising little hope of an agreement. After separate meetings with the rival leaders, Mr Yasushi Akashi, top UN official in former Yugoslavia, said the talks would be adjourned for a later date unless the main protagonists made a 'real effort' towards an agreement. As both sides quarreled over how long the proposed truce should last, fighting was reported between Serb and government forces in northern Bosnia. In Serbia, in a thinly-veiled attack on Bosnian Serb leaders, President Zoran Lilic of Yugoslavia, technically head of the Yugoslav federation but seen as a puppet of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, yesterday said his country will not be 'dragged into war' and that 'millions of Yugoslav citizens' in Serb-held areas in Bosnia 'cannot be hostage to one leader'.</p>

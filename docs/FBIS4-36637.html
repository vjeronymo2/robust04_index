			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source today made a statement to SPA  in which he said: Both AFP and AP reported yesterday [11 June]  that 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ali al-Iryani, Yemeni minister of planning  and development, told AFP that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had  become a party to the Yemeni conflict and that it was supplying  the southerners with weapons.    The source said: We are not surprised by such completely  fabricated allegations and lies coming from 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ali  al-Iryani, whose hostile positions toward the Kingdom have been  known for a long time, and this is not the first time that  al-Iryani has violated the truth. In fact, he has made similar  statements and allusions several times in the past weeks.    The source concluded his statement by saying: It is  noteworthy that the picture conveyed to the custodian of the two  holy mosques by Mr. Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the current mediator, from  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is completely different in spirit  and substance from the statements of al-Iryani to whom, were it  not for our eagerness to clarify facts about him for public  opinion, we would not have given any importance.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ludovit Cernak, chairman of the Slovak National  Party [SNS], has advocated a broad government coalition of  pro-Slovak forces. However, he rejected the possibility of  Hungarian political parties participating in this coalition.  The SNS chairman thinks that the parties with pro-Slovak  orientation are the parties capable of declaring, regardless of  their positions in the past, their support for the national and  state interests of Slovakia and, in particular, for the  integrity and prosperity of the Slovak Republic.    Those parties suitable to form a broad coalition are said to  be the Party of the Democratic Left, the Christian Democratic  Movement, the Alliance of Democrats, and practically all of the  factions of the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.  According to Cernak, Hungarian political parties do not meet  the requirements for creating a broad coalition of pro-Slovak  forces because of their behavior in the process of Slovakia's  admission to the Council of Europe.</p>

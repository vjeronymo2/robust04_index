			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: Puma to close last German factory PUMA, the troubled German-based sports goods manufacturer, is to close the last factory on its home soil by the end of August. More than 200 jobs will go as a result of the closure of a football boot works at Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, leaving just 470 working for the company in Germany, mainly in design, marketing and administration. The move, announced by Mr Jochen Zeitz, chairman, will be followed next month by the unveiling of a reorganisation plan which will set Puma on the way to becoming 'a new, fast, lean, flexible and effective business,' he said. 'It is simply no longer justifiable to maintain a factory which loses money year after year,' Mr Zeitz added. The plant's output of 200,000 pairs of boots a year, representing 3 per cent of total production will be transferred to low-cost manufacturers, including Butana, a Czech licence-holder. Mr Zeitz, 30, is the third new chairman to be appointed since Puma was taken over by the Swedish Aritmos group in 1990. Puma made a provisional loss last year of around DM12m (Dollars 7m) on sales of more than DM500m.</p>

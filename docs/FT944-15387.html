			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Eko Stahl may get less cash Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency and the economics ministry may be forced to reduce by DM250m (Pounds 103m) the planned DM1.2bn rescue package for Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's steel mill, European Commission officials said yesterday. But any reduction of subsidies could throw into jeopardy the sale of the plant to Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian steel producer, which has agreed in principle to buy for DM30m a 60 per cent stake in Eko Stahl. It also intends to invest DM440m in modernising the steel mill's existing blast furnace and building a new hot-rolling mill. Cockerill yesterday said 'it would not take Eko Stahl at any price', adding that the agreement to buy a stake in the mill was linked to the large rescue package. 'It is up to the Treuhand to negotiate with the European Commission,' it said. If Cockerill is not prepared to renegotiate the rescue package, the Treuhand might allow it to buy the remaining 40 per cent stake for a token DM1 in order to make up for any reduction in the rescue package.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 24 (YONHAP) -- Kim Sam-hun, South  Korea's nuclear ambassador who is currently visiting the United  States, said Monday the North Korean nuclear fuel rod problem is  one basis of Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks but not a  precondition to the dialogue.    Kim made the remark after meeting with Robert Gallucci, U.S.  assistant secretary of State for Political and Military Affairs,  to discuss the North Korean nuclear problem and  Pyongyang-Washington talks for about four and a half hours at  the State Department.    He indicated that conditions for U.S.-North Korea high-level  talks have virtually been met, saying, "The direct conditions  for the talks are additional inspections by the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the radiochemical laboratory and  follow-up inspections on maintenance of the IAEA's monitoring  equipment.    "As far as I know, the IAEA's additional inspection has been  carried out smoothly."    He noted that solving the fuel rod problem at the 5-megawatt  reactor in Yongbyon is not a precondition to the third round of  dialogue but a basis on which Pyongyang and Washington can  continue bilateral talks.    "The basis can be prepared only when North Korea stops  replacing the fuel rods or accepts the IAEA position, which  demands selection, storage and measurement of the fuel, or  agrees with the IAEA to secure measurement in any form after a  certain period.    "If North Korea pushes to withdraw fuel rods from the  reactor  unilaterally, the basis of the talks is feared to collapse at a  certain point in time," he said.    IAEA officials have already confirmed that Pyongyang  replaced  some fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor without outside  supervision, while another IAEA team is to arrive in Pyongyang  on Tuesday to negotiate supervision of further refueling.    He also hinted that the IAEA-North Korean negotiations on  fuel rods and the Pyongyang-Washington talks could be carried  out side by side.    Kim's comments suggest that the United States will push for  a  third round of high-level talks unless the IAEA officially  announces that North Korea's fuel rod replacement has already  passed over the "red line," even if the fuel rod negotiations  take much time. He added that it is up to the IAEA to determine  the "red line" up to which measurement of the fuel rods is  secured.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Building materials The sniff of interest rate cuts has intoxicated the building materials sector, stimulating a further 9 per cent outperformance against the market over the past three months. On Goldman Sachs' forecasts, the sector is now trading on 13.5 times 1996 earnings. That demonstrates a remarkable degree of far sightedness, leaving no room for error. The main exception to the trend has been Redland, which has under-performed the sector by 7 per cent over the past three months. The news that finance director Mr Gerald Corbett is leaving to join Grand Metropolitan has not helped Redland's share price - nor, curiously, that of GrandMet. Furthermore, Redland's tax charge will inexorably rise if UK earnings do not rebound strongly enough to resolve its ACT problem. There are also concerns about the sustainability of demand in the west German housing market. Changes to tax incentives may suck forward sales of Redland's roofing tiles into 1994, but demand could fall sharply thereafter. The big cloud over the whole sector's earnings prospects is the difficulty of making price rises stick in a disinflationary climate. Pilkington has already had to unwind an 8 per cent price rise for glass. Downward price pressure will continue for many products as mainland European manufacturers divert surplus stocks into the UK. If there are any wobbles in building materials shares, the construction sector could gain. Contracting companies benefit later in the cycle. But at least they are trading on comparatively meagre multiples.</p>

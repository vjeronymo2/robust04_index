			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Books: Three eccentric English lives WAKE UP BRITAIN] by Paul Johnson Weidenfeld and Nicolson Pounds 9.99,200 pages DAMN YOU, ENGLAND by John Osborne Faber and Faber, Pounds 14.99, 264 pages LORD LONGFORD by Peter Stanford Heinemann, Pounds 20, 502 pages One of the enduring English traits is the capacity to produce eccentrics. Here are three on parade: Paul Johnson and John Osborne with their oddly symmetric titles - Wake Up Britain] and Damn You, England (the latter avoiding the exclamation mark) - alongside an authorised life of Lord Longford, possibly the most eccentric of the lot. All of them have changed as time went by: Johnson from left to right, Osborne from a fairly prolific playwright to someone who may not write for the theatre again, Longford from right to left (with a conversion to Roman Catholicism in the middle) and almost back again. In his late years, we learn, Longford gets on well with another English eccentric, Denis Thatcher. The pair share a love of rugby and the experience of being the butt of cartoonists. Yet one wonders if the changes have been in anything much more than the labels. Johnson, once the editor of the New Statesman, remains a polemicist. The new element is nostalgia for an old Britain. When he was at school, he recalls, the whole dormitory would be woken up in the middle of the night 'to be given the glorious news that yet another old boy had won the VC'. And when he was at home in Staffordshire, 'an entire street would celebrate when a boy or girl from it got into a grammar school'. Something went wrong after the second world war starting, he thinks, with the end of empire without the consent of the British people. Ever after, save a brief interlude from Lady Thatcher, it has been down hill. Johnson claims that Europe might have saved Britain if it had joined at the start. He sees Jean Monnet as a hero and the 'onlie begetter' of the European Union, with Churchill alone ready to support him on the British side. Note that the evidence for Churchill's staunch commitment to Britain in Europe is not produced and would be hard to find. Note also that there was nothing to prevent anyone reading the Treaty of Rome when it was first written and realising its implications. Still, the book is sub-titled a pamphlet, so perhaps details do not matter. Johnson wants the emergence of a party 'broadly conservative in its attitudes' campaigning for 'the retention of essential elements of British sovereignty'. In spite of the exclamation mark, the fire has gone out. Osborne has perhaps been misunderstood, partly by his own doing. The words 'Damn you, England' originally came from one short article written as the Berlin Wall was going up in 1961. There are other harsh words in it, such as: 'I carry a knife in my heart for every one of you. Macmillan, and you, Gaitskell, you particularly'. Yet if you read his prose as a whole there is not all that much spleen even in the political pieces. In 1974 he wrote in The Observer: 'I shall vote Labour once more, but with even emptier heart that usual'. He added: 'If I lived in Ebbw Vale I should vote for Michael Foot, and if I lived in County Down I should vote for Enoch Powell'. In other words, another English romantic eccentric hankering after his own kind. For the rest, Damn You, England is mainly a collection of Osborne's sensitive and highly intelligent views on theatre. He may not like critics and sometimes even audiences, but they were not always right about him. Nor is he especially little English: see his notes on Strindberg and Ibsen. The public image has sometimes obscured the quality of his work. Much the same may be said of Lord Longford, notably by way of his attachment to the convicted moors murderer, Myra Hindley. The reservation about this authorised biography is that Longford should think himself important enough to trust his life to a 500 page book by a former editor of the Catholic Herald, Peter Stanford. Longford cannot be as modest as he looks. Over time he has had much to be modest about. As Stanford points out, his ambition was to rise much higher in politics than he did. It is hard now to recall that he rose as far as minister for civil aviation. He would have liked, but was never offered, the Home Office. Perhaps he wanted to be more conventional than he seemed. Certainly, with the possible exception of the Hindley case, there is nothing particularly eccentric in what he has said. It is not all that odd for someone with a decent education to abandon the Conservative Party. Longford did not turn far left: only to the Labour Party. Yet the image of eccentricity remains. As one of his daughters comments: 'It's as if he is saying, 'I'll be a maverick, I'll be a rebel, I'll never tie my shoelaces, but two people I'm always going to support are the Pope and the President of the United States''. Stanford's claim that he is an elder statesman of the Labour Party goes a bit far, but it's not a bad life.</p>

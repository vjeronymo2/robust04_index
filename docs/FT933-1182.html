			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (41): Market unlikely to recover until 1996 - Chemicals / The recession has caused turmoil in the industry. Overcapacity and poor demand has led to a collapse in prices THE world's chemical industry is in turmoil. The sector, accustomed to wickedly cyclical swings in profitability, is at the bottom of a long and painful recession. Prices, margins and profits have fallen. So, too, have sales. Worldwide sales of chemicals fell from Ecu970bn (Dollars 1,144bn) in 1991 to Ecu941bn last year, according to Cefic, the European chemical industry's trade association. The decline is in spite of continuing rapid growth in the Asia-Pacific region. The fall is a result of the recession in the western economies. The chemicals sector, representing 2.5 per cent of the European economy, is highly dependent upon the construction and automotive industry, both badly affected by the downturn. The decline in value of chemical sales is not due to a downturn in production. Rather a combination of overcapacity and poor demand has led to a collapse in prices. Take PVC, for example; prices of the product, widely used in vehicles and buildings, have fallen in Europe from a peak of DM1.85 in 1989 to DM1 during the second quarter of this year. Meanwhile, in the US, the slow, hesitant recovery is also being undermined by overcapacity. Analysts believe there is not a single manufacturer of high density polyethylene in the US making money. From a peak of about 45 cents a pound in 1990, prices have plummeted to 28 cents. Recent attempts to raise them have been unsuccessful. The market is unlikely to recover until 1996 at the earliest. The need for restructuring in Europe has been apparent for at least two years. But in spite of well-publicised negotiations, progress so far has been limited. Mr Bryan Sanderson, chief executive of BP Chemicals, the UK group, has said German manufacturers should cut production. Mr Jurgen Strube, chairman of BASF, the German company, confidently predicts British and Italian producers will cut capacity. However, Mr Cees van Lede, chairman-designate of Akzo, the Dutch group, says every cloud has a silver lining. 'The recession has allowed us to restructure and cut costs in a way that was just not possible during the late 1980s,' he explains. Whether the end of recession in the western economies will bring an end to the chemical sector's pain is far from certain. A significant and fundamental structural shift in the geographical location of production appears to be occurring. Just as the manufacture of fibre has for the most part followed the textiles industry to the Far East, so petrochemicals and plastics production looks to be shifting to low-cost sites in Asia and eastern Europe. 'A substantial relocation of industry is occurring,' says Mr van Lede. 'A skilled industrial worker in Germany takes home about DM600 a week. Just across the border in the Czech Republic he gets DM60, and in Russia it is DM6. This is going to lead to a fundamental rethinking of the industry and how this should be managed. We have a choice. We can either import cheap labour - which is politically impossible - or we can employ them in their local economies.' The advantages of manufacturing in eastern Europe is already apparent. Cheap eastern European imports are flooding into western Europe. The loudest complaints have come from western European companies manufacturing fertilisers, soda ash, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), caprolactam (a precursor of nylon), and melamine (a plastic). With low inflation, slow growth and improving productivity in western companies, the outlook for employment in western Europe looks grim unless they can change to higher growth products such as pharmaceuticals, says Mr Lede. Mr Donald Anderson, chief economist of Courtaulds, the UK group, says: 'The difference in cost levels between Europe, the Far East and eastern Europe, have really not been addressed by the sector. The adjustment problems will be very severe and western European companies will be severely tested to match those elsewhere.' 'The chemical industry is at a critical stage of its development,' agrees Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive of ICI, the UK's largest chemical group. 'The market has changed forever, and we must learn to cope with a low inflation environment and globalisation.' Nearly all European and many US groups plan to respond to the present crisis in the west by expanding their operations in the fast-growing Asian economies over the next few years. Courtaulds, the UK group, still views the UK as an important manufacturing base, but it sees itself as under-represented in the Asia-Pacific region, according to Mr Anderson. 'The statistics are unreliable in the Far East, but the growth is more than 10 per cent. Some of the investment substitutes exports, but we are optimistic. The potential of China is frightening,' he says. Local production in Asia is growing rapidly but is not without problems. The pain of growth can be as difficult as the pain caused by recession. The extraordinary growth of petrochemicals production in South Korea has upset Japanese and Middle East manufacturers. Ethylene capacity has tripled in the past three years to 3.25m tonnes a year, 2m tonnes more than domestic demand. Korean companies had hoped to sell surplus requirements in China. However, the Korean Petrochemical Co has recently been granted protection from creditors and all its liabilities have been frozen. If even Asian manufacturers are suffering, the outlook for higher-cost western producers looks bleak.</p>

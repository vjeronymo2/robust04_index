			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Programme trading swamps equities Wall Street Blue chip stocks gave ground yesterday afternoon as a wave of late programme trading swamped the market in final session of the third quarter, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 11.44 lower at 3,843.19, after showing moderate gains for most of the session. But the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 weathered the computer-guided selling to close up 0.48 at 462.71. Advancing issues on the Big Board led declines by a three-to-two margin on moderate volume of 291m shares. The secondary indices ended with solid gains. The American SE composite was 2.34 ahead at 458.81 while the Nasdaq composite added 4.95 to 764.29 on the strength of a resurgent technology sector. At first, the day's main economic news provided a favourable background for institutional investors to put 'window-dressing' on their positions going into the final three months of the year. The activity tended to favour stocks which have performed well over the third quarter. By the end, however, it pushed some widely held issues in the loss column. The monthly survey of Chicago purchasing managers showed fewer manufacturers were paying higher prices this month than last, reversing the recent trend. With the financial markets on alert for tightening of monetary policy, the development helped longer-dated government bonds move higher and buoyed sentiment in the stock market in the early going, at least. But any enthusiasm was tempered by conflicting reports on progress achieved by US and Japanese trade negotiators, with the midnight deadline for completing their talks fast approaching. The Dow industrials opened in negative territory but quickly scrambled on to the plus side, only to sag anew amid the final scurry. Philip Morris was in particular favour. Its share price climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 61 1/8 on reports - later confirmed - that the company was negotiating the sale of its Kraft food-service business. Offsetting that gain, Allied Signal dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 34 1/8 and Alcoa shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 84 3/4 . But Chrysler added Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 44 7/8 after the cash-rich car maker revealed plans to increase its capital spending over the next five years. On the Nasdaq, the window-dressing plays appeared to benefit many technology stocks, which extended their gains in the late afternoon. Among the best performers were: Parametric Technology, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 33; DSC Communications, Dollars 1 1/8 ahead at Dollars 28 7/8 ; and Informix, Dollars 1 1/4 better at Dollars 27. Canada Toronto prices drifted mixed to lower in a quiet session, as investors kept to the sidelines ahead of crucial economic data from the US in coming weeks. The TSE 300 composite index was off 7.87 points, or 0.18 per cent, to close at 4,354.18, but gainers outnumbered losers 425 to 359. Volume of CDollars 50.41m valued at CDollars 632.3m compared with 56.90m worth CDollars 789.5m on Thursday. Overall, eight of the 14 sub-indexes were down with one unchanged. Golds, metals, communications and conglomerates posted the biggest declines. Brazil Sao Paulo closed up 0.7 per cent in heavy trade despite some late profit-taking as investors squared portfolios ahead of Monday's presidential elections. The Bovespa index of the 55 most-active shares ended up 414 at 54,840 points.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIRST MEETING HELD;  </P> <P> MORE LATINO LEADERS SOUGHT BY NEW GROUP  </P> <P> In the first gathering of its kind in Orange County, a group of locally elected  Latino officials met Thursday to discuss ways to recruit and groom Latinos for  public service, including political office.  </P> <P> Spearheaded by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, the highest ranking and most  visible Latino officeholder in the county, the nonpartisan group was formed to  encourage Latinos to seek careers in public service as well as to provide  leadership and promote discussion on issues such as education.  </P> <P> In the past, Vasquez said, attempts to solve the problems confronting the  county's burgeoning Latino population have been isolated and sporadic. By  coming together, he said, the county's Latino leaders can pool their clout as  well as their resources to deal more effectively with the needs of the Latino  community. Before that can happen, however, Latinos who hold elected or  appointed offices must become familiar with one another.  </P> <P> There are now 30 Latinos in elected offices at the city, county and judicial  level in Orange County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Platform Adopted  </P> <P> "If nothing else, at least many of the Latino leaders in this county had a  chance to meet one another," Vasquez said after the private luncheon at La  Brasserie in Orange. Eighteen Latino officials were there. "Literally, we had  some situations" at the luncheon, Vasquez said, "where people didn't know the  person across the table from them."  </P> <P> The group, called the Latino Elected and Appointed Officials of Orange County,  unanimously adopted a nine-point platform Thursday intended to expand the  "Hispanic political base and the Hispanic agenda" in the county, according to a  statement released by the group.  </P> <P> In 1980, Latinos made up 15% of Orange County's population. By 1987, nearly 24%  of the county's 2.2 million residents were Latino. But the numbers of Latinos  on school boards and city councils and also in key administrative posts have  not kept pace, Latino officials contend.  </P> <P> In Santa Ana, for example, Latinos account for more than 50% of the city's  225,000 residents, yet only two of the seven seats on the City Council are held  by Latinos. The disparity is even greater for the city's school board. Eighty  percent of the 41,000 students in the Santa Ana Unified School District are  Latino, yet only one of the five school board members is Latino.  </P> <P> Latino community leaders place part of the blame on Latinos themselves for not  being more aggressive and better organized. Correcting that situation, they  said, was one of the reasons for forming the new group. Another of its  objectives is to provide role models for young Latinos.  </P> <P> "Because we are elected officials, we are role models for the Hispanic  community," said Sal Mendoza, a member of the Santa Ana school district board.  "We have a responsibility to network as Hispanic leaders to create more  opportunities for other Hispanics."  </P> <P> Santa Ana City Councilman Miguel Pulido emphasized that education will be a top  priority for the group.  </P> <P> Referring to the high dropout rate for Latino students, Pulido said Latino  officials "have an obligation above and beyond other elected officials' " to  encourage young people to stay in school. That message, he said, should be  carried by the newly formed group.  </P> <P> Because the group is nonpartisan, Vasquez said, there are no plans to designate  specific school boards or cities for the election of Latinos.  </P></p>

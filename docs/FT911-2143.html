			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Lang rejects move for assembly - Devolution MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, has underlined his continuing opposition to any form of Scottish assembly, which he says would undermine the stability of the United Kingdom and bring no benefits to Scotland. His comments, in an interview with the Financial Times, came amid continuing speculation that the Scottish Conservatives are planning a big U-turn on the issue of devolution, which was overwhelmingly rejected at the party's Scottish conference in 1988 but commands majority support in the Scottish opinion polls. A number of prominent Scottish Conservatives have recently proposed various forms of Scottish assembly. Mr Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association, has indicated that the party is prepared to listen to arguments on the subject, although it is not down for debate at next month's party conference. 'I have not the slightest doubt that there would be a serious crisis of confidence leading to reduced investment and employment and the undermining of our manufacturing base if we moved along the devolutionary path,' Mr Lang said. The effects would be the same whether or not the assembly had tax-raising powers, though without tax-raising powers would take longer to become apparent.</p>

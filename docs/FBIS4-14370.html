			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rashid Khashanah: "Hurani Returns to the PLO </F> Executive Committee; Palestinian Leadership Discussing National  Authority Structure"]    [Excerpts] Tunis -- Informed Palestinian sources in Tunis  have told AL-HAYAH that the PLO leadership is currently  discussing the structure of the Palestinian national authority  to agree on a final formula before submitting it to the  Israelis. They added that the discussions have so far resulted  in agreement to have figures from inside the occupied territory  and figures from the diaspora equally represented in the  authority body. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, informed Palestinian sources have stated that  'Abdallah Hurani, who had resigned from the PLO Executive  Committee, has had a reconciliation with President Yasir  'Arafat. Their reconciliation resulted in his appointment as  head of the "Returnees Department" formerly headed by  'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, the representatiave of the Popular Front  for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] in the Executive  Committee (who had also resigned).    Hurani, who, along with five other Executive Committee  members, resigned after the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles was signed on 13 September 1993, was previously head  of the PLO's Cultural Department.    AL-HAYAH has learned that Malluh visited Tunis at the end of  last week for the first time since resigning from the Executive  Committee last September. He met with some prominent Fatah  leaders and also probably met with President 'Arafat. This is  considered to be the first meeting between the the PFLP and  Fatah since the Declaration of Principles was signed.</p>

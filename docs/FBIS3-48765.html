The comment came as speculation continued  over whether Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa would attempt to  reach an eleventh hour compromise with the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party to get the measures passed before the Diet  session ends Saturday.    Watanabe, speaking at the Japan National Press Club, called  on coalition and opposition parties to instead issue statements  committing themselves to legislate provisions to crack down on  electoral fraud and bribe-taking by March, and to continue  discussions on changes to the electoral system. He also  expressed support for a proposal to pass a law giving  prosecutors' power to arrest Diet members who take bribes.    He said he backed a draft bill jointly proposed by Social  Democratic Party veteran Hideko Ito and Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) legislator Katsuhiko Shirakawa. "If the proposed draft  bill were legislated, it alone would be able to exert a powerful  effect to dissuade a Diet member from taking a bribe," said  Watanabe, leader of the LDP's second-largest faction.    Under the bill, a Diet member could be liable to up to three  years in prison if they accepted a bribe to use their political  influence to persuade other politicians or bureaucrats to favor  a specific business interest.    The draft bill, now being promoted by more than 50  legislators from both the LDP and the Social Democratic Party,  was submitted to both houses of the Diet on Tuesday.</p>

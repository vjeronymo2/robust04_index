			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRISON FURLOUGH PLAN CANCELED  </P> <P> State corrections officials said Wednesday they will cancel a plan to bring a  work furlough program for 80 male parolees into a now-closed Inglewood motel  because of opposition from the City Council.  </P> <P> Council members had issued a resolution strongly condemning the move.  </P> <P> The council urged the state to find another location and noted that Inglewood  already has two other halfway houses near the proposed site at 4026 Century  Blvd.  </P> <P> After all five councilmen condemned the project at Tuesday's meeting,  Department of Corrections spokesman Nal Pedrosian said: "You've made yourself  very clear without a shadow of a doubt."  </P> <P> Jerry Dimaggio, regional administrator for the Department of Corrections, said  Wednesday that the plan was dropped. "Without the local accord, we're not going  to go forward." He criticized the city for opposing the program, saying that  most of the people in the proposed program would be Inglewood residents.  </P> <P> The owner of the site, Irene Christopher, accused the councilmen of shirking  their duty.  </P> <P> "Some members of this council may wish to take the politically expedient easy  way out in dealing with our community's need to reintroduce rehabilitated  offenders into society," she said at the meeting. " . . . It would be great if  doing what was right and what was popular were the same thing, but the  decisions faced by an elected official are not easy."  </P></p>

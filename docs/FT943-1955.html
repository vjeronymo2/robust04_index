			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (15): From paper casinos to reliable yardsticks - A look at eastern Europe's stock markets The most remarkable thing about eastern Europe's stock markets is that they exist at all. What generations of bankers and traders slowly and sometimes haphazardly constructed in the City of London and on Wall Street, eastern Europeans began building from scratch in 1990. But, by 1993, the volume of trading, though not the value, on the Warsaw bourse was almost equal to that of London, and the exchanges of Warsaw, Prague and Budapest are now well on their way to becoming a standard, if modest, shopping stop for European investment portfolios. The switch from five-year plans to five-year government bonds has not always been either smooth or seemly. 'This is like Wall Street in the 1870s,' says Mr Andrew Reicher, head of investment for CS First Boston in Prague. 'I haven't a clue and neither has anyone else. They've only ever read about markets in books.' Of the three exchanges, the Prague bourse is most closely linked to the broader economic reforms in the country. After their nation's 'velvet revolution', Czech leaders decided that the only answer to their country's unfortunate inheritance of one of the most centrally planned economies in eastern Europe was a fast-paced, mass privatisation programme. The 'velvet divorce', which liberated the Czech republic from the loss-making heavy industry and defence factories in Slovakia, made this process easier. As Mr Richard Wood, founder of Wood and Co Securities, one of the biggest investors in the Prague bourse, puts it: 'When it comes to privatisation and capital markets, the Poles behave like Czechs and the Czechs behave like Poles.' The Czech policy of mass privatisation, which transferred 943 companies to its citizens for negligible fees in the first wave of privatisation and will transfer 861 more in a second wave that is already under way, has made the Prague exchange the broadest in eastern Europe with over 900 shares publicly traded. But western investors warn that the Czech republic's international image as eastern Europe's free market zealot obscures a club world still run by the old elites. Western observers complain that insider trading, abetted by the loosest regulatory environment in eastern Europe and the multitude of channels outside the stock exchange through which shares can be bought and sold, is rampant. 'Often we have no idea that large blocks of shares have been traded for months afterwards,' complains one western banker based in Prague. 'There is a tremendous cynicism about the rule of law. The factory directors think they are very smart, but often they wind up screwing the shareholders.' The Budapest bourse is at the other end of the spectrum, although it is by no means free of insider trading. It is smaller, better regulated and often peripheral to the economic transformation in the country. Saddled with a gross foreign debt of Dollars 2,500 per head, which, unlike their Polish counterparts, the Hungarians chose not to negotiate away, Budapest has been reluctant to give its state enterprises to its citizens for free. The Hungarian government has preferred to sell its patrimony to strategic foreign investors for real money and in the rare cases when state companies have been floated on the exchange has broken the east European pattern and over-valued rather than undervalued share prices. In Hungary and Poland, enthusiasm for the stock market has been conditioned by its infancy, which was traumatic for investors in Hungary but wildly lucrative in Poland. 'In Warsaw it had a snowball effect,' says Mr Andras Simor, managing director of Creditanstalt Securities in Budapest. 'But here people got the impression that the stock exchange is not where you make money.' As a result, only 29 shares are traded on the Budapest exchange, with half a dozen more expected to be floated over the next few months, and average daily turnover, in the first four months of this year, was Dollars 11.9m. Uniquely, the Hungarian bourse is dominated by companies which were private from the start and, from the outset, its main role has been to raise capital rather than to serve as an outlet for speculative instincts repressed by four decades of communism. The Warsaw exchange, with only 24 shares listed and a dozen more expected in the next few months, is structurally similar to its puny Hungarian cousin rather than its swollen Czech neighbour. However, propelled by the national speculative frenzy of 400,000 registered domestic investors and a lack of other outlets for domestic capital, last year the Warsaw bourse experienced a 820 per cent rise in real terms with the average prices-to-earnings ratio hitting the dizzy level of 40. Poland's strong economic growth last year at 4 per cent was the second highest in Europe, but the speculative fever soon outstripped real economic gains. 'Poles are the Chinese of Eastern Europe, we are traders in our souls,' Mr Krzysztof Stupnicki, chief representative of CS First Boston in Warsaw, offers as an explanation for his compatriots' stock market fever. The Polish entrepreneurial instinct has been sorely tested over the past few months, as the Warsaw bourse has dropped more than 50 per cent. But western institutional investors - who got out in time, creating an ironic situation in which bankers estimate that between Dollars 50m and Dollars 150m of Polish domestic capital has flown into the coffers of western merchant banks  -describe the fall as a 'correction' rather than a collapse. Indeed, despite their recent declines, no one seriously doubts the staying power of any of the three main eastern European bourses. The bigger question is what real role the stock markets are playing in the radical economic transformations under way in the former Warsaw pact states. As an engine for economic transformation, the exchanges have played a modest role. The central challenge that post-communist economies face is opening the economy to the entry of new, private businesses and transferring state enterprises into private hands. Insiders suggest that, even in the Czech republic, where the stock market has played the most central role in privatisation, it is a facade behind which the old elites are manipulating the economy much as before. By contrast, Hungary, which has favoured direct foreign investment over public flotations, has been at least as successful as its eastern European neighbours. Many Hungarians argue that a takeover by a strategic foreign investor, such as General Electric, which, after a shaky start is successfully transforming Hungary's Tungsram factory, is the most effective way to push an enterprise into the market economy. Furthermore, the bourses have also been slow to take on one of their central functions in established market economies: offering companies a venue for raising capital. Investors in all three capitals complain of the 'irrationality' of domestic players and describe their countries' stock markets as 'paper casinos.' As the bourses mature, that is beginning to change, but only gradually. Finally, as investment vehicles for domestic savers, the eastern European stock markets have been indifferent performers. Their volatility has made them immensely profitable for some western investors and a few sophisticated locals. But, as the Warsaw bourse demonstrated earlier this year, the gains of a few smart speculators, many of them outsiders, have been at the expense of naive, over-zealous domestic investors, who would have done better putting their money into reliable, high-yielding Treasury bills. Yet, while stock markets have not served as a magic carpet which has swiftly and efficiently whisked eastern Europe into capitalism, using exchanges to transform communist economies has had two great virtues. First, it is fast. Hungarians can argue that strategic foreign investors produce more fundamental management changes, but it is only by trusting an unruly and often unfair stock market that the Czech republic has managed to jump from being one of the most state-controlled economies in eastern Europe to the leading market reformer. Perhaps more importantly, stock markets can play a crucial political role. More than any nation in eastern Europe, the Czech republic has transformed itself from a country of comrades into a land of small shareholders. That could be the reason why, while the disgruntled Poles and Hungarians have turned to ex-communist leaders, the Czechs are still ruled by an aggressively right-wing government. Moreover, as Poland, the Czech republic and Hungary move from economic transition to growth, all three countries' bourses are settling down as mature, relatively stable exchanges. Like their western counterparts, they are becoming reliable yardsticks of their nations' economic growth and a small, but standard, element in European investment portfolios.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REMNANTS OF PCP LAB FOUND NEAR DIRT ROAD  </P> <P> Los Angeles County health officials Tuesday cleaned up equipment from an  illegal drug lab found in a remote canyon in Val Verde, sheriff's deputies  said.  </P> <P> Judging by the size of the containers found near a dirt road off Hasley Canyon  Road, deputies estimated that 35 gallons of the drug PCP, with a street value  of up to $5 million, could have been manufactured with the equipment.  </P> <P> Numerous trash cans and empty ether cans were found about 7:30 p.m. Monday by  two deputies looking for abandoned cars. They smelled ether and traced it to a  small clearing.  </P> <P> A narcotics investigator said it was unclear whether the PCP was manufactured  there or whether the materials had been dumped.  </P> <P> No PCP was found, but a highly flammable chemical residue left after  manufacture of the drug was still in the containers. The deputies called a Fire  Department hazardous materials unit and health officials to remove the  materials.  </P></p>

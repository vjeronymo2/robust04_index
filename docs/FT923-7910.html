			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: SE to hold trading inquiry AN INQUIRY is to be held by the Stock Exchange into dealings yesterday in Sears shares after the stores group was the victim of an anonymous note sent to the offices of many institutions and brokers. The one-sheet note made a series of allegations about the financial state of the company and its relations with its bankers, raised doubts over the dividend, and suggested the shares should be traded down to 35p. Analysts were quick to rebut the criticisms, but not before the shares had retreated in busy trading early in the session. Opening at 67p, the shares slipped to 62p within half an hour as word spread of the anonymous letter. However, closer inspection of the mysterious document raised suspicion that a bear raid was being attempted, and the share price recovered. Mr Andy Hughes at Nomura said: 'Worries over the dividend and aspects of trading are not new but are already in the price, which at this level looks reasonably good value.' Kleinwort Benson, the company's broker, described the notes as 'cheap and nasty' and not worth further comment. Sears shares closed at 67p, unchanged on the day after hefty volume of 12m. Waters firmer The publication of the discussion document from Ofwat on quality costs in the water industry was greeted with a huge sigh of relief by the market and shares in the sector were marked up accordingly. Analysts pointed to a number of positive points, principally that the large capital expenditure programme after 1994 will enable the industry to maintain positive dividend growth and argue for higher prices. However, others were more bearish. County NatWest pointed out that Ofwat's indication of keeping down the 'K' factor - the level above inflation that prices can be set - could mean water companies having to find more money from the balance sheet. But Dr Angela Whelan at BZW argued that water companies would have scope to fund extra capital expenditure from cost savings and some reduction in the rate of return. Smith New Court and County said that the best placed companies were those with big investment programmes after 1995, namely South West, Anglian and North West. Among the main movers yesterday, Severn Trent rose 12 to 392p, Welsh 14 to 429p and Yorkshire 20 to 438p. Vodafone pleases The price restructuring plan proposed by Vodafone was welcomed by the market which saw it as a positive move to combat its cellular rival, Cellnet, without provoking a price war. Vodafone proposed to reduce rental rates but increase call charges at peak times in an attempt to attract new customers, mainly from the domestic market. The company estimates the new measures will cost Pounds 5m this year and Pounds 10m in 1993. The shares gained 5 to 317p. Barclays setback Bearish comment from one securities house lay behind a sharp fall for Barclays which closed 12 lower at 290p on busy turnover of 9.2m shares. SG Warburg Securities reminded clients of the bank's comments last week that bad debt ratios would deteriorate and that the final dividend depended on the state of the economy. Warburg said the comments meant profit expectations would be very low over the next two years and that the dividend might be cut. Barclays held its first-half dividend unchanged at 9.15p when it announced half-year results last week. BP nerves An unimpressive performance from British Petroleum (BP) shares may be taken further today when the market digests disappointing news on the new Columbian oil field in which BP has a 40 per cent stake. Last night, the first official reserve estimate stated that Cusiana contains 700m barrels of crude oil. Analysts said that although this report reflects only initial surveys, it is certain to be a disappointment for BP. The announced figure is below even the most conservative forecasts from market analysts of around 1bn barrels. The shares, restrained by lack of interest from the US fell 1 1/2 to 187 1/2 p on heavy volume. Insurance brokers were under pressure ahead of results next week. Analysts believe that soft US insurance markets and a weak dollar will push down first half profit figures from the two largest brokers, Sedgwick and Willis Corroon. Sedgwick slumped 17 to 141p and Willis slid 9 to 179p. Both depend heavily on the US market, with around 50 per cent of their earnings in dollars. Royal Insurance closed unchanged at 165p after announcing it had cut its first-half loss to Pounds 79m, in line with expectations, from Pounds 97m last year. A return of takeover speculation boosted Lasmo by 10 1/2 to 147p on heavy turnover of 10m shares. French group Total was linked to the UK oil exploration group but the rumours were not widely believed and increasing Middle East tension was also a factor. The prospect of an amicable settlement between Eurotunnel and TML, the tunnel's constructor, in their dispute over costs continued to boost Eurotunnel's shares. They added 10 to 335p. Engineering group Glynwed International shrugged off recent gloom as the market greeted with relief its 48 per cent improvement in interim figures, at the top end of expectations. The shares jumped 13 to 196p on though turnover at 1.6m was average with renewed confidence that the company would post a covered dividend this year. Worries over the dividend have been responsible for Glynwed's recent poor performance. Motor dealer Henlys gained 6 to 75p after predator T. Cowie improved its hostile bid to Pounds 30.3m, valuing each Henlys share at 80p. Cowie ended unchanged at 115p. Negative comment after Wednesday's results from Queens Moat sent the shares reeling further. After an 8p fall on Wednesday, they shed another 6 to 51p in turnover of 22m, to make it the most actively-traded stock in the market. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (5).

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Sport: The man who fell to earth - Soccer / Peter Berlin watches Klinsmania break out in north London The fan gave a little skip as he passed under the gate to the ground. He clasped his little blue season ticket book so tightly that his knuckles were white. 'Calm down, Andy]' said his friend without much conviction. 'It's only a game of football.' But it was not any game of football. It was the second turn on the Premier League's emotional roller coaster; Osvaldo Ardiles's wild ride. In particular they had come to see Jurgen Klinsmann, the German international striker, who has joined Tottenham Hotspur and who was playing that night against Everton. The frenzy surrounding Tottenham Hotspur reaches a surreal level this afternoon when they entertain Manchester United, champions for the last two years, double winners last season. Yet all eyes will be on Spurs, a team which barely escaped relegation last season and which started this one with a six-point penalty. Spurs began to capture the headlines when they signed Ilie Dumitrescu, a Romanian World Cup striker, in late July, igniting a small fizz of excitement among fans. The rocket took off when they signed Klinsmann. It exploded to delighted gasps of surprise last Saturday when Ardiles solved the selection problems presented by his two new signings by picking five attackers. Many teams in England play two strikers, some pick just one. Fans who have teams in newspaper fantasy leagues would not be allowed to pick the team Ardiles has selected. This is fantasyland. The white knight is Klinsmann, the smiling, friendly, blond, swashbuckler. He has already scored three goals in two games, helped wipe out the six-point penalty and has talked defiantly about winning the championship. It is as if he had stepped through Alice's mirror. A month ago he rivalled Diego Maradona as the footballer most loathed by English fans. The basic problem, for these fans, is that Klinsmann is a German. This is not simply a question of who won the world war, although the tabloids who greeted his two goals against Everton with 'Herr Raid Warning' and 'Master Brace' seem determined to ignore Basil Fawlty's advice on this subject. It is more a question of who won the World Cup. Since losing to England in 1966, Germany have won twice. In the last seven world cups, England have reached the final stages only four times, and on three of those occasions West Germany knocked them out. This is also the reason why even non-Spurs fans are queueing to watch him. A German star has chosen to play in England. Fans may hate to admit it, but his presence suggests that foreigners respect the English league, it even gives a little weight to the increasingly hollow boast that the Premier League is the best (or at least toughest) in the world. But Klinsmann is guilty of a greater crime. English fans still demand fair play - at least from sportsmen of other nations - and they regard Klinsmann as a cheat. Eric Cantona, United's French striker, will miss today's game because he is suspended again. Cantona has an unpleasant habit of kicking, raking or stamping on opponents. Cantona is an 'artist' and therefore, the cant goes, this is part of his nature. Klinsmann, an athlete, is not violent but, in the eyes of fans, he is sneaky. English fans criticise his habit of tumbling when tackled in the penalty area. He is known as the Stuka, because he dives. The fans may claim not to like him, but they pay to see him and they cheer when he mocks them by diving across the pitch after scoring a goal. Since Spurs signed him they have sold Pounds 500,000 of season tickets. Shirts with his name and number are falling off the shelves at Pounds 47.24. On Thursday, after his goals against Everton, Spurs' shares jumped 10p. Klinsmann's powerful header at Sheffield on Saturday helped Spurs to win 4-3. His two in the first half on Wednesday, a close range header and a satisfyingly spectacular scissors kick, gave Spurs a 2-1 victory. But he cannot win games alone and a lot will depend on how well the other members of the team play. So far the attack is working nicely but the undermanned defence is creaking. Ardiles' biggest gamble was dropping Gary Mabbutt, club captain and England international, and picking two centre halves - Sol Campbell, 19, and Stuart Nethercott, 21, - with barely 20 Premier League games at that position between them. Today's match will provide a test of their nerve. After Wednesday's game Ardiles said: 'We are cavalier, yes that is the right word.' After Ardiles, Mike Walker, the Everton manager, started to answer questions. Suddenly the crowd in front of him turned and walked away. Klinsmann had come in. Two years ago, after the launch of the media-friendly Premier League, clubs began to bring players to meet the press after matches. The first time Spurs tried this, the choice was an experienced player who had scored the match-winning goal. 'I just stuck my boot out and it went in,' and 'it felt tremendous' was all he could manage. The experiment was dropped. On Wednesday, Klinsmann stood in the same spot. He held forth articulately, intelligently, charmingly until he was dragged away by Ardiles to some other appointment. In a way this Spurs team is a caricature of English soccer: stacked with strikers, devoid of midfielders and with a very mixed bag of defenders. Furthermore, there seems to be something in the air. There have been other big scores in the first two rounds of league games. Liverpool scored six goals in one match, Newcastle have scored seven, Sheffield Wednesday have let in seven and scored five. Even Arsenal, whose recent success has been built on defence, started the season with four strikers. This may have something to do with the tougher rules on tackling. On Wednesday, Everton did not commit a foul - a penalty for hand-ball apart  -in the first half. If defenders keep refusing to tackle, it may be a while before Klinsmann has a chance to dive in earnest. Maybe he will spurn it with a smile.</p>

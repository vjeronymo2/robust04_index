			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Krzysztof Gottesman, under the "Observations" </F> rubric]    [Text] Dariusz Rosati, a deputy prime minister and finance  minister candidate, whom the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] has  very seriously supported, failed to receive presidential  approval. Aleksander Kwasniewski made assurances Friday [25  March] that Dariusz Rosati continues to be the joint candidate  of the prime minister and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]-SLD  coalition, which is waiting for the president to change his  decision. But Andrzej Drzycimski, Lech Walesa's spokesman,  ruled out such a possibility. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak did  not speak out on the issue.    The course of events may suggest that President Lech Walesa  may not have been the only one to have doubts about Rosati's  candidacy. That proposition could have been supported by  statements coming from the PSL, by Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak's procrastination in his decision, and also by changes  implemented in the Finance Ministry's leadership. So the  president could have just willingly implemented a decision that  the PSL coalition members were in an awkward position to  implement. There has been a silent accord emerging for some  time between the president and Waldemar Pawlak. I think both of  them are equally interested in the SLD, and Aleksander  Kwasniewski personally, not gaining too strong a position.    The SLD is aware of the danger of close cooperation between  the PSL and the president. That proposition may be supported by  statements made by [former Finance Minister] Marek Borowski  concerning the president's unreasonable powers and also by an  evening session of the SLD Parliamentary Club during which there  was unequivocal talk of the possibility of the parliament  confronting the president. It was as if the essence of the  president's decision was ignored. One can have doubts about  whether it is a good situation where a deputy prime minister for  economic affairs and the man responsible for the state's  finances will be testifying in front of a court of law in the  future in what is obviously a scandal, regardless of his status  when in front of the court.    First responses by the SLD leader indicate that he and his  party intend to persist with their candidacy. On the other  hand, the prime minister's restraint may suggest that the  current state of "suspension of things" is to his liking. But  will that not lead to instability in the coalition's situation?    The question as to who would gain more out of a possible  confrontation is open, even though there are many signs today  that the SLD's position would deteriorate as a result of such a  confrontation. There are no volunteers willing to form a  coalition with the SLD. The Democratic Union [UD], which could  possibly be considered, but with a whole list of reservations,  is bound not to take such a step after it merges with the  Liberal-Democratic Congress. The PSL's position seems much more  comfortable. Neither UD nor the Union of Labor nor the  presidential Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms (under certain  terms, of course) rule out by definition cooperation with Pawlak.    The impact of the current crisis on the situation within the  SLD could also be interesting. Aleksander Kwasniewski's  position within the party may be substantially weakened as a  result of the recent coalition crises. He may be the recipient  of a majority of accusations by his colleagues from the party  concerning lack of efficiency, going along with the PSL,  excessive self-confidence, and too unequivocal and perhaps not  always mature opinions expressed. The SLD is not a monolith,  and it also has three leaders who sooner or later may start  competing with each other. So it is possible that the recent  events may be perceived inside the party as mistakes made by a  leader whose powers should be slightly curtailed "in the name of  the coalition's continued existence."</p>

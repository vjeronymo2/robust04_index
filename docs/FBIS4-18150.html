			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tansu Ciller, prime minister of the Republic </F> of Turkey, by Petur Bochukov; place and date not given: "`It is  Our Sincere Wish To Strengthen Mutual Confidence and Cooperation  Between Turkey and Bulgaria'"]    [Text] [Bochukov] Madame Prime Minister, I hope you  remember that, on the occasion of the CSCE Conference in Vienna,  you promised us an interview for the daily DUMA. I take  advantage of your kindness today. Your first visit to Bulgaria  is soon expected. What are your feelings in anticipating your  Sofia visit?    [Ciller] Apart from a short period in the recent past,  relations between Turkey and Bulgaria have always been good. If  you consider the list of current mutual visits between officials  of both countries, you cannot fail to notice the intensity of  our mutual relations. I can confidently claim that relations  between Turkey and Bulgaria have achieved a remarkable level.    Turkey attaches great importance to friendship, good  neighborly relations, and cooperation with the Republic of  Bulgaria. We are convinced that the good, friendly relations  between the two countries are not only contributing to peace in  the Balkans, but in Europe as a whole.    [Bochukov] How could the remnants of past distrust and  mutual suspicions between Turkey and Bulgaria be eliminated,  according to you?    [Ciller] I think that the problem deserves a very careful  and objective examination. I would like to stress that our  relations with Bulgaria have entered a new stage, leaving behind  the past. On the Turkish side there is no hesitation whatsoever  to normalize our relations with Bulgaria. I also would like to  remind you that, following 1989, our mutual relations were  promptly promoted to the highest level. We are actively working  for an atmosphere of mutual confidence and security between  Turkey and Bulgaria. We signed the Sofia and Edirne documents,  whose contents are by far exceeding the Vienna document of 1992,  which once more confirms Turkey's good will toward Bulgaria and  our sincere wish to intensify mutual confidence and cooperation  between our two countries. Turkey has also withdrawn military  units from our common border with Bulgaria.    Turkey supported Bulgaria's efforts to join the European  political and military structures. This clearly shows that no  distrust and suspicions whatsoever exist on our side.    [Bochukov] Do you admit that not all people who profess the  Islamic faith in Bulgaria are ethnic Turks?    [Ciller] From the first moment of its establishment, the  Republic of Turkey has wholeheartedly supported a foreign policy  based on the principles of common sense.    In accordance with such principles, we are willing to  establish good neighborly and friendly relations with all  countries, to develop relations and cooperation in all spheres  in the peoples' interests, to respect mutual independence,  sovereignty, and territorial integrity, to refrain from  interfering in other countries' domestic affairs, to consolidate  peace and understanding. These are only a few of the principles  that we are observing. The aforementioned principles are also  applied in our Balkan relations.    "Human relations" exist between Turkey and the region. We  have Turkish minorities living in Balkan states. Numerous  Turkish citizens have emigrated from the Balkans to Turkey. We  regard the Turkish minorities as a bridge between Turkey and the  country in which they are living as loyal citizens.    I would like to remind you that Christian Turkish minorities  also exist.    [Bochukov] Do you see any other solution than the force of  arms regarding settling your government's problem with the  Kurdish Workers Party [PKK]?    [Ciller] The PKK is a terrorist organization aimed at  dividing Turkey on an ethnic basis. Like every other government  in the world, the Turkish Government is trying to restrain the  terrorist activities of this organization with its own legal  security forces. This fact is confirmed by the mass  assassinations of women, children, and old people who are  Turkish citizens of Kurdish origin. Our government is involved  in a democratization process and in the defense of human rights.  The right of living in freedom is one of the fundamental human  rights. The violence of the PKK shall be eradicated by the  joint efforts of all our citizens, those of Kurdish origin  included.    [Bochukov] How do you see the future development of  bilateral economic and trade relations between our two countries?    [Ciller] We consider the economic and trade relations  between Turkey and Bulgaria as very promising. There is no  doubt that a well balanced economic cooperation between the two  countries would be of mutual interest. Hence, we should work  for its development.    The present level of our mutual trade does not reflect the  real potential of our countries. I am convinced that much more  could and should be done. In this respect I would like to  stress that the number of Turkish-Bulgarian joint ventures has  attained 279. Naturally, they could be more. Our government is  doing everything to encourage Turkish businessmen and investors  to work with Bulgaria. We are soon expecting to sign an  agreement in this field. Undoubtedly, this will be to the  advantage of Turkish and Bulgarian businessmen alike, providing  an opportunity for mutual investments. We are currently working  on an agreement to eliminate double taxation.    Accepting that regional cooperation is a step toward  European  integration, the Balkan countries should develop their trade and  economic relations. Proceeding in this direction, both Turkey  and Bulgaria could obtain opportunities for larger markets. A  similar idea was at the basis of the project to establish a  Black Sea economic cooperation zone.    [Bochukov] Which economic spheres are the most interesting  for Bulgarian-Turkish cooperation?    [Ciller] Considerable structural changes were recently  introduced in Turkey. We have good opportunities for  cooperation with Bulgaria in all spheres that your country  prefers, and particularly related to infrastructure and building  projects in third countries.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Content of the USCAR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The USCAR provides a background to the issue of global climate change and describes current U.S. efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Following the Introduction and Overview (chapter 1), the report begins (in chapter 2) with an analysis of United States national circumstances which affect its vulnerability and responses to climate change. These circumstances include natural resources, the economy, energy production and consumption, governing institutions, and U.S. policies related to climate change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next chapter (chapter 3) consists of an inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and HFC and PFC emissions. Because the full U.S. submission includes a copy of the EPA Report ``Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks for 1990&hyph;1993'', the USCAR itself provides a summary of this complete inventory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter 4 deals with the specific actions being taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This section is drawn from the material contained in the 1993 U.S. Climate Change Action Plan. As with the emissions inventory, a detailed supplement was also submitted to the INC Secretariat on this material. That document, ``The Climate Change Action Plan: Technical Supplement,'' has been published separately by the Department of Energy. The 1993 Action Plan aims to limit greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to guide the U.S. economy toward environmentally sound economic growth into the next century. The Plan is comprehensive, as it targets all greenhouse gases and all sectors of the economy through a portfolio of nearly fifty different actions. It is designed for rapid implementation by building on existing technologies, programs, and voluntary efforts to deliver cost-effective results. It is a coordinated federal response, involving several government agencies working together, and was developed through an interagency process. The Plan is being actively monitored to ensure that it meets the President's goals, and will be modified to adapt to changing circumstances. Finally, the Plan lays the foundation for an international response to climate change through the United States Initiative on Joint Implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The combined effect of the U.S. actions, assuming 1993 economic predictions and full funding of all mitigation measures, would reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1,459 million metric tons of carbon equivalent (MMTCE) by the year 2000, slightly below the 1990 level of 1,462 MMTCE. Without these mitigation policies, projected net greenhouse gas emissions would rise to 1,674 MMTCE. Since these policies were first developed and their effects projected, economic growth has been more robust, and oil prices lower than predicted in the Action Plan. These differences and other effects on meeting the projected emission reductions of the Plan are now being evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter 5 of the USCAR examines the potential impacts of global climate change as well as strategies to adapt to any such change. Both adverse and beneficial consequences of climate change are plausible, with the overall effect depending on the rate and magnitude of change and the vulnerability or sensitivity of human and natural systems to such changes. Possible consequences include rising sea levels, coastal zone erosion, shifts in precipitation patterns (causing either more floods or droughts), shifts in agricultural production, and increased stress on forest ecosystems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter 6 highlights current U.S. research and public education efforts regarding climate change. The U.S. Global Change Research Program, the largest climate change research program in the world, seeks both to expand knowledge about the processes that affect climate change and to develop integrated models to predict these effects. In addition to basic science research, the U.S. is promoting research in all economic sectors_including industry, transportation, housing, and agriculture_to develop strategies to reduce emissions. The United States is coordinating its research efforts with both international organizations and on a bilateral basis with individual countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that the public has a solid understanding of the science of climate change and the consequences of policy options, the U.S. is also continuing to develop its efforts to coordinate general education, communication, and information programs for the public. Educational outreach programs include GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment) for K&hyph;12 students, and Project Earthlink, a long-term effort targeting community leaders, informal educators, teachers, students, journalists, and the general public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

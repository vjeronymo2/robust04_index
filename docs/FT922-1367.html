			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ban on industrial fishing called for INDUSTRIAL FISHING should be banned in the North Sea, according to Greenpeace, the UK environmental pressure group. A report published today suggests that industrial fishing - which takes fish for uses other than human consumption - is responsible for falling fish stocks. The fish are processed into fish meal and fish oil for such industries as pig and poultry feed, paint, and shoe polish. Industrial fishing, which takes up to 50 per cent of the North Sea catch, targets small species such as sandeels, which provide food for bigger fish, sea birds and marine mammals. Greenpeace believes the practice is destructive and wasteful, and describes regulation of the European Community fleet as inadequate. Ms Mary Munson, the organisation's fisheries campaigner, believes the UK presidency of the community will give the UK 'a unique opportunity to influence the EC and stop the pillage of our seas'. As well as a ban on industrial fishing, Greenpeace is calling for environmental effects to be considered in every EC fisheries decision and for measures to end the catching and discarding of non-target species. Greenpeace points out that improved technology has increased the efficiency of the total fishing industry. 'As fishermen have increased their abilities to catch the few remaining fish, stock after stock of commercial fish has significantly declined.' British landings of cod, for example, have decreased from 380,000 tonnes to 60,000 tonnes since the 1970s. The report admits that it is unlikely that over-fishing will lead to the extinction of any species as fishermen rarely find it worthwhile to continue when a stock is severely depleted. 'However, the loss of such a huge proportion of fish populations is alarming in itself,' says the report. Net Losses, Gross Destruction. European Fisheries in Crisis.

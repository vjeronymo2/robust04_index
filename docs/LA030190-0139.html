			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4% GOT DISABLING INJURY IN N.Y. HOSPITALS, STUDY FINDS;  </P> <P> HEALTH: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT SUCH CASES ARE UNDER-REPORTED. HARVARD  RESEARCHERS SAY ONE-FOURTH OF THE INCIDENTS WERE CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE.  </P> <P> A major Harvard University study of medical malpractice has found that almost  4% of patients sustained an injury resulting in disability while hospitalized  in New York state, and more than one-quarter of the injuries were caused by  negligence.  </P> <P> The study, made public Wednesday, analyzed what happened to 30,121 patients  admitted to 51 hospitals during 1984. It suggested that -- among the 2.7  million patients actually hospitalized in New York that year -- thousands of  deaths were caused by in-hospital injuries.  </P> <P> It found that the risk of suffering an injury in a hospital increased with a  patient's age, that negligence was 50% higher in government hospitals and that,  although nearly half of all injuries occur in operating rooms, malpractice  during surgery is less than in other areas of hospitals.  </P> <P> The results of the project also indicated that hospital administrators continue  to under-report incidents, including life-threatening events, to state  authorities.  </P> <P> "I think there is significant under-reporting today," New York state's health  commissioner, Dr. David Axelrod, told a tumultuous news conference in Manhattan  during which he was frequently interrupted by patients who asserted that they  had suffered malpractice while being treated by physicians.  </P> <P> " . . . I do not believe there is a code of silence. I believe there is concern  with the way the current malpractice system functions."  </P> <P> Drug complications were the most common type of injury, accounting for 19% of  the problems reported in the study. Antibiotics and anti-tumor drugs were the  most likely to cause difficulties for patients, including allergic reactions,  kidney damage, diarrhea, depletion of white blood cells or infection.  </P> <P> The team of Harvard physicians, lawyers, administrators, nurses and  statisticians who conducted the four-year-long, $3.1-million study said the  results had implications for patients and health care providers in other  states.  </P> <P> "This will have important implications for society as a whole," said Dr. Howard  H. Hiatt, professor of medicine at Harvard and former dean of the university's  School of Public Health who participated in the study along with investigators  from the Maxwell School of Syracuse University. "We can't undo what happened in  1984. Our goal is prevention."  </P> <P> The study was commissioned by the state's Department of Health as an offshoot  of major reform in 1986 of the state's malpractice insurance act.  </P> <P> The study found that 3.7% of patients who were hospitalized in 1984 received an  injury in the hospital resulting in a measurable disability. Statisticians said  this translated into 99,000 injuries among the 2.7 million patients who entered  hospitals.  </P> <P> Among those who were disabled, 28% of the injuries were caused by negligence,  for a total of 27,000 patients, the study concluded. Most injuries were  relatively minor -- 57% of patients recovered completely within a month, and a  total of 70% recovered within six months.  </P> <P> However, the study estimated that 14% of the medical injuries were fatal, and  almost half of the fatalities were caused by negligence. The researchers said  this percentage suggested that there were 13,451 deaths and 2,550 cases of  permanent total disability resulting from medical injury in New York hospitals  during the study year. They estimated that 6,985 deaths were caused by  negligence.  </P> <P> Age clearly was a risk factor. Patients over 65 years old, who often suffer  complex medical problems, were judged to have twice the chance of being injured  as patients 16 to 44.  </P></p>

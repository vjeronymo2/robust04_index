			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa deficit estimate cut THE DEFICIT in the world cocoa supply and demand balance for 1991-92 has been cut to 107,000 tonnes by Gill &amp; Duffus, the London trade house owned by ED &amp; F. Man. This compares with a January estimate of 177,000 tonnes and a surplus of 178,000 tonnes in 1990-91. The main reasons for the adjustment have been a bigger than expected crop from the Ivory Coast and a virtual absence of buying from the former Soviet Union, says Gill's latest cocoa market report. The Ivory Coast crop, estimated in January at 710,000 tonnes, is now put at 750,000 tonnes. Buying from the former Soviet Union is now thought to have sunk to 25,000 tonnes, compared with a January estimate of 65,000 tonnes. Gill believes that the downside risk on the cocoa markets is limited but the upside risk is greater, particularly if next year sees another deficit.</p>

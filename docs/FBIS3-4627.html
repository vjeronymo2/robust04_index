[23 February] -- The army is  planning to replace the present 1,500 Malaysian Battalion  (Malbatt) troops serving under the United Nations Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said the army had  yet to identify which unit would take over the peacekeeping  duties from the Third Royal Armoured Regiment, which was sent  there in batches from last September 21.    He said the troops needed to be relieved after undergoing a  lot of tension and stress for long periods at designated  battle-zones.    Under the present arrangement with UNPROFOR, the troops are  expected to serve for between a year and 18 months. But their  stay could be prolonged depending on the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    He was speaking to reporters after meeting Canadian Minister  for Industry, Commerce, Science, and Technology Gerald Tremblay  at his office today.    Najib said two consignments of Hari Raya [end of Ramadan]  gift parcels, army vehicles, and equipment would be sent to  Malaysian troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Somalia.    One consignment would be flown to the Malbatt troops in  Bosnia-Herzegovina on Sunday while the other consignment of army  logistics would be shipped to Mogadishu tomorrow.    "Due to the lack of air flights between the countries, many  of our soldiers in Somalia go to neighbouring countries for  their holidays. The two most common places they frequent are  Mombasa and Nairobi."    Najib also said the cabinet decided today to contribute U.S.  $100,000 in clothes and medication for victims of last  Wednesday's earthquake in Sumatra, Indonesia. The earthquake  killed more than 200 people and injured 1,000. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Payroll weakens the dollar THE DOLLAR lost about  1/2 a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday lunchtime after the latest US employment report turned out to be slightly worse than expected, writes James Blitz. However, after falling to a low of DM1.5675 against the D-Mark on the day, the dollar bounced back as longer-term investors were attracted by the currency's cheapness. Dealers were also reluctant to take long D-Mark positions at the end of a week which has seen the release of extremely poor indicators on the German economy. They pushed the dollar up nearly  1/2 a pfennig to close on the day at DM1.5825 against the German currency. The headline US non-farm payroll figure for April saw a rise of 119,000 on the month, compared to market expectations of a 148,000 rise. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America, said that the drop in manufacturing employment by 65,000 on the month was a particularly depressing feature because manufacturing growth had been thought to be leading the US recovery. However, the dollar's losses were mitigated by this week's particularly poor performance in the German economy. The March figure for industrial orders in Germany was a particularly worrying indicator this week, dropping 3 per cent on the month. This background explains why sterling rose 1 1/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday, finishing at DM2.4925, despite a defeat for the UK government's candidate in the Newbury by-election. By contrast, the Swiss franc ended a good week on the soft side. The 'Swissie' closed a little weaker at SFr0.902 from a previous SFr0.899. The strength of the Dutch guilder and Belgian franc this week prompted central banks to reduce interest rates for both of these currencies yesterday. However, the guilder was still some 35 basis points above the D-Mark in the exchange rate mechanism grid yesterday, threatening to breach the 50 basis point margin against the D-Mark set by the Dutch authorities. The Danish krone slipped sharply against the D-Mark, however, with 10 days to go to Denmark's referendum. The trigger for yesterday's decline was an opinion poll showing that the number of people planning to vote 'No' in the referendum had increased from 33 per cent to 39 per cent. The Danish currency slipped to DKr3.8545 against the D-Mark from DKR3.8450 on Thursday. Inside the ERM grid, the krone's divergence against its central Ecu rate slipped to 42 percentage points.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAVENTHOL OFFICE MAY JOIN WITH BDO SEIDMAN  </P> <P> The local office of foundering accounting giant Laventhol &amp; Horwath is  negotiating to reopen as a second Orange County branch of BDO Seidman, an  official from that accounting firm confirmed Wednesday.  </P> <P> Previously, four of the partners in the office had said they would maintain an  independent office -- Carpe, Wachs, Kipper &amp; Davis -- after Laventhol &amp;  Horwath fired most of its 3,400 employees in November and announced that it  would dissolve and file for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the  federal bankruptcy code.  </P> <P> But plans to keep the local office going as an independent were squelched after  some clients said they would change accountants because they wanted their  audits certified by a big-name firm.  </P> <P> Jerry Walsh, a spokesman for BDO Seidman in New York, said negotiations are  expected to conclude this week between his firm and partners from the former  Laventhol office in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> He said he would not identify the partners his firm is negotiating with until  the deal is final.  </P> <P> BDO Seidman, the U.S. member of BDO Binder of Brussels, is the seventh-largest  accounting firm in the world, with 432 offices in 61 countries. In California,  BDO Seidman has five offices, in Los Angeles, Orange, San Francisco, Torrance  and San Diego.  </P> <P> People answering the telephone at the former Laventhol &amp; Horwath office in  Costa Mesa now say simply, "accounting offices."  </P> <P> Three former partners are apparently already working for BDO Seidman: Rich  Kipper at the company's Los Angeles office, and Brian Wachs and Ron Williamson  at BDO Seidman in Orange.  </P> <P> BDO Seidman had revenue of $178 million for its fiscal year ended June 30,  Walsh said, and parent BDO Binder predicts revenue of $1 billion worldwide for  the year ending Dec. 31. The 80-year-old firm has 269 partners.  </P> <P> Laventhol &amp; Horwath was the nation's seventh-largest accounting firm, with  350 partners, when it broke up in November. At the time, the company said its  liabilities far exceeded its assets, although figures were not given.  </P> <P> The company has $85 million in bank debt and there are several pending lawsuits  alleging poor accounting that could add millions of dollars to the total.  </P></p>

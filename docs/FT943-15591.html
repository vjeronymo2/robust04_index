			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Arts: Why the Bolshoi pulled out of Britain - Inflating classical ballet for commercial gain was the real cause of failure Bolshoi scandale] A Russian dancer will recount a 'big scandal' - a skirt lost as Giselle makes her spectral appearance in Act 2 - with peals of merry laughter. But there is no joking about the scandal of this summer's cancelled Bolshoi Ballet tour. Moscow's finest were due to perform at indoor arenas in Birmingham and Manchester, and after a season in Dublin, were to make a series of open-air appearances to tens of thronging thousands at Leeds Castle, Highclere, and Castle Howard. The Manchester and Birmingham seasons were postponed, and after a financially disappointing visit to Dublin and the cancellation of two of the stately dates, the last - Leeds Castle - was this week abandoned. Derek Block, impresario of the enterprise, is quoted as saying: 'I believe I've been caught up in something which is much bigger than me: the worst recession I've ever seen'. I think the failure of the tour is indicative of something bigger than the events themselves, bigger than the losses incurred (stated as Pounds 1.25m), and bigger than the public's reluctance to fork out Pounds 55 for open-air performances by what has always been thought the ultimate bankable dance troupe. Block master-minded the five week season in the New Year, 1993, which brought 150 Bolshoi dancers to the Albert Hall and exposed them (rather as one might an unwanted tot on a Greek hill-side) on a thrust stage. Programmes comprised 'Suites' - ie large and often illogical chunks of the standard Moscow repertory - which impressed by the numbers of dancers involved and by their roaring enthusiasm. An audience - not the usual Russian Ballet aficionados - poured in, as they might to hear a rock-star or a popular evangelist, paying considerable sums to see a well-marketed show. Hence the 'suites' as a sampling of classical tit-bits. Hence our critical sniping, which pointed out that ballet is an art that is conditioned by the proscenium arch, and without that formal frame is sadly diminished in effect. The argument for such gigantism in the lyric theatre is commercial. Lots of space, lots of bodies and a few big names can do marvels for an impresario's and a company's bank-balance. In warmer European climes than ours there can be trudging hordes of supers in an open-air Aida (a friend appeared in such a staging in Italy, just behind the camels, whose defecations he neatly caught upon the serving platter he was holding), or an acreage of white tulle and swan-feathers, and given reliable weather and proximity, the public may be expected to flock. Such mass art demands modest pricing, ease of access, even a tradition of comparable entertainments. The Bolshoi has, in South America, played to vast crowds, and in the Palace of Congresses in Moscow it can appear before 6000 people. It is not in any way subtle as ballet, nor credible save on the bald terms of slam-bam performance and reverberant box-office tills. Like other Russian artistic enterprises, the Bolshoi has a present and urgent need for hard currency. It is also faced with the problem of relocation while its home theatre is re-furbished. Last year's Albert Hall season meant, for the Bolshoi, work and funds, though in every other way it implied a continuation of the hack-labour and artistic stagnation which has dogged its every gloriously-trained step in recent years. The blatancies of such seasons - never mind the quality, feel the size of the cast - are deleterious to the lyric arts. (The Bolshoi, whose style is physically larger than that of any other troupe, runs the danger of elephantiasis.) The performances are also oddly dependant upon public caprice, momentary switches of taste. Three tenors may bawl their lungs out to millions, and Pavarotti hold a sodden horde captive with gems from his repertory, but recent cancellations of other bloated opera recitals suggest that the fad has passed. Ballet under the terms proposed by the Bolshoi and Mr Block this summer - ten thousand spectators every night, in the open air  -was ballet seen through the wrong end of a telescope. And the enterprise demonstrated a greater faith in the English climate than most of us would credit. (Last week, in my corner of Sussex, we had an evening temperature-drop of 20 degrees and a rain-storm. Ideal for Penguin Lake.) At the heart of this fiasco is the matter of how ballet may be shown to a large audience. Maurice Bejart, for valid aesthetic reasons, made spectacles for the expanses of the Boboli Gardens; the Grand'Place in Brussels; the Grand Palais in Paris. These succeeded on boldest terms, because Bejart conceived them thus. Inflating traditional ballet for a new public, be it in the Albert Hall or the English country-side, implies distortion, evaporation of effect. It is a thoroughly bad thing, because an audience is given art diluted, deformed. And, if the prices for this tour are evidence, it is expected to pay through the nose for it. The great ballet companies are now prohibitively expensive to tour and present: value for consumers' money demands that if they are to be seen, it must be at their very best. Was it recession that caused the failure of this tour, or public reluctance to face the tedium of travel, the unpredictabilities of climate and location and even of programming? Ballet is an art of the theatre, and even the strongest troupes are only truly themselves in the great houses where they have always flourished. The impresario's trick, and the company's task, is still to make ballet available on these rigorous terms.</p>

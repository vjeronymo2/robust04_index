			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: BMW advances despite tough market conditions BMW, the German luxury car manufacturer, yesterday reported net profits up 10.5 per cent to DM421m (Dollars 284m) in the first half of the year. Against a backdrop of difficult markets in Europe and elsewhere, turnover climbed by 12 per cent to DM16.2bn and the number of cars sold rose by 15.4 per cent to 300,367. In the first half, it produced 313,000 cars, 19 per cent more than in the same period last year. The company predicted the rate of growth would slow in the second half but said it would probably manufacture and sell more cars and motorcycles over 1992 as a whole than it did last year, when car output totalled 553,000 units. BMW attributed its strong performance to its new 3-Series model which, BMW said, had enjoyed widespread success. This had helped BMW's total car sales to increase by 30 per cent in the US, to 31,000 models, and to maintain its sales in Japan at the same level as last year despite sharply deteriorating conditions. BMW said a lasting recovery in the world car market could hardly be expected this year, especially in the light of the uncertain economic recovery in the US and Japan. Conditions in Europe - and especially Germany - would remain weak because of high interest rates. The outlook for the German market was blighted by the prospect of further taxes, levies and restrictions, the company complained. It said it was doing its best to ensure profitability would be maintained despite Germany's unattractiveness as a production location. It aims to invest some DM500m in the first stage of a plant in South Carolina which, the company said, would strengthen its international competitiveness, secure jobs and reduce vulnerability to fluctuations in the US dollar. Mercedes-Benz, the luxury car subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial company, has signed letters of intent to set up joint venture production facilities in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Mr Werner Niefer, chief executive, said he had arranged the sale of a large number of Mercedes vehicles in all three countries.</p>

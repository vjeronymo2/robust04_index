			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / People: Former shipmate comes aboard It is perhaps appropriate that one of the first shore jobs taken by Sir Julian Oswald, who stepped down as Chief of Naval Staff earlier this year, is to join the board of an old shipping company whose directors have just mutinied. Sir Julian, 60, has become a non-executive director of Barrow-in-Furness-based James Fisher following the ousting of John Hornby, the 48-year-old chairman. Sir Julian has been brought on board by Sir David Hardy, a former finance director of Ocean Transport and one of two non-executive directors who joined the Fisher board at the end of June. Sir David, a director of several companies including Hanson, is an old friend of Sir Julian. Sir David used to be chairman of Swan Hunter which built HMS Worcester, one of Sir Julian's last commands, and Sir Julian arranged for Sir David to go to sea on a Nato exercise. Sir David says he had wanted to recruit someone to the board who could help restore the low morale at Fisher, which expects to lose money in the current half year. He added that John Hornby, who has been chairman and chief executive for the past four years, was an accountant and not a 'people person'. Pressure for change at the top of James Fisher, which manages several British Nuclear Fuels ships in addition to its large short-sea fleet, came from the charitable trusts which control nearly half its equity. The company cut its dividend sharply last year and passed its interim dividend this year, substantially reducing the trusts' income. Sir David has taken over as acting chairman but has hired Sir John Trelawnay of headhunters Goddard Kay Rogers to look for a replacement and a new chief executive. In the interim, Trevor Hart, 43, managing director of the firm's Coe Metcalf Shipping, becomes acting managing director.</p>

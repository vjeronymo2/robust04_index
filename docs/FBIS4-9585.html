			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 28 (TANJUG) - Radio Moscow said on  Thursday [28 April] the current and future achievements of  Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) "are a guarantee of stability and  peace in the entire territory of former Yugoslavia, a guarantee  of the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Serbian  people on the international scene."    In a broadcast monitored in Belgrade, Radio Moscow  commentator Yuriy Bragin said this was why he understood the  position currently being formed internationally about Belgrade's  new role as the political and social factor which could play a  positive role in the future in re-establishing goodneighbourly,  partnership and friendship ties among the peoples of former  Yugoslavia.    Commenting on the second anniversary of promulgating the  constitution of the new Yugoslav state, Bragin said the past two  years were marked by increasing pressure on Belgrade because the  civil war in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina had not been ended.  In late May 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed tough  sanctions on Yugoslavia for its alleged involvement in the civil  war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bragin said each time  Belgrade sympathized with the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  West, dissatisfied, tightened pressure on Yugoslavia, although  Yugoslavia made it clear in a declaration made public two years  ago that "it has no territorial claims to any of its neighbours."    With this, Yugoslavia has clearly shown that it honours the  U.N. Charter and CSCE documents and consistently supports the  principle of [word indistinct] nonuse of force in solving all  oustanding issues, he said.    It is evident in practice that Yugoslavia is honouring all  its obligations, that it has no territorial claims to any of the  newly formed neighbouring countries, that it is constantly  proposing new initiatives for a peaceful settlement of conflicts  and that it is strictly abiding by the principle of avoiding  force, Bragin explained. Bragin also said the plight caused by  the international blockade did not cause chaos in Yugoslavia's  political, economic and cultural life, but only consolidated its  people and proved the vitality of the state organization.    The recently launched monetary reform has curbed the  disastrous inflation, stabilized prices and revived production  both industrial and agricultural production. The country goes  on living despite the blockade. Sports competitions and  exhibitions are organized, new books are promoted and new plays  staged in theatres, Bragin said.</p>

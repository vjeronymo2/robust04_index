			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT JUSTICE EAGLESON PLANS TO RETIRE IN NOVEMBER  </P> <P> State Supreme Court Justice David N. Eagleson, one of three conservatives  appointed after voters ousted Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two other  liberals in 1987, will retire in November, a court spokesman said today.  </P> <P> Eagleson's retirement marks the last departure of the three justices appointed  by Gov. George Deukmejian to replace Bird and Justices Joseph Grodin and Cruz  Reynoso after a bitter confirmation election in November, 1986.  </P> <P> Justice John A. Arguelles left last year and Justice Marcus M. Kaufman retired  in January.  </P> <P> The latest departure will give Deukmejian his eighth appointment to the court.  The governor has appointed Justice Joyce L. Kennard, 48, to replace Arguelles  and Justice Armand Arabian, 55, to replace Kaufman.  </P> <P> Eagleson is considered one of the most conservative members of the court and  often joins in decisions with Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, who was appointed  by Deukmejian in 1984. He is considered a hard-liner on the death penalty.  </P></p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Arts: Goodbye, Mr French Fries - Cinema THE BROWNING VERSION (15) Mike Figgis RAPA NUI (12) Kevin Reynolds FEAR OF A BLACK HAT (15) Rusty Cundieff MAJOR LEAGUE II (PG) David S. Ward LONDON FILM FESTIVAL Few in this island will have restrained a giggle at the vision of British boarding school life presented in the recent Smoking/No Smoking. Alain One (Resnais) hijacked Alan Two (Ayckbourn) to give us what seemed a cross between PG Wodehouse and the wilder scenic fancies of Fragonard. For non-Britons, it was clear: Idiocy plus Idyll equals the public school. So naturally we turn to The Browning Version for realism. Produced by Ridley Scott and directed by Mike Figgis (Stormy Monday, Mr Jones), this stars Albert Finney as the unloved, dicky-hearted classics teacher of Terence Rattigan's stage play. All these chaps are British, so we should be safe. But wait. Ten minutes into this tale of Andrew Crocker-Harris and the heartless, unpensioned retirement forced on him by his school, and we are hankering for the documentary exactitudes of Resnais. This tweedy, stilted place seems even more unreal than Resnais' Franglais-sur-mer College. An hour in - after we learn that the hero's wife (Greta Scacchi) is canoodling with the American chemistry teacher (Matthew Modine), who has been hired on an exchange basis with Hollywood, and that Greta will never show Albert as much love as does the one grateful pupil who gives him the eponymous Aeschylus translation as a parting gift - and we feel that some serious surrealism is setting in. All these odd Caribbean complexions. For this is a Paramount-produced film and no American (the studio's thinking probably goes) will believe that public schools are actually filled with pale, spotty people who look as if they spent their formative years in a badger tunnel. And then there is that odd cricket match in which the fielders cry 'Howzat]' when someone is bowled. And then there is that overcranked ending when the whole school rises to applaud Crocker-Finney's farewell speech as Crocker-Scacchi stands at the rear of the hall shedding - yes] - a silent tear as the music by Mark Isham (A River Runs Through It) swells. Unbelievable. In all senses. The only actor to stem the tide of implausibility is Albert Finney, bravely reaching out for moments of truth and unexaggerated poignancy from his toby-jug frame. The rest of the film, wrongheadedly updated from Rattigan's period-perfect original, is made for the age of synthesised, fast-food foreign culture tasting. Goodbye, Mr French Fries. Rapa Nui, a South Seas epic by Kevin Reynolds (director of the Kevin Costner Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves), speculates on how Easter Island may have become a treeless wilderness filled with statues. In the late 17th century, the film hazards, the Short Ears tribe fought the Long Ears after the LEs had spent many years forcing the SEs to build those rock figures topped with weird visages. Palms were felled to provide scaffolding and rolling tracks. Food ran out. Natives got restless. Things came to a head during the annual Birdman race, in which Noro (Jason Scott Lee, Long Ears) vied with Make (Esai Morales, Short Ears) to be the first man to swim back from the neighbouring island and shin up the sheer cliffs with an unbroken egg strapped to his forehead. The victor of this early, remarkable jeu sans frontieres - we keep expecting the late Eddie Waring to burst out with 'And a fine move there by the Long Eared team . . .' - will win both power and the hand of the beautiful Ramana (Sandrine Holt). She has been in the Cave of the Virgins for six months, though spoiling the sacrificial effort by emerging pregnant. Meanwhile the island's absentminded ruler (Eru Potaka Dewes) frets over his multiplying statues - 'One day we'll get these right,' he waves - and the evil high priest (George Henare) keeps sending islanders to a better world by hitting them with a paddle. I shouldn't have, but when not laughing I loved this film. Knee-deep in the ridiculous, Rapa Nui also keeps clawing its way to the sublime. I wish I had tape-recorded the press show reaction. We all began by giggling into our handouts. By the close you could hear a pin drop. By the close the plot has become so surreal that it is worthy of Werner Herzog. The coda involves a journey to a magically whitened island - the next world? - as eerie as anything in Aguirre or Heart Of Glass. It crowns a movie whose visual spectacle - it was actually shot on Easter Island - keeps transcending its bathetic dialogue and pained plot ingenuities. And even those are not so pained as to have stopped 30 critics inching to the edges of their seats as the Birdman race entered its majestic delirium of seas, rocks, sharks and cliffs. * The director, writer and cast of Fear Of A Black Hat - broadly one and the same person, Rusty Cundieff - should be despatched to Rapa Nui immediately. It would be punishment for giving us 88 minutes of rapper phooey: a dismal spoof documentary in the Spinal Tap tradition in which Cundieff and pals, as the band NWH (Niggaz With Hats), strum chords and crack jokes with all the elan of street buskers in Hell. Major League II is worse. Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and the rest are back for fun and games in the world of baseball. Since this sport is more obscure to British audiences even than the Great Easter Island Birdman Handicap, we are completely at sea even when we are on dry land. In such a week you will welcome alternative choices. But can one have too much choice? The 38th London Film Festival begins next Thursday and once more offers a powerful argument for owning several sets of eyes and ears and an ability to sit in three cinemas at once. There are almost 200 feature films this year, but I have run out of ideas for being rude about the LFF's size. If London wants its main movie event to be an undiscriminating chaos, let it. If it wants to fill up theatres and silt up minds with the detritus of the year's other festivals - what on earth are films like Jiri Menzel's feeble Adventures Of Private Ivan Chonkin and Mario Brenta's catatonic Barbabo Of The Mountains doing here? - let it. As critics we can only stand between you and the National Film Theatre, offering some aesthetic point duty as you swarm towards the celluloid. Here are my Top Nine. Atom Egoyan's Exotica: a mazy mind-thriller about sex, memory and identity. Ang Lee's Eat Drink Man Woman: a 'Three Sisters' with food, funny and poignant, from the maker of A Wedding Banquet. Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures: artfully OTT in its recreation of a New Zealand murder scandal. Nanni Moretti's Dear Diary: artfully UTT in its scenes from the life of the wry director/ comedian (Rome's answer to Woody Allen). Louis Malle's Uncle Vanya On 42nd Street: eavesdropping on a heart-stopping reading/rehearsal by a Broadway stage company. Anna Campion's Loaded: fine psycho-gothic from the sister of Jane (The Piano). Mika Kaurismaki's Tigrero: inspired docu(mocku?)mentary about filmmaking veteran Sam Fuller. Rith Panh's Rice People: Hardyesque tale of the land from Cambodia. Tsai Ming-Liang's Vive L'Amour: Venice Golden Lion-winning puzzle picture, witty and erotic, about abstracted lives in semi-abstract settings. All this and Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein to open the event. Book now while seats and stamina last.</p>

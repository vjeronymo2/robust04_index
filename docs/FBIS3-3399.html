He added  that the advantages resulting from a place in the international  market by Shanghai and Hong Kong would play an irreplaceable  role for China's economic development.    Mr. Liu said that he believed both places had their own  merits. Shanghai as a financial centre in the Far East since the  1930s has seen a vast annual amount of imports and exports by  reason of its sound geographical location. The municipality now  boasts a strong economic base with many financial professionals.  The 350-sq. kilometre Pudong economic development zone will be  of great economic might with branches of 28 foreign-funded banks  and representative offices of 60 other foreign-funded banks  there at present, ranking the municipality first among the  cities in the country in terms of the number of such  establishments.    Shanghai, however, cannot replace Hong Kong as an  international financial centre in Far East Asia for several  reasons, including, first, the well-established financial system  in Hong Kong which had made it an international financial centre  widely recognized for its sound operation. The territory  possesses a free port, the gathering of professional personnel  in various fields and good investment and geographical location,  while Shanghai cannot develop into a free port in near future.    Second, Shanghai is scheduled to become an international  financial centre by the year 2010. Before that date, the  municipality can only be a domestic financial centre and lag  behind Hong Kong for at least 20 years.    Third, once the municipality becomes an international  financial centre, the Chinese government will have no intention  of replacing Hong Kong with Shanghai nor will it weaken the  territory's function and status. It is recognized that the two  places can at the same time do good to China with their status  in the international financial market.    The Shanghai government, according to Mr. Liu, has called  for  the removal of the headquarters of the Bank of China to the  municipality. He, however, believed that such an idea was  loaded with difficulties, including communications and transport  which are yet to be improved. The idea could, however, be  achieved in two phases involving first the removal of the  international department of the bank to Shanghai and then the  department as well as capital would go to Hong Kong after 1997,  while the headquarters remained in Shanghai. Such a move had  precedents in the international community with Japan, for  example, where many banks have their headquarters in Osaka,  while their international businesses departments remain in Tokyo.</p>

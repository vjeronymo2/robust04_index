			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Float planned for Australian insurer MMI Insurance Group, the Australian general insurer which has links to a number of Japanese and European insurance companies including Germany's Allianz, is coming to the stock market. The New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures, a Australian manufacturing industry trade association, announced yesterday that it plans to float a 55 per cent stake in the business. The shares will be offered at ADollars 3 each, capitalising the insurer at ADollars 330m (USDollars 237m). The NSW chamber says it will retain the remaining 45 per cent interest for at least two years. MMI's current ownership structure dates back 80 years, to its formation in 1914 by the NSW chamber. After taking on business from non-ACM members, MMI moved to Queensland and then became a national operation in the late-1950s. More recently, MMI's business has diversified into property, compulsory third party insurance and motor cover. The company has also been expanding by acquisition; in 1986, it acquired the Australian operations of Germany's Allianz group and in 1988, bought Sirius Insurance, which specialises in the heavy vehicle and equipment insurance area. After-tax profits fell from ADollars 25m to ADollars 18.4m in the year to end-June, after a ADollars 11.6m unrealised loss on investments (ADollars 700,000 loss). The directors now forecast a current-year after-tax profit of ADollars 28.1m. This includes an unrealised investment gain of ADollars 49.3m. This implies that the 60.5m shares are being sold at around 10.9 times prospective earnings. MMI managed total assets of around ADollars 3bn at end-December.</p>

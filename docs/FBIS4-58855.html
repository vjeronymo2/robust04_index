			<p>BFN     [Text] Riyadh, May 7 (AFP) -- Two U.S. planes evacuated 360  foreign nationals, mostly Americans, from Sanaa and flew them  out of Yemen's civil war to safety in Saudi Arabia on Saturday,  diplomatic sources said.    U.S. Embassy staff in the Saudi capital greeted the  evacuees,  also including British, German, Dutch and Egyptian nationals, at  Riyadh airport, the sources said.    The United States said Friday it would evacuate  non-essential  diplomatic personnel from Yemen and advised other U.S. nationals  to leave the country because of the fighting between northern  and southern forces.    In Washington, State Department spokesman Christine Shelly  said the U.S. had issued a travel warning for American citizens  and was making arrangements for those in Yemen to leave.    Officials expect as many as 1,000 of the estimated 5,150  U.S.  nationals in Yemen to leave soon, she added.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Salomon plans market in UK equity options SALOMON Brothers plans to start making markets in UK equity options on Liffe next month, as part of its expansion of its European equity market operations. Salomon will act as an assigned market maker in at least 20 options on the most internationally traded UK stocks, but will not trade FT-SE options. Mr Paul Varcoe has been hired from Swiss Bank Corporation to head a small team of equity options traders. Poor trading volume in UK equity options has failed to revive following the much-vaunted merger of the London Traded Options Market with Liffe last year, but the market has managed to attract a fresh supply of market makers, now numbering eight. Salomon 'intends to add liquidity' to the market, according to Mr Andrew Barret, head of European equity trading.</p>

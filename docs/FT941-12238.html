			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Boost for German machine tools Germany's machine tool industry, one of the key sectors reflecting trends in the country's economy, is showing some sign of growth, the association for German machine tool manufacturers, VDMA, said yesterday, writes Judy Dempsey from Berlin. Foreign orders in December rose by 19 per cent compared with the same period the previous year, although there were few signs that orders from European Union countries and eastern Europe were increasing. The VDMA said that south-east Asia, the US and Latin America accounted for the bulk of the orders. But domestic orders continued to decrease in December, falling by 14 per cent over the same period last year, so that total orders for the month rose by a modest 1 per cent. On a year-to-year basis, total orders in 1993 were down 8 per cent compared with 1992, with domestic orders falling by 15 per cent and foreign orders growing by 1 per cent. Most of the growth in foreign orders was recorded in the second half of 1993, confirming a pick-up in exports.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HOT ON ICE;  </P> <P> COOL GOALIE AND TORRID BLAZERS DOUSE FLAMES IN THE 14TH FIREMEN'S HOCKEY  CHAMPIONSHIP  </P> <P> A longtime firefighter and still, at 44, a hockey goalie, Spence Waldo looms in  both roles as a mysterious heroic figure, masked and helmeted as he faces the  heat.  </P> <P> A member of the Southern California Blazers -- a team of firefighters from Los  Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and San Diego counties -- Waldo guarded the  nets Tuesday night as the Blazers played the San Francisco Flames in their 14th  annual Firemen's Hockey Championship at Iceland Arena in Paramount.  </P> <P> The three-game tournament, which concludes tonight at 7:30, has in the last 10  years raised more than $100,000 for the Canoga Park-based Alisa Ann Ruch  California Burn Foundation, a nonprofit group that offers burn-prevention  education in schools and assists burn victims and their families.  </P> <P> Before joining the Blazers 17 years ago, Waldo had never skated. "But I had a  knack for (playing goal) and I thought it was fun," he said last week at  practice, his forehead sweaty even in the arena's frigid air. "And the guys  would ask me to do it. They said, 'If you play goalie, you don't have to pay  dues.' "  </P> <P> As it's turned out, Waldo, who lives in Lakewood and works at the Long Beach  harbor, has paid his dues anyway. Pucks have left their imprint on various  parts of his body, and, while playing in a tournament in Canada two years ago,  he suffered a torn hamstring and torn knee ligaments. As a firefighter, he's  had only a few pulled muscles and some minor burns.  </P> <P> "Butterflies already," Waldo says an hour before the game Tuesday night. "I  don't know if I can play a whole game, it's so hot."  </P> <P> At 7:30 he goes into the dressing room where his uniform and equipment have  been laid neatly on the floor by his 11-year-old son, Tyde: socks, pants,  skates, gloves, protective cup, pads of various thicknesses, an orange jersey  with 00 on the back and the mask that looked suitable for Halloween.  </P> <P> "Spencer, come on buddy, this is it," defenseman Rich Grimm says to Waldo as  the goalie rubs himself with liniment.  </P> <P> When he has pulled everything on, Waldo stretches. "The gladiator going out to  the coliseum," he says. And then he waddles out the door.  </P> <P> Before a noisy packed crowd that chanted, "L.A., L.A.," in an arena deorated  with "Go Blazers," "Beat Frisco" and beer signs, Waldo spears a hard shot with  his glove on his first save opportunity in the opening period. Then, with the  fast-skating Blazers leading, 1-0, he makes a kneeling save. Just when it  appears he won't get any more action, he is elbowed to the ice by a charging  Tom Alexander of San Francisco, who is called for a penalty. Waldo bounces up  and watches the ensuing power play, on which Gerry O'Hagan scores on a slap  shot to make the score 2-0.  </P> <P> Between periods, while his teammates talk excitedly in the front of the  dressing room, Waldo smokes a cigarette and sits in the rear, alone.  </P> <P> Although Waldo -- also the goalie for the Phantoms and Lancers, amateur teams  in Paramount -- won't be confused with a National Hockey League goalie, his  competitiveness and desire to improve have made him a creditable amateur.  </P> <P> "He's enthusiastic, and enthusiasm means a lot at this level," Art Brewster,  the Blazers' 73-year-old coach, said last week. "You can count on him. He's a  good goalie who doesn't let a game get out of hand. He's got that mental  attitude of a winner. An excellent team man, everybody loves him."  </P> <P> Waldo, without an idea what his goals-against average might be because no one  keeps statistics, has long wondered how he would fare as a professional.  "Everybody dreams of playing at least one game in the pros to see what it's  like," he said. "I go out to a Kings game and sit down by the ice and see that  it's a whole different world. I think I'm all right for our caliber of play but  (NHL goalies) are superhuman. You can't even see the puck, and those guys are  on it."  </P> <P> At the side of the rink during the recent practice, Waldo's family -- wife  Shzelle, sons Tyde and Keane, 7, and daughter Fawna, 3 -- watched their hero.  </P> <P> "I think what he does is fantastic, I'm real proud of him," Shzelle said. She  worries about Waldo getting hurt playing hockey but "not like when he's out on  the job."  </P> <P> Tyde, a hockey player himself, yelled out at his father: "Watch the back door."  </P> <P> "He turns too much and faces the guy who has the puck, and doesn't watch the  back door," the youngster explained.  </P> <P> Having never had formal coaching, Waldo's approach is basic: "I try to figure  out where the puck is going and get in between it (and the goal)."  </P> <P> Goaltending's individuality appeals to Waldo, who also pitches on the  39-and-over firefighter's softball team and placekicks in the annual  firefighter-police football game.  </P> <P> "I do my own thing, and since there are not too many on the team who know what  goaltending is about, they don't yell at me," he said. "You're either a hero or  a goat. You get slapped on the back or ignored."  </P> <P> As Waldo had hoped, his teammates keep the puck at the opposite end of the rink  during most of the second period. But penalties suddenly plague the Blazers and  Mike Domeier of the Flames shoots the puck in the net with 6:54 left. After two  periods, the Blazers' lead is down to 2-1.  </P> <P> "I was screened, I never saw it," Waldo says of the shot while watching the  Zamboni machine smooth the ice for the third period.  </P> <P> On a recent afternoon at the four-man fire station that serves the harbor area,  Capt. Al Chronister described Waldo, a Los Angeles native and a firefighter for  20 years, as "a very quiet man who knows his job and does more than his share."  </P> <P> Off his skates and out of his bulky gear, Waldo looked much smaller, although  he is a firmly built man of nearly six feet and 180 pounds.  </P> <P> Because of his profession and sports participation, he is a double hero to his  children. On fire safety days, he goes to their schools and, in full gear, puts  on demonstrations. "They think it's a big deal, and say, 'That's my dad.' "  Waldo said.  </P> <P> Tyde sometimes spends the night at the fire station, where his father is used  to waking abruptly, jumping into his boots and the rest of his cumbersome  "uniform" and, in seconds, climbing aboard a polished lime-colored truck.  Because the modern building has only one story, there is no pole to slide down.  </P> <P> "It's a good job," Waldo said. "Fires are always exciting, especially if you  can see the flames and smoke while you're driving up. Every day there is  something different. When you see all the stuff out there, all the tragedies,  you learn how to put it in perspective. You don't forget it but you don't dwell  on it. You get shook up seeing something (happen to a) kid; that really gets to  you."  </P> <P> And he recalled a time when he gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a baby in a  police car en route to a hospital. But the baby, who had strangled on a toy,  could not be revived. "I thought he was coming back,"  </P> <P> He thinks more about pressure when he's in goal than when he's on the job. "In  firefighting you don't think about it, you're trained to do it," he said. "You  have a captain and a chief, they point and you go. You don't think about it  until afterward. In the (hockey) tournament there's pressure because of the  people. It's the biggest crowd anyone has played before."  </P> <P> With 13:04 left in the game, Rick Moreno scores to give the Blazers a 3-1 lead.  As three Flames bear down on him, their skates squawking, Waldo stands his  ground and kicks away the shot. With 2:49 left, Aldo Bevilacqua scores a final  Southern California goal.  </P> <P> The Blazers win, 4-1. In the tradition of hockey, they skate to the goal and  congratulate Waldo.  </P> <P> Though he was not under heavy pressure most of the game, he has done what he  had to, and is a hero.  </P> <P> He congratulates the Flames, then skates to the side of the rink and says to  Shzelle, "This one's for you, hon."  </P></p>

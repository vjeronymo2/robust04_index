			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> 'CALVIN' CREATOR WON'T SELL OUT  </P> <P> The creator of the syndicated comic strip "Calvin and Hobbes" is resisting the  riches that would come his way from marketing his characters. William Watterson  II, speaking at Sunday's commencement at his alma mater, Kenyon College, says  he doesn't want to commercialize them, despite the wishes of Universal Press  Syndicate to turn them into "TV hucksters."  </P> <P> "We've been fighting for over three years now," said Watterson, a 1980 graduate  of Kenyon.  </P> <P> Watterson would stand to make a mint if his Calvin, the sage 6-year-old, and  his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, were turned into toys, but he says artistic  principle comes before commercialization. "Sooner or later, we are all asked to  compromise ourselves and the things we care about," he told the graduates.  "There are no good ways to sell yourself out."  </P></p>

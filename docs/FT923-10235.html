			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (5) A long wait for better times - Sheffield's recovery has been delayed THESE ARE frustrating times for Sheffield. It was battered in the last recession, boosted in the late 1980s and the city is now waiting, edgily, for its promised new dawn. It seems a long time coming. This should have been when all the effort ploughed into public/private sector partnership and derelict land reclamation in recent years, coupled with heavy investment in important new sporting and retail facilities, combined to produce dramatic growth in the city's economy. Instead, the recession has put on the brakes, leaving Sheffield with a patchwork of smart new developments alongside vacant sites and blighted properties awaiting better times. Mr John Hambidge, chief executive of the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce, sums it up: 'While we thought we were on the launchpad we've been hit by a national recession and national lack of confidence. The property collapse came at just the wrong time for us.' The picture is not all gloom. The chamber's export documentation section is working flat out to cope with a 15 per cent increase in work compared with last year. Mr Hambidge says that Sheffield businesses which survived the last manufacturing recession, which hit the city so hard, have learned lessons and those with strong export and niche markets are even doing well. He observes, however, that nowhere can insulate itself from a national recession. And while the picture is more mixed in Sheffield than in some more southerly parts of Britain, recession is biting, at least in the short-term. According to the city council's latest quarterly Economic Bulletin, the increase in Sheffield's unemployment, currently 11.2 per cent, flattened out in the first months of 1992, against the national trend, but looks likely to rise over the coming months. After losing 40,000 net jobs between 1981 and 1987, Sheffield gained 13,300 between 1987 and 1989, bringing its employment up to 233,400. But the council estimates that there has been a net loss of 3,000 jobs in the past two years. It reckons that 24.4 per cent of Sheffield's jobs now are in manufacturing - 2.6 per cent down on 1989, with the service sector up from 65 per cent to 68.8 per cent. The bulletin says that development starts and approvals in the city have hit all-time lows, although developer interest remains relatively healthy. The high degree of local ownership of companies and strong exporting activity are helping to protect Sheffield's manufacturing sector. Furthermore - again contrary to the national trend - its finance sector looks set for jobs growth. This is mainly thanks to Norwich Union's choice of Sheffield for its northern headquarters, and Abbey National's decision to locate a new 200-job share dealing base at the new Carbrook Hall Business park in the Lower Don Valley. The arrival of Norwich Union, which is now upgrading a listed building in the city for its 900-job first phase), is highly significant, says Mr Rod Jones, city council director of land and planning. 'It's crucial to the city because it's blue chip.' But this project, too, is not immune to recession; because of cuts elsewhere, more Norwich Union staff are likely to transfer to Sheffield, meaning fewer job opportunities for locals. The Sheffield Development Corporation (SDC), formed in 1988 to regenerate 2,000 acres of the Lower Don Valley, Sheffield's traditional steel industry heartland, and create 20,000 new jobs, says the recession has produced a 'definite slowdown', but it is pressing ahead with land reclamation and site marketing. So far, says the SDC, Pounds 484m of private sector investment has come into its area: Stadium Developments' Pounds 400m Meadowhall complex, one of Europe's biggest retail schemes; British Steel's trade centre; a massive warehouse, and the Carbrook Hall business park. In addition, work is about to start on the prominently sited Pounds 70m Canal Basin redevelopment. At Meadowhall, a Retail Park is to open shortly; anchor tenants include Toys R US. 'We tend to be slightly schizoid about Meadowhall,' Mr Hambidge admits. This is hardly surprising, when Sheffield city centre retailers report drops in their takings, since it opened, of between 4 per cent and 25 per cent. Consultants are about to report on the city centre's current state and how it can attract investors. Disappointingly for all concerned, Sheffield failed in its City Challenge bid this month - the city had hoped it would revitalise development of the blighted shopping and markets area around the Haymarket. The city centre may also face problems from Sheffield's new, partly government-funded Pounds 240m Supertram; although its first phase, to operate from late 1993, could bring shoppers in from Meadowhall it may equally take them there from the city centre. Better transport links are an important theme in the city's regeneration plans. Work starts at the end of the year on the SDC's spine road through the Lower Don Valley and negotiations are under way with airline operators over routes to be offered from the proposed airport on the Sheffield/Rotherham boundary, on a site currently being opencasted for coal. Recently, Sheffield city council has suffered bad press because of financial problems; it has to find savings of Pounds 13m this year and could face cuts of Pounds 40m in 1993-1994. Leader Mr Mike Bower says it will sell property, including investment opportunities, to raise money. But cuts and redundancies look likely. The council's financial problems reach back at least to the mid-1980s but were compounded by its decision to host last summer's world student games, which entailed capital expenditure of nearly Pounds 150m and left behind not only outstanding sporting facilities but a Pounds 10.5m operating loss. The games were intended to gild Sheffield's image; the losses have done the reverse. Yet while thinking so big in the cause of image improvement, the council could perhaps help itself in more modest ways. Weeds grow high on the traffic island which serves the city's central shopping area. While the council has worked hard to create a 'cultural industries quarter', with about Pounds 10m invested so far, it is publicising this to passing motorists with a sign on a tatty building - as yet unimproved, but prominently located - which is daubed with flyposters for Megadeath's 'Symphony of Destruction' and Def Leppard's 'Seven Day Weekend Tour'. Mr Hambidge, a director of the company which controls the new sports facilities, says they are pulling in top events and capacity audiences as hoped. But he says the swimming facilities and stadium are not expected to run at a profit; the arena, it is hoped, will generate enough profit to cover their deficits as well as contributing to capital costs. To the east, in Doncaster, Kyle Stewart Properties has begun work on a 65-acre site owned by Doncaster borough council, adjacent to British Rail's main east coast line. One mile from the M18, it is alongside one of BR's three UK Train Operating Centres, intended as freight marshalling points for Channel Tunnel traffic. Doncaster council sees the 'Direct for Europe' project as a means of capturing not only international freight handlers and warehousing businesses, but also manufacturing companies operating Just In Time delivery systems. The council envisages a branch line leading from the site to BR's marshalling sidings. But BR has chosen Wakefield for its Channel Tunnel railport; it is still awaiting the result of a public inquiry about its site. 'We believe the private sector will choose,' says a Doncaster council spokesman. For the council, the project would build on the town's long history as a communications crossroads, a traditional confirmed by BMW's opening this year of its new UK distribution centre at Doncaster. Over in Rotherham, where tradition was rooted in coal and steel, a council official admits - with refreshing candour - that there is little new to report. He reminisces about the postwar heyday, when 20,000 people, five times today's total, worked in coal and steel in Rotherham. 'The employers were interviewed by the potential employees in those days,' he says wistfully. It seems a very long time ago.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 76ERS ACQUIRE 7-7 BOL FROM GOLDEN STATE;  </P> <P> NBA: PHILADELPHIA SENDS A DRAFT CHOICE TO GOLDEN STATE FOR THE CENTER. IN  ANOTHER DEAL, NUGGETS SEND SCHAYES TO BUCKS FOR ROOKIE FORWARD MILLS.  </P> <P> The Philadelphia 76ers today acquired 7-7 shot-blocking center Manute Bol from  Golden State for a 1991 first-round pick in the NBA draft.  </P> <P> In another trade, the Milwaukee Bucks today sent their first-round draft pick,  forward Terry Mills, to the Denver Nuggets for veteran center Danny Schayes.  </P> <P> "Manute Bol is the premiere shot-blocker in the NBA today," said Harold Katz,  76ers owner. "It is obvious to us that our biggest need last year was clogging  the middle. We feel there is nobody in the game today that can do it better."  </P> <P> The 225-pound Bol, 27, has been in the NBA five seasons, three with the  Washington Bullets and two with Golden State. He played in 75 games last season  with the Warriors and was the fourth-leading shot-blocker in the league with  238, or 3.17 per game. He averaged only 1.9 points per game.  </P> <P> Bol's acquisition is the latest in the Sixers' moves to bolster their inside  game, which suffered after the club traded center Moses Malone in 1986.  Philadelphia last season acquired power forward Rick Mahorn, a move that helped  them to the NBA Atlantic Division championship.  </P> <P> Bol likely will be a backup to center Mike Gminski.  </P> <P> Bol has blocked 300 or more shots in three seasons, including a career-high 397  his rookie year to lead the league, and a league-leading 345 in the 1988-89  season.  </P> <P> His career shooting averages are 57.1% from the free-throw line and 42.5% from  the field.  </P> <P> The Bucks had announced their intention to trade the 6-10 Mills right after  making him 16th pick in the June draft. But the team had to wait for the  league's salary cap to expand today before it could fit Schayes onto the  roster.  </P> <P> "Danny's rugged style of play will aide us tremendously in the physical Eastern  Conference," Milwaukee Coach Del Harris said. "Our staff identified our No. 1  need to be the acquisition of another center to relieve Jack Sikma of excessive  minutes."  </P> <P> Mills averaged 18.1 points and eight rebounds last season at Michigan. Schayes,  a first-round draft pick of the Utah Jazz in 1981, has spent the last 7 1/2  seasons with the Nuggets. He averaged 10.4 points and 6.5 rebounds for Denver  last season.  </P></p>

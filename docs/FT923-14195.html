			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / French government report levels criticisms at Volvo VOLVO, the Swedish partner of Renault, the French carmaker, yesterday came under fire in a French government-commissioned report, a summary of which was leaked by a Renault union official. The study, by SRI International, a Californian technical consultancy, criticises Volvo's car division for losing market share in the US; for having out of date plants; for inefficiently managing its modern facilities; and also for failing fully to adapt just-in-time stock control methods. Renault said that the report was only a working document and that it reflected neither its opinion nor that of Volvo. The study was commissioned by Mrs Edith Cresson, the former prime minister, who was critical of the Volvo alliance and was anxious at the Swedish carmaker's joint venture with Mitsubishi Motors, the Japanese car group, in the Netherlands. However, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, who succeeded Mr Cresson, is content to let Renault and Volvo deepen their alliance. The two-year-old partnership has led to substantial savings for both sides, through sharing important components and the economies of scale achieved by joint purchasing. The partners have spoken of a possible merger. The SRI study says that Renault faces 'major risks' in deepening its alliance with Volvo. It warns Renault not to underestimate the changes needed in Volvo's product range and production lines, the human resources required to bring these changes about, and the fast response that Volvo has to make to the collapse of the US market. The study also estimates that Volvo will make an operating loss of between SKr995m (Pounds 95m) and SKr1.3bn this year, after last year's SK1.16bn operating loss. The study admires Volvo's quality image and its distribution networks, but warns that the safety and dependability of its vehicles are becoming standard qualities in the car industry. Volvo needs three models to keep its distributors going, but only has the means to develop one, the study claims. The document may fuel French union discontent. 'There is a real danger in pursuing this accord,' claimed Mr Gerard Muteau, an official from the Communist-led CGT and Renault administrative board member, who released the summary.</p>

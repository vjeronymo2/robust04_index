			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / People: Manchester Airport picks internal candidate After a Pounds 40,000 trawl round the world by headhunters and a starting list of 160 potential candidates, Manchester Airport has given the job of chief executive to Geoff Muirhead, the internal candidate. He will succeed Sir Gilbert Thompson, the man who spearheaded the airport's explosive recent growth, who is retiring. Muirhead, 43, is a civil engineer and currently the airport's director of development. He was in charge of the new Terminal Two, which was delivered on time and opened in March. With Manchester the fastest growing airport in Europe and now approaching a throughput of 15m passengers a year, the job is regarded as one of the best in the aviation sector. It is also crucial to northern England, where the airport is proving an important economic generator. Muirhead emerged from a short list of three; the other contenders were Stephen Poster, managing director of Granada's motorway services chain and hospitality division, and Rod Hoare, managing director of British Airways regional operations. Poster is understood to have been first choice for the Pounds 114,000-a-year job, despite his lack of airline or aviation services management, but turned it down.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The agreement between the Japanese and U.S.  Governments on a new framework for the exchange of defense  technology shows that interchangeability between civilian and  military technology has become a crucial issue in the area of  defense following the disintegration of the Cold War structure.    Senior leaders of the U.S. Defense Department, including  Secretary of Defense William Perry, show keen interest in the  proven high level of Japanese civilian technology. They have  been approaching Japan on this for some time. For the United  States, which now hopes to promote interchangeability between  civilian and military technology to strengthen its defense  industry, while simultaneously reducing the defense budget, the  introduction of Japanese civilian technology is necessary.    For Japan, maintenance of the Japan-U.S. security setup is  an  "irrevocable theme" (according to a senior Defense Agency  official). As bilateral relations are constantly plagued by  trade frictions, Japan's agreement to this new framework on  defense technology, which was demanded by the United States,  represented an "opportune occasion" for upholding close  cooperation in security and defense. Thus, both countries'  interests coincided.    However, the present agreement will mostly result in a  technological transfer from Japan to the United States. There  are concerns that "This may result in the United States alone  walking away with the benefits."    The utilization of civilian technology and exchanges with  the  United States are also top priority issues for Japanese  defense-related industries. These industries mainly look at the  agreement as a framework for "joint development with both sides  contributing the technology they possess." There are lingering  concerns about a one-sided flow of technology to the United  States.</p>

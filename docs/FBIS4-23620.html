			<p>BFN     [Text] The latest government offer on the participation of  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  in the country's government is final and nonnegotiable, Joao  Lourenco, information secretary of the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola [MPLA], said today. He was reacting to  UNITA's position accepting the government's offer in general,  while insisting on governing Huambo Province.    [Begin Lourenco recording] Our latest offer is final and  nonnegotiable. Our offer to UNITA is in accordance with the  proposal of the observers in the peace process. We offered  UNITA the post of deputy governor of Huambo Province. This  offer is nonnegotiable. As a matter of fact, the issue of  UNITA's participation in the country's government has already  been concluded. It is no longer being discussed. It is not on  the negotiating table. On 13 June the two delegations will  begin discussions on modalities to implement the extension of  state administration throughout the national territory. [end  recording]    Joao Lourenco decided not to make any predictions on the  peace talks between the government and UNITA under way in Lusaka.    [Begin Lourenco recording] It is difficult to make any  predictions because there are still issues to discuss; there are  pending issues on the negotiating table. We do not know how  long it will take to discuss them. Discussions on the extension  of state administration could be difficult or easy. The  principle is that the state authority should be extended  throughout the national territory, from Cabinda to Cunene  Provinces. We are going to see what UNITA's reaction will be --  whether or not it will show resistance. It is therefore  extremely difficult to predict how the discussions will evolve.  [end recording]</p>

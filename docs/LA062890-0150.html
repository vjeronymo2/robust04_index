			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLYING DISC CHAMPIONSHIPS TO END SUNDAY IN LA MIRADA  </P> <P> Self-caught flight and double disc court competition are the two main events  scheduled today in the fifth day of the 17th annual U.S. Open Flying Disc  Championships.  </P> <P> An estimated 20,000 spectators are expected to attend the weeklong competition  that began June 24 and will end Sunday. All of the events are free, and most  are at La Mirada Regional Park, 15501 Alicante Road.  </P> <P> The outdoor championships will include disc golf, disc-a-thon, freestyle,  distance competition, double disc court, self-caught flight, accuracy and  throw-run-catch competitions, Frisbee-catching dogs and Ultimate and Guts game  demonstrations.  </P> <P> In the self-caught flight event, a player has to catch his own disc with one  hand. Scoring is based on how long the disc is airborne. The double disc court  event involves two teams of two players each with two discs in play. The goal  is to get both discs in the opponents' court at the same time. It is played on  grass courts 13 meters square and 17 meters apart.  </P> <P> Each day's activities start at 8 a.m., but today's two events have gotten so  big that they cannot be contained in La Mirada Regional Park, sponsors said.  They are being held at Imperial Field, Imperial Highway and Idaho Street, La  Habra.  </P> <P> Two popular spectator events on the final day Sunday will be the Big Throw and  Frisbee-catching dogs. In the Big Throw at 12:30 p.m., all spectators in a  large grassy area will be asked to throw their own discs simultaneously in an  attempt to break the Guinness world record of 1,903 discs in the air at one  time.  </P> <P> The finals of the Frisbee-catching dog event, beginning at 1 p.m. Sunday, will  involve the top four or five teams, based on eliminations earlier in the week.  Most competitors do a four- or five-minute routine to music.  </P> <P> Event sponsors encourage spectators to bring video cameras in the hope that  some of the unusual competitions will be recorded for submission to "America's  Funniest Home Videos" television show. All entries will be reviewed and  eligible for a $10,000 grand prize.  </P></p>

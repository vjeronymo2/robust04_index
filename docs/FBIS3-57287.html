			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F> Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and  others]    [Text] A concrete date for the possible meeting between  Azeri President Gaydar Aliyev and his Armenian counterpart Levon  Ter-Petrosyan in Moscow has not been fixed yet, the special  envoy of President Yeltsin, Vladimir Kazimirov, who leads  Russia's mission for settling the conflict in Karabakh, told  INTERFAX on Monday [24 January].    "Meetings on such a level should be prepared very  carefully,"  he pointed out. "It's premature to mention concrete dates  before concluding preparations that would ensure success for the  proposed summit," he said.    According to Kazimirov, Russian mediators intend to continue  the work they are conducting "in the three major points of the  conflict" -- Baku, Yerevan, and Stepanakert, as well as in  Moscow. "As long as we are at this stage, I am not in a  position to say when this work can be raised to a higher level,"  the diplomat said.    The meetings held in Moscow recently by Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev with his Azeri and Armenian counterparts  Gasan Gasanov and Vagan Papazian, as well as with a spokesman  for the leadership of Nagorno-Karabakh, Arkadiy Gukasyan, showed  that "the stands taken by the conflicting sides drew somewhat  closer," he noted.    Nevertheless, the talks were "rather complicated," Kazimirov  said. "We are dealing with one of the fiercest and longest  conflicts in the territory of the former USSR. Therefore it  would be naive to believe that the entire knot of problems will  be untangled to the satisfaction of all the parties concerned  overnight. We proceed from the assumption that a settlement  will be gradual, that it will consist of searches for  compromises on virtually all points," the diplomat said.</p>

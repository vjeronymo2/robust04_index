			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Paris France-Inter Radio Network in  French at 0720 GMT on 10 January, in its "Questions by A Plus B"  program, broadcasts a nine-minute interview with Alain  Lamassoure, minister of European affairs, by correspondent  Annette Ardisson. The interview begins with a discussion of  calls made yesterday for air strikes in Bosnia. Lamassoure  recalls that French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and his German  counterpart Klaus Kinkel put forward the EU [European Union]  peace plan in November, and that it is France which is imposing  the subject of Yugoslavia on the NATO summit.    Lamassoure says: "The time has come to make everyone face up  to their responsibilities -- the three Bosnian sides -- it is  all too clear today that none of them really want peace -- and  also all the important Western countries who belong to the  international community, in such a way that each one should say  whether they are ready to do something for peace, and what they  are ready to do."    Annette Ardisson then says: "But the peace plan you are  referring to -- and we'll come back to it -- is a diplomatic  plan. I am talking about military action, supposing that the  Americans are ready to take part in air raids. This isn't very  clear yet. We have been told since the beginning that this is  impossible as long as the UN forces, and in particular our UN  forces, are in Sarajevo, because they could become targets. So  either we were being lied to before, or else we are ready to  sacrifice them today."    Lamassoure replies: "The French minister wrote to his  counterparts expressing hope that the NATO meeting will be a  chance for all the participants, in particular the Americans, to  approve three things, both political and military, as you said.    "First, the Americans have to recognize the validity of the  European peace plan, which, rather paradoxically, they haven't  formally done up to now.    "Second, to get the Americans to say that they are ready,  directly, or through NATO, to take part in implementing the  peace plan as soon as it has been accepted by the three Bosnian  parties. Then there will be a need for several tens of thousands  of men on the basis that the peace plan is being applied, that  the military forces on the ground, the militias, should withdraw  and disarm, and here too we need a formal American commitment.    "Finally, we want the Americans to say in a more solemn  manner, that they are ready to deploy the means needed to apply  what is being called UN Resolution No. 836, which provides for  the possibility of military action by UNPROFOR with air cover,  should humanitarian convoys be held up by armed forces or should  the so-called security zones, such as the city of Sarajevo, be  subjected to shelling."    He goes on to elaborate on this, following which Ardisson  says:    "I repeat my question: Is France ready now, given the  current  positions of each side, for there to be air strikes around  Sarajevo on Serb positions?"    Lamassoure replies: "The French minister of foreign affairs  said more than a month ago that France was ready to support the  request by UNPROFOR should it deem such a thing necessary." He  repeats that agreement on the modalities was reached several  months ago. The UN secretary general and NATO must make the  decision to carry it out, he says.    They go on to discuss the partition plan for Bosnia, which  Lamassoure reluctantly supports. "At this NATO summit," he  says, "we, Europeans and Americans together, are applying as  much pressure as possible, to see that the sides should take the  final step we are expecting from them. And we are speaking to  each one. We are telling the Serbs: If you go on shelling  Sarajevo, you can expect air strikes. We are telling the  Croats: If, in turn, you behave like aggressors, you will suffer  sanctions of the kind we have been applying against the Serbs  for several months. And we are telling the Muslims: If you  don't want peace either, watch out, because our patience has its  limits."    Ardisson then asks him what he thinks about the possibility  of European action in general without the United States.  Lamassoure says it is time to reconsider the sharing out of  roles in the defense of America. Europe still needs the  Americans, he says, because there are still threats there. But  for many of the crises, the Europeans should do without U.S.  leadership.    Lamoussoure concludes the interview by saying that he  expects  to see an agreement between the Atlantic alliance and the WEU.</p>

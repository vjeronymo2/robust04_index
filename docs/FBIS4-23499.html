			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] On 6 June 1994, delegations of the Italian  Government and UNICEF were in Mulindi, Byumba Prefecture, where  they held talks with representatives of the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF]. [passage omitted]    The talks ended with the donation of a large amount of money  which Italy intends to offer to Rwanda. According to agreements  reached with the RPF, the money will be used for assisting  refugees and war-displaced people, particularly in the areas of  nutrition, health care, and assistance to the orphan population  caused by the massacres.</p>

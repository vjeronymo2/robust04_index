			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (4): Group A - Romania Only one eastern European club has won the European Cup, Romania's Steaua Bucharest in 1986, and of that region's three representatives in the World Cup, Russia, Bulgaria and Romania, the latter is the most likely to make an impact in America. Romanian footballers are fiery and temperamental but above all they have a flair and skill that will - make them hard to beat. Gheorghe Hagi, the Maradona of the Carpathians', is the most skilful footballer to have come out of the country. He is the creative influence of the side but has a questionable temperament and can be a destructive influence on the side. The 1990 World Cup was a showcase for Romanian footballers in their attempts to find a way out of the country. Ile Dumitrescu will want to use USA 94 the same way. He is Steaua's top forward, but the club can no longer hang on to players of his class. As the club scene has declined, more attention has been focused on the national team. Anghel Iordanescu's side has plenty of promise and a strong backbone of experienced players. In attack, Dumitrescu will be partnered by Milan's forgotten forward Florin Radiucioiu. In midfield Hagi will be partnered by his Brescia team mate Ioan Sabau. The Romanians should have no trouble qualifying from this group and, given the right draw in the second round, could go further. It all depends on their attitude. If Hagi is on song it will take a good team to beat them.</p>

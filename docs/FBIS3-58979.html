French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said after meeting  Christopher it was important to implement NATO decisions when  Tuzla and Srebrenica were concerned.    It is difficult to conclude from the two statements whether  Paris and Washington had agreed over what Washington described  as the insufficiently clarified diplomatic initiative launched  by Paris to help resolve the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    At the recent NATO summit in Brussels, France was the  staunchest advocator of the use of air power against Bosnian  Serbs for their alleged refusal to reopen the local airport in  Tuzla, the Moslem enclave in northeastern Bosnia, and allow the  replacement of Canadian U.N. troops in another Moslem enclave,  Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Bosnian Serbs have reached agreement with the U.N. Bosnia  command to allow Dutch peacekeepers to replace the Canadians in  Srebrenica in early February, but rejected to reopen the airport  in Tuzla before a general peace accord has been signed, fearing  that the facility may be used for arms shipment to Bosnian  Moslems.</p>

However, Moscow would then  sacrifice its partnership with NATO countries, lose initiative  in military cooperation and remain an outsider to European  processes. A high ranking official from the Russian Defence  Ministry expressed this opinion to Interfax Monday.    He said the Russian leadership views the program as an  intermediate stage in forming a new collective security system  in Europe. He stressed that at the moment NATO is changing its  policy of deterrence through intimidation towards Russia to  deterrence through cooperation.    The official said that if Moscow joins the program it is  going to press for a status in line with its significance in the  world. The fact that Russia is a Eurasian nation should also be  taken into account, making the CIS collective security treaty  the most important matter.    He also named the main purposes of Russian participation in  the program:    1. Active involvement in the formation of the new European  collective security system based on equal rights and  responsibilities of members.    2. The formation of an effective mechanism for preventing  wars and conflicts that could serve as a prototype for the  military structure of future European security.    3. The official recognition by NATO partners of the special  responsibility of Russia for maintaining peace in the CIS.    4. The spreading of confidence-building measures to the  military-technical sphere with the purpose of halting any new  spirals of the arms race, a well-considered strategy of  conversion.    The official told Interfax that none of the political or  military leaders are thinking of Russian integration in NATO  military structures. "We believe in the need for cooperation and  interaction with the alliance in the interests of peace and the  security of Europe and Russia", he said.</p>

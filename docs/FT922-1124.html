			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Kohl seen as key to Gatt breakthrough EUROPEAN trade negotiators were in intensive telephone contact yesterday, seeking a compromise that will allow the long-blocked Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation to be settled before the Group of Seven summit in Munich, now two weeks away. 'I think there is a deal there,' one official said. 'It would be catastrophic if it does not succeed.' Negotiators agreed that the position of Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl was crucial. Meanwhile, international business leaders last night met Mr Kohl in Bonn to protest that the credibility of the G7 industrial nations had been stretched to the limit by its repeated empty commitments to settle the Uruguay Round - and could be stretched no further. Representatives of the International Chambers of Commerce (ICC), who met the German leader, insisted that a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round was 'crucial and urgent'. 'Nowhere has the inadequacy of political leadership (in the G7) been more evident in recent years than in the Uruguay Round,' they said. The Uruguay Round has been stalled for 18 months by a dispute between the US and the European Community on liberalisation of farm trade. Leaders at two previous G7 summits have called for settlement of the Round, but without effect. Negotiators in several European capitals said yesterday that intensive efforts were under way to formulate proposals that could be presented to the US, perhaps next week. Mr James Baker, the US Secretary of State, is understood to be ready to meet Community foreign ministers. Two issues continue to block agreement. First is an EC demand - backed strongly by Bonn - that compensation to be paid to farmers for cutting output and setting land aside should be accepted by the US as not distorting to trade. The German government is being pressed to compromise here. The second is the Uruguay Round proposal that the volume of subsidised exports be cut by 24 per cent. The EC's preferred compromise is that the Community should be allowed flexibility to cut the volume of subsidised cereal exports more deeply than 24 per cent, in order that more sensitive subsidised exports - in particular meat and dairy products - could be cut less deeply.</p>

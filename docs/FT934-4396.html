			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Treuhand is to shift borrowing to longer term Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency will shift its borrowing to longer-term instruments because of lower interest rates, Mr Heinrich Hornef, a member of the board said yesterday. The Treuhand, which was set up in 1990 to privatise and restructure eastern German industry, will have a deficit of DM216bn by the end of 1994, and will have a total accumulated debt of DM275bn. At the same time, the net borrowing requirement for the Treuhand will total DM44bn for 1994, of which DM38bn will be earmarked for running costs. The remaining DM6bn will be used to service the interest from the Krediabwicklungsfond, the government-backed fund set up to cover the debt of the former east Germany. The DM44bn will be raised through bonds and medium-term notes. But Treuhand officials said the agency would focus on longer-term financing because of the gradual fall in Germany's interest rates. By the end of 1993, the agency will have borrowed a total of DM133bn through bonds and Treuhand obligations, or medium-term issues. The agency has a net borrowing requirement of DM44bn in 1994, and on top of this it has DM39bn of old debt, which is due to be paid back, and will be restructured. The agency is due to be dissolved late next year, after it had privatised more than 12,000 of enterprises placed under its control. By October, the agency had 1,392 enterprises on its books. It had obtained DM181.6bn of investment commitments, earned DM44.3bn in sales, and secured 1.48m job guarantees. However, these investment and employment commitments are not indefinite. Many are spread out over a maximum of five years. To monitor the implementation of these contracts, the Treuhand has set up a special contracts department which will not be wound up until the contracts expire. However, the agency will be still be saddled with about 500 enterprises. Some have already been placed in Management KGs - enterprises which the Treuhand will pass on to west German managers for restructuring and preparation for privatisation. The agency has allocated more than DM17.3bn for this purpose. Apart from the Management KGs, the Treuhand will be left with some of the most difficult enterprises to restructure and privatise. These include Deutsche Waggonbau, the rail carriage manufacturers, Sket, the large machine tool complex, and the chemical sectors of Leuna and Buna. Beyond that, the agency will invest DM4.3bn in eastern Germany's chemical sector, which has yet to be privatised. It will also earmark a further DM5.4bn for environmental clean up and land reclamation of chemical and brown coal mines which have been closed. Mr Hornef said he expected the agency to earn about DM11bn from privatisation sales next year, which include selling off Veag, eastern Germany's largest utility company.</p>

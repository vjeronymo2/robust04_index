			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ROUGE': A SUPERNATURAL FABLE FILLED WITH ROMANTIC VISIONS  </P> <P> Stanley Kwan's "Rouge" (Nuart) is an exquisite supernatural fable, an opium  dream of a movie that re-creates glamorous Hong Kong of the '30s and then plays  it against the city's teeming, workaday present to illuminate and contrast the  changing relationships between men and women there.  </P> <P> The story focuses on the ravishing Fleur (Anita Mui), whom we first meet in  1933 in a luxurious Hong Kong brothel then see again in 1987, inexplicably not  looking a day older and apparently searching for a long-lost lover. The film  turns upon the old Chinese belief that a day in the spiritual world is roughly  equivalent to 50 years on earth.  </P> <P> Kwan and writer Lee Pik Wah have created a story that both laments the loss of  romance of the old ways, but also respects the easy give-and-take between the  sexes that exists in Hong Kong today.  </P> <P> The film's key setting is that brothel, a sex palace with balconies lined with  beautiful young women and decorated with jade screens and the finest Venetian  mirrors. There, we meet Fleur, who has fallen in love with a weak-willed 12th  Master (Leslie Cheung), a man more interested in pursuing a career in the opera  than taking over his family's herbal medicine business.  </P> <P> As Fleur and the Master embrace, in an old-movie style close-up, Kwan pans to  the glittering skyline of 1987 Hong Kong and in that moment we are whisked more  than a half-century forward to a scene where the still-youthful Fleur, dressed  in the traditional cheongsam, enters a newspaper office to place a notice in  the personals column.  </P> <P> From this point on, Kwan shifts between past and present with ever-increasing  meaning and poignance -- and with an ironic surprise involving Fleur's mission.  As Kwan gracefully ranges between locales as colorful as the backstage of a  Chinese opera to a busy present-day movie set, he protests the folly of women  who out of ingrained custom sacrifice themselves for men -- especially those  unworthy of them in the first place.  </P></p>

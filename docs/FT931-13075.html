			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Keep the scissors out - Cutting red tape UK Prime Minister John Major is stepping up his campaign to reduce red tape with the announcement of a cabinet seminar next week, to force ministers to produce plans for action. But as the company featured here illustrates, well-intentioned bureaucrats have planted a fearsome thicket of regulation around business. The Growing Business Page will highlight over the next few months businesses entrapped by red tape. It will award a bottle of Laurent-Perrier pink champagne to each one featured. The owner-managers of independent businesses are invited to describe their experiences - on no more than two sides of A4 please. Letters should be addressed to Charles Batchelor, Growing Business Correspondent, Financial Times, Number One, Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL. AFTER 22 years in business, Bud Ellis, managing director of Flexi-pak - a manufacturer of individual portions of jams and sauces - decided to take out liability insurance for himself and his two fellow directors. The growing weight of legislation affecting companies, particularly those in the food sector, and the penalties attached, persuaded Ellis, reluctantly, to act. He is now resigned to paying an annual premium of Pounds 2,625 to cover himself, his wife Ann, and sales director James Puttick. 'I came back after Christmas and decided that we had to bite the bullet,' says Ellis. 'We are very insurance-minded but this was a chink in our armour. We will have to sell a lot of extra sauce and jam to cover the extra overhead.' Taken in isolation, an insurance premium of Pounds 2,500 is not a large sum even for a company the size of Flexi-pak. The New Milton, Hampshire-based business has sales of Pounds 1.3m and employs 12 people, including the three directors. But it comes on top of a growing raft of other burdens which absorb time and money. New waste control legislation (designed to reduce fly-tipping), which came into effect last April, means Ellis has had to fill in a form from the company which removes his refuse describing what sort of waste his company produces. This legislation simply involved Ellis in filling in a few boxes on a form, but the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health legislation has involved much more work. Ann Ellis, who deals with most of the red tape, says the directors had assumed COSHH applied only to the products they package. But while she was talking to the environmental health officer about another matter the conversation turned to COSHH. 'He picked up a bottle of Tipp-Ex corrector fluid and said that if we used it we were covered by the legislation.' This has led to Ann Ellis compiling a list of 35 potentially harmful products, their contents, application, manufacturer's reference number and possible effects. The products involved include a spray glue, marker pens, Jif cleaner, Brillo pads, disinfectants, de-icer, paints and methylated spirits. In some instances Ellis had to write to the manufacturer to obtain the information needed for her files. 'This is an insult to our intelligence,' says Bud Ellis. The Food Safety Act, which came into force in January 1991, does apply to the products Flexi-pak makes. To comply the company has drawn up a detailed product specification and a description of the procedures the company follows to maintain food hygiene. The Worcester Sauce entry runs to three pages. 'We have spent hours on this,' says Bud Ellis. 'Customers we have dealt with for years have been on to us for extra information. I am not saying we should not do this but it all leads to extra work.' Extra work - and cost - are also involved in the Electricity at Work regulations. This requires businesses to maintain electrical equipment and wiring in a safe condition. Ellis has asked his electrician to produce a register of electrical equipment and to carry out annual inspections. But he is not convinced of the need. 'We have had no problems with our electrical equipment in 22 years,' he says. Ann Ellis's bulging files have recently been joined by a packet of leaflets on the changes to the VAT rules brought about by the creation of the single European market. Under the rules Flexi-pak will be responsible for collating its own VAT data and filing trade information to Customs &amp; Excise. Because the company imports more than Pounds 135,000 in goods, it will be required to fill out a more detailed monthly form. Administering the VAT system has already caught the company out once. The company reclaimed VAT twice on the same invoice of nearly Pounds 4,000. This error happened when it was moving its records from one computer to another but was picked up during a VAT audit 18 months later. Last July Customs imposed a serious misdeclaration penalty which, with interest charges, amounted to Pounds 1,000. Bud Ellis says the double claim was a genuine mistake, the first significant VAT error the company had made, and feels Customs' response labelled him and his fellow directors criminals. Resentment of the serious misdeclaration penalty is widespread and pressure from business has led to a reduction in the severity of penalties and review of its workings. The continual accretion of new legislation and the growing number of laws which can lead to directors facing criminal charges is a source of considerable concern to many small businesses. 'Government is pillorying responsible people instead of getting to grips with the real criminals,' comments Bud Ellis. 'We are the soft touch.' The Health &amp; Safety Executive said that products covered by the COSSH regulations could be dangerous in certain situations. Solvents used to make, for example, corrector fluid, are also used in adhesives. In sufficient quantity in enclosed areas, these have led to deaths.

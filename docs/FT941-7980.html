			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Technology: Waking up to dream control - A look at an alternative to virtual reality technology with vivid results As computer companies strive to develop virtual reality systems, researchers in California are working on technologies that allow people to tap into the virtual (or sub-conscious) reality inside their heads - namely, dreams. The Lucidity Institute, a private organisation founded in 1988 by Stephen LaBerge, a Stanford University researcher, has developed computer-based electronic devices and training programmes that teach people how to experience lucid dreams. In these, the dreamers are aware of their dreams; they can participate consciously in them and control them for specific objectives. The methods developed by the institute promise users such possibilities as indulging in adventures and fantasies, refining skills, finding solutions to difficult problems, overcoming nightmares and discovering methods of healing. Executives have used lucid dreams to rehearse difficult presentations, surgeons have practised complex procedures, and classical musicians have rehearsed difficult passages. In most cases, the skills perfected in the lucid dream have been transferred to the waking state. There are also important therapeutic applications. Physically handicapped persons can regain total mobility within the lucid dream state, and there are some indications that lucid dreams can help boost the body's immune response and increase the rate of healing. As yet, though, evidence of lucid dreams' impact is anecdotal. Some researchers are sceptical about their value. Also, some psychotherapists who use dreams to treat neuroses are unhappy about lucid dreams, regarding them as an interference with the sub-conscious. Lucid dreams certainly offer a more effective virtual reality than is achieved by computer systems. In computer-based virtual reality, the user interacts with a computer-generated world by wearing goggles containing tiny computer screens and a special electronic glove that detects hand movements. Such systems have a long way to go in mimicking waking reality; the computer graphics resolution is poor and the systems are slow and very expensive. But in the virtual reality of dreams, the dreamer experiences a world almost indistinguishable from waking reality. While lucid dreams sometimes happen spontaneously, they are fairly rare for most people. This is why researchers at the institute concentrate on developing electronic biofeedback devices and programmes that help people achieve lucid dreams on a regular basis. The most sophisticated device is called the DreamLight. This is a small computer about the size of a hardback book with a one-line liquid crystal display and four control buttons. It is attached via a wire to a lightweight sleep mask worn by the user. Sensors in the mask detect body and eye movements and contain two tiny lights. When the DreamLight detects rapid eye movements and no body movements, it knows that the user is dreaming. It will then flash the lights in the sleep mask in a specific sequence. In the dream, the DreamLight user sees the flashing lights incorporated in some way, such as the sun rising and setting, or car headlights flashing. The flashing lights act as a signal to the dreamer that he or she is experiencing a dream. By maintaining a balance between staying within the dream and not waking, the dreamer can experience a lucid dream lasting up to 45 minutes or more. LaBerge is also a co-founder of the Stanford University Sleep Research Center, one of the few large research centres into sleep and dreams. LaBerge He and his colleagues began developing the DreamLight technology in 1985. 'The first prototype looked more like a prop in a bad 1950s science fiction film,' says LaBerge. But despite its crude nature, experiments showed that it worked well. The institute further refined this technology and now offers not only the Dollars 1,200 (Pounds 822) DreamLight but also a less expensive version, the Dollars 275 NovaDreamer. 'The NovaDreamer has the potential to reach a very large market and help introduce large numbers of people to lucid dreaming,' says Craig Webb, one of the NovaDreamer developers. Webb adds that the institute is looking for investors and distributors to help market its technology to the large potential market. It says the technology has widespread applications - the storage capacity, up to 10 days, of a subject's dream cycles can help diagnose and treat sleep disorders without requiring lengthy and expensive visits to sleep laboratories. The institute claims it can also be programmed to sound an alarm during or before a dream - useful in treating people with recurring nightmares.</p>

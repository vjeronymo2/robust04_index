			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITYLINES: MORE TO WRIGHT MYTH  </P> <P> The interest in all things Frank Lloyd Wright continues. The latest book on who  many consider America's greatest architect of the ages is "Frank Lloyd Wright:  The Crowning Decade, 1949-1959, Selected, and With a Commentary, by Bruce  Brooks Pfeiffer" (The Press at Cal State, Fresno: $22.95 hardback, $13.95  paperback.)  </P> <P> The thin book of large type and a selection of personal photographs focuses on  the last 10 years of the architect's tumultuous life. Offered are views of  Wright by the public through a selection of articles; Wright's own reflections;  his wife's, drawn from her own personal papers; his daughter's, through  interviews, and those of his apprentices.  </P> <P> Although when his widow, Olgivanna, is quoted as saying shortly before her  death, "I ruled him, but I ruled him with love," it is perhaps more than we  want to know. Nevertheless, the volume adds to the myth that was Wright, and is  sure to be of interest to his faithful followers. Sam Hall Kaplan  </P></p>

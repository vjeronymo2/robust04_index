			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Air Canada set for Osaka The Canadian government is to allow Air Canada to move into the Japanese market in direct competition with rival Canadian International, while raising the possibility of new routes later for Canadian. Air Canada said it would begin flying into the new Kansai airport, Osaka, when it opens in September. It originally wanted Tokyo, but Narita airport is saturated. Both airlines want more Asian destinations, saying too much Asia-Canada traffic is being taken by US Airlines. Air Canada said Hong Kong is its first priority, and then new routes to China. In Calgary Canadian International said a CDollars 246m (USDollars 187.7m) equity infusion from American Airlines will be in place this spring, so that the parent PWA's financial restructuring can go ahead.</p>

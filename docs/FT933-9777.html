			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris ends at all-time high on rate cut hopes EXPECTATIONS of lower interest rates drove continental bourses higher yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS closed at a new all time high as investors took the view that a cut in interest rates was imminent after the Bank of France reopened the five to 10 day lending facility that had been suspended on July 22 when speculation against the franc began to intensify. The CAC-40 index ended 34.53 higher at 2,149.83, a day's rise of 1.6 per cent and a week's of 3 per cent. Turnover remained heavy at FFr5.2bn. Cyclicals and financial sector stocks were strong with the finance sub-index gaining 1.4 per cent. Peugeot added FFr14 to FFr680 and Michelin FFr8.60 to FFr188.20. AMSTERDAM ended the week in strong form, up 0.3 in the CBS Tendency index at 123.4, a gain of 1.1 per cent on the week. There was a further decline in Elsevier, down Fl 2.80 at Fl 132.90 as investors took another look at Thursday's results. Hoogovens was very strong ahead of next week's results, putting on Fl 3.30 or 7.7 per cent to Fl 46.20. Hoare Govett forecasts a net loss of Fl 210m for the half year period and notes that while expectations of a return to profit makes the stock attractive on a long-term view, 'we would hold off from buying in the wake of the recent run in the price'. MILAN resumed its advance, the telecommunications sector once again providing the lead, and the Comit index rose 1.01 to 581.48 for a 3.2 per cent rise on the week. Sip, the day's most active issue in volume of 23.3m shares, rose L188 or 6 per cent to L3,331 while Stet firmed L92 to L4,154 in volume of 15.3m shares. The renewed enthusiasm followed approval of the sector's reform by postal minister Maurizio Pagani that will eventually lead to a single telecommunications group. Olivetti also posted solid gains, rising L54 to L1,876 with 11.2m shares dealt. Kleinwort Benson, which recommended the stock this week, said it regarded Olivetti as the most attractive of the big blue chip industrials at present, not least because the shares had underperformed by 30 per cent over the last year, in spite of the recent rally. ZURICH saw some profit-taking that left the SMI index 0.8 lower at 2,423.5, 1.0 per cent up on a week that has seen the index at its all-time high. Swissair, whose shares were under pressure on Thursday, shed SFr35 or 4.9 per cent to SFr715. The airline's announcement of a first half net loss of SFr125m, compared with last year's SFr116m, was worse than analysts had been expecting. Nestle edged SFr1 above Thursday's low for the year to SFr1,018 although analysts commented that the share continued under pressure. STOCKHOLM saw turnover rise to a record SKr3.9bn as Sydkraft, the electricity producer, divested itself of its entire shareholding in AGA, the industrial gas group, accounting for SKr1.5bn of the total. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 8.60 to 1,250.10, up 4 per cent on the week. AGA B shares closed up SKr18 at SKr388 Sydkraft A shares added SKr6 to SKr146. OSLO closed at a new 1993 high, the index gaining 9.8 to 546.50, while HELSINKI's Hex index put on 1.5 per cent to 1,252.3. BRUSSELS saw renewed demand for steel shares which helped the Bel-20 index 19.18 or 1.5 per cent higher to 1,342.69 for a 1.2 per cent rise on the week. Cockerill Sambre added BFr5 or 3.9 per cent to BFr133 while Arbed rose BFr390 or 10.4 per cent at BFr4,135. MADRID was helped by the closing of Banesto's rights issue, and the general index rose 1.18 at 271.37, 0.5 per cent higher on the week. The results of Banesto's one-for-three offer, the first part of a Dollars 1.2bn capital increase, will be announced next week. The shares were steady at Pta2,250. VIENNA moved forward to a new, 14-month high with the ATX index 7.6 ahead at 989.2, up 4.3 per cent on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- August 6                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1271.94    1273.43    1273.47    1272.64 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1345.80    1348.79    1347.30    1347.30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1271.94    1270.73    1270.92    1272.34 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1346.87    1348.93    1349.93    1348.44  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Aug 5     Aug 4     Aug 3     Aug 2    Jul 30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1268.56   1268.09   1261.49   1252.49   1253.91 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1340.80   1339.61   1341.55   1347.49   1343.59  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1273.84; 200 - 1353.12 Low/day: 100 - 1269.54  200 - 1345.08.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peruvian state-owned copper smelter sold US-owned Southern Peru Copper Corporation, producer of two-thirds of all Peru's copper, bought the state-owned Ilo refinery at auction in Lima on Friday. Although five potential bidders had pre-qualified for this, the second attempt at a sell-off, SPCC made the only offer. The initial, February, asking price of Dollars 75m was reduced by 10 per cent for the second auction. SPCC bid Dollars 68.9m for all Ilo's assets, although it will hand back Dollars 5m in unwanted buildings for the state to dispose of. SPCC had always looked to be the natural buyers for Ilo. The refinery, purpose-built in 1975 at a cost of Dollars 56m, produces 99.9 per cent pure copper cathodes from SPCC-supplied blister copper under a tolling agreement. Output last year topped 180,000 tonnes. The new purchase will enable SPCC to integrate its smelting and refining operations and cut costs. It will invest more than Dollars 20m in upgrading and expansion of the refinery in the next three years. This should boost SPCC's total output of refined copper by about 9 per cent.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (7): Pearls in a cobalt sea - The Spice Islands' exotic charms and grizzly past AS THE sun sets over the idyllic island of Banda, the shadow cast by Gunung Api volcano, with sulphurous fumes rising from its summit, acts as a reminder of the island's turbulent past. In the eastern reaches of the archipelago, Banda is one of the original spice islands which attracted the European powers in the 16th century and led to more than 300 years of Dutch colonial rule. The spice islands - described in the florid language of guidebooks as clusters of pearls resting in a cobalt-blue sea - are now attracting their first tourists. To greet them in Banda is Mr Des Alwi, the Chief Orang Kaya (traditional island leader), owner of the Maulana Hotel and much else besides in the main town of Bandaneira. Mr Alwi is credited by many, including himself, with rescuing the local economy. Well-connected to several key figures in the Jakarta government, he is largely responsible for the arrival of electric power, for improving the town's roads and the construction of a small airstrip. The flow of tourists is likely to increase after a British Sunday newspaper named the Maulana Hotel as one of the world's finest. Its nomination might be considered fortunate given the lack of hot water, the miserably thin mattresses and the compulsory fare of fried fish and rice. It is a measure, however, of the island's and Mr Alwi's charm that beer, cake and a setting sun can still conjure up a feeling of blissful satisfaction. Bandaneira town, with its balustraded colonial houses, often in a state of overgrown ruin, has an unhurried pace of life and an almost unnaturally peaceful air. Caught in one of many free moments, Mr Alwi responded to a popularly held theory that Indonesia is a Javanese empire and, by extension, his island a colonial territory. Jakarta, 1,500 miles to the west and two time zones away, is so distant as to rarely enter the island's consciousness, he explained. Instead, if a bete noire had to be chosen, it would be the provincial government in Ambon, an island 10 hours by boat to the north. Five administrative officials sent by Ambon had recently been removed from Banda on the grounds of corruption, whilst an Ambon civil servant's order licensing 38 guest houses in Bandaneira had been rescinded after he intervened, Mr Alwi said. Whilst too many guesthouses would be as damaging as too few, Mr Alwi is sensitive to criticism of protecting his near monopoly of the town's tourist accommodation. There's no pleasing everyone, he says, announcing that the profits from his hotel are ploughed back into renovating Banda's historic buildings. And however great the authority he wields, Mr Alwi is certainly more benevolent than the Dutch who first visited Banda in 1599 and took the region by force 22 years later. Banda and its neighbouring islands were the world's sole source for high quality nutmeg, an essential ingredient in preserving meat in the years before refrigeration, whilst to the north of Ambon lie the islands of Ternate and Tidore, the original source of cloves. The islands were a source of considerable wealth and the Dutch employed savage means to impose their rule. In 1621, Jan Pieterszoon Coen arrived in Banda to take up residence as governor general with an army of nearly 2,000 men, including about 100 Japanese mercenaries. Interpreting the collapse of a ceiling lamp in the governor's residence as an assassination attempt, the Dutch extracted retribution by razing villages and engaging in mass-slaughter. In one incident 44 condemned prisoners, including eight orang kaya, were beheaded and quartered by Japanese mercenaries. An eyewitness described the execution as 'awful to see. The orang kaya died silently without uttering any sound except that one of them ..said, 'Sirs, have you then no mercy?'.' Of an estimated 15,000 population on Banda and the surrounding islands, only about 1,000 survived the massacres. As with the clove harvest in Ternate and Tidore, the Dutch imposed a trading monopoly over Banda's lucrative nutmeg crop with the islands' annual exports valued at the equivalent of Dollars 30m today. But rampant corruption and a lack of basic financial accounting infected the United East India Company (VOC) monopoly and in the 1790s it went bust owing more than Dollars 160m in today's money. In his book Indonesian Banda, Willard Hanna, a former US diplomat in Jakarta, blames 'the unworkable principle of monopoly' for the company's collapse and notes 'the enormously wealthy and powerful VOC may have been a losing proposition all along'. How little times change and how hard are the lessons of history won, note current Indonesian economists. Freed of the Dutch colonial yoke, in an ironical twist of fate a new, privately-owned, trading monopoly was imposed on clove farmers two years ago. Chaired by Mr Hutomo 'Tommy' Mandala Putra, youngest son of President Suharto, the new monopoly has received moe than Rp1,000bn in mostly soft credits from state-owned banks. Not only has the monopoly been unable to service even the interest on the debt, the actual price of cloves, used in Indonesia's fragrant kretek cigarettes, received by farmers has fallen. Banda's remaining nutmeg producers might regard themselves as fortunate their spice has insufficient value to attract a modern-day monopoly. The comfort, however, will be small with the collapse of the nutmeg trade pushing the islanders back toward subsistence farming. Where nutmeg plantations once stood, ubiquitous cassava is now grown and Mr Alwi may be correct in seeing tourism as the only means of improving the local economy. But to succeed, the people of Banda must prevent history repeating itself. They must follow the example of Mr Alwi and, with big smile and arms spread wide, exploit the wealth of foreign visitors, not vice-versa.</p>

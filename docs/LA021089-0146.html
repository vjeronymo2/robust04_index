			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHANG UPSETS CONNORS IN TIEBREAKER AT CHICAGO  </P> <P> Sixteen-year-old Michael Chang of Placentia outslugged second-seeded Jimmy  Connors from the baseline and capitalized on numerous unforced errors Thursday  to win their second-round match, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2), at the $350,000 Volvo Chicago  tennis tournament.  </P> <P> After losing his serve in the 11th game of the second set to go down 5-6, Chang  broke back to force the tiebreaker.  </P> <P> Connors took the first two points, but Chang reeled off the next seven, ending  the 2-hour 3-minute match on a call that even Chang thought was bad.  </P> <P> "The ball I hit I felt was long when it left my racket," Chang said. "But it  was called good. Sometimes in the heat of a match, people get nervous."  </P> <P> Ranked 29th in the world and fresh from two Davis Cup victories against  Paraguay, Chang pulled off his biggest upset, beating the world's  seventh-ranked player.  </P> <P> Earlier, top-seeded Ivan Lendl, No. 4 Tim Mayotte and No. 7 Kevin Curren posted  straight-set victories.  </P> <P> Lendl defeated Johan Kriek, 6-4, 6-3; Mayotte downed Roger Smith of the  Bahamas, 6-3, 7-5, and Curren eliminated Nicolas Periera of Venezuela, 6-4,  6-4.  </P> <P> Making his debut, third-seeded John McEnroe defeated Dan Goldie 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).  </P> <P> Chang ran Connors all over the University of Illinois Circle Pavilion Supreme  Court surface.  </P> <P> At one point, Connors asked Chang, "Are you 16 or 17?" Another time, Connors  yelled, "Remember, I'm an old man. I'm 36."  </P> <P> With both players playing from the baseline, Connors took the first two games,  breaking Chang's service in the second. But the teen-ager broke Connors in the  third and fifth games to take a 3-2 edge.  </P> <P> After Chang increased his lead to 5-3, he broke Connors again in the ninth game  as the veteran hit three balls into the net.  </P> <P> In the second set, Connors scored the first service break in the seventh game  to grab a 4-3 edge. After Connors held serve in the eighth game, Chang won the  next two games, squaring the set at 5-5.  </P> <P> They then traded service breaks to force the tiebreaker.  </P> <P> Chang said beating Connors "is an honor. He'll be in the Hall of Fame someday.  He played great and he made me work hard."  </P> <P> In the tiebreaker, Chang said, "I think after going up 2-0, he felt he could  gamble on my second serve and play some returns short. After all, he wasn't  serving."  </P></p>

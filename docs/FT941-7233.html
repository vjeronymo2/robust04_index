			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (4): State agencies fight for business - Thailand The recent surge in demand for telecommunications services in Thailand has overwhelmed the old-fashioned state agencies which control the networks, forcing them to concede an increasing share of new telecommunications business to the private sector. But the state agencies are not giving up without a fight, and they are extracting a heavy price from concessionaires - who quickly pass on the cost to the long-suffering consumers of Thailand - for every inch of telecommunications territory they yield to a private contractor. Against a background of Thai economic growth of around 8 per cent a year, the Communications Authority of Thailand (Cat) and the Telephone Organisation of Thailand (Tot) are notorious for their failure to keep pace with the demand for telephone services. By tradition, the Cat, which has monopoly control of international services, used to be the fiefdom of the air force. The Tot, which runs the domestic network, was dominated by the army. Over the years, however, the influence of the armed forces in Thai politics has declined, and in 1992 the former government of Mr Anand Panyarachun removed several military officers from the boardrooms of state agencies such as the Cat. Government officials and others are now discussing the possibility of fully privatising the Cat and the Tot, opening the arena to competing companies, and appointing a neutral regulator. The Tot has already appointed consultants to examine its own privatisation. Meanwhile, the waters have been muddied by a round of quasi-privatisations, in the form of concessions to private operators granted by the two state bodies, for activities ranging from mobile telephone operations to satellite launching. There is no doubting the need for more telephone lines and telecommunications services. Today Thailand has about 2.5m lines, half the estimated demand. In Thailand there are about four lines per 100 people, less than half the figure for neighbouring Malaysia and a tenth of the level in Singapore. The concession agreements have promoted the rapid growth of Thai telecommunications companies such as TelecomAsia, the subsidiary of the multinational Charoen Pokphand group, and the Shinawatra group of Mr Thaksin Shinawatra, a former police colonel. But the concession contracts are often controversial. The Anand government even withdrew 1m lines from the 3m-line installation contract awarded to TelecomAsia and gave them to another consortium, on the grounds that the original deal was too lucrative for Tele-comAsia and deprived the government of revenue. International telephone calls out of Thailand are among the most expensive in the world, an anomaly for a country which insists that it wants to become a regional communications hub. British Telecommunications has finally installed a data packet-switching node in Bangkok under a joint venture agreement with the Cat, but the charges levied by the Cat are believed to be exceptionally onerous by international standards. Tot staff have been slow to connect the lines built by TelecomAsia, a problem Telecom-Asia has sought to overcome by offering Tot employees inducements in the form of shares at a steep discount to their market value. Full privatisation of telecommunications in Thailand is likely to be hindered not only by vested interests in the Cat and the Tot, but also by some of the private concessionaires themselves when they benefit from 'exclusivity' clauses allowing them sole rights to a particular network or type of operation for a fixed number of years. For example, Shinawatra, which launched Thailand's first satellite in December last year, was granted a 30-year monopoly on serving local satellite users when it won the contract in 1990, although the Anand government subsequently reduced the monopoly period to eight years. Foreign equipment suppliers which have cosy arrangements with the Cat and Tot might also resist liberalisation. Some international telecommunications companies, on the other hand, would welcome a change in the laws which grant the Cat and the Tot monopoly ownership of the networks. The Cat and the Tot, surrounded by dynamic local private sector companies and their foreign partners, are beginning to look out of their depth in an age when telecommunications, broadcasting and the computer business are converging. TelecomAsia, in which Nynex of the US has a 15 per cent stake, wants to increase the value of its contract to install 2m telephone lines in Bangkok by using fibre-optic cables to transmit cable television as well as telephone calls. This did not form part of the original contract, but the Tot, perhaps persuaded by the offer of cheap shares, appears to have accepted it as a fait accompli.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Property: The extra value of Oxbridge - Gerald Cadogan finds plenty of attractive houses available in the old university towns - at a price What unites Oxford and Cambridge? 'Merton land' used to be the answer. You could walk from Oxford to Cambridge on land owned by Merton College, one of the colleges which makes up Oxford University. When you reached Cambridge, the first building was Merton Hall, where the late Lord (Victor) Rothschild lived. In today's property world the reply would be that they are exceptional provincial cities, both within an hour of London. That makes them ideal for commuting, and ideal to stay put in. The resulting premium on property prices is perhaps more marked in Cambridge, where there are fewer surrounding villages with fewer houses from which to commute into Cambridge. That reflects the difference between the Cambridgeshire flatlands, which were unusable fens until recently, and the Oxfordshire hills and valleys, crammed with villages which once lived off sheep and wool. In both cities agents have clients clamouring for houses of character. It is hard to find homes, especially since many of the best belong to the colleges. School-level education is a serious matter in Oxford and Cambridge, as I know as an Oxford parent, and John Patten, the Education Secretary, knows as one of the MPs for Oxford. People move to Oxford so that they can send their children to the Dragon preparatory school as day pupils. Oxford High School, for girls, accepts only a third of the applicants for the senior school, where fees are an attractive Pounds 1,152 a term. For boys at senior level, Magdalen College School is high in the Weekend FT school tables. Likewise, in Cambridge, education is the essence of the city. The names here are the Perse (schools for boys and girls) and The Leys plus, as in Oxford, excellent state schools - no surprise in view of the parents - and two very good sixth form colleges. The polytechnics in both cities have been promoted to universities. The other pluses the cities share are good medicine, masses of music, theatre, bookshops, art cinemas, a rich variety of places to worship and an articulate citizenry (which makes for marginal parliamentary elections in both places). And they each have a fabulous university. Do they differ? Yes, Oxford's train service is probably better and its station is closer to the town centre. Parking the car I find impossible in Cambridge, but I do not know the city well. In Oxford I have a spot where I usually get in - which I shall not reveal. Many eager buyers ensure an Oxbridge premium in house prices. And since there are not enough medium-to-large houses for the dons and other professionals, they spill over into the old working class terrace housing. In Oxford, live in Victorian / Edwardian North Oxford if you can, or in the old parts of Headington and Iffley. But if you cannot find a house there, or want something more modest, then turn - as many do - to the old terrace houses for printers in Jericho close to the Clarendon Press. Jericho's attractions include the synagogue, a Lebanese restaurant and an art movie house. In Cambridge the market has turned. It fell 40 per cent from 1988 to early 1993, but buyers are now offering the guide price for two-and- three bedroom Victorian and Edwardian terrace houses. First- time buyers prefer them to the modern starter homes, says Nicholas Redmayne of Redmayne Arnold &amp; Harris. For 42 St Barnabas Road it has bids above the guide price of Pounds 175,000, and with Carter Jonas it offers 106 Huntingdon Road, at the end of a terrace of five houses, built probably in 1899, for Pounds 198,000. Fern House, Prospect Row, is a simple Regency house from the company for Pounds 150,000, and usefully central. Also central are the flats in Beaufort Place built in 1984 beside the river Cam. Carter Jonas offers Nos 20 and 28 for Pounds 159,500 and Pounds 165,000 and Bidwells No 49, a penthouse, for around Pounds 250,000. No 7 Boathouse Court is a town house in another new development on the river, from Bidwells for Pounds 220,000. The main shortage is in houses in the Pounds 250,000-Pounds 350,000 range, says Jock Lloyd-Jones of Bidwells. Two that he has are The Birches (red brick Victorian) in Cavendish Avenue for Pounds 350,000, and the Victorian Bridge House in Great Shelford four miles from the city centre for Pounds 295,000. In Oxford, I would love to live in Beaumont Buildings, a quiet side street with smart brick houses off St John Street, in the centre of town. The covered market and all the shops, colleges and libraries are in easy walking distance. John D Wood is selling 3 Beaumont Buildings with four bedrooms and one or two studies (or a fifth bedroom), and off-street parking (a valuable plus), for Pounds 450,000. I should also like Osney Island, the 'village' on an island in the middle of the city, off the Botley Road, close to the railway station. Here the end of terrace 22 Bridge Street is for sale from George Pearce for Pounds 75,000. Also attractive is the Georgian Lucia House in the old village of Iffley. It costs Pounds 220,000 from Chancellors. 71 Great Clarendon Street, a terrace house in Jericho is Pounds 95,000 from Cluttons. Just outside Oxford lies Kidlington, a dull suburb except for the old part around the church which includes the Old Vicarage, a 16th century grade II* house. Carter Jonas is selling it for Pounds 350,000. Jackson-Stops offers Lincoln Farm in the High Street of Standlake for Pounds 260,000, and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley has Highcroft House in Eynsham for Pounds 475,000. Both are grade II. Looking out on the Thames is 66 Thames Street, a two-bedroomed new town house near Folly Bridge, from Chancellors for Pounds 115,000. In Headington 56 Old Road, a five- bedroom family house, built in an eclectic style that combines the tile hanging tradition of Sussex with a touch of an Edwardian boathouse, costs Pounds 300,000 from Carter Jonas. New on the market from the same agent is the imposing Queen Anne-style Bow House in Jack Straws Lane for offers of more than Pounds 445,000. In North Oxford, hymned by Sir John Betjeman, properties are scarce. Consider then 86 Cunliffe Close, a town house for Pounds 207,500 from Adkin or Cluttons. It is a healthy walk to good food and wine at the Cherwell Boat House restaurant, where you can drink a toast to the team that wins the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race in London next Saturday.

			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: AMEN CORNER AT AUGUSTA DAMAGED BY FLOODS  </P> <P> Officials at Augusta National Golf Club, home of the Masters tournament each  April, still haven't finished inspecting damage from heavy rains and flooding  last week, but it appears some rebuilding will be necessary.  </P> <P> Amen Corner, a stretch of three difficult holes, was one of the casualties when  the remains of Tropical Storm Marco hit eastern Georgia.  </P> <P> The green on No. 11, first of the three holes, was washed away when Rae's Creek  overflowed. Flood waters also damaged a bunker on No. 12, swamped the Byron  Nelson Bridge and destroyed the members' tee box at No. 13.  </P> <P> Workers were removing mud and sand left on the Nos. 12 and 13 fairways this  week.  </P> <P> "We've got some damage, but we haven't had a chance to assess it yet because  all the water has not receded," General Manager Jim Armstrong said Tuesday. "It  appears, however, that the No. 11 green will have to be rebuilt."  </P></p>

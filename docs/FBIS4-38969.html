			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Sergey Kravchenko for </F> TASS]    [Text] Dnepropetrovsk June 2 TASS -- Speaking at an  election meeting in the mining academy on Thursday, Ivan  Plyushch, Ukrainian presidential candidate and former parliament  speaker, called for tough economic measures.    "The time for mild decisions has gone. Tough measures are  need to avoid cruel and repressive ones," he said.    Plyushch believes that it is necessary first of all to form  a  team of like-minded people in the new parliament to shoulder the  entire responsibility. He is convinced that to do that there is  no need to enter into confrontation or reorganise the new  parliament. It is necessary simply to make competent use of  those powers which the old one granted to the executive branch,  he pointed out.    The presidential candidate is of the opinion that it does  not  basically matter whom the Cabinet of Ministers would be  accountable to -- the premier or the president. It is important  that firm executive power be wielded by one body and act  effectively.    Plyushch is confident that in order to get the first sprouts  of stabilisation now, it is enough to liberalise production,  including foreign economic activities, reinstate the law on the  state enterprise, bring into the operation the law on foreign  activities and foreign investments and see to it that the  production demonopolisation mechanism begins to operate and the  law on the banking system is upgraded.</p>

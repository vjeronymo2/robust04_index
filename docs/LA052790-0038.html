			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALICE KAHN: A NATURAL DRIVE TO DISTRACTION  </P> <P> All the way here, I have been thinking about what I would say to you. Today's  column comes to you -- live! -- from the woods. This modern miracle is made  possible by a portable laptop computer. The laptop is so light I can take it  off my lap and place it in my knapsack along with my apple and bag of nuts.  </P> <P> They say you should write about what you know. I am sick of what I know --  contemporary urban life. I want to be a nature writer. I want to write about  the beautiful things you never read about in newspapers, right here at the  source, away from the cutting glances of coffee-gulping editors.  </P> <P> (Although right now there is a huge turkey vulture circling above me. Do you  think he can sense my dead prose?)  </P> <P> On the way here, I saw some kind of butterfly. I scared away a family of quail.  Those would be the highlights of my story so far.  </P> <P> I have come to the woods where I used to hike daily in my halcyon hippier days.  It's hard to believe those were 20 years and 20 pounds ago, back when the focus  of my life was staying mellow and getting in touch with nature.  </P> <P> I once brought my mother to this place. Her trip here was certainly harder than  mine -- from Russia by boat and then plane to California, with a 50-year  stopover in Chicago. I thought it would be good to get her on the trail, but  those 50 years in Chicago had taken their toll.  </P> <P> Itook her to where there was no sound except the chatter of birds. She looked  around at the tall pines and eucalyptus, the graceful hillsides of purple  lupine, and said: "Ya' know, you could bring someone here, kill them, bury the  body and no one would ever know."  </P> <P> I must admit a touch of that orientation has stayed with me. When I sat down on  this hillside. . . . Excuse me, but two young gray birds with white tails are  edging toward me. Not sure what they are. Why can't they pose exactly like the  ones in my "Field Guide to Western Birds"?  </P> <P> Yes, a life lived in cities has rendered me a tiny bit paranoid. When I sit  down in the woods now, I frequently look behind me. I'm not sure what I think  is going to happen. It's not as if a bear with a gun will come up to me and  say, "OK, lady, hand over the Tandy laptop."  </P> <P> There's an airplane. These darn noises are so distracting!  </P> <P> Think it's time for a break. Think I'll eat the apple, OK?  </P> <P> It's clouding up now. Getting kind of chilly. Getting kind of hard to write in  complete sentences, too.  </P> <P> I thought that if I came to this peaceful place, I could write of such serenity  that you, in your crowded office or dingy room or noisy cafe, could get a  contact mellow off reading this. You know: I'm here and you're not, but at  least one of us is doing this for all mankind.  </P> <P> I also thought that away from the distractions, I could concentrate, get in  touch with the fundamental truths and communicate them. It's a  you-are-where-you-write kinda thing. Just a woman, an apple, a bag of Weight  Watchers peanuts, a Tandy laptop and the cosmos. . . . What was that? A blue  jay. Noisy son of a gun. I'll just wait until it stops squawking. Waiting. . .  . Oh well.  </P> <P> Yes, free from the distractions, the clock, the Post-its, the phone, the  endless whirl of the hard disk drive, I could. . . . When is that darn bird  going to shut up? For Pete's sake!  </P> <P> Think I'll take a little break here and eat the peanuts.  </P> <P> Oh my God! There's a man down there on the trail. You know, he could kill me  and leave the body and a ranger will find this computer in a garbage bin with  these, my last words.  </P> <P> So if I never get back alive, take my advice: Get out to the serenity of. . . .  </P> <P> Whew! He walked on by.  </P> <P> Now, as I was saying, I had hoped that by coming to this beautiful place. . . .  What was that?  </P> <P> Squirrel! No problem; just a squirrel. Too bad I'm out of nuts.  </P> <P> Guess the old wind in my boot heels is sayin': Time to move on.  </P> <P>  I love to go a wanderin'  </P> <P>  Across the mountain track . . .  </P> <P>  And as I go  </P> <P>  I love to schlep  </P> <P>  My computer on my back.  </P> <P>  Valdere-e-e . . . Valdera-a-a . . .  </P></p>

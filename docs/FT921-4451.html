			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Letter: Names place their hopes on Walker inquiry Sir, In response to Val Powell's letter (March 7), the majority of our members wish to see Lloyd's thriving in the future. The excessive losses incurred in 1988 by a few of the syndicates writing London Marine Excess of Loss (LMX) Risk, with themselves being inadequately reinsured, are likely to be repeated in 1989. In addition, many of our members were encouraged by their agents to allocate a disproportionate amount of their underwriting to LMX syndicates. Unless such Names can recover a significant sum from litigation, their resources will be wiped out and they will be unable to trade their way out of the situation. These Names are angry and disillusioned. It would be surprising if they did not feel that Lloyd's had failed them, and they are placing their hopes on the reports to come from Lloyd's Loss Review Committee and from Sir David Walker's inquiry into the LMX market. It is to be hoped that Lloyd's will put pressure on obtaining a quicker and cheaper resolution to any litigation that may ensue than occurred in the Outhwaite case. Lloyd's should also consider new arrangements to protect Names, perhaps by requiring all agents, member and managing, to subscribe to a central Errors and Omissions policy with centrewrite which could overcome some of the problems that the present arrangements have exposed. Sir David Berriman, chairman, Names Action Group, 125 Uxbridge Road, London W12 3NL</p>

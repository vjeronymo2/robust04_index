			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Where Community went wrong: Mistakes were made, but EC-established principles will hold THE decision by Lord Carrington to step down yesterday formally ends Europe's attempt to negotiate on its own a solution to the conflict in its Balkan backyard. As the baton passes to the wider international conference convened in London today, the EC can only be judged to have failed in its first effort at international peacemaking. This failure has underscored how difficult it is for the 12 to co-operate in foreign policy; but it is not solely an EC failure. Moreover, any eventual settlement in the region will not stray far from the principles Lord Carrington and the EC have established over the past year. The EC made serious mistakes. Initially, it insisted on maintaining Yugoslavia's federal structure, which may have given the Serbs licence to wage war on the first republics to depart, Slovenia and Croatia. By succumbing to German pressure for early recognition of the breakaway states, the Community frittered away the only diplomatic ace it held. As Lord Carrington himself warned in December, premature recognition of Croatia - with a third of its territory in Serb hands - would 'light a powder trail' to Bosnia. And so it proved, once recognition, rather than a lasting solution, was established as the international goal, and the ethnically intertwined Bosnians were thrown back on a rump Yugoslavia dominated by the Serbs. No other international body or country could, or was trying to, do better, until the UN moved slowly on board during last winter's suspension of the Carrington process. But the EC's shortcomings are no less evident for that. There are three overriding reasons for its failure. The EC is a civil power defending its external frontiers through Nato. It gradually developed foreign policy co-operation from 1970. But the collapse of the eastern bloc has left a vacuum in Europe and *something in here (HP) * requires the EC to assume some of the duties of a superpower. A common foreign policy in embryo, with no defence arm, is unsuited to this task. The Maastricht treaty establishes a common foreign and security policy (but still largely requiring the unanimity of the 12), and posits a future European defence dimension, based on the Western European Union. But the Yugoslav crisis arrived first and Maastricht still hangs in the balance. Some EC members (France, Spain, the UK) were worried about the impact of Yugoslavia on their own minorities. The Community's post-war success at consensual supranational management equipped it poorly to respond to the re-emergence of historical, ethnic-based conflicts. EC officials, particularly in their early dealings with the Yugoslav crisis, seemed almost unable to comprehend what such conflicts, a forgotten relic of western Europe's own past. When forced to remember, France recalled its Serbian links, and Germany its Croatian ones; the crucial Franco-German axis which carries the EC forward did not work. The international community as a whole has no clear practice on the right to self-determination of aspirants to statehood, nor on how to protect national minorities. Lord Carrington's peace effort did make some progress here. It established that neither internal nor international frontiers can be changed by force in the process of establishing new nations, and that minority rights within them must be guaranteed internationally. Whatever the precise solution is in ex-Yugoslavia, and whenever it comes, there will be no getting away from these two principles. All participants in the conflict have at some time assented to these principles - and virtually all have ignored them in practice. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, in French radio and newspaper interviews before today's conference calls for 'a credible perspective of military intervention: we must prepare such a force in order not to have to use it.' After the past year's imbroglio, however, EC diplomats do not see this on the cards. Rather, they foresee tighter sanctions against Serbia, armed escorts to aid convoys and a continuing search for political solutions while the fighting goes on - a Carrington tactic.</p>

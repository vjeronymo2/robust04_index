			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-WHITTAKER OFFICIALS ADMIT BRIBERY COUNTS  </P> <P> A subsidiary of Los Angeles-based Whittaker Corp. and two former executives  pleaded guilty today to charges they bribed a Marine Corps contracting official  to increase the value of Pentagon electronic contracts their company obtained.  </P> <P> Whittaker Command and Control Systems pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud  the government and two counts of bribing former Marine Corps official Jack  Sherman with nearly $75,000 between 1982 and 1988.  </P> <P> The Whittaker subsidiary agreed to pay $3.5 million in fines, civil penalties  and reimbursement for the cost of the investigation.  </P> <P> Scott M. Lamberth, 59, the former head of the subsidiary, and John F. Van  Tassel, ex-director of operations at its Fayetteville, Ark., facility, also  entered guilty pleas before U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton.  </P> <P> The plea by the Whittaker subsidiary is the third by a corporation since the  investigation began last year. Teledyne Electronics and Hazeltine Corp. have  both entered guilty pleas for their roles in the procurement scandal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unaware of Scheme  </P> <P> According to court papers, officials of Whittaker Corp. were unaware of the  bribery scheme, which began before the company acquired the subsidiary in 1986.  </P> <P> The bribery scheme allegedly began in 1982 when the company was known as Lee  Telecommunications and continued two years after its acquisition by Whittaker.  </P> <P> Lamberth was a stockholder of the company and became head of the subsidiary  following its acquisition by Whittaker. Court papers said Lamberth hid the  scheme from Whittaker officials.  </P> <P> Lamberth faces a possible 20-year sentence and fines up to $500,000. Van Tassel  could be sentenced to up to 15 years and fined $250,000.  </P> <P> Hilton scheduled a Dec. 15 sentencing proceeding for both defendants, who have  agreed to cooperate with the investigation.  </P></p>

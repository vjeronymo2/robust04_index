			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, 28 Jun (KUNA) -- Northern forces this evening  fired five rockets at the al-Mu'alla, al-Tawahi, and Khor Maksar  areas of Aden.    A southern military source told KUNA that more than 20  people  were killed or wounded.    The source confirmed that the northern forces which have  come  close to Aden today are now launching artillery and rocket  attacks on residential areas.    The battlefronts near the Aden refinery have witnessed  fierce  battles today and the KUNA correspondent, who was at the scene  of the fighting, saw the southern forces advancing to the  positions occupied by northern forces the day before yesterday.    The correspondent said that life is calm in Little Aden,  where the southern forces have control over the oil refinery,  and that the movement of traffic in the town to Aden is normal,  contrary to news agency reports that northern forces had  occupied the town of Little Aden.    A southern military communique said today that southern  forces had destroyed 10 northern tanks which tried to approach  the defense lines north of Aden.    The communique stressed that the town is "well fortified  despite the continued shelling of residential areas."</p>

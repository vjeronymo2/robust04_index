			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, April 4 (XINHUA) -- Residents of areas  around the planned Three Gorges project are getting effective  help from northern China's port city of Tianjin.    The city has offered many kinds of techniques to help local  ventures, through technical cooperation or setting up joint  ventures, officials in Tianjin said.    The Tianjin "Dengta" paint factory, for instance, offered  technical help to Xingshan County paint factory in Hubei  Province and upgraded the local factory's annual production  capability from 1,500 tons to 5,000 tons. That has brought  considerable economic returns for local people.    With techniques from Tianjin, automobile and steel joint  companies have also been established in local areas around the  Three Gorges. So far, some 22 projects have been completed.    Tianjin was designated in 1992 by the State Council to help  16 counties and regions in Sichuan and Hubei provinces around  the Three Gorges areas, where the world's highest dam will be  built on the Chang Jiang river. More than a million local  residents will be resettled.</p>

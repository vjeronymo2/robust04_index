			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Coles Myer sees scope for Australian acquisitions COLES MYER, Australia's largest retailer, sees scope for increasing its market share by expanding its operations and through acquisitions, Reuter reports from Melbourne. Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, said: 'There are at least a few percentage points to be added to our market shares in the not too distant future.' Coles Myer has 17 per cent of the Australian retail market and has about ADollars 15bn (USDollars 10.7bn) in annual sales. He said Coles Myer had plenty of scope for closing market gaps with acquisitions and there were many opportunities to open some of its businesses in states in which it was not represented. The decision two weeks ago to open a chain of toy superstores was the first of the niche market opportunities the group would develop. 'We see plenty of scope for new business initiatives in other areas and we are looking at a range of opportunities,' he said. Coles Myer would concentrate its business in Australia and he did not want to make promises of offshore expansion. He said growth plans for current businesses included the opening of new stores, refurbishment of existing stores, extending trading hours, development of store brands, reducing unwanted lines and installation of electronic sales systems. Coles Myer was examining all its operations to see whether the group should be in them and whether their performance could be improved. 'Indeed, I think it is obvious to anyone who knows the company well that a new era is well and truly under way,' Mr Bartels said. There was still work to be done after its half-year result unveiled recently, which showed a 4 per cent rise in net profit to ADollars 236.6m in the 26 weeks to January 24. Mr Bartels said the K mart discount chain was nowhere near its potential, and he wanted to improve contributions from supermarkets and department stores.</p>

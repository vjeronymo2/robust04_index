			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A REASON TO AVOID NICOTINE CHEWING GUM  </P> <P> Question: I've been using nicotine chewing gum in a program to get me to stop  smoking. Can I continue to use it if I become pregnant?  </P> <P> Answer: Nicotine chewing gum should not be used during a pregnancy.  </P> <P> Q: I've been making a point of using skim milk and cottage cheese instead of  whole milk and solid cheeses because I was told that I would get less fat in my  diet that way. But I'd like to know what low-fat really means. If I don't use  skim milk and cottage cheese, how much fat do these other dairy products have  in them? Does it really make a difference?  </P> <P> A: Butter is about 100% fat, and many cheeses are at least 70% fat. As for  whole milk, one-half of its calories come from fat.  </P> <P> Q: My sister-in-law has cancer, and she's been accepted for a clinical trial. I  know that it involves some form of treatment, but I'm not sure what a clinical  trial actually is. Are there any risks to it? I would appreciate an  explanation.  </P> <P> A: Clinical trials usually are designed to evaluate a new form of treatment.  New treatments may appear to be safe and effective when tested in the  laboratory, but no one can be certain of this until it is used on humans. The  clinical trial helps determine this.  </P> <P> All treatments, both new and old, involve both risks and benefits; with a new  treatment, however, there may be risks that could not have been foreseen. On  the other hand, a clinical trial can provide patients with the finest in  available medical care and with a form of treatment that may be superior to  anything else they had been receiving.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by Mikhail Zotov; from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Announcer Tatyana Komarova] We would now like to  show you for the first time footage our correspondent managed to  film. Missiles brought out of Belarus under an agreement are  being placed on alert duty in Russia.    [Mikhail Zotov] In the village of Manan-Muchash, which means  -- short end -- in the Mari language, not far from Yoshkar-Ola,  a regiment equipped with missiles brought out of Belarus under  the trilateral agreement has been placed on alert duty. You can  see the missiles behind me. They are the newest strategic  missiles, codenamed Topol, SS-25.    The military says these strategic mobile missile complexes  have no computer program devised to eliminate targets in any  country that might be a potential adversary. However, the  on-board electronic systems are capable of retargeting the  complex within a few seconds. Radar-proof warheads can reach any  point in the opposite hemisphere.    Despite the fact that the army is troubled by many problems,  the missile troops are relatively well-off, and in the words of  Major-General Nikolay (Moroz), are capable of maintaining a  guaranteed minimum of security and independence for Russia.    Meanwhile, the West is keeping an close watch on the Topols  in Mari territory. Radar stations have registered the fact that  our neighbors' satellites were monitoring the redeployment of  the missiles. Space, however, remains the only place from where  an outsider can watch Russian strategic missiles being placed on  alert duty. On the ground it is only reporters from Ostankino's  First Channel who can do it.</p>

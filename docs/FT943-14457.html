			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Castle Comms jumps 58p on offer talks The share price of Castle Communications, the music and video publisher, jumped 58p to 335p yesterday as it announced that it was in talks that might lead to an offer for the company. The statement was in response to recent moves in its share price. Castle, which was floated on the USM at 200p in March 1987, releases compilations of pop artists from the 1960s and 1970s and owns rights to some groups from the period, including the Kinks and the Searchers. There was speculation yesterday that the rights, valued at 230p a share in its last balance sheet, might have attracted the attention of large music copyright holders. Castle made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.5m on turnover of Pounds 33.4m in the year to June 1993. Castle, which is valued at Pounds 22.8m at yesterday's closing price, said a further announcement would be made as soon as practicable.</p>

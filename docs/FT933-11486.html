			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Letter: Assessments of BS 5750 ignore quality assurance principles Sir, Like many others, I am concerned about the issues addressed by Charles Batchelor in his article on BS 5750 ('A victim of its own success', July 21). However, I believe much of the criticism of BS 5750 centres around the costs and management of the certification process, rather than the quality assurance principles that the standard was originally designed to focus on. Many of the articles in the business press have little to say about this more important subject. Having just achieved BS 5750:Part 1 registration for one of our businesses, my company's experience is that BS 5750 has given us a disciplined approach for establishing a documented quality management system, resulting in: a sound foundation on which to continue to build improvements to our client service; a model for reviewing our operational procedures, which gives everyone a common understanding of how we deliver our services; an opportunity to ensure that we consistently deliver the same service throughout our UK business by auditing our procedures; an ongoing requirement to review our quality management systems and change them in response to external demands. Perhaps one way to enhance the credibility of BS 5750 would be to establish assessment criteria requiring evaluation of customer feed-back on the effectiveness of a company's service and the quality of its products or services. After all, the main reason for focusing on quality must surely be continually to improve customer service.

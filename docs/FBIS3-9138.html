Simic was interviewed by the JOURNAL DE GENEVE daily, which  introduced him as the first Yugoslav politician to visit Zagreb  after Croatia violently seceded from the former Yugoslav  Federation in 1991.    Speaking about the Moslem-Croat agreement on setting up a  federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Simic said the Serbs would  welcome the deal if it was to bring about the cessation of  hostilities and peace in the republic.    The paper reminded its readers that Belgrade had made it  clear to U.S. Presidential Envoy Charles Redman that there could  be no solution to the Bosnian crisis without Bosnian Serbs and  that political and military aspects of the situation could not  be overlooked.    The Yugoslav Government maintains that the European Union  has  lost credibility in trying to resolve the crisis in  ex-Yugoslavia, of which it has informed President of the E.U.  Ministerial Council Karolos Papoulias of Greece during his  recent visit to Belgrade, JOURNAL DE GENEVE said.    Paraphrasing Simic, it went on to explain that the European  Community last December proposed that sanctions against  Yugoslavia be lifted if Bosnian Serbs made territorial  concessions to the Moslems. This condition has been met, the  paper said, but the Serbs now have the impression that they have  been pushed to the side.    Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) insists on the adherence to  the democratic formula adopted at the Geneva-based International  Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, according to which a  solution to the Bosnian War is to be negotiated by all three  sides to the conflict, the paper explained.    It quoted Simic as saying that the Yugoslav Government did  not want to be directly involved in the upcoming talks in Zagreb  between Croatia and the Republic of Serb Krajina, and that its  dialogue with Croatia should be conducted on an equal footing.    This implies the lifting of the absurd anti-Yugoslav  sanctions which have harmed both the Serb people and countries  neighbouring on Yugoslavia.</p>

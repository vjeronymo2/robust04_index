			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (11): Going gets tough for the bellwethers - It has been a mixed year for the big groups.  However, those quick enough on their feet have had a rich year snapping up suitable opportunities / Conglomerates RARELY can conglomerates across Europe have been through such a year of tests and opportunities as in 1992. These bellwethers of the general economy have all had to face tough conditions, varying from a full recession in Britain, to a near recession in France and the beginnings of a downturn in Germany. Earnings in some of their core businesses have been under pressure, reflected in a fall in rankings from some of the biggest groups. Yet at the same time it has been a buyers' market for conglomerates seeking to make acquisitions, so those quick enough on their feet to snap up suitable opportunities have had a rich year and increased their market capitalisations as a result. 'There has been a trend towards concentration. What propels this is a maturing core business, with little growth but plenty of cash. This is what has been happening over the past year,' says Mr Arend Dikkers, director of equity research at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. Cases in point include BTR's takeover of Hawker Siddeley group at the end of 1991, following which the buyer rose one place in the rankings to 21 last year, or Tomkins's purchase of Ranks Hovis McDougall, the food group, in a year in which Tomkins climbed 57 places to 192. For similar reasons, this has also been a year in which two important new conglomerates have been formed, in Sweden with Volvo's acquisition of a minority stake in Procordia, the food and pharmaceuticals group, and in France, with the controversial merger between Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere's two business empires, Matra, the telecommunications to transport and defence group, and Hachette, the publishing company. Volvo slipped 20 places to 129, hit by losses in its car making division and the disappointment over being prevented by the Swedish government from taking full control of Procordia. Matra and Hachette only sealed the knot at the end of the year, so the new group does not appear in the listings. The thinking behind this new creation is slightly different from other conglomerates' acquisition strategies. The aim, says Matra-Hachette, is to give the merged group the new freedom to channel cash between different activities. Yet as with some other conglomerates, the logic is financial rather than industrial. Broadly, conglomerates in the list come in two distinct models. First, there is the Anglo-Saxon-style diversified industrial or financial holding group, a collection of fully- or majority-owned businesses to which central management seeks to add some kind of value. Hanson, BTR and Tomkins are the classic examples, but this category also includes such as Alcatel-Alsthom, the French telecommunications to engineering and publishing giant, or Mannesmann, the German capital goods to mobile phones conglomerate. Second, there is the continental European model of a financial holding company, sometimes grouped around a bank, which holds a large number of minority or majority stakes as investments, to which it provides little daily management input. Classic examples include Societe Generale de Belgique, the Belgian holding group, or Suez and Paribas the French financial and industrial holding companies. If Anglo-Saxon-style conglomerates like BTR and Tomkins have been hot on the acquisition trail this year, their continental counterparts have tended to do the reverse. Paribas and Suez have been selling non-strategic assets, to tidy up their complex portfolios, so as to make themselves more attractive to institutional investors, but also to raise cash to bolster their banking businesses' capital adequacy ratios. In the process, they are becoming less continental and more Anglo Saxon in structure. It has been a tough year for them. Paribas and Suez both slipped 14 places down the rankings, the former down to 78 and the latter down to 65, both hit by intense competition in French banking as well as by provisions on their extensive property interests. That said, analysts see no clear trend in the performances of the two main kinds of conglomerates over the past year. Changes in their market capitalisations appear to be linked more to the sectors in which individual conglomerates have invested and the individual qualities of their management than on whether they are organised like pension funds or industrial groups. The worst performing company in the list, for example, is none other than Lonrho, an Anglo-Saxon-style conglomerate down 301 places to 478, reflecting worries over the succession to the ageing Mr Tiny Rowland, after his retirement in three years' time, and the group's heavy debt service burden. Hanson, the classic model of an Anglo-Saxon conglomerate, has had a particularly difficult year. It dropped five places in the FT500 ranking to 16th, after a year in which Hanson gave up its attempt to 'unbundle'. ICI, the UK chemicals group, reported its first ever decline in annual profits and lost the battle for Ranks Hovis McDougall to Tomkins, run by one of Lord Hanson's own star pupils. Also on the list of the poorest performers is Navigation Mixte, a continental-style financial services to foods conglomerate, down 70 places to 230, hit by the poor performance of its insurance and banking investments. None of the classic conglomerates, on the other hand, can be found in the top 60 performers, though Valeo, the car components maker which is the main investment held by Cerus, Carlo De Benedetti's French holding company, did rise 127 places to 254, thanks to its uncanny ability to increase profits in the depressed automotive industry.</p>

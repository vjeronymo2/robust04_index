			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Arts: Schumann and Friends - Concert Mini-festivals are not often so neatly planned as 'Schumann and Friends', which is the brainchild of Raymond Leppard. Four Barbican concerts with the English Chamber Orchestra, each including one of Schumann's symphonies, filled out with less familiar pieces by him and with a wide variety of music by friends and influential contemporaries: Mendelssohn, Brahms, Weber, Hummel, Berlioz, Paganini. A judicious banquet, in fact. On Monday the first concert - also broadcast on Radio 3 - showed him in characteristic form. Generally brisk, unhesitating tempi, a strong sense of continuity, a light touch that can become incisive but never strenuous; also a certain shyness about Romantic expression, except where he has decided to mould a passage with deliberate art. He did that, for example, in the Larghetto of the First Symphony, which sounded unspontaneous and slightly arch. The ECO strings, not at their most polished here, might have achieved a more natural flow with an extra rehearsal. On the other hand, his way with the Scherzo was very fetching. Taking Schumann's 'molto vivace' at full value, he gave the main dance a headlong sweep, almost falling over itself with excitement (often it seems a more heavy-booted affair), while the contrasted Trio sections were suddenly relaxed, cosy, even playful. As a whole span, the symphony boasted a convincing gleam. So too Brahms's evergreen 'Haydn' Variations, with any hint of village-band pomposity scrubbed away, enhanced by an uncommon air of delicate introspection - true to Brahms, of course, but usually underplayed in this work. The novelties in the programme both had the American clarinettist Richard Stolzman as soloist, joined by Thea King's basset horn in Mendelssohn's indulgent little Konzertstuck. Mendelssohn himself described it as 'noodles with cream', which is just how it sounded: long, glutinous strands of duetting in thirds, with conventional roulades assigned to each soloist in turn. Charmingly played, it fell pleasantly upon the ear, but once was enough. Weber's E-flat Concerto offered Stolzman far more opportunities for deploying his fabulously subtle tone-colours and his genius for imaginative phrasing - most of all in the Romance, which is really a rich concert-aria, complete with hushed, dramatic recitative. The concerto also has sustained bursts of mechanically brilliant virtuosity, in which even Stolzman slipped twice or thrice in the effort of keeping up. But the heart of the performance was in his fanciful expressive insights, and those were breathtaking. Remaining concerts: February 4, 5 and 8</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Royals firm Composite insurer Royal Insurance climbed 12 to 290p, in hefty trading of 11m shares, on reports that US Federal authorities had reached agreement with insurers on a proposed new tax on insurers. The action is part of the reform of superfund, a device to make money available for pollution clean-ups, and the current suggestion is that the tax be imposed in two stages, with a first stage running for four years. In this period, it would be based 70 per cent on policies written over the last 20 years, and 30 per cent on policies written in the future. In later years, 65 per cent of the tax will be on future policies and 35 per cent on past policies. Robert Fleming Securities, the stockbroker, issued a robust buy circular on the stock and said: 'If this 70/30 methodology is adopted, then we calculate that the premium 'tax' or levy that Royal will have to pay will be under Dollars 20m per annum - hardly an onerous or worrying prospect given that Royal has set aside reserves of Dollars 248m . . . to cover US industrial pollution losses.' SG Warburg was also said to be positive on the stock. Among banking issues, a Smith New Court profits upgrade lifted Bank of Scotland by 4 to 196p. Mr Simon Samuels at Smith raised his current-year forecast by Pounds 18m to Pounds 444m, but said: 'Our profits forecast still remains conservative given falls in bad debt seen elsewhere in the sector.' News that a US district judge had decided that a big asbestos class action settlement involving 20 companies that included T&amp;N was fair cheered the market, leaving the stock 8 ahead at 247p. Mr Robert Speed at Henderson Crosthwaite, a bull of the shares, commented: 'I believe this settlement will put a cap on the potential liability under personal injury claim in the US.' It was the turn of Vodafone to star in the telecoms sector, with traders reporting strong US interest. The shares climbed 11 to 206p in heavy trade of 19m. Cable and Wireless also continued its firm performance of this week, adding 8 at 456p. The stock has been buoyed by Hoare Govett and a warrant from BZW. The regional electricity companies (recs) were again a firm market as investors continued to respond to the overwhelmingly solid support from brokers on the sector post the Offer document. South West climbed 14 to 741p, East Midlands 13 to 713p and London 13 to 688p. Scottish Power appreciated 9 to 407p, with Panmure Gordon recommending the stock ahead of its Offer review next month. The broker forecasts a 10 per cent upside for the shares. National Power edged forward a half-penny to 502p in brisk turnover of 7.8m on talk of a buy note from one of the big US-owned houses. There was renewed strong demand for shares in the Telegraph, the London-based newspaper group, with turnover of 630,000 again topping usual levels of activity. The hints in the market on Wednesday, suggesting that Mr Conrad Black, who owns a near 57 per cent stake in the Telegraph group, may have been buying Telegraph shares, were discounted by some dealers. They said that as a director, Mr Black would be prohibited from buying shares in the closed period ahead of the Telegraph's interim results, which are scheduled for next Wednesday. The stock added 12 at 373p. The ebb and flow of the oil workers' strike in Nigeria produced a firmer trend in crude oil prices, but the oil majors were restrained by selling said to have emanated from the US. BP settled 3 off at 408p and Shell Transport the same amount lower at 721p. British Gas moved up 3 to 295p on relatively heavy turnover of 11m shares, boosted by talk of aggressive buying by US institutions. Building materials group Rugby shed 4 to 146p in its highest recorded day's volume of 12m shares, which included a 5.6m share block deal. The deal, which some analysts linked to investment house BZW, is ahead of Rugby's interim results at the end of the month. Andrews Sykes advanced 6 to 53p after European Fire Protection announced the acquisition of 8.2 per cent of the construction group's equity to bring its total holding to 42 per cent. News International strengthened 10 ahead of results expected next week, to 254p. United Newspapers forged ahead 17 to 535p, with analysts suggesting that an announcement by investment houses PDFM and UBS confirming that they hold 10 per cent of the stock was the driving factor. Profit-takers undermined the recent good run by Unilever, the shares retreating 10 to 1120p. Smith New Court also reiterated its sell stance. Northern Foods was the subject of a profits downgrade and the shares slid 7 to 220p. Albert Fisher, 2 softer at 47p, was also said to be receiving cuts to its forecasts as brokers met with the company. Other statistics, Page 31</p>

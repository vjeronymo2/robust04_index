			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar moves narrowly The Independence Day holiday in the US, and caution ahead of today's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, ensured that the dollar yesterday traded in a fairly narrow range, writes Philip Gawith. The US currency finished little changed in London, at Y98.9 from Y98.705 on Friday, and DM1.5965 from DM1.5946. With the US markets closed, the currency market had effectively shut by mid-afternoon in London, with one leading bank reporting that most of its spot traders had taken off to watch the crucial Ireland-Holland match in the World Cup. Traders said investors, faced with a bewildering array of monetary policy meetings this week, appeared to have taken to the sidelines. There is increasing scepticism, however, about the likelihood of co-ordinated policy action in support of the dollar from leading industrial nations. In Europe, the Swedish krona and Italian lira recovered from their weakness of last week. The pound had an uneventful day, the sterling index ending steady at 79.6. There was little fresh news for the market to chew on, save for comments from President Clinton that 'we do not believe a country can devalue itself into prosperity'. Commenting on the dollar's recent weakness, Mr Clinton added that 'great care should be taken before unusual actions are taken'. Some traders interpreted this as diminishing the likelihood of concerted intervention. Bolstering this impression were remarks from Mr Gert Haller, state secretary in the German Finance Ministry, that the current dollar/D-Mark rate, of about DM1.60, 'corresponds to the long term average'. He added: 'I have not understood the excitement about the dollar in relation to European currencies.' While few analysts rule out the possibility of a monetary tightening from the policy-making FOMC, most agree that this would be motivated by domestic economic conditions, rather than the weakness of the US currency. Similarly, analysts said any monetary easing from the Bundesbank council, which meets on Thursday, would be tied to domestic factors. Mr Peter Luxton, economist at Barclays in London, said if the FOMC authorised a rise in rates, it was possible that Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, would be given leeway to move only after he has seen Friday's payroll figures, and the preliminary second-quarter GDP figure later this month. The Barclays economist said a 'do nothing' policy might be the best option, and that an intervention strategy was very dangerous as it provided markets with a target to aim at. But Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said he did not believe finance ministers and their political leaders were ready to risk a 'crisis of confidence' in international markets. He added that recent dollar weakness had been a catalyst for financial market weakness, and predicted that this causality will continue. Mr Chertkow doubted whether G7 leaders will come up with a pre-emptive strategy to defend the US currency, and expected more intervention as a response to further dollar weakness. He said this is likely next week when the market wakes up to discover that there is no strategy to defend the dollar. Chase Manhattan, in its weekly foreign exchange analysis, notes that 'although G7 intervention has seldom been effective at the first or second attempt, it generally has been effective eventually'. The bank makes two further points: there has so far been little intervention from the G7, with past episodes seeing 10 or more episodes of intervention before markets turned. Second, there has been more limited G7 success with intervention on dollar/yen than on Dollars /D-Mark. In Europe, attention focused again on the lira and krona. Against the D-Mark, the lira finished in London at L990.6 from L994.7 and the krona at SKr4.890 from SKr4.906. The recovery in the krona was tied up with the Swedish bond auction, which went off more successfully than expected. Analysts said there was evidence that the weakness of the krona had enticed foreign investors to participate in the bond auction. Mr Chertkow said the recovery in the lira was perhaps linked to market rumours that the government planned, later this week, to announce significant cuts in public expenditure. This would help address market concern about the size of Italy's budget deficit. The general torpor infecting markets spread to interest rate futures, where volumes were at a very low ebb. But the firmer tone in the bond markets helped prices, with the December Eurosterling contract closing at 93.73, from 93.71. Only 2,782 lots were traded. The December Euromark contract saw 5,042 lots dealt and ended at 94.97 from 94.94. In the money markets, German call money rates eased to 5.05/5.15 per cent. In the UK, the Bank of England provided Pounds 915m liquidity to the market after forecasting a Pounds 900m shortage. Overnight money traded between 3 1/2 and 5 per cent.</p>

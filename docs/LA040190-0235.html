			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BURNED BY BURR  </P> <P> Perry Mason turned up once again with one of his plodding two-hour vehicles on  March 11. If you're a fan of Raymond Burr, you could describe his acting as  laid back and underplayed.  </P> <P> If not, you could call it stilted, ponderous and boring. Whatever, "The Case of  the Desperate Deception," which was filmed in Paris, seemed carelessly done. If  Burr comes to life at all in this series of movies, it is usually during the  trial scene. This time out, he couldn't manage that. Mason's secretary, Della,  seemed uncaring about her few telephone scenes. And William Moses is no  substitute for William Katt, who had pizazz.  </P> <P> The Gargantuan gaffe of the film was Burr's line (misread, perhaps?): "The  court-martial begins tomorrow at 10 a.m. in the morning." Can anyone recall  when 10 a.m. came in the afternoon?  </P> <P> Randy Fitts, West Hollywood  </P></p>

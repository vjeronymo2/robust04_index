			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 25 (CTK) -- An inter-departmental  commission will be set up to draft a law ending abuse of the  legal host requirement for citizens from Russia, Ukraine,  Romania, and Bulgaria seeking to reside in the Czech Republic,  Interior Minister Jan Ruml announced at a press conference  today. The law should also make regulatory measures more  effective in relation to citizens from countries with which the  Czech Republic has an agreement waiving the visa requirement, he  said.    The inter-departmental commission is to be composed of  representatives from the ministries of the interior, foreign  affairs, and the economy.    Ruml said some 100,000 foreigners have long term residence  in  the Czech Republic. Stricter requirements are under preparation  which will lead to only those who have a genuine interest in  working or studying in the Czech Republic being granted  residence permission, he said.    Legislation is also being prepared whereby a Czech citizen  who invites a foreigner who later undertakes criminal activity  will have to pay the cost of his expulsion. Ruml said he  expected the bill to find support among members of parliament.    The commission will also consider raising the charges  related  to the invitation of a foreigner. In Slovakia, Ruml pointed  out, the charges have already risen to 1,000 crowns (about $30).</p>

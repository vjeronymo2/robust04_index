			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast; video report by Vladimir </F> Grigoryev]    [Text] [Announcer] Russia, Ukraine, and the United States  are expected to sign a treaty in Moscow next Friday [14 January]  on the complete elimination of the strategic nuclear weapons  deployed on Ukrainian territory, U.S. President Bill Clinton  said during a press conference in Brussels.    [Grigoryev] This statement really caused a sensation and has  already elicited a positive response worldwide. The upcoming  signing of the agreement follows intensive tripartite talks in  Washington, which resulted in Ukraine's renouncing its nuclear  potential.    As you know, following the breakup of the Soviet Union,  Ukraine inherited 176 strategic missiles and 1,800 nuclear  warheads. That constitutes a more powerful arsenal than those  of France, China, and Britain together.    In return for dismantling their weapons, Ukraine's  parliamentarians demanded that the West provide considerable  financial aid for economic reforms and security guarantees, as  well as compensation for the short-range tactical missiles that  have been handed over to Russia. The talks in Washington showed  that this was no time for bartering and that the whole world can  benefit from the agreement. Nor will Ukraine lose out. It is  to receive nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes. And Russia is to  cancel Ukraine's enormous debt for energy sources. Finally, the  United States will provide the republic with economic and  technical aid, as well as guaranteeing its security.    The importance of the upcoming treaty signing is indicated  by  the fact that tomorrow, following a change in the initial  program for his visit, Bill Clinton will meet President Leonid  Kravchuk in Kiev in order to express his support.

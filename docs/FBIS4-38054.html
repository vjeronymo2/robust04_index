			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that general  public opinion notwithstanding, the Shamgar Commission report is  harsh and includes sharp criticism on various issues, such as  law enforcement in the territories. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir  reports that the prime minister told the Labor Knesset faction  he considers the report as the commission's way of dealing with  a complicated situation and criticizing the operation of certain  systems. Rabin emphasized that the government will implement  all the conclusions and recommendations, adding that the report  will make it easier for him to determine prayer and security  procedures in the Cave of the Patriarchs and especially to  enforce the arrangements on Jewish worshipers.    Yitzhaq Rabin rejected the statement of Ari'el Sharon --  without spelling out his name -- that contrary to previous  commissions of inquiry, the Shamgar Commission has not placed  any ministerial responsibility on anybody. Rabin said that  contrary to the Lebanon War, where the government made a  concrete decisions to enter Beirut, the Shamgar Commission has  dealt with an unpredictable event which was not initiated by the  government.    Regarding the reports on Ron Arad's fate, the prime minister  says Israel has considerable information regarding Ron Arad's  fate up to 1989. In the past he was held by Mustafa al-Dirani  who was a member of the Amal organization. He was then turned  over to Hizballah and Iran. Syria could also have done more  than it has on this issue.

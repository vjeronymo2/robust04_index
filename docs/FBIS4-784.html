			<p>BFN     [Text] Today's news also concerns the flight of the clique  of killers, who are currently stuck at Burundi International  Airport. Let us recall who they are: There is Ferdinand  Nahimana, whom you know, who was minister of higher education  and scientific research. He belongs to the Republican National  Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for the Defense  of the Republic [MRND-CDR] and is known for dividing Rwandans.  He made this the law of Rwanda and the law became MRND ideology.    You also know Simeon Nteziryayo, minister at the Presidency.  He was too powerful in the office of the president recently.  There is Cyprien Munyankundu, secretary general of the National  Assembly that was imposed by the president. The head of the  deputies, Theodore Sindikubwayo, is the one who imposed himself  as president of the Republic.    There is Faustin Ruzindana, (Fidel Ntuyenabo), and Supreme  Court President Alphonse Marie Nkubito, who is among those who  fought for change, who fought the dictatorship. He escaped the  presidential guard killers.    There is also Lieutenant Colonel Charles Uwihoreye and Mrs.  Casimir Bizimungu, wife of former Health Minister Casimir  Bizimungu, who is a staunch member of the MRND-CDR. He is not  in Burundi; he fled to Zaire. There is Daniel Mbangura who was  minister of higher education and scientific research. You know  him. He belongs to the MRND-CDR. There is Mrs. Deo Nsabimana,  wife of Major General Deo Nsabimana, who was chief of staff of  the Rwandan Armed Forces. He died in the crash with the Rwandan  and Burundi presidents on 6 April. There is Mrs. Sylvestre  Nsanzimana, wife of the former prime minister of the first  coalition government and Mrs. Pascal Ndengejeho, wife of  Ndengejeho of the Republican democratic movement, who is known  to have refused to take part in the government of the late  Agathe Uwilingiyimana. There is Mrs. Faustin Maniraho, Mrs.  Felicien Kabuga, wife of Kabuga, head of the divisionist  Radio-Television Libre des Milles Collines radio, and Mrs.  Ntagerura, wife of former Transport and Communications Minister  Ntagerura, a staunch MRND-CDR member. All these people have  fled.    So, the clique of killers has fled along with its families.  The clique which started the war has fled. They have left the  Rwandan youth they sent to war behind. Those who are still  fighting for the clique, why are you fighting now that those you  fought for have left you at the front? What is the relationship  between you and those who left you at the war front? Unite with  the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] to search for all those who  supported the clique wherever they are, whether in the communes  of (Bicumbi), Gikoro, and elsewhere.</p>

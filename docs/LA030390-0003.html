			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCCER IS A GREAT GAME, BUT NO ONE KNOWS IT  </P> <P> Many times in the last few years, and once again in Melvin Durslag's column on  Saturday, Feb. 24, the Times has published articles that raise the same  question about soccer in the United States. At least Durslag's point of view  was relatively positive, and didn't make any statements that were patently  wrong to anyone who knows anything about soccer.  </P> <P> When I was in high school here in Los Angeles 30 years ago, soccer was unknown.  Twelve years ago, through my kids playing AYSO, I started to learn about the  game. Now I coach and referee AYSO, and referee L.A. City and CIF high school  games, and play in an over-30 league.  </P> <P> Soccer is an incredible game from every angle except maybe a TV advertiser's  point of view. But without that TV exposure and the proper promotion, it's just  going to take that much longer. It's a pity that the opportunity afforded the  United States to promote soccer through hosting the 1994 World Cup is being  squandered.  </P> <P> STEPHEN G. VINER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

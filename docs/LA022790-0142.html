			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREW SAVED AFTER FINNISH BOAT CAPSIZES IN ROUND THE WORLD RACE  </P> <P> The 16-member crew of the Finnish entry Martela was rescued Monday after the  81-foot sloop lost its keel and capsized 150 miles off the coast of South  America on the fourth leg of the Whitbread Round the World Race.  </P> <P> Martela, skippered by Markku Wiikeri, has been having trouble with its keel  since the first leg of the race in September.  </P> <P> The keel was refitted to the German Frers design in Montevideo, Uruguay, but  the bolts worked loose again.  </P> <P> The boat was in fourth place, 350 miles out from Punta del Este, Uruguay, when  the keel let go shortly after noon. Conditions were moderate -- 15 knots of  wind and three-foot seas -- but the sudden loss of ballast caused the boat to  roll upside down. After broadcasting an emergency distress signal, some of the  crew scrambled onto the bottom of the hull and others went into inflated rafts.  </P> <P> The nearest boats, Merit and Charles Jourdan, altered course to pick up the  crew about 4 1/2 hours later. Those two boats will receive credit for the time  lost and for extra crew transported to Punta del Este.  </P> <P> Steinlager 2 of New Zealand continued to lead the 23-boat fleet and was  expected to reach Punta del Este late Monday. The 84-foot ketch won the first  three legs and led another New Zealand entry, Fisher &amp; Paykel, by 70  nautical miles as the 32,932-nautical mile race neared its two-thirds point.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ravil Mustafin: "What Lies Behind the Arrest of </F> the Ames'"]    [Excerpts] CIA officer Aldrich Hazen Ames, 52, was  arrested on his way to work. His wife Maria was arrested at  home. The Ames are accused of spying for the former USSR and  for Russia for nearly nine years. [passage omitted]    In principle the arrest of a foreign agent is not that rare  an event in the invisible war the various special services have  been waging among themselves for many centuries. But the arrest  of the Ames caused, perhaps, an overreaction in the United  States. In Moscow U.S. Ambassador Pickering made an official  protest to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Lavrov. In  Washington Secretary of State Christopher asked those Russian  diplomats who had been in contact with the Ames' to leave the  United States quietly, as it were. President Clinton, who, as  it happens, was aware that U.S. counterintelligence had had the  Ames under surveillance for 10 months, ordered administration  staffers to carry out a detailed analysis of the consequences of  the spies' activities for U.S. national security. Some senators  were calling for aid to Russia to be frozen.    According to our experts, there are several ways of  explaining the ballyhoo in the United States over the arrest of  the Ames. First and foremost it could be a wish on the part of  the U.S. special services to obtain one-sided advantages in  conducting intelligence on Russian territory. Actually, Russian  intelligence is doing no more in America than U.S. intelligence  is doing in Russia, according to one Foreign Intelligence  Service representative. Incidentally, CIA Director James  Woolsey has repeatedly stated that his department is keeping an  extremely close eye on Russia.    It is not inconceivable that the Ames case got such heavy  publicity in view of the exposure of more than 20 foreign,  including U.S. intelligence agents in Russia last year. They  included a Russian citizen, who, as Nikolay Golushko, director  of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, said in an IZVESTIYA  interview, had caused damage to Russian national security  interests comparable to the damage caused by former GRU officer  Penkovskiy, who was shot in 1963.    Some observers believe that the furor caused by the arrest  of  the Ames' is a kind of adverse reaction on the part of certain  U.S. circles to the shift of emphasis in Russian policy in the  Balkans.</p>

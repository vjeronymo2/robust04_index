			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Pay squeeze in public sector to include MPs MPS FACE the prospect of a small pay rise or a freeze next year as Whitehall officials confirmed yesterday that they could be subject to the same pressure on pay as other public-sector workers. Salaries for MPs, now Pounds 30,854, usually increase in line with those of senior civil servants, and were expected to rise by 3.9 per cent from January. But the Treasury is anxious that MPs should not be exempt from the financial curbs it will place on Whitehall departments. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to allow room in Thursday's Autumn Statement for pay rises for public-sector workers of, at best, 2 per cent and perhaps zero. The pay review bodies which recommend rises for groups such as teachers and nurses will not be suspended, but their recommendations are likely to be overruled if they breach the Treasury's strictures on finances. Mr Lamont and Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, will meet Conservative backbenchers before the Autumn Statement to brief them on the economic background against which spending and pay decisions have been taken. Mr John Major, the prime minister, will meet other Tory MPs tomorrow. One senior Whitehall official said yesterday: 'Because something is going to happen to public-sector pay in the Autumn Statement, something is going to have to happen to MPs' pay as well.' Future decisions are uncertain as civil servants' pay, on which MPs' salaries are based, is moving towards the increased use of performance pay. Any decision would almost certainly have to be approved by the Commons. By tradition MPs are given a free vote on the issue, but the economic background against which the decision will be taken could mean the government faces comparatively little difficulty in winning support for a low or zero settlement. One senior backbencher described a pay freeze for MPs as 'eminently sensible', adding: 'It would certainly set the right sort of example.' Many MPs were embarrassed by the row which erupted before the summer recess over increases in their allowances for office services. The government was defeated in its efforts to keep the rise to Pounds 4,000 by MPs who voted to increase allowances by Pounds 11,000. That might persuade them to accept smaller pay rises. Cohse, the health-service union, says in a report today that, contrary to government claims, public-sector workers - particularly health workers - have not been pulling ahead of private industry on the pay front.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] One hundred and forty six men belonging to the  second foreign paratroopers regiment abroad have left Calvi [in  Corsica] to relieve troops in Gabon. They may intervene in  Rwanda from there if the need arises. Indeed, they may be some  of the first French soldiers sent to that country should there  be a French intervention.</p>

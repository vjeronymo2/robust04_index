Leaders  of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) and  four other sectors related to information, electronics and  electrical machinery made the request during a breakfast meeting  with Hiroshi Kumagai, international trade and industry minister.    Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman of the EIAJ, while making a  severe assessment of business conditions surrounding his  industry, said the government should place top priority on  stimulating the economy.    Takashi Kitaoka, chairman of the Japan Electronic Industry  Development Association, sought an increased role by the  government in upgrading the information infrastructure in Japan,  particularly promotion of information networking.    The computer industry suffered a sharp setback in hardware  production for the second consecutive year, Kitaoka said.    Kumagai said his ministry is maximizing efforts for an early  recovery of Japanese business activity, for example, by  formulating a program to create new business. But structural  problems facing Japan's business sectors need to be solved  first, Kumagai said, noting such problems are partly responsible  for high material, personnel and production costs in Japan.    Tomoo Takahara, chairman of the Japan Information Service  Industry Association, said the ailing software industry is  pushing ahead with efficient relocation of white-collar workers  and revamping of overall business operations.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Daimler Benz agrees Fokker deal DAIMLER BENZ, Germany's largest industrial group, is to take control of Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker, in a deal that could trigger a restructuring of Europe's regional aircraft industry. The successful end to four months of talks is likely to put pressure on other manufacturers such as British Aerospace and Saab of Sweden to accelerate their efforts to find partners. At least nine manufacturers are chasing customers in an industry dogged by overcapacity. The total value of the deal was not revealed yesterday, but Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), a Daimler Benz subsidiary, has previously said it envisaged paying up to Fl 1bn (Pounds 312m) for the 51 per cent stake. Dasa will take its stake in Fokker through a new holding company which will buy the Dutch state's 32 per cent holding plus Fl 500m of new Fokker shares. A 22 per cent stake in the holding company will be sold back to the Dutch state, which will keep it for a maximum of three years. The holding company will own 51 per cent of Fokker, with the remainder continuing to be held by private and institutional shareholders. Dasa is also expected to sell stakes in the holding company to its partners in the Euroliner consortium, Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. Mr Koos Andriessen, the Dutch economic affairs minister, agreed the deal yesterday evening after an emergency parliamentary committee meeting which followed a marathon 20-hour negotiating session with the two companies' chairmen. The last obstacle was cleared when the Dutch government backed down over its demand to remain a shareholder in the company until the turn of the century. It will be entitled to appoint one member of Fokker's nine-member supervisory board for the next eight years. It also won guarantees that final assembly of aircraft will continue to take place in the Netherlands.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Balanced view is needed Sir, Reading the letter from the managing director of Cory Environmental (January 29), I was deafened by the sound of grinding axes. The fact that Mr Riddle's business depends on the continuing unsustainable use of packaging should not blind him to a balanced view of the issues. He accurately quotes the House of Lords select committee report with respect to packaging roast coffee. Unaccountably, he omits to quote another finding in the same report, to the effect that re-usable packaging such as returnable bottles uses one quarter of the energy of the single-use alternatives. Could this be because they do not end up being put in a hole in the ground, and therefore providing business for his company?

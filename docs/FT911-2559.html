			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Letter: Taxing arguments as seen from Britain's north and south (2) Sir, I wonder why the government decided to apply bands of taxation according to value of property. The added burden placed upon those living in the south-east is self evident and any system related to values will, by definition, involve the expense of valuation. A far more equitable refinement of the system would have been to create banding by property type  -terraced house with two bedrooms, moving up to terraced house with three bedrooms; semi-detached house with three bedrooms and so on. The implication seems to be that those in the south-east pay more for their homes because they can afford to, whereas in reality I wonder whether expendable income, having been saddled with the high cost of a house, is any higher than that of the north. I doubt whether southerners have the greater expendable income - in which case they are less able to pay the council tax than those occupying similar properties in the north.

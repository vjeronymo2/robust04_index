No withdrawal penalty would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing bidder has deposited with the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Default or disqualification after close of auction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If a high bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close of such an auction, the defaulting bidder will be subject to the penalty in paragraph (a)(1) of this section plus an additional penalty equal to three (3) percent of the subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the defaulting bidder's bid amount, the 3 percent penalty will be calculated based on the defaulting bidder's bid amount. These amounts will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the defaulting or disqualified bidder has deposited with the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) When the Commission conducts single round sealed bid auctions or sequential oral auctions, the Commission may modify the penalties to be paid in the event of bid withdrawal, default or disqualification; provided, however, that such penalties shall not exceed the penalties specified above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In the case of single round bidding for narrowband PCS licenses: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If a bid is withdrawn before the Commission releases the initial public notice announcing the winning bidder(s), no bid withdrawal penalty will be assessed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission releases the initial public notice announcing the winning bidder(s), the bid withdrawal penalty will be equal to the difference between the high bid amount and the amount of the next highest valid bid.

Losing bidders will only be subject to this bid withdrawal penalty for a period of 30 days after the Commission releases the initial public notice announcing the winning bidders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In the case of oral sequential bidding for narrowband PCS licenses: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If a bid is withdrawn before the Commission has declared the bidding to be closed for the license bid on, no bid withdrawal penalty will be assessed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission has declared the bidding to be closed for the license bid on, the bid withdrawal penalty of &sect;1.2104(g) and paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section will apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;24.305  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Bidding application (FCC Form 175 and 175&hyph;S Short-Form). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All applicants for initial provision of narrowband PCS service must submit applications on FCC Forms 175 and 175&hyph;S pursuant to the procedures set forth in &sect;1.2105 of part 1 of this chapter.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ghassan al-'Atiyah, Editor in Chief of AL-MILAFF </F> AL-'IRAQI (The Iraqi File), London]    [Text] The Islamic al-Da'wah Party [IDP], which was founded  in 1957, is now considered (after the break-up and splitting of  the Communist Party) the foremost opposition party in Iraq's  political arena.    Since the end of World War II, the Iraqi opposition has been  dominated by three Iraqi party organizations in succession. The  Communist Party, which was persecuted by the government during  the monarchy period, played a leading opposition role during  'Abd-al-Karim Qasim's tenure. Later, it allied itself with Qasim  and began to persecute the opposition, then led by the Ba'th  Party. When the Ba'th Party obtained power in 1963, and later in  1968, it became the hangman of the opposition. During the  Ba'th's first stint in power, the Communist Party was its  victim. When the Ba'th came to power again in 1968, the IDP  became its victim.    The Communist Party, the Ba'th Party, and the IDP do share  some characteristics, despite the great differences between them.     -  Each has suffered at one time from persecution and has had  to adopt covert action to avoid repression and torture. This  situation has precluded the practice of democracy within their  respective ranks. These parties' leaders have thus engaged in  autocratic decisionmaking, arguing the need for such methods  because of exceptional circumstances.    -  Each of these parties claims to possess a comprehensive  ideology--be it Marxism, nationalism, or Islam--which confers on  its members the characteristic of an elite acting on behalf of  the proletariate, Arabism, or religion.    -  In relating to the people, each of these parties views itself  as the guardian of the people, believing that it knows best what  is in the people's interests.    -  Each of their ideologies extends  beyond Iraq's borders. In many cases, their ideological and even  organizational authority is abroad: in Moscow in the name of the  International, in Damascus or Cairo in the name of Arabism, or  in Tehran in the name of Islam.    -  Each of these parties has used force to achieve its  objectives,  thereby entrenching the principle that the ends justify the  means. As soon as they attain power or come to share power, they  liquidate others and persecute allies of yesterday. The  Communist Party fought the Ba'th, which was its ally in the  National Front opposing the monarchy. The Ba'th has begun to  persecute clerics to whom it had frequently appealed in its  fight against the Communist Party and communism during  'Abd-al-Karim Qasim's tenure. For example, the family of Muhsin  al-Hakim, the supreme, Shiite religious authority, who issued a  religious ruling prohibiting communism in 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim's  tenure, later became the first victim of Ba'thist rule.       If political persecution creates its antithesis, the  organization's secret is its incubator.    The IDP's literature is limited. The lectures and writings  of  the martyr Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr remain an important reference  in this regard. Al-Sadr advocated mutual understanding and  dialogue with other forces. The statement of mutual  understanding issued by the party in the early eighties, before  the Iraqi-Iranian War, is an example of this thinking. It  appears in a pamphlet issued by the party in London in March  1992 entitled "Our Program": "This statement of mutual  understanding issued in the early eighties makes allowance for  the numerous special characteristics of the Iraqi people's  social composition and active political forces. It calls on all  of these political groups to take up the mission of saving the  Iraqi people and preserving Iraq's independence and territorial  integrity." This positive, political tendency changed after the  Iraqi-Iranian War broke out. The IDP dropped its efforts to  achieve an alliance with secular Iraqi forces. Instead, it  adopted the Iranian formula, as represented in the Supreme  Islamic Revolution Council in Iraq in 1982, in which the IDP was  an active member.    During the Iranian-Iraqi War (1980-1988), the IDP adopted an  organizational and ideological trend--perhaps in keeping with  political currents in Iran at the time--of hostility to any  un-Islamic Iraqi political party or force. In this regard, it  borrowed some notions, quoted below, from a book published in  Iran to indoctrinate IDP members entitled Islamic Call  Education, Political Section (published by the IDP, first  edition 1984).    Under the heading of "Theory of Political Action in Islam,"  the following is stated in said book:    "It was natural that the IDP--like other sincere, Islamic  movements and groups--would find the political environment  contaminated with accusations, vanities, and attempts to mislead  public opinion, the most important of which are the following:  (...)    "6. The propagation of a flood of parties, theories,  concepts, terms, and entities based on nationalist or patriotic  democratic, capitalist programs, or on theoretical Marxist and  socialist principles. Such parties, politicians, educational and  cultural academies, and political thinking are all designed to  run counter to Islam and to fundamentally destroy and weaken  Islam's influence among the people through various techniques  and means.    "7. Several emaciated entities linked to European and  American colonialism, which purport to be Islamic or to promote  Islamic government.    "8. Political entities and leaders who claim to be sincere,  to defend the nation's causes, and to act to liberate and  develop the nation. They side with the procession of colonialism  and are linked with it ideologically and politically. Examples  of this type of ruler and entity are 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim, Gamal  Abdel Nasser, and national and crusader movements, e.g., the  Ba'th and the like.    "It was incumbent upon al-Da'wah to make plans to confront  this aggregate and these circumstances and thus bring the people  of the nation through the clouds and blocked visibility to  clarity, understanding, and sound political awareness." (pp  16-18)    Under the heading, "Capitalism's Means for Implementing Its  Goals," the following is stated:    "[Among these means are] the fabrication of regimes,  parties,  and international organizations to safeguard colonialist  interests. Examples of this include parties throughout the  Islamic world and Latin America that have adopted European  thought and capitalist culture--including laws, regulations, and  morals--as a foundation and modus operandi. Other examples are  provided by parties that have adopted change by introducing  ideas and slogans consistent with the people's environment and  nature, e.g., socialism, nationalism, patriotism, and perhaps  false Islamic slogans at times. Examples of international  organizations and laws that serve colonialist interests are the  United Nations, the Arab League, the Nonaligned Movement, the  OAU (...) and international law, the law of the veto...etc." (pp  32-43)    Under the heading, "Foundations and Premises of Islamic  Political Thought," is the following:    "[In taking] a wary, skeptical view of what is issued by  movements, entities, and personalities which are non-Islamic,  anonymous, or which have a disquieting past, the principle  regarding those which are non-Islamic is that they are suspect  and untruthful in their action. The principle in dealing with  someone of doubtful identity and intentions, who acts, or seeks  cooperation, under the heading of Islam, is caution and  circumspection in circumstances in which we fear infiltration  and political deception, in the absence of evidence that proves  his sound intentions and pure identity." (pages 57-58)    Under the heading, "Theoretical Goals of Political Action,"  it is said that "the IDP has identified infiltration after  analyzing the types of agents and infiltrators. It concluded  that anyone who has not propagandized Islam and promoted its  slogan truthfully and sincerely is a linked agent, whether or  not he is actually linked, because he must always swim in an  international environment created by colonialism, act on the  basis of the arrogant powers' policy and interests, and advocate  the colonialist imports of democracy, socialism, nationalism,  communism, etc. In any case, he is only a part of the political  equation dictated by the colonialist policy planners." (p 77)    The second Gulf war was a turning point for Iraqi political  action in general and Islamic parties in particular. These  forces had hoped that the second Gulf war would succeed where  the first Gulf war had failed by toppling the dictatorial regime  in Iraq. The Islamic forces pinned great hopes on the March 1991  revolt. However, the international and regional calculus  precluded the success of that revolt. In its review of the  revolt, the IDP states, regarding the position taken by  countries in the region:    "The regional position was not better than the international  position. Some governments in the region took pleasure in the  tragedy that occurred in Iraq. Others displayed anxiety over the  people's revolt; they feared the next regime, because it would  represent the Iraqi people's will."    Regarding Iran's position, the IDP states in its review:  "Countries which the Iraqi people had hoped would hasten to  support it in its trial during the revolt, especially those  countries which were a victim of the regime's crimes and hostile  policies, did not rise to the occasion by providing what was  essential to a people being harmed by hunger brought on by a  bloody, savage regime" (the pamphlet, "Our Program," March 1992,  p 39).    This analysis reflects the IDP's difference with Iran, which  apparently goes back to before the second Gulf war, when Iran  selected Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim instead of the IDP to head the  Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, which was set  up as a framework for political action in opposition to the  Iraqi regime. The IDP continued to be a member of the council,  though only nominally.    After the second Gulf war, the IDP opened--under the heading  of flexibility--to the neighboring Arab countries, specifically  Saudi Arabia. A delegation of IDP leaders visited Saudi Arabia  on more than one occasion to meet with senior Saudi officials.  In consonance with the orientations of Syria, Saudi Arabia, and  several other Iraqi political forces, the party joined the  preparatory committee laying the ground for a congress of the  Iraqi opposition in Beirut in March 1991. It subsequently became  an active member in the joint action committee and cooperated  with the group that attended the Vienna congress (in June 1992).  However, at the last minute, it announced that it would not  participate in the congress for procedural, formal reasons  pertaining to the timing of the congress and allocation of  [representational] proportions among the political forces in the  committees. Nonetheless, the IDP continued to cooperate with the  parties that participated in the Vienna congress, which was  crowned, at the Salah-al-Din and Shaqlawah meeting on 22-27  September 1992, in a joint agreement to hold an enlarged Iraqi  opposition congress with the participation of the Islamic  parties, including the IDP. In October 1992, the Iraqi National  Congress was held at Salah-al-Din, Irbil, with the participation  of the IDP, which joined the congress's executive council under  the chairmanship of Dr. Ahmad Chalabi.  <H5>  The IDP Withdraws From the National Congress </H5>   In late August 1993, the IDP announced that it was  withdrawing from the Iraqi National Congress, a move that had  been hinted quietly for some time.    This announcement, and statements made by party leaders,  were  general and avoided specifics, which prompts a number of  observations:     -  Because the Iraqi National Congress was known for its  alliance with the West, specifically America, before the Irbil  congress was convened, some Iraqi political forces and  personalities boycotted the congress, but the IDP attended it.    -  The IDP's reservations regarding several leaders of the  Congress can be overcome through the application of internal  regulations and the holding of free elections. In this regard,  one asks why the IDP did not wait for, or request, the  convocation of the congress's national assembly to discuss all  of its reservations candidly and clearly, instead of alluding to  unaddressed reservations? For the Congress leaders' failure to  convene the national assembly, or their refusal to convene it  for any reason, would be a mistake that would put the National  Congress on the popular, democratic touchstone to which it lays  claim.    -  The IDP's solitary exit from the Congress, without  coordinating  with the other participating forces, at least the other Islamic  forces, weakens the IDP movement, especially in the Islamic  milieu. Moreover, it entrenches division within the Islamic  house. Here, a question arises: How can one speak of the  opposition's unity when a primary group in the Islamic movement  fails to at least unify Islamic ranks?    -  Since the second Gulf war, accessibility and political  flexibility--which are necessary at times, provided that the  party and its leaders are clear about their objectives--have not  been seen in the IDP's course. The party is intransigent in  negotiations and in indoctrinating its members, and it rejects  others. However, publicly, in the Arab world and  internationally, it speaks of unity and a consolidation of  forces. At the same time that it rejects colonialism and all  arrogant powers, it seeks justifications for cooperating with  Western powers and America, and it enters into political  alliances with forces that are proteges of the West and America.  These contradictions must necessarily be reflected in the  party's ranks and bases. It may be that the main reason for the  IDP's withdrawal from the Unified Iraqi National Congress is its  desire to overcome an internal crisis.    -  Some IDP leaders justify cooperation with the Congress,  despite  its Americanness, with the argument that it is the only  available auspices for toppling Saddam Husayn through a military  coup that ushers in a transitional government that moves Iraq  toward popular, Islamic rule. Therefore, the IDP agreed to a  role in the National Congress that is not in proportion to its  popularity, and it is also speaking moderately in the hope of  eliminating the charge of "terrorism" against it, all of this in  the hope that the U.S. administration will continue Bush's  declared course of calling for Saddam's ouster. However, today,  after Bill Clinton's advent, Saddam's ouster no longer tops the  U.S. agenda. Consequently, the IDP no longer sees any  justification for remaining in the Iraqi National Congress.    -  The IDP's options have shrunk. Iran recognizes the Supreme  Council of the Islamic Revolution and is interested in the  survival of the Iraqi National Congress, which, for the first  time, has given a Shiite political current a preeminent position  in the Arab sphere. Also, the Kurds' approval of the National  Congress formula means that they will stick with the Iraqi  formula and not realize Iran's fear of Kurdish separatism. On  the other hand, by withdrawing from the National Congress, the  IDP loses an effective opposition pole represented by the Kurds.  Action in the field in Iraq is impossible without these two  arenas, unless Syria agrees to undertake active political  action, which is not substantiated by events, inasmuch as Syria  is now occupied with the Israeli, Palestinian, and Lebanese  file, and any uncalculated change in Iraq might result in an  alternate [regime] or political situation that does not serve  Syria's current interests. In conclusion, re-examination,  review, and new formulae for taking action are needed.</p>

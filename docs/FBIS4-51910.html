			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- Yang Chong-mo, former  chairman of the Kukje-ICC Corp., has lost his legal bid to  overturn the sale in 1985 of 1.19 million stocks of Kukje Corp.  -- a subsidiary of Kukje-ICC -- to Hanil Systhetic Fiber Inc. Co.    A civil panel of the Seoul High Court ruled Wednesday that  Yang was not totally deprived of the right to express his will  when he contracted to sell the stocks to Hanil, meaning the  contract is valid.    The face value of the 1.19 million Kukje Corp. stocks is  5.99 billion won (about 7.42 million U.S. dollars).    The court decided that if a certain legal action is to be  canceled or rendered invalid because it was committed under  duress, such duress should be so strong that, as in Yang's case,  the right to express one's free will should have been deprived  totally.    "But after examining the detailed process of handing the  stocks over to Hanil, the court cannot judge that Yang's freedom  to express his will was deprived perfectly. The contract is  therefore valid," the decision read.    Although the Constitutional Court ruled last July that the  dismantling of the Kukje Group was unconstitutional because it  came about due to unjust exercise of government power, the  contract cannot be considered as being necessarily related to  any abuse of government authority, the court said.    "So the contract itself is not a legal action of an  anti-social nature."    Yang brought the lawsuit in April 1988, accusing senior  government officials including then-Finance Minister Kim  Man-chae of coercing him to sell all stocks in the Kukje Group's  trade and footwear areas. Yang said the officials told him this  was the wish of a high-ranking official in the Chon Tu-hwan  government.    Yang lost the first trial as the court ruled that he had not  been under such duress as to be perfectly deprived of the  freedom to express his will, prompting him to appeal to the high  court.</p>

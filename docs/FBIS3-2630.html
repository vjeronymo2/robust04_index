Ernst] </F>   [Text] After six months of currency stability, the  renminbi is coming under renewed selling pressure on black  markets around the country. In Beijing, black market traders  were yesterday buying dollars at a rate of US$1 to Rmb8.88, a  premium of more than 2 percent on the local swap market and  almost 5 percent on rates, inclusive of commission, offered by  banks.    In Guangzhou and Shanghai, black market rates were lower,  ranging between Rmb8.80 and Rmb8.83 to the dollar, but traders'  expectations were that dollars are set to become more expensive.  "Suddenly a lot of people want dollars and there aren't enough  around," a black market dealer in Beijing said.    Until two weeks ago, black market rates for dollars had  remained in line with the Rmb8.7 to the dollar rate at which  China unified its currency on January 1. But change has come  quickly. Black market rates in Beijing have moved to Rmb8.8 to  the dollar over the past 10 days. Official bank rates, which  follow prices in China's swap centres, have remained unchanged.  The People's Bank of China, the central bank, and the State  Administration of Exchange Controls manipulate dollar rates in  the swap markets by controlling access to the market and by  setting price limits. Swap centres opened yesterday at Rmb8.68  to the dollar.    "The return of the black market is a sign that in economic  terms things are going in the wrong direction," a Beijing-based  diplomat said. "At these levels there is no need for dire  concern, but the government should take it as an early warning."    At current rates, the black market is already likely to draw  tourists, expatriates and small companies with dollar revenues  away from China's banks and swap centres. "The vast majority of  companies won't be tempted to break the law," the diplomat said.  "But if we get a spread of 5 to 10 percent, there could be a  serious problem."    Trading volumes in China's black markets are at present  reckoned to be tiny compared with that of the swap centres, but  the black market dollar rate has an important psychological  role. Any depreciation of the renminbi on the black market  brings pressure to bear on the People's Bank of China to allow  depreciation of swap market rates.    Bankers in Beijing and Shanghai yesterday pointed to two  main  reasons for the renminbi's sudden black market depreciation.  The first is an increase in money supply in the last quarter of  1993. This liquidity is now feeding through into the economy and  more renminbi is chasing a static supply of hard currency. The  second factor is inflation, currently at over 20 percent in the  big cities, which means people do no want to hang on to renminbi.    None of the bankers yesterday would hazard a guess as to  where the black market dollar rate is headed. Black market  traders themselves said the momentum was upwards.    The free market, however, is likely to receive visits from  the police if it continues to operate at official expense.</p>

These tests shall include, but not be limited to, the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Lightning strikes, such as multiple-stroke and multiple-burst <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Pin-injected tests to appropriate wave forms and levels <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) HIRF susceptibility tests <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Be demonstrated by analysis/tests that associated software is designed and implemented to prevent errors that would result in an unacceptable change in propeller pitch or an unsafe condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Be designed and constructed so that a failure or malfunction of electrical or electronic components in the propeller control system will not prevent safe operation of any remaining propeller that is installed on the aircraft. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Burlington, Massachusetts, on October 27, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jay Pardee, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Manager, Engine and Propeller Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27291 Filed 11&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

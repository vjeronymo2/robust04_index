			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreigners climb aboard the Lima rollercoaster - Peru's fast growing market Foreign investment is the driving force behind Lima's small, but lively bolsa. Since March 18, when Peru finally normalised relations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, and became re-eligible for loans, both daily volume and the general shares index have registered sharp increases. And foreign buyers account for around two-thirds of all activity. The long-awaited IMF approval for Peru's economic programme boosted the index by 18 per cent in a week, while volumes traded rose to around USDollars 5.5m a day, an all-time record. However, the market's equity capitalisation had already jumped from USDollars 1.4bn at the end of 1991 to Dollars 2.6bn 12 months later. The Lima bolsa was the second most profitable in the world last year, according to International Finance Corporation figures - up 125 per cent in dollar terms and streets ahead of all other Latin American stock markets. Leading Peruvian brokers are predicting a similar performance this year. 'It's the confidence factor,' says Mr Jose Luque Otero, president of the Lima bolsa's board. 'The rules of the game are clear and foreign investors appreciate that.' Like all emerging markets, Lima has proved highly vulnerable to political ups and downs. Just when foreign investors were starting to bring money in early last year, attracted by a wave of reforming legislation which transformed Peru into one of the world's least-regulated markets, President Fujimori dissolved Congress and suspended the constitution. The stock market plunged into recession, the index declining steadily for six months. Then September's surprise capture of the Shining Path guerrilla chief and other high-ranking leaders dramatically reversed the trend. For the past seven months, with only a slight hiccup when the economy minister was changed, the index has soared. Now, a year after the 'Fujicoup', formal democracy has been restored and both the president and his radical economic reform programme appear more secure than ever. Mr Fujimori's personal popularity exceeds 60 per cent, the privatisation process is being accelerated and direct foreign investment, particularly from Asia and Latin America, is getting under way. Two specific factors are expected to bolster the bolsa this year and next. First, the government's privatisation office has announced sales totalling between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 1.4bn before year's end. In some, the stock exchange will play an important role, as it did in the sell-off of six smallish state companies last year. The other element which will stimulate bolsa activity this year is the start-up of new private pension funds, known as AFPs. Designed along the lines of the successful Chilean model, Peruvian AFPs will begin operating in June. In the short-term, AFPs are expected to capture around Dollars 500m a year. Of that, experts calculate that Dollars 120m will go into the stock market, immediately boosting daily volumes by around 15 per cent. Because of the size of the Lima bolsa, this could exert important upward pressure on prices. Currently, almost 300 companies are quoted, but regular trading is confined to about a dozen; there have been weeks when only two stocks have accounted for one-third of all trading. One headache for the investor picking a likely company is the unreliability of balance sheets. Until 1991, hyperinflation played havoc with figures and serious comparative studies are still impossible. 'You simply have to resort to strategies like counting how many bags of cement or crates of beer they're selling,' says one fund manager. Lima's blue chip shares include the two main breweries, Backus and Johnston and Compania Nacional de Cerveza (CNC); two cement companies; the large privately-owned Banco de Credito and the Lima telephone company, CPT. The state's holdings in CPT and the finance companies are due for sell-off later this year and trading has been heavy. In recent weeks, however, star performers have been mining shares. Minerals account for half of Peru's annual exports but the over-valued Sol has kept the sector badly depressed for the past two years. Now, with the prospect of a 10 per cent devaluation on 1993 after a similar rate last year, investors are looking seriously at mining shares again. The government is claiming that the country's prolonged recession has now bottomed out. GDP is set to rise between 3.5 and 5 per cent this year, with inflation likely to stay under 50 per cent, low by Peruvian standards.</p>

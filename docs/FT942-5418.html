			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / The Long View: Chaos theory for bonds For anyone who lived through the second half of the 1970s the past few days in the markets have felt curiously familiar. With apologies to Henry Ford, history, in this instance, is funk not bunk. Bond investors are on strike again and the Bank of England has been forced to disinter exotic kinds of IOU to coax these fickle folk back. Its latest offering consists of a 7 per cent convertible - a throwback if ever there was one. Meantime inflation worriers are in a panic over shortages of steel and paper in the UK. All that is missing is the presence of the International Monetary Fund. If only the IMF would come back. It was much more forgiving than a liberalised and empowered global market, and you could at least argue with its poker-faced officials. Even the Bundesbank was punished by investors earlier this week for daring to cancel an issue of bonds. The backwash from this stand-off was felt across Europe and caused British gilts and equities to wobble. Yet the Bundesbank has less reason than most to decline to raise money at current rates. With German inflation running at around 3 per cent and 10 year bonds yielding just over 7 per cent, the real rate of interest in Germany is about 4 per cent. If that sounds tough, look at Sweden, where the comparable rate is 7 per cent, or the UK, where the equivalent figure is close to 6 per cent, or France, where it is not far short of that. These numbers are potentially ruinous for government borrowers and constitute a pre-emptive strike against inflationary pressures that are still remote at this early stage of European economic recovery. And if bond yields continue to rise, they could threaten to turn recovery back into recession, especially in continental Europe. Since February, when market strategists reached for their books on chaos theory, the bond markets seem to have been obsessed with historic performance rather than future prospects. German bonds have been a safe haven in Europe, with yields rising less than others in the Group of Seven industrialised countries apart from Japan. Britain is in the financial doghouse. Its bond yields have risen further than any in the G7, while its equities have been treated as though they fell into the emerging market category. They have fallen more than all the others including the US, which is at a more advanced stage in the economic recovery. Does it really deserve this dismal rating? For all the markets' post-February suspicions of Kenneth Clarke, UK fiscal policy remains undeniably tough. The new macho regime at the Bank of England is joining with the markets in stiffening the chancellor's sinews on the monetary front. The best of the disinflation story may now be over, but the panic about renewed inflation is surely overdone. The one genuine cause for concern is the recent rise in earnings, which is not solely due to inflated City bonuses. But for the moment that looks like being off-set by the continuing squeeze on prices in the shops. And that great engine of British inflation, the housing market, is quiescent. It was good to see the Halifax Building Society revising downwards its house price forecast this week. As for those bottlenecks in industry, a market that worries about shortages of steel, the product of an industry plagued with subsidies and Europe-wide overcapacity, is plain loopy. Compare and contrast with Germany, where fiscal policy remains loose and monetary policy looks increasingly suspect. Having built its credibility on adherence to money supply targetry, and having argued last year that to abandon the credo would alienate the foreign investors who were financing a majority of the fiscal deficit, the Bundesbank has suddenly lost its faith. Whether you think that growth in M3 really is excessive or not, the fact that the German central bank has changed its biggest tune when the money numbers are soaring does little for its credibility. Moreover, the timing of the recent big cuts in the discount and Lombard rates, with a Christian Democrat boss, Hans Tietmeyer, in charge and federal elections due in October, looks highly suspect. The economy, meantime, is recovering more quickly than expected after the mildest of recessions at the end of a huge boom. Capacity utilisation is rising. The Bundesbank signally failed to reduce inflation below 3 per cent in the recession. If this is the definition of a safe haven for bond investors, then the times are wildly out of joint. All this suggests that the 1 3/4 point gap between 10-year gilt yields and German Bunds is excessive. Real bond yields in Britain and much of Europe are at attractive levels for investors. Yet there is minimal activity in the cash markets and those investors who have chanced their arm in futures and options have retired hurt. What could change market sentiment for the better? Clearly there can be no going back to the peaks seen in 1993. The bond markets were suffering from a speculative overshoot. Moreover, the rise in the yield on index-linked gilts points to a genuine increase in the global cost of capital. This reflects not only the structural budget deficits of the developed world, but the increasing demands being made on the global pot by fast-growing countries in Asia and in the former communist bloc. Yet the present high level of bond yields is also a result of the immobilisation of international capital flows. Investors in the world's last big creditor country, Japan, are sitting on a rising cash mountain. They worry about political uncertainty at home and the weakness of the dollar against the yen. The preconditions for both a bond and equity market boost may thus be a dollar recovery, prompted by further rises in US interest rates, and the reactivation of Japanese capital outflows. Signs of slower economic growth in the US would also help. Until then keep the book on chaos theory beside the bed.</p>

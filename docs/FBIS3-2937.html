Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)  Standing Committee and a member of the Political Bureau Standing  Committee of the party Central Committee, said that at present  more laws are being formulated to govern and ensure the smooth  advance of the country's reform, opening to the outside world  and establishment of a socialist market economy.    Qiao made the remarks in a group discussion of the Inner  Mongolia delegation attending the ongoing session of the eighth  NPC.    Qiao admitted that China's legislation lagged behind social  and economic development despite noticeable achievements made  over the past 15 years. Legislation should be speeded up to  keep pace with development of the socialist market economy, he  added. Qiao also called on local people's congresses to  formulate more regulations in line the constitution and state  laws.    People's congresses at various levels and their standing  committees have the responsibility to supervise the work of  governments and courts and procuratorates, Qiao said, adding  that the ongoing deliberation of the government work report by  deputies is not only a form of supervision but also a exercise  of democracy.    In his speech Qiao also touched China's system of  establishing minorities autonomous regions and economic  development in areas densely populated by minority people.    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a region with good unity  among different ethnic groups. The autonomy system introduced  since the founding of New China has proved correct and conforms  with China's conditions and also accords with the common wishes  of the people and their fundamental interests. The system has  helped boost local economies and retain ethnic cultural and  tradition which are the common wealth of the Chinese nation.  The Chinese nation should carry forward the good tradition of  maintaining national unity and safeguarding the national  unification, he said.    On regional economy, Qiao Shi said that Inner Mongolia has  witnessed great progress politically, economically, culturally  and in terms of national unity over the past 40-odd years. And  the region could make full use of its rich resources and take  advantage of the good relations among various ethnic groups to  strive for greater achievements.    Qiao Shi expressed his appreciation of deputies' clear  understanding of and support to the general task of correctly  handling the relations between reform, development and  stability, which is the theme of the session. Every reform  measure has undergone meticulous consideration before it is put  into effect, Qiao said, adding the measures would also be  improved in implementation.    China's reform began from the coastal areas to gain  experience and then proceeded to expand to other areas because  of China's uneven development. Historically, the inland areas  had been comparatively underdeveloped. However, so long as  these areas give full play to their advantages, their gap with  the coastal areas would be narrowed and common prosperity would  finally be realized.</p>

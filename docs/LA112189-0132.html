			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE'S STIRLING AND RABBITT GAIN NCAA ALL-AMERICAN HONORS  </P> <P> Brigid Stirling and Buffy Rabbitt of UC Irvine earned All-American honors  Monday at the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's cross-country  championships Monday.  </P> <P> Stirling, a senior, finished the 5,000-meter course in 17 minutes 16.5 seconds  for 24th place. Rabbitt, a junior who also earned All-American honors as a  freshman in 1987, ran 17:22.52. She finished 29th.  </P> <P> The Irvine women, who entered the meet ranked 12th in the nation, finished 10th  overall. Rounding out Irvine's top five were freshman Rayna Cervantes, 75th in  17:59.32, junior Amy Dabul (118th in 18:23.35) and freshman Laurie Lucas (129th  in 18:31.28).  </P> <P> "I'm very, very happy," Irvine Coach Vince O'Boyle said. "We've been bouncing  between seventh and 10th all year long in the rankings. . . . It's a super  effort, a great effort. And having two All-Americans in one year from one  program, I'm awfully happy with that. This is a young team -- Brigid is the  only senior -- so the future looks outstanding."  </P> <P> Vicki Huber, a 1988 Olympian in the 3,000 meters, won the women's race in  15:59.86 -- the fastest time in nine years of women's NCAA competition -- to  lead Villanova to the team title with 99 points. Kentucky was second with 168  and Nebraska third with 186.  </P> <P> In the men's competition, John Nuttall and Jonah Koech of Iowa State finished  1-2 to lead the Cyclones to the men's title with 54 points. Oregon was second  with 72.  </P></p>

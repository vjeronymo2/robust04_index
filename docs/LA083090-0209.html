			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FUNDAMERICA'S FOUNDER ORDERED TO GIVE UP PASSPORT  </P> <P> The Florida judge presiding over a criminal case against FundAmerica founder  Robert T. Edwards ordered the Newport Beach resident to surrender his passport  Wednesday but denied the prosecution's request to increase his $1-million bail.  </P> <P> Edwards is facing charges of organized fraud, securities fraud and running an  illegal lottery or pyramid scheme in Florida. Authorities claim that  FundAmerica bilked consumers out of $8.2 million. If convicted, Edwards could  receive 65 years in jail.  </P> <P> Florida's statewide prosecutor sought to increase Edward's bail because of  concern he might flee the United States. In seeking the increase, authorities  noted that he had wired more than $11 million to foreign entities before his  arrest last month and that he had a prior record of trouble with authorities on  three continents.  </P> <P> But Circuit Court Judge Robert Conrad decided the $1-million bail was  sufficient.  </P> <P> The judge, however, placed a few additional restrictions on Edwards, who is  living in a rented home near Balboa Island. For instance, Edwards, 49, had to  surrender his passport and must provide the court with an itinerary at least 72  hours in advance before returning to his native Canada.  </P> <P> Edwards' appearance in court in Orlando marked his first public appearance  since his arrest July 19.  </P> <P> FundAmerica is under investigation in several states, including California, for  allegedly operating illegal pyramid schemes. Florida is the only jurisdiction  which has filed formal charges against the company.  </P> <P> The company -- which recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from  creditors -- has tried to distance itself from its former president, including  cutting off all communications with him.  </P> <P> FundAmerica's new management has steadfastly maintained that the company is a  legitimate business. Company officials describe it as a consumer club offering  members discounts on services such as travel and long-distance phone calls.  </P> <P> Besides the criminal charges, Edwards is facing the prospect of paying a $20.4  million fine sought earlier this week by Florida Atty. Gen. Bob Butterworth.  </P> <P> He has until Sept. 4 to contest the attorney general's administrative action  judgment. Edwards has said they will fight Butterworth's action and seek to  litigate the matter in court.  </P> <P> Edwards is scheduled to be arraigned today on the criminal charges, and a trial  date is expected to be set.  </P> <P> "Mr. Edwards intends to stay and vigorously fight these serious charges," his  attorney, Neal Sonnett, said in a statement. "We look forward to the trial of  this case, and total vindication."  </P></p>

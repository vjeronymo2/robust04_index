			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Presov, East Slovakia, March 27 (CTK) -- The  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) today called on the  present government coalition not to drive the critical situation  to a head but stick to political culture. In a statement from a  two-day HZDS conference which ended today, the HZDS urged the  government to halt dismissals of state functionaries for  political reasons.    HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar delivered a closing speech to  the conference, but journalists were not briefed about its  details. At a press conference earlier in the day, Meciar hinted  his speech would analyze the situation in Slovakia since the  June 1992 parliamentary election to date. He said that  shortcomings which appeared in HZDS activities in that period  were due to peoples' failures but also discrepancies in the  system. Meciar said that the HZDS had approved a positive  manifesto as a basis for a future government programme, and  elected leading officials who would implement it.    The HZDS conference approved new statutes whose wording  brings the movement's activity closer to that of a political  party.</p>

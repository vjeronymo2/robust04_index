			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 28 (TANJUG) - Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday gave the government positive marks  for the first 100 days in office.    He said he was convinced that, with popular support, the  cabinet of Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic stood a good  chance of success in the implementation of the Yugoslav economic  recovery programme. Serbia, together with Montenegro, forms  Yugoslavia.    Milosevic received Marjanovic and his cabinet on the  occasion  of their 100 days in office. Milosevic said the government had  been consistent in the application of the economic recovery  programme, which was launched on January 24 and is being  implemented at federal level. Milosevic described as  achievements unrivalled in years the rise in industrial and  agricultural production and elimination of the budget deficit  recorded in the past three months. Marjanovic, for his part,  said that industrial production had risen by 18.6 per cent from  January to May 1994. The stocks of finished goods are melting  down, which means that the output is not being stock-piled, but  absorbed by the market, he added.    Milosevic said that another of the government's achievements  was that it had broken away from the legacy of decades of  bureaucratic rule and that the initial criticism that it was a  cabinet of technocrats had turned out to be an advantage.    The fact that it comprises a large number of former industry  executives has led to its breaking away from the bureaucratic  legacy of evading responsibility and has contributed to its  creative approach to dealing with problems, Milosevic said.    "I am sure that this kind of record after 100 days and this  kind of experience with which the government has embarked on  this crucial stage in the implementation of the economic  programme give it a good chance of success," he added.    Marjanovic said that the economic recovery programme was not  one intended to ensure merely the nation's survival, but also a  promotion of the market mechanisms and life in dignity in  conditions of international isolation.    Moreover, the programme lays the groundwork for an economic  boom after sanctions, Marjanovic said and added that the  government was giving results, that the programme had been  widely accepted and the people would not agree to any solution  that would take them back to the inflationary chaos of last  January.    "It remains for us at all times to unrequivocally defend,  protect and promote the healthy dinar as the pivot of our future  economic prosperity," Marjanovic said.</p>

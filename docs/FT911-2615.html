			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Bank initiative will tackle legal uncertainties in City THE BANK of England is launching an initiative to identify areas of legal uncertainty which could harm London's standing as an international financial centre. A committee of leading City figures and members of the legal profession will be chaired by Lord Alexander, chairman of the National Westminster Bank and a leading barrister. The initiative, spearheaded by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank Governor, will address problems arising from grey areas of the law. Most notorious is the local authority swaps affair where banks face losing hundreds of millions of pounds because of confusion in local authority law. Legal uncertainties have also posed difficulties in the stock lending market. The committee will have a full-time secretariat based at the Bank of England, and will include a senior Bank official and a lawyer on secondment from a City firm. It will be funded and supported by the Bank, the major UK banks and leading City law firms and will report to the Governor. It's first report will be within a year or earlier if there are pressing issues. The Bank says there is widespread City support for the committee. The City needs firm legal underpinnings to succeed as an international financial centre, particularly with mounting competition from centres on the Continent. Problems have arisen because the speed of innovation has left the law behind in some cases and because many City practices are based on tradition rather than the law. The Bank says that committee's remedies will try to avoid the need for new legislation. Where this is not possible, representations will be made to the government on the need to clarify the legal position. The committee includes representatives of foreign as well as UK banks. There are also representatives of the investment banking and fund management industries. The 11 members are Lord Alexander (NatWest), Gottfried Bruder (Commerzbank), Lachlan Burn (Linklaters &amp; Paines), Robin Fox (Kleinwort Benson), Mr Justice Hoffman, Charles McVeigh (Salomon), Humphrey Norrington (Barclays), Ian Plenderleith (Bank of England), Peter Stormonth Darling (Mercury Asset Management), Nicholas Wilson (NatWest), and Philip Wood (Allen &amp; Overy). The Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee of the House of Commons plans to give "further consideration" to the local authority swaps affair. Any further steps will be await the conclusion of the review of the affair by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. The Bank has urged retrospective legislation to regularise the swap transactions after the Law lords ruled that councils could not engage in swaps.</p>

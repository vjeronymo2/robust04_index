			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Arts: Players of promise in the PLG - Concert Every January the Park Lane Group sets about shaking off the sleepiness that grips London music over the new year period. Since 1956 the game plan for doing so has remained pretty well fixed: a five-evening series of chamber concerts in the Purcell Room, two each evening, in which young artists tackle choice varieties and careful combinations of 20th-century music. The 38th series (January 9-13) is under way. In advance one may have wondered - as one has tended to in recent years - whether the PLG formula had become tamely predictable, had even outlived its usefulness. But then Sunday's opening presentations brought on three young players of promise, each of whom one was glad to encounter for the first time, each of whom programmed a wide selection of (mainly) post-war music. The suspicion was once again proved unworthy and unjust, in the most satisfying of ways. The most remarkable of the three youngsters, Jonathan Kelly, was last year appointed principal oboe of the City of Birmingham Symphony. No wonder: he is a simply smashing player, an on-the-toes virtuoso whose delivery boasts a leaner timbre, a sharper definition to the line than is common with British woodwind players (no doubt the training under Maurice Bourgue in Paris had something to do with it). He made light, in both senses, of the musical and interpretative demands of two modern oboe-and-piano showpieces, Richard Rodney Bennett's After Syrinx I and Paul Patterson's Duologue (the trim rhythms of his pianist, Alison Procter, provided strong ballast). A new piece by Jonathan Dove, first of this year's PLG commissions, extended the range into long-breathed lyricism  -a short Irish-folksong fantasy, it is titled Music for a Lovelorn Lenanshee and combines craftsmanlike skill and salon-music charm. Thea Musgrave's Niobe for oboe and tape, its patterns no less elegantly threaded, completed the impression of fine-focused musicianship. For this player a bright future is easily predicted. For the two pianists - the Russian Olga Balakleets, who occupied the early-evening session, and Lisa Loh from Hong Kong, who rounded out the later one alongside Mr Kelly - the crystal ball is slightly cloudier. Still, both gave considerable pleasure. The first, assertive but never overbearing, keen in directing every musical current, made a particular success of Martin Butler's On the Rocks (1992), a fluent, somewhat wry-flavoured, always appealing tribute to Debussy's La Mer. The second, who stepped in to the series at a late stage in place of an ailing mezzo-soprano, revealed an unflappably cultivated touch and a sinuous sense of phrase in Dutilleux, Messiaen and the Canadian composer Francois Morel.

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Soviet party asks court to lift ban LEADERS of the now banned Communist Party of the Soviet Union, until a year ago the commanding political force in the former Soviet Union, yesterday told the Russian Constitutional Court that a continued ban on their party would foreshadow a dictatorship. The party officials included Mr Vladimir Ivashko, the former deputy general secretary. But Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former general secretary, was absent. The officials argued that the banning of the party by President Boris Yeltsin after the attempted coup last August was unconstitutional. The court ruled that a second suit lodged by Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, a senior Russian deputy, alleging that the party itself was unconstitutional, will be heard separately - in spite of an earlier decision to combine the two actions. Mr Victor Zorkaltsev, a former party official who represented the party, said the ban set a precedent which was sure to be used against other political parties and public movements. 'A ban on soviets (local councils) will follow that on the party, thus setting the conditions for an authoritarian takeover,' he said. Mr Yeltsin has said that the court might find 'certain slip-ups of a procedural nature' in his decrees, but added: 'Remember the atmosphere in which these decrees were adopted, and the emotional wave of popular support. It was probably the only course.' Moldova's parliament yesterday urged deployment of a multinational force to separate warring factions in the breakaway republic of Trans Dnestr, the eastern part of Moldova populated mostly by Russians and Ukrainians. It said the force should be composed of troops from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Romania and Bulgaria. Moldova was formerly part of Romania, while 100,000 ethnic Bulgarians live in Moldova.</p>

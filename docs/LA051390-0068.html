			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ECOLOGICAL GAMES FROM LOCAL SOURCE  </P> <P> I was surprised that the recent article on ecological games entirely missed a  local source ("Playing Games With Mother Nature," May 2). Animal Town Game Co.  in Santa Barbara has been producing and distributing games for more than 10  years, including wonderful board games that require players to cooperate to  save the whales or to grow an organic garden. Its catalogue is full of  ecological and earth-centered activities not available in stores.  </P> <P> KATHLEEN SHELDON, Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Turkey searches for central bank chief - Capital &amp; Credit The search is on for a central bank governor in Turkey following the resignation of Mr Bulent Gultekin last week. One man who fancies his chances is the head of the Treasury, Mr Osman Unsal, a 39-year-old former Citibanker well-known in the international bond market as the ringmaster of Turkey's foreign debt programme. A man with expensive tastes and who favours monogrammed cuffs on his shirts, Mr Unsal has one advantage over his peers: he can work with the prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller. This is something Mr Gultekin admitted he was unable to do. Unlike the former governor, Mr Unsal was quick to grasp that, as far as economic policy goes, it is Mrs Ciller who calls the shots. But then, she was his professor at university. In the wake of last month's liquidity crisis and the subsequent devaluation of the lira, Mr Unsal will need all his powers of persuasion to win over his critics, particularly the foreign banks which are reappraising Turkish risk. His debt plan has been to limit the government's domestic borrowing while increasing its foreign debt in an effort to edge down domestic interest rates. He has argued that the high level of domestic debt has been the main reason for Turkey's runaway budget deficit and inflation. He has shifted the emphasis from syndicated loans to bond issues. Having secured an investment-grade rating in 1992 from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the two leading credit rating agencies, Turkey has frequently tapped the Samurai market, Japan's domestic market for foreign borrowers, and has also issued Eurobonds in D-Marks and sterling. His strategy has helped diversify the investor base and improve the maturity and term structure of the national debt. The move may have curbed the volatility in debt servicing but the debt has risen rapidly. Total external borrowing - public and private - has increased to an estimated Dollars 64bn at the end of last year from Dollars 54bn at the end of 1992 and is forecast to reach Dollars 68bn in 1995. The policy has been driven by twin imperatives - to maintain reserves at a time of a large current account deficit and to avoid overloading the domestic capital market. Domestic rates have eased through much of 1993, helped by the decrease in domestic borrowing. In addition, the government cancelled the regular Wednesday auction of bills nine times in the past three months in an attempt to make the banks take longer-term paper. Sticking to this policy has required some nerve. On one occasion Mr Unsal telephoned to cancel the weekly auction while in mid-air to Japan, promising worried Treasury colleagues that he would return with 'a suitcase full of money'. This 'can-do,' sometimes cavalier, approach may have won him Mrs Ciller's admiration, but it has worried a number of Turkish and foreign economists. Some maintain it may have contributed to Turkey's recent currency crisis. Certainly, the catalyst for the run on the lira was the decision by the two rating agencies to downgrade Turkey's credit rating, in Moody's case to sub-investment grade. But by cancelling the auctions, the government deprived itself of one tool with which to control liquidity. When the Treasury also resorted to increasing advances from the central bank to finance the budget, the result was a market awash with lira. To bolster the lira, the authorities raised rates sharply. Interest on three-month bills rose to 99 per cent last week while interbank rates touched 600 per cent. What is more, the devaluation, which adds to Turkey's debt servicing, has put budget projections further out of kilter. While most of the government appears dazed by the events of the past two weeks, Mr Unsal has not lost his stride. This month, Turkey will raise a further Dollars 750m equivalent in the Samurai market. It intends to launch its first offering of global bonds which is expected to raise up to Dollars 1bn. How Mr Unsal salvages the situation is hard to predict. He has few friends within Turkey's powerful civil service. Many senior civil servants, jealous of his meteoric rise up the ranks thanks to Mrs Ciller's patronage, want him to be replaced. He does not have much support in parliament either. Members of parliament foiled an attempt by Mrs Ciller to secure him the job as head of the Treasury by drafting a special decree citing the rulebook on civil service appointments. This tactic showed up that Mr Unsal's years in the civil service were not sufficient to warrant such a senior position. Today he is still only acting under-secretary for the Treasury and foreign trade. However, to those who know him, his political ambition remains as strong as ever. As one former Citibank colleague put it: 'He was the only one of us who had a career plan and I don't think his plan is over'.</p>

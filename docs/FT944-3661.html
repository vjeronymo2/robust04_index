			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: Market focus on US data - Currencies Traders will this week focus on the deluge of US data to be released in the run-up to next Tuesday's policy meeting of the Federal Reserve. Expectations that the Federal Open Markets Committee would raise interest rates hardened last week after an appearance before Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman. The picture was subsequently muddied by the financial troubles of Orange County, California, prompting fears of systemic financial instability. This raises the prospect that the Fed will decline to tighten policy, to avoid aggravating financial weakness with higher interest rates. This could undermine the dollar, which has been supported recently by expectations of higher rates. Some observers argue that even on economic grounds the case to tighten is not proven. Mr Dave Munro, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics in New York, says the 1 per cent pace of unit labour cost inflation, and the sluggish PPI and CPI, 'give the Fed leeway to let its past tightening work into the economy'. He also predicted joblessness and capacity utilisation were likely to steady soon at levels which did not constitute an inflationary threat. This week will provide ample data to help investors form a view. Retail sales and PPI figures will be released tomorrow, with CPI, industrial production and current account figures on Wednesday. The UK faces a similarly congested week of data, including producer and consumer prices, distributive trades and monthly trends surveys from the CBI, retail sales and labour market figures. The edge has been taken off these figures, however, by last week's decision to raise the base rate to 6.25 per cent. Higher rates and good economic fundamentals have lent support to sterling, but its progress is hampered by political uncertainty. In Germany, as with the US, the key event comes next week, with the pre-Christmas Bundesbank council meeting.</p>

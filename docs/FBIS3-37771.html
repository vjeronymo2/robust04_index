			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 22, BNS -- A representative of TAAS  Israel Industries Ltd., visiting Estonia over alleged failure of  a part of the companys' arms consignment to measure up to  provisions of the arms purchase agreement, said TAAS will  unconditionally and on its own expense do away with all  shortcomings in the shipment.    The Estonian side at today's talks presented its claims and  proposals concerning the shortcomings uncovered by experts at  the Estonian armed forces' Central Staff, a spokesman for the  Defense Ministry said.    Issues over which the parties might remain diverse will be  settled after additional expert examination, he said.    In order to avoid discrepancies in the future, Estonian  representatives will inspect the weapons as to their  completeness when the next consignments will be put together in  Israel, the meeting decided.    Soviet-made trophy weapons received by Estonia as a gift  from  TAAS, which have caused most of the protests by Estonian as to  their usability, are to be assessed by a commission of  independent experts in the near future, the defense ministry  spokesman said.    The Soviet-made ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft guns, which arrived in  Estonia in shipments on Jan. 23 and Feb. 4, were found  substandard by Estonian experts in a report turned in Feb. 16.  The weapons were a gift from TAAS Israel Industries Ltd. to  Estonia. This was also confirmed in a letter by the company's  Vice President Razi Dotan from Jan. 27.    The Estonian defense forces' Central Staff in its Feb. 17  report on expert examination pointed out shortcomings in the  supplies of additional equipment when compared to the provisions  of the agreement signed between Estonia and the Israeli company.  In abidance by the stipulations of the agreement, the Defense  Ministry on the same day notified the Israeli company of the  shortcomings discovered.    The Estonian parliament's State Defense Commission in a  statement on Feb. 17 said the Israeli state company had  violated the arms purchase agreement with Estonia.</p>

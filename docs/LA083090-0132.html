			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EQUITEC, STIFLED BY TAX REFORM, FILES CHAPTER 11  </P> <P> Equitec Financial Group, once a premier real estate syndication firm that has  been hit hard by tax reform, announced Wednesday that it filed for protection  from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  </P> <P> The Oakland-based company, which offers investors a broad range of financial  services, said the bankruptcy filing resulted from "difficult times in the real  estate industry" and the need to "safeguard" its remaining assets. The firm is  nearly half owned by a subsidiary of PacifiCorp., a utility company in  Portland, Ore.  </P> <P> Equitec is but one of several major property syndication firms to encounter  tough times in recent years. At its peak in the late 1970s and early 1980s,  Equitec syndicated the sale of office buildings in downtowns nationwide,  including the World Trade Center in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Equitec has been losing money heavily in recent years and is now in default on  several of its bond obligations. The bankruptcy filing, which allows Equitec to  reorganize and try to pay its debts, affects the parent company and "certain"  of its subsidiaries, the firm said.  </P> <P> Susan H. Kopp, an Equitec spokeswoman, said the firm needs breathing room to  reorganize. "We have had some lawsuits filed against us and certain other  financial pressures that have made it difficult for us to do business and  complete our reorganization," she said.  </P> <P> In one lawsuit last year, a group of investors alleged that Equitec overcharged  on fees on its real estate partnerships sold between 1980 and 1988. Kopp also  noted that Equitec has rented far more office space than it needs at its  headquarters near the Oakland airport.  </P> <P> "That's a real drain," she said.  </P> <P> Equitec is currently trying to sell 11 of its real estate partnerships -- not  included in the bankruptcy filing -- to Hallwood Group, a financial services  company in New York. If it goes through, the sale is expected to earn Equitec  as much as $15 million.  </P> <P> Syndication firms typically acted as general partners on commercial buildings  sold to private investors through limited partnerships. These syndications were  wildly popular because they allowed wealthy investors to save taxes by writing  off large paper losses from the partnerships against their income earned  through work and investments.  </P> <P> But Congress plugged this loophole in the 1986 tax reform act, and the impact  devastated companies like Equitec.  </P></p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Japanese reduce capital outflows Japan's role as a supplier of international capital is waning as domestic institutions have pared down overseas investment and fund flows from the US have risen sharply, according to a report by the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank. While Japanese financial institutions were leading providers of capital during the late 1980s, this has changed because of the burst of the economic 'bubble' in 1990. And although Japanese investors again turned buyers of overseas securities last year, the recent rise in US interest rates has prompted a sell-off. The report provides some explanation of the strength in the yen. Part of the recent upward pressure on the yen has come from the decline in Japanese demand for dollars and the rise in demand for yen. According to the Bank of Japan, overseas investment in the Tokyo stock market totalled a record Dollars 34.5bn (Pounds 22.9bn) during the first quarter of this year. During the late 1980s, Japanese investment in overseas assets including securities and property prompted a large capital outflow. Between 1985 and 1989, annual net outflow of long-term capital averaged Dollars 110bn. However, this has since fallen sharply and in 1992 Japan saw a total Dollars 28.5bn outflow in long-term capital and an outflow of Dollars 78.3bn last year. Securities investment by Japanese investors last year rose 50 per cent from the previous year to Dollars 51.6bn because of the rally in US and European stock and bond markets. Investors bought a net Dollars 21.9bn in US securities, up 2.5 times from the previous year, and Dollars 17.4bn in German securities, up 2.1 times. Net purchases of French securities rose five times to Dollars 10bn, but buying of UK securities fell 1.8 per cent to Dollars 16.8bn. Downward pressure on the dollar has stemmed from US overseas investments. The report says overseas securities investment by US investors last year totalled 2.5 times that of Japan's at Dollars 125.4bn.</p>

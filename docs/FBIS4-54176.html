Noting that some Americans are of the opinion that Japan  might be the only country which can say "no" to the United  States in the post-Cold War period, the article says:    Japan at last began to say "no" to the United States. The  Japanese prime minister said "no" when discussing trade friction  and other issues with the U.S. President during his visit to the  United States last year, thus breaking down the talks.    The United States is very nervous about such developments.  It is alerted against the stark fact that Japan may become its  archrival in the future in executing its global strategy. For  their conflicting interests the United States is trying to hold  down Japan. But Japan has built up "defences" and is stubbornly  resisting it.    Noteworthy here is it that the United States is being driven  into a position of passive defence.    After the Second World War Japan has surfaced as an economic  power under the U.S. shadow. It has unfolded a challenging and  ambitious economic strategy and began to regard the United  States as nothing, in the belief that in the present-day world  where the Cold War has come to an end the economic potential is  the real strength and, accordingly, those who established  economic supremacy would come at the helm of power for world  domination.    In recent years the United States has annually suffered a  deficit of more than 50 billion dollars in trade with Japan.  Worse still, Japan is extensively buying land and businesses of  the United States. Words are rife now in the U.S. public that  should such development continue the Japanese capital would  swallow up the whole territory of the United States some time in  the future. The United States is raising terrific outcries over  Japan's trade offensive, calling it the "second attack on Pearl  Harbour".    Meanwhile, Japan, broadening new markets, is continually  increasing investments to form its economic sphere.  Subsequently, the United States is gradually going into the  passive.    Japan is also trying by degrees to free itself from the U.S.  control militarily. By legalizing the troop dispatch overseas  of its "self-defence forces" and accelerating its own nuclear  armament Japan is intending to take the initiative and act a  political power in the international arena.    Now, Japan has made all material preparations for the  production of nuclear weapons any moment. The United States is  very uneasy about this.    Some quarters of Japan say they cannot forget the atomic  bombing of the United States on the territory of Japan, and  agitate people by saying Japan must call it "to account for"  this in the future.    Judging from all this, one can see that what Japan seeks is  to exhaust the United States in the economic, military and other  domains and take the initiative in the international arena.    At present, the United States is trying to keep Japan under  its control, and the latter is intending to get the upper hand  by fostering its own strength without letup, while pretending to  make concessions to the former and seemingly currying favor with  it.    The relations between the United States and Japan, each  having an axe to grind, will take a turn for the worse with the  passage of time.</p>

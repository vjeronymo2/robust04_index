			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND SURPRISES;  </P> <P> FASHION: SHORT WAS THE WATCHWORD AT THE LONDON SHOWS. MANY DESIGNERS FEATURED  BRIGHTLY COLORED, KNEE-SKIMMING OR SHORTER SKIRTS, SUCH AS THIS ONE FROM JEAN  MUIR.  </P> <P> Perhaps the biggest news so far from the fall, 1990, collections is the shadow  they have thrown on the future of the traditional runway fashion show.  </P> <P> Take designer Franco Moschino's show last week in Milan. In Moschino's  presentation, members of a ballet troupe wearing flesh-colored leotards tossed  a jumble of clothes -- which turned out to be the designer's new collection --  onto the stage, then fished out various items, slipped them over the leotards  and danced down the runway to French cancan music.  </P> <P> Then, over the weekend in London, two of the city's most talked about talents,  Rifat Ozbek and Jasper Conran, eschewed a show for an alternative form of  fashion theater. Obviously, there's a trend in the making.  </P> <P> Conran's method, like Moschino's, was haphazard. He pulled together a selection  from the new collection, hung it on a rack and asked friends to pick out  something and wear it to a packed party he gave in his Great Malborough Street  design studio.  </P> <P> Even Conran was surprised at the ensuing results. "When I made my selection,"  he said, "I was sure I knew who was going to pick which outfit to wear. Not one  friend chose the outfit I had selected mentally for her."  </P> <P> Fun, maybe, but confusing for buyers (among American stores represented in  London were Bergdorf Goodman, Barney's, Charivari, Maxfield, Macy's California  and I. Magnin), who were not aware that Conran's new collection was milling  about in the mob. Most had to go back for a second look, this time shown on a  video that starred Royal Ballet dancer Darcy Russell. The background music  quickly became the weekend's signature: "I've Got the Power," by Soul to Soul.  </P> <P> But the weekend's most spectacular event was Ozbek's video, "Millennium,"  directed by John Maybury, considered England's hippest young film maker. The  Turkish-born designer, whose fans range from Madonna to the Princess of Wales,  claims he chose this video presentation over a live show because it was easier  to control the image he wanted to project.  </P> <P> With shops all over London filled with interpretations of his all-white "New  Age" collection from last season, Ozbek's fall line stunned viewers with a  blast of brilliant color. Models drifted and floated across the screen against  a shifting field of kaleidoscopic images.  </P> <P> The video was shown by appointment on a gigantic screen at Westway Studio with  the clothes conveniently at hand in an adjoining studio.  </P> <P> Another new wrinkle in the London scene is one that riles many in the English  fashion community: Designers John Galliano and Katharine Hamnett will present  their collections in Paris, not London. Hamnett's defection deprived the scene  of what was usually the maddest bash of London Fashion Week, although her  protege, Nick Coleman, will continue to show in town. Coleman also runs  BSolaris, a nightclub where the young fashion crowd gathers, as Coleman says:  "to sweat" and listen to jazz.  </P> <P> Jean Muir presented her collection against a background of jazz. Colors were  primarily gray and black for a collection with a '30s feel -- cape collars were  a theme, as were little shaped jackets. Skirts were knee-baring but demure.  Muir's long, cashmere cardigans formed abstract prints in warm colors. She  showed them over short, knit skimmer dresses.  </P> <P> Graham Fraser and Richard Nott of Workers for Freedom, last year's Designer of  the Year team, showed their usual rich-hippie intellectual clothes, this time  for a modern-day Millicent Rogers Taos look. (She's the art patron whose house  is now a museum.) A white-tiered georgette skirt had black tights showing  underneath, and was topped by a hand-knit sweater decorated with organic images  and the word Freedom. This was one of the best-attended shows of the week, but  the collection, while charming and fanciful, lacked the drama to hold a runway.  </P> <P> It is a problem many London collections suffered this season. In his show, Joe  Caseley-Hayford did himself a disservice by accessorizing the basic, clean  shapes of his men's and women's collections with clunky hiking boots. And, in  his quest for a new twist, he may have reached too far. Suits resembled  doctor's uniforms, with shoulder-button jackets and straight-leg pants --  unfortunately, shirred up the side.  </P> <P> John Richmond is a young London talent who is quietly coming into his own. He  had the coveted Fashion Week windows at Joseph's Brompton Cross showcase  boutique -- the fashion crowd lunches at Joe's Cafe just across the street --  and has built a loyal following through Los Angeles boutiques such as Roppongi  on Melrose Avenue.  </P> <P> He was among those who chose not to have a runway show, but displayed his new  collection at Olympia, the fashion trade fair. "Nobody is interested in shows  any more," Richmond said. "We don't need the hype. For me, the best catwalk  (runway) is the street."  </P> <P> His clothes, many made of stretch fabrics and almost all of them with hoods,  reflect what is happening on the street right now. Along with the hooded sweat  shirt, other themes include long loose jackets worn over stirrup pants and  leggings, and shorts or minis worn with opaque tights. The American baseball  cap and sneakers with a contrast-color tongue pulled out over the laces are  other trends.  </P> <P> It's all rather tame. About the only eccentricity to be seen in London streets  is the occasional shaved head rising from one of those hooded T-shirts, a  surrealistic reminder of a more flamboyant past.  </P> <P> Queen of the flamboyant past, and Mother of Punk, designer Vivienne Westwood,  staged a runway show, late night, at a private club hung with royal portraits.  Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were at one end of the runway, Edward VII and  Queen Alexandra at the other when Westwood sent out the answer to a question  that has been troubling fashionables ever since Milan: namely, can anyone but  the youngest and skinniest squeeze into the body-clinging shapes that are in  every collection? Westwood's first model was frankly middle-aged, yet  definitely had the body to carry off the look. Other than the goofy shoes she  showed, some of Westwood's clothes were in the best British classic tradition.  </P> <P> British classic too was the mulberry cloque dinner suit that Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher wore to the official reception she held, along with the  minister of trade, for designers, press and store buyers at London Fashion  Week.  </P> <P> Thatcher's suit, like everything she wears, was designed for her by Marian  Abrahams of Aquascutum. The same afternoon, Thatcher had received King Hussein  of Jordan at her country residence. At the fashion party, she worked the room  like the consummate politician she is, complimenting designer Zandra Rhodes on  her new, shorter haircut -- "We can see your face so much better, my dear!" --  and asking boutique owner Joseph Ettedguie about business.  </P> <P> A concern for the environment was a sub-theme in many of the collections, from  Stephen Jones' knit hats with an intarsia map of the earth worked around the  crown to Betty Jackson's intarsia map of Africa on one of her knit coats.  Jackson explained that the map expressed her concern for "the rain forest."  Right sentiment, wrong continent. Brazil's rain forests have been the focus of  concern.  </P> <P> The mistake was emblematic of the London shows this time. Designers seem lost,  eager to connect with the fashion scene at large through message and  cause-related clothing. Too often it appears to be just for the sake of keeping  up with a trend.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 17 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- The Costa Rican  justice system gave Paul Carpenter, the former Democratic  senator from California, 20 days to present evidence in his  defense before resolving a U.S. Government extradition request  against him for alleged bribery and misuse of funds.    Carpenter was arrested last Thursday by Costa Rican Judicial  Investigation Agency (OIJ) officials in a neighborhood in  northern San Jose at the request of U.S. judicial officials.  The former U.S. senator, located by Interpol (International  Police) and the Costa Rican OIJ, has been under an arrest  warrant since he fled his country last February to avoid a  seven-year prison sentence imposed by a district court in  Sacramento, California.    Carpenter is accused of alleged bribery and misuse of funds  in a political campaign, illegal financial transactions, and  obstruction of justice.    Carpenter said in San Jose, "I came to Costa Rica to die,"  in  an interview granted to the newspaper THE SACRAMENTO BEE from  his San Jose prison, where he has been held under arrest since  Thursday awaiting an extradition resolution being handled by the  Higher Criminal Court in San Jose.    The former politician is suffering from advanced prostate  cancer, and he made it known to the Sacramento court in a letter  he sent a few days before escaping to Costa Rica, where he  entered with a safe-conduct and not with a passport, according  to police reports.    Carpenter has insisted in Costa Rica that he is "innocent"  and says he is a victim of the FBI. It has been learned in San  Jose that a Sacramento investigation of corruption led to an  accusation against the former congressman and his Democratic  assistants Alan Robbins and Clay Jackson, alleged masterminds of  a complicated bribery plan to finance his political campaign.  Carpenter was a Democratic state senator from 1976 to 1986.    "I never broke the law, I am a victim of political ambition,  the lawyers, and the FBI," he said. He said he believes he will  win the process begun in Costa Rica, where he expects to live  until his death.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL DENIES HIDING MUSEUM CONSTRUCTION COSTS;  </P> <P> ART: EXECUTIVE ACKNOWLEDGES IN COURT PAPERS THAT INTERNAL MEMORANDUM DISCUSSED  SHIFTING COSTS OF WESTWOOD FACILITY TO OTHER ACCOUNTS, BUT SAYS NO TRANSFERS  WERE MADE.  </P> <P> Occidental Petroleum Corp. on Tuesday denied that it ever attempted to conceal  construction costs of a Westwood museum being built to house the art collection  of company chairman Armand Hammer.  </P> <P> Ronald Asquith, the Occidental vice president in charge of construction of the  Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center, said in an affidavit filed in  Wilmington, Del., that allegations that Occidental engaged in a scheme to  artificially lower the apparent cost of the museum "are false."  </P> <P> "There has never been any plan," Asquith said in the affidavit, "to transfer  museum construction costs from the museum account to elsewhere on Occidental's  books to conceal the true cost of the construction."  </P> <P> Occidental filed the court papers after attorneys for dissident shareholders  accused the company of engaging in a "fraudulent scheme" to falsify the true  amount required to build the museum. The shareholder lawyers filed their  documents after The Times reported last week that Occidental had apparently  decided to move millions of dollars in museum costs to other corporate  accounting categories.  </P> <P> Three pending shareholder lawsuits challenge Occidental's decision to build and  endow the museum. A proposed settlement in one of the cases would require  Occidental to limit construction costs to $60 million.  </P> <P> Documents obtained by The Times indicated that the company had considered and  decided to move some museum costs to accounting categories apparently related  to renovation of Occidental's Westwood office building, the bottom four floors  of which are being gutted and reconstructed as part of the museum.  </P> <P> In the court filing, dated Tuesday, Asquith said an internal memorandum shows  that he authorized a key separation of costs for the museum from costs to be  attributed to a building maintenance account. But he said he discovered later  "a mistake in the preparation of the minutes" of the meeting at which the  decision was made. "I immediately recognized the error," Asquith said in his  affidavit.  </P> <P> The court filing consists of an affidavit by Asquith and a copy of minutes of a  meeting at which Asquith contends he rectified his original mistake.  </P> <P> The new court documents also confirm that Occidental and its contractors held  discussions on whether to change accounting allocations for $2,266,066 in  museum costs but that a proposal to actually switch the money was never carried  out.  </P> <P> The litigation is being handled by a Delaware court because Occidental is  incorporated there.  </P> <P> At the time the story was published, Occidental declined to respond to a set of  written questions by The Times inquiring about decisions recorded in Occidental  internal documents and specific amounts of money transferred from museum  accounts to other bookkeeping categories.  </P> <P> "These discussions (of transfer of the $2,266,066) related exclusively to an  effort to ensure that Occidental's books were accurately recorded," Asquith  said in his affidavit. "From time to time, there have been good faith and open  discussions respecting the proper allocation of costs to the appropriate  accounts, including discussions relating to a list of items comprising the  $2,266,066 figure.  </P> <P> "Such discussions were not part of any 'secret' scheme. There has never been  any attempt to 'conceal' these discussions."  </P> <P> Asquith emphasized that the current total budget for the museum includes the  entire amount involved in discussions of shifting of costs from one account to  another. Asquith said in his affidavit that, despite discussions of making such  accounting transfers, none of the money involved was ever actually shifted from  a museum account to a non-museum account.  </P> <P> He said Occidental Petroleum established a separate subsidiary, Oxy Westwood  Corp., and a separate account in the books for maintenance and tenant  improvements in Occidental's 16-story office building. But Asquith specifically  denied that the tenant improvement account had ever been used to conceal  construction costs related to the Hammer museum.  </P> <P> Asquith confirmed that Occidental efforts to drive down the museum construction  cost had lowered the price of the museum from $78.4 million before top  Occidental executives ordered massive reductions to a currently projected  $59-million budget. Asquith also confirmed that the cost-cutting means the  museum will open in November with its auditorium, restaurant and library  unfinished.  </P> <P> "Ironically, (the dissident shareholders') own papers acknowledge the fact  that, to ensure Occidental's compliance with the $60-million cost limitation .  . . work on certain items originally part of the project has been suspended."  The affidavit identified the three facilities as among the suspended work, but  noted that "it is my understanding that these portions of the museum will be  completed if other funds become available."  </P> <P> The Asquith affidavit also confirmed that Occidental had removed a $258,000 VIP  reception lounge called the "Hammer Memorabilia Room" from the project, along  with a $25,000 fireplace that would have been part of the lounge. "Such  revisions to construction plans are a customary and appropriate method to  adhere to a construction budget," Asquith said.  </P> <P> "Thus, the budget process reflects nothing but Occidental's adherence to the  $60-million settlement limitation," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Publisher's shares slide as Kuok details offer SHARES in South China Morning Post, the Hong Kong newspaper group, fell 9 per cent yesterday. The drop followed the announcement that its major new shareholder - Mr Robert Kuok - would not be launching an outright takeover bid for the company. The shares had been suspended from trading for six days pending the outcome of negotiations between Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation - which owned 50 per cent of SCMP - and Malaysian-born Mr Kuok. A USDollars 349m agreement to sell 34.9 per cent of SCMP was signed in Hong Kong on Sunday. However, the deal is contingent upon there being no requirement for Mr Kuok to launch a general offer to all SCMP shareholders. Since the stake is below the Hong Kong takeover code's 35 per cent trigger level, this should be a formality. Mr Kuok's Kerry Media revealed yesterday a further condition giving it the right to purchase News Corp's remaining 15.1 per cent stake in SCMP at HKDollars 5.17 a share, plus interest payments based on the value of the investment, if a general offer is launched by the Kuok group within the next 18 months. Mr Kuok is to be chairman of SCMP. His colleague, Mr Roberto Ongpin - the former Philippines minister for trade and industry - will be deputy chairman. Mr Kuok Khoon Ean and Mr Paul Bush are to become directors. Mr Murdoch and Mr Gene Swinstead have resigned from the board. Mr Kuok has no newspaper experience. However, the fact that News Corp retains a 15.1 per cent stake in the company - short-term though this may be  -means there should be relatively smooth transition in the management of what has been one of the world's most consistently profitable newspapers.</p>

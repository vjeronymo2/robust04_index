			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRESHMEN AT UCI ARE A CLASS APART  </P> <P> A national study of college freshmen shows that UC Irvine first-year students  are more ethnically diverse than their counterparts at other U.S. colleges. The  study also found that they are less likely than other college students to drink  alcohol.  </P> <P> UCI officials this week released results of the survey, which is made annually  by the American Council of Education-UCLA Cooperative Institutional Research  Program.  </P> <P> "This year's UCI freshmen came from high schools and neighborhoods more  racially diverse than their national counterparts," said Colleen Bentley-Adler,  a UCI spokeswoman. "Thirty-four percent (of this year's UCI freshmen) said  English was not their first language, compared with 5.6% at other universities.  Only 47% said they came from a mostly white high school, while 62% at other  universities did."  </P> <P> Bentley-Adler said this year's freshmen survey shows how much UCI has changed  since a 1978 analysis.  </P> <P> "In 1978, the vast majority -- 67% -- of UCI freshmen were Caucasian,"  Bentley-Adler said. "Nearly 8% were black; 15% Asian; nearly 8% Chicano/Latino  and 1% American Indian. Ten years later, 50% are Caucasian; 2.4% black; 40%  Asian; 5.2% Chicano/Latino, and 1% American Indian."  </P> <P> The survey's questions about religion also produced results showing how diverse  UCI has become, Bentley-Adler noted. "By far there are more Buddhists at UCI --  6% -- than at other universities," she said. "Ten years ago, Buddhism was not  even listed as a choice (on the annual freshman survey)."  </P> <P> The 1988 survey found that UCI freshmen are academically brighter and less  likely to drink alcoholic beverages than their counterparts nationwide.  </P> <P> Bentley-Adler said that "more than 90% of the 1988 UCI freshmen class rated  themselves in the top 10% in academic ability, compared with 77% at other  universities."  </P> <P> She said the survey also found that less than half of the 1988 UCI freshmen had  ever drunk beer, wine or liquor, compared to nearly 70% at other campuses.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Geneva Correspondent Ana Fernandez] </F>   [Excerpts] A bilateral agreement was signed yesterday  between Chile and the European Union (EU) on the controversy  over Chile's exports of apples and other fruits. The move ends  a year of anxiety and negotiations. The initial bilateral  negotiation was followed by others within the GATT, where a  panel was set up after the EU imposed countervailing duties in  April 1993.    Ernesto Tironi, the Chilean Ambassador to Geneva who  receives  the kudos for this agreement, labeled this process as  "laborious" and told EL MERCURIO that it entailed a race against  time. "The agreement was ready on 8 March and it was practically  closed on 17 March," he added.    He explained that the agreement entails both a change in the  way the EU calculates the countervailing duties and a reduction  in EU tariffs on Chilean apples and other fruits. In exchange  for this, Chile suspended its protest before the GATT which had  established a panel presided by Swedish Ambassador to GATT  Christer Manhusen and included representatives of Mexico and  Pakistan.    This agreement will be instrumental in boosting Chile's  export earnings. Tironi stated: "A surplus in the European  production of apples last year, coupled with a 10 percent  increase in tariffs -- up from 6 to 16 percent -- caused exports  of Chilean apples to drop by 40 percent." [passage omitted]    A Foreign Ministry communique states that the countervailing  duties which affected Chile last year will be replaced by  another, less restrictive, more transparent, and more  predictable system. This was negotiated within the framework of  the Uruguay Round of GATT trade talks. This new tariff system  will apply to all Chilean fruits, not just to apples.    The communique adds that within the framework of the Uruguay  Round, Chile managed to increase the selling price of its apples  from 8 to 12 percent [as published] without being penalized by  extremely high additional customs duties. This measure will  become effective in July 1995.    The agreement also includes clauses to make the EU system  that limits the entry of fruit less severe when there are  exceptional market conditions. For example, countervailing  duties will not be levied when sales volumes are very small.    The communique adds that the agreement includes a commitment  for closer cooperation between Chile and the EU on the exchange  of information about fruit market conditions. The agreement  states: "The information provided by the Exporters' Association  is of utmost importance for the fulfillment of the cooperation  commitment." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEWS;  </P> <P> FEITELSON'S SERENE AND ANXIOUS FORMS  </P> <P> Feminine curves slither through the figurative and abstract works of Lorser  Feitelson, one of Southern California's seminal modernists. A modest survey of  his paintings and graphic work at Tobey C. Moss Gallery reveals his suave  handling of line and fascination with the image of woman as tantalizer and  nurturer through six decades of stylistic change.  </P> <P> Feitelson was born in Savannah, Ga., in 1898 and reared in New York. He was  mostly self-taught. Galvanized by the European art he saw in the Armory Show of  1913, he made several trips to Paris during the '20s to check out the scene. In  "Two Figures: Kinetic Organization" (1919-20), repeated concentric silhouettes  in vivid colors give a proto-Art Deco look to a pair of Jazz Age flappers with  elongated torsos, perky breasts and licks of spit curl.  </P> <P> After working through a Neoclassic style indebted to Picasso and Andre Derain  -- and lavish in depictions of the statuesque female form -- Feitelson found  his voice as a Surrealist in the early '30s. By then he was living in Los  Angeles, and Europe was far away.  </P> <P> In place of the irrationalist dream imagery of the European Surrealists,  Feitelson's orderly, contemplative scenes of female nudes and symbolic objects  -- eggs, the moon, pieces of fruit -- were serene symbols of a sensual and  fecund universe.  </P> <P> In the '40s, the artist started playing with what he called "Magical Forms." At  first they retained a Surrealist aura, as in the giant abstract "male" and  "female" shapes that dominate a desolate landscape at dusk in "Tree Form."  </P> <P> Eventually, these eccentric forms became bold, flat silhouettes that locked  into solid-colored fields. Aggressively pointed shapes in precarious balance  and the restless competitiveness between the shapes and the equally vivid  "negative space" around them evoke the anxieties of the postwar era.  </P> <P> "Magical Space Forms" of 1961 is indeed magical in its tension-filled  construction of looming, oblique black forms on a white ground. These five  monoliths touch each other only at two points, evoking contradictory qualities  of mass and weightlessness -- and a corresponding sense of the vulnerability of  the universe.  </P> <P> During the last decades of his life (he died in 1978), Feitelson reduced his  forms into ever-more-streamlined contours -- shapely ribbons of color that  glide through the air with space age velocity. In an untitled painting from  1971, a vertical line of bright blue rimmed in rust red and peach briefly curls  in on itself -- the sexual imagery and tension is unmistakable -- before  rushing off the gleaming white expanse of the canvas.  </P> <P>  "Lorser Feitelson: The Organic Line 1916-1977," at Tobey C. Moss Gallery, 7321  Beverly Blvd., to Oct. 31.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Human Comedy: The idea of presenting Diane Arbus' photographs of the  unbeautiful people in tandem with flattery-be-damned portraits by four  well-known photographers who preceded her was born of necessity -- not enough  Arbus images were available to fill the gallery.  </P> <P> But the resulting parallels and differences give the exhibit a depth of field  infrequently seen in gallery photo shows and reaffirm how disturbing and  provocative the world of Arbus' subjects -- our world -- really is.  </P> <P> German photographer August Sander, who wrote that he wanted to present "only  the honest truth about our time and people," embarked in the 1920s on a project  of individually documenting representatives of the different walks of life --  from circus performers to politicians -- represented in his native Germany.  </P> <P> If the unsmiling farm children Sander photographed in the Westerwald in 1913 --  arrayed stiffly with their playthings: a doll, a whip, a toy horse, a dog --  look strange to us, that's because today's children are old hands at the ritual  of photography, and they live in a casual world where adult concerns have  filtered through the cloistered innocence of the childhood represented here.  And back then, nobody was urged to smile for the birdie.  </P> <P> Brassai (born Gyula Halesz in Hungary) photographed the night life of Paris  during the 1920s and '30s. His camera lingered on lovers and strangers, all  enveloped in the mystique of going out on the town in search of a good time.  However pensive or awkward individuals may appear no one seems grotesque or  pitiable.  </P> <P> In the work of Viennese emigre photographer Lisette Model, who was Arbus'  teacher, New York in the 1940s and '50s is full of people who may not have been  fashion plates -- folks with jowls, flab, smeared lipstick, gnomelike bodies --  but who clearly retained the zestful independence of urban dwellers back when  New York was still a liveable place for the middle class.  </P> <P> Tabloid photographer Weegee (ne Arthur Fellig; his nom de camera was derived  from his knack for turning up when something criminal was going down, as if he  had access to a Ouija board) was Johnny-on-the-spot in New York for murders,  fires and general mayhem. In one image, a skinny transvestite raises his skirt  in a "cheesecake" pose while he and his more frightened-looking buddies are  hauled away in a paddy wagon.  </P> <P> But Arbus removed the sideshow aspect as well as the soothing aura of universal  brotherhood and bonhomie. Returning to the posed format Sander favored -- under  radically different cultural circumstances of media sophistication, social  mobility and moral uncertainty -- she made images that are at once  uncomfortably confrontational and devoid of helpful answers.  </P> <P>  "Diane Arbus: Her Artistic Lineage" at Jan Kesner Gallery, 164 N. La Brea  Ave., to Oct. 13.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu </F> by 'Ido Baum; place not given; from the weekly "In the Current  Situation" program -- live]    [Text] [Baum] Good morning Knesset Member Binyamin  Netanyahu, head of the opposition.    [Netanyahu] Good morning.    [Baum] What is your reaction to last night's operation?    [Netanyahu] Well, you know I make no secret of my criticism  of the government but in this case they, as well as the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] commanders and soldiers, all deserve  hearty praise for apparently carrying out what the late Hayim  Bar-Lev [former chief of staff and minister who died last week]  used to call a strong, swift, and elegant operation. I take my  hat off to them.    [Baum] Some opposition members have claimed that the  government is not doing enough to bring back the POW's and the  MIA's. Perhaps the correct way to go about this is to really  take direct action against Hizballah and not demand information  from the PLO which apparently does not have any.    [Netanyahu] The steps taken should be comprehensive. The  PLO definitely has information because 'Arafat gave the prime  minister half of Ron Arad's dog tag. Therefore, we can demand  valuable information from 'Arafat such as who handed him the dog  tag and who holds its second half. However, I still think that  we can exert certain pressure -- from which the government is  refraining -- with regard to the mass release of prisoners, an  issue I regard as problematic in the first place. If we are  already going ahead with such a step then we definitely could at  least extract more information and clues to help us locate our  people. With regard to last night's operation, which may arouse  international criticism, it is important to explain that Israel  has the full right not only to follow the supreme Jewish  doctrine of ransoming prisoners thus reassuring every IDF  soldier that he will never be abandoned if taken prisoner by the  enemy, but also to act against the kidnappers and to capture  them whether for bargaining purposes or to extract information.  This is something the IDF has done in the past not only in the  case of Shaykh 'Ubayd [kidnapped from Lebanon in 1989]. This  policy was also reflected in the kidnapping, or, more rightly,  the capture of the five senior Syrian general staff officers  while Syria was holding our pilots and POW's and refused to  release them as part of a prisoner exchange as mandated by the  Geneva Conventions. We have carried out such operations. I  myself participated in two unsuccessful missions. My brother,  Yoni, directly commanded the operation in which the Syrian  officers were captured and four or five months later our  prisoners were returned as part of a prisoner exchange.  Therefore, Israel has all the right to act whether for  information or bargaining purposes as part of its efforts to  bring back our POW's and MIA's.    [Baum] Shaykh 'Ubayd was kidnapped when the unity government  was in power with Yitzhaq Shamir as prime minister and Yitzhaq  Rabin as defense minister. So far, however, his kidnapping has  not helped especially. The POW's and MIA's have not been  returned. The question is whether or not the risks entailed in  such an operation outweigh the possible benefits? Are these  operations justified?    [Netanyahu] First of all, there are no guarantees. I do not  deny the fact that there is no way of knowing. When we  kidnapped those Syrian officers no one could state with  certainty that the outcome would be positive or that there would  be no negative ramifications. This danger always exists, in  this case as well. However, I definitely have full confidence in  the government's decision on this matter because every country  has the right to act against an organization of murderers and  kidnappers which has information, and perhaps even more, in  order to achieve the basic, humanitarian goal of bringing its  prisoners back home. That is acceptable within all  international frameworks and we must insist on this matter, not  only on the international but also on the domestic level.  Whatever the price, it is more important that every IDF soldier  sent to the battlefield knows with full certainty that Israel  will do the maximum to bring him back home.    [Baum] Thank you, opposition leader Binyamin Netanyahu.</p>

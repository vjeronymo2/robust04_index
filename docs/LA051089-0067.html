			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN SURRENDERS AT BORDER IN SLAYING OF WOMAN, 25  </P> <P> A U.S. Navy serviceman was arrested in the stabbing death of a North Hollywood  woman after he turned himself in at the Mexican border Tuesday, Los Angeles  police said.  </P> <P> Lt. Ron LaRue said police were called to an apartment in the 10800 block of  Kling Street at 11:15 p.m. Monday and found Alyson Eve Billard, 25, dead of  multiple stab wounds. The woman's two roommates found the body.  </P> <P> LaRue said detectives were beginning the investigation when they were contacted  at 1 a.m. Tuesday by U. S. Customs agents from the border crossing at San  Ysidro and told that Hugo R. Wiegand had surrendered in connection with  Billard's death.  </P> <P> Weigand, 20, was believed to be absent without leave but the location of his  Navy base had not been determined. Officials did not know his rank. He had been  staying for about two weeks with his brother, who was one of the victim's  roommates, police said.  </P> <P> "He was going to go into Mexico but decided instead to turn himself in," LaRue  said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles detectives drove to San Ysidro and returned with Wiegand, who was  arrested on suspicion of murder and was being held without bail in the North  Hollywood station jail.  </P> <P> LaRue said detectives had not learned the motive for the stabbing.  </P></p>

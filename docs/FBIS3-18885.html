			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Jose Faura Martin, the </F> Spanish Army chief of staff, by announcer Angela Nunez; Martin  is at Spanish blue helmets headquarters in Medjurgorje -- live]    [Text] [Nunez] We are in contact with Lieutenant General  Jose Faura Martin at the Spanish blue helmets headquarters in  Medjugorje. Lieutenant General Jose Faura Martin, good evening.    [Martin] Good evening.    [Nunez] You took over the job of Army chief of staff 20 days  ago, and since then you have wanted to visit the Spanish blue  helmets and the area where they are deployed. You have visited  them on the day a Spanish military plane was hit by antiaircraft  fire over the Krajina region. How do you evaluate this incident?    [Martin] I think that it is an isolated incident because the  situation here -- as far as I have seen it -- is fairly calm and  under control, all things considered.    That said, I think that such acts will not be avoidable for  some time. And these acts cast a shadow on the peace and calm  for which we are aiming. But I do not think it should be taken  too seriously.    [Nunez] So, apart from these isolated incidents, your  assessment of how the conflict is evolving is positive?    [Martin] In the area I have seen, yes. That is where the  Spanish battalion is, yes, definitively yes. It is going well,  very well.    [Nunez] Would you say there is reason to hope for peace  soon?    [Martin] Yes, I think so. If it continues to go, as up until  now, since the signing of the agreement, yes. One sees more  normal life in the cities. Your colleague has said there were  trams running in Sarajevo for the first time today. This means  life is returning to normal in the area.    [Nunez] You mention the normalization of the conflict but it  also means our blue helmets have more work to do. The defense  minister said they are working to 100 percent of their capacity.    [Martin] That is true. Now that the Neretva route is opened  -- that is the one we control -- the number of convoys is up,  missions have been increased, and so our men are working to the  hilt. Despite this, they are all in good spirits, morale is  good, and the atmosphere in this Spanish unit is magnificent.    [Nunez] The blue helmets have more work, does this mean that  they are more at risk?    [Martin] No, no, I think the risk has diminished. There is  more work but there is less risk.    [Nunez] Mr. Faura, the defense minister has said that a  small  additional contingent -- about 100 men -- might be sent to the  area where our blue helmets are deployed. Considering the  situation on the ground, would this be enough men?    [Martin] I do not know, because the decision to send more  men  is a political decision in which I have no part. I will report  back about what I have seen, I will inform the minister, and he  will make his decision. I can not say right now what he will  decide to do.    [Nunez] Anyway, one can say that there is not only more work  to be done, but the work is more important.    [Martin] No, I would say the work is just as important as  before but now there is more activity, there are more convoy  escorts, more checkpoints. There have been new deployments in  areas where we could not have people before -- this means it is  safer to have more detachments -- but this does not make our  mission more important than before.    [Nunez] In April, the Madrid Group [name of current Spanish  blue helmet contingent] will be replaced by the Cordoba Group.  What will this new contingent find? What will you tell the new  units that are going to go to the former Yugoslavia?    [Martin] I think they will find a completely different  situation to the one the Madrid Group found on arrival, a calmer  situation, with maybe new missions, maybe more activities, but  with less risk. Luckily.    [Nunez] Lieutenant General Jose Faura Martin, Army chief of  staff, thank you for answering the call of Radio Nacional de  Espana.    [Martin] Thank you. Goodnight.    [Nunez] Goodnight.</p>

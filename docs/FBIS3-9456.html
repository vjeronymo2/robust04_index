			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [Announcer] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus left for  a three-day official visit to Finland late this afternoon.  Miroslav Konvalina reports from Ruzyne Airport:    [Konvalina] We do not have any problems in bilateral  contacts  with Finland. On the contrary, Vaclav Klaus will affirm our  permanent interest in this northern country. He gave us his  reasons a few weeks ago, after returning from Norway, which so  far was the last Scandinavian country he visited.    [Begin Klaus recording] We should not forget that the Czech  Republic, with its geographic size and number of inhabitants,  must logically seek partners not from among the superpowers, as  we thought at a certain time in the past. Norway and Finland  are our natural partners. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

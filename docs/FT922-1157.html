			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A LARGE deal in traded options not only boosted turnover but also led to falls in stock index futures in a busy session for the derivatives markets, writes Joel Kibazo. Following Monday's dull session in which only 24,842 contracts were traded, Tuesday's volume soared to 44,286 contracts. Activity in the FT-SE option accounted for a large part of the day's total, with James Capel reported to have done a 'call spread' deal in the December series. The FT-SE option had traded a total of 16,105 lots by the close, while turnover in the Euro-FTSE reached 8,604. Stock options were also busy ahead of today's expiry of the June stock options. Asda was the top traded option with a day's total of 3,011 contracts. The big trade in the options was said to have had an effect on the day's activities in stock index futures. The September contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,561 and was briefly squeezed up to 2,601, which proved to be the high of the day. It was the James Capel trade that sent September into retreat, although Wall Street helped it recover to 2,591, up 13 on the previous session but around three points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 35. Turnover reached 7,410. Dealers however expect a poor opening today.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Pak Chong-mun: "Prospects of North </F> Korea-U.S. Talks"]    [Text] It seems certain that the third round of North  Korean-U.S. talks will be held in early July, and the  preliminary contact for the inter-Korean summit talks is  scheduled for 28 June. The North Korean nuclear issue,  therefore, is to be dealt with through the two channels of  dialogue.    The binary dialogue lines--one between North Korea and the  United States and the other between North and South Korea--mean  a structural change from the four-plus-three method (the three  dialogue channels between the North and the South, between the  North and the United States, and between the North and the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in which four parties  are involved) to the three-plus-two method in which the IAEA is  not involved. The structural transformation of the dialogue  method shows the probability that in-depth discussion will be  held on practical problems.    When the IAEA participated in an independent dialogue,  technical problems concerned with safeguards of the continuity  of inspection surfaced one after another, often shaking the  overall picture of the dialogue.    The upcoming North Korean-U.S. Geneva talks and the  inter-Korean summit talks are likely to bring a considerable  change in the contents of the dialogue as well. After North  Korea declared the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty [NPT] in March of last year, North Korea and the United  States discussed ways to resolve the nuclear issue in the first  and second round of high- level talks in June and July,  respectively. However, while the United States placed the  primary emphasis on the discussion of the nuclear issue, North  Korea focused on the improvement of its relations with the  United States and the U.S. assistance in the installation of the  light-water reactor, preventing the talks from making tangible  progress.    However, in the upcoming third round of North Korean-U.S.  talks, specific rather than principled ways for the complete  return to the NPT, suspension of the present and future nuclear  development, and the improvement of relations between the two  countries will be discussed extensively. This may well bring  about a certain degree of tangible results.    The mode of connection to be maintained between the two  lines  of dialogue depends primarily on the North Korean intent. North  Korea has so far placed emphasis on its talks with the United  States, and acceded to the inter-Korean dialogue in a limited  manner as a measure to complement the North Korean-U.S. talks.  It is likely that North Korea will follow the same style.  There are signs that North Korea will hold the North  Korean-U.S. talks before the inter- Korean summit.    In this connection, our government wishes to link the two  lines of dialogue to maintain a balance between the progress in  the North Korean-U.S. dialogue and the improvement of  inter-Korean relations. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu did not  outright link the two lines of dialogue, but said: "We need not  attach substantial significance to which talks are held a few  days before the other. Whether or not progress is made in the  resolution of the nuclear issue through dialogue will be  appraised on the overall basis after following the process of  the two sets of talks." Foreign Minister Han's remarks suggest  that if the South directly links the two sets of dialogue, this  could give an impression that the South is shackling the United  States. Therefore, the South is avoiding this situation and  trying to avoid the blame for the stalemate that could result in  the talks by having one set of talks directly affecting the  other.    The North Korean-U.S. talks and the discussion for  inter-Korean summit help suspend the discussion of UN sanctions  and pave the way for dialogue. However, there are factors which  may stand in the way of smooth progress of dialogue, including  the conflicting interests among the North and South Korea and  the United States.    The assistance in the replacement of reactors with  light-water reactors is one of the most controversial points.  North Korea wishes the United States to make arrangements with  an international monetary institution for the supply of funds to  North Korea for the construction of light-water reactors in  return for its freezing its nuclear development. The United  States, however, is hardly able to give North Korea satisfactory  assurances because of the limitation in its national treasury.    By obtaining specific assurances for the construction of  light-water reactors, North Korea intends to have the economic  sanctions against it dissolved and resolve the hostile relations  with the West as well. Therefore, North Korea is not likely to  part with its nuclear-freeze card in exchange for a mere promise  of assistance by the United States. Hence, how the United  States deals with the issue of assistance in the installation of  light-water reactors will be a key to the success of the talks.    Another important matter connected with the success of the  talks is how the two sides will conclude the issue of tracing  the past nuclear history of North Korea. North Korea is also  raising the issue of not using nuclear weapons against North  Korea, and the United States is planning to deal with the North  Korean development and export of missiles.    Thus, there are quite a few difficult problems lying ahead,  but since both North Korea and the United States are not  concealing their desire to resolve the long hostile relations in  the talks, we will watch with expectation the turn of events  that will develop.</p>

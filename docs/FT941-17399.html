			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Danes win big shipping order Danyard, the shipyard owned by the Lauritzen shipping group, has signed contracts to build seven double-bottomed and doubled-hulled chemical carriers of 37,000dwt each for the American-Norwegian Stolt Nielsen Group, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The contract carries an option for Stolt Nielsen to order a further three vessels, which have a value of between Dollars 65m (Pounds 44m) and Dollars 70m each. Danyard claimed that this is the biggest single order ever received by a Danish industrial company. The first vessel is for delivery in 1995 and six more in 1996-97, with the three additional vessels delivered in 1998 if the option is exercised. The order will provide Danyard, in the North Jutland town of Frederikshavn, with 2,800 full-time jobs a year between now and 1998. The ships will be built to a new design, with tanks built in stainless steel. Automatic steering and navigation equipment and unmanned machine and control rooms will reduce crews to a minimum.</p>

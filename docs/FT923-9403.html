			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Kenya may pull out of track, field events Kenya's track and field squad may pull out of the Games if the controversial reinstatement of Moroccan runner Khalid Skah as men's 10,000 metres gold medallist is not overturned. Kenyan chef de mission Isaiah Kiplagat protested to International Amateur Athletic Federation president Primo Nebiolo after Skah was first disqualified in favour of Kenya's Richard Chelimo, then reinstated on appeal. Asked if Kenya would boycott the rest of the athletics events if they did not get satisfaction, Kiplagat said: 'If we feel that we're not getting a fair judgment the possibility would be there, but we're not saying that at the moment.' A Kenyan official said the team might boycott races from 800m up. However, the team's assistant general manager, Aish Jeneby, later indicated that there might not be a boycott. 'We Kenyans are fighters. When we lose in one event, we regroup ..You watch us tomorrow,' he said.</p>

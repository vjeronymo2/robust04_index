			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITH NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE, WORKERS COULD CHANGE JOBS WITHOUT LOSING  BENEFITS  </P> <P> One benefit of national health insurance that David M. Gordon ("National Health  Insurance Would Be Cost-Effective," June 17) failed to mention is its  portability from employer to employer. Our current system provides health  insurance, pensions and similar programs on a company-by-company basis.  </P> <P> When employees change jobs they often discover that significant benefit losses  are entailed.  </P> <P> For example, at a new job an employee may discover that his or her previously  insured medical conditions (or those of dependents) are not covered because  they are "pre-existing." Pension formulas are often arranged to penalize  employees who leave in mid-career. The contrast with Social Security is  obvious; under that national system employees can change jobs without any loss  of coverage. It is 100% portable.  </P> <P> The concern over rising health costs creates an opportunity for re-examining  the decentralized, duplicative and mobility-inhibiting benefit system created  by the tax code. That system reflects a bygone era of large, secure employers,  long-term careers and economic stability. But in the modern world, many forces  have combined to make job changes, both voluntary and involuntary, commonplace.  </P> <P> Benefit programs that are not 100% portable deserve no tax subsidy.  </P> <P> DANIEL J. B. MITCHELL  </P> <P> The writer is a professor at the Anderson Graduate School of Management at  UCLA.  </P></p>

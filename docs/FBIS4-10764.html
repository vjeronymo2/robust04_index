			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 16 Apr (EFE) -- The pro-Maoist Shining Path  guerrilla group today called for a peace agreement with the  government by sending to a Lima television station a video that  showed a hooded man reading a letter from Shining Path leader  Abimael Guzman. The message read by the hooded man, who was  accompanied by another hooded Shining Path member, emphasizes  the need to reach a peace agreement with President Alberto  Fujimori's administration.    The letter states that the Communist Party of Peru, which is  Shining Path's official name, feels that because the government  "has made progress in its efforts following 5 April 1992" -- the  day Fujimori staged a self-inflicted coup through which he  dissolved Congress and assumed total power with the support of  the military, the Communist Party of Peru "has thought at length  about this situation."    The message adds: "The party and its Directorate must make a  decision, because, if in the past we advocated a popular war, we  must now reach a peace agreement."    The letter points out: "All popular war activities must be  suspended, except those that are defensive in nature, under the  condition that the government also suspends its activities."  Once this condition is met, the hooded man added, a peace  agreement can be reached.    A few days ago, President Fujimori said he received a third  letter from Abimael Guzman, which he did not plan to divulge.  He added that this letter was stored in a safe to which he  alone knows the combination.    In October 1993, Guzman sent two letters to Fujimori in  which  he also called for peace and appealed to his followers to  suspend their violent activities. This appeal, however, has  gone unheeded by at least one Shining Path faction. In his  letters, Guzman, who was arrested on 12 September 1992 in Lima  and has been sentenced to life in prison, did not say that he  had surrendered.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Police call for research on drugs A SENIOR police officer has called for research into licensing users and suppliers of illegal drugs. Speaking on Thursday at the annual Association of Chief Police Officers' drugs conference, Commander John Grieve of Scotland Yard said it was time for police and government to 'think the unthinkable'. Mr Grieve said the aim would be to cut crime against the elderly and vulnerable. He also called for a national system of cautioning for a wide range of drugs offences. ''However, it does mean research that might mean licensing some people to possess, some people to use and some people to supply some, several or many drugs,' he said. His controversial proposals come after chairing a working group of 31 police chiefs during the conference, nearly half of whom, he said, favoured at least some research.</p>

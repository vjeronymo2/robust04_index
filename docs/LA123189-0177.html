			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREAKING INTO THE '90S. A NEW WORLD IN TIME. WALLS FALL, DEBTS RISE,  POLITICIANS THRIVE, ENVIRONMENTS SUFFER-A LOOK OVER THE SHOULDER AND OVER THE  HORIZON.;  </P> <P> EUROPE TAKES CENTER STAGE AS SOVIET EMPIRE COLLAPSES  </P> <P> Easily said, still hard to believe: The Soviet empire came to an end in 1989.  History never came wrapped in a neater package.  </P> <P> In 1980, the will of the people found voice in the shipyards of Gdansk, Poland.  Outlawed and driven underground, the movement only gathered strength. Last  year, it stepped into the void left by the Polish Communist Party. Before  year's end, the power of this example swept four other Communist parties out of  power, stranding Soviet armies in a Europe they could no longer hope to  control.  </P> <P> All sorts of trouble may lie ahead but there is no going back. Three times in  the course of their 40-year occupation, Soviet armies put down popular  revolutions in Eastern Europe -- in East Germany in 1953, in Hungary in 1956,  in Czechoslovakia in 1968. Each episode sparked an international political  crisis. An attempt to repeat suppression -- simultaneously in five countries --  would be indistinguishable from general war. As a result, several things end  with the '80s: Moscow's rule in Eastern Europe, communism as a political  movement, the balance of power established after Germany's defeat in 1945 and  the fear of Soviet expansionism that sustained the Cold War.  </P> <P> It is so hard to exaggerate the political significance of these events. They  place 1989 on a level with 1917, 1848 and 1789. But the full meaning of those  years is in what followed, not in what ended; this will also be true now. As  Niels Bohr used to say, "It is very hard to predict, especially about the  future."  </P> <P> Yet certain things seem likely. The first is Europe's return to center stage in  international politics. Not only the Soviet Union will recede to the wings, but  the United States as well. We aren't rich enough to pay for the reconstruction  of Eastern Europe, and we are no longer irreplaceable in defense of the West.  Europeans will be polite about it, but there will be some painful adjustments  in Washington.  </P> <P> Second will be the re-emergence of a confident, powerful, united Germany.  Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria are now the orphans of  Europe. No one is responsible for financing their recovery after 40 years of  economic stagnation. They will have to beg for help where they can find it.  Only East Germany will have a powerful patron.  </P> <P> The combination of a growing economy and return of the German capital to Berlin  -- what better concession can the West make to the pride of the East? -- will  make Germany first among equals in Europe. With luck, this will evolve slowly,  but it is bound to happen. The peace of the world for the next generation  depends on the grace and sure-footedness with which the rest of Europe allows  it to unfold.  </P> <P> Yet one question looms largest: How will the Soviet Union respond to  simultaneous losses of empire and political faith while the economy grinds ever  deeper into paralysis? Will collapse of the Soviet empire be followed by  collapse of the Russian empire -- that vast stretch of Asian peoples, 11  time-zones wide, put together by czars in the 19th Century? At the moment,  Mikhail S. Gorbachev himself seems to be the center of gravity holding the  pieces together. The whole world -- not just Russians -- would do well to tell  themselves: apres lui, le deluge.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 22 (CTK) -- The investigation  underway into the shipping accidents that have blocked two locks  at the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric power project on the  Danube has so far not revealed any evidence of external  interference, according to a Slovak Government statement which  CTK has obtained.    "Only the findings of the government commission working at  the Gabcikovo water project will be authoritative," the  government statement reads.    Economics Minister Peter Magvasi refused to speculate about  the possibility that the accidents were caused by sabotage,  saying the commission had to continue and complete their  investigation.    The Slovak Government expressed regret today at its session  that international passage on the Danube remained impossible  because the right-hand lock at Gabcikovo was still blocked by  the Ukrainian tugboat Zernograd which sank on February 11. The  government announced it hoped river traffic could be resumed  within a few days.    A section of the bottom gate of the left lock was damaged --  it is not known how -- on Sunday [20 March] night and the  resultant wave under the dam damaged mechanisms on the bottom  gate of the right lock. Subsequently international ship  transport along this section of the Danube has been interrupted.    The Hungarian Foreign Ministry earlier issued a statement  asserting that the Slovak Government bore full responsibility  for the blockage and asked countries supporting free passage on  the Danube to call on Slovakia to re-open the river.</p>

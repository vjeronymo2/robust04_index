			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- The procedure for direct  foreign investment in South Korea will be improved to require  only the filing of an investment plan with the government, while  tax breaks and financial support for foreign firms investing in  high- tech and other specific industries will be greatly  expanded this year.    At present, investors must obtain government approval of  their investment plan.    The foreign exchange market will be further liberalized,  with  the exchange rate fluctuation range increased from the current 1  percent of the previous day's average market rate.    To minimize farmers' losses due to market opening, a  specific  duty system will be introduced for cheap farm products whereby  tariffs will be set on the basis of a fixed sum of money for  each unit of quantity or weight.    These are among the salient points of the Finance Ministry's  operating program that Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong reported  to President Kim Yong-sam on Wednesday.    Hong said the Citizens National Bank will be denationalized  and equity totaling 688 billion won of four state-run banks,  including the Korea Development Bank, in 29 firms will be sold,  along with equity worth 211.2 billion won in 18 subsidiaries.    Ceilings on investment in foreign securities markets by  institutional investors, such as securities, insurance and  investment trust companies, will be lifted altogether for free  investment abroad, and individual investors, now allowed to  invest in foreign securities only through investment trust  firms, will be free to invest directly in foreign equity markets.    The introduction of foreign commercial loans will be limited  to importing equipment needed in infrastructure expansion  projects, while terms of foreign exchange loans from the Bank of  Korea will be eased for increased capital investment by  corporations. These loans will be excepted from credit controls.    The tax credit system for investment in equipment and plant,  where 10 percent of the investment cost is deducted from taxable  profit for small firms and 7 percent for large firms, will be  extended by the end of the year.    All listed firms in the manufacturing sector will be allowed  to increase their capital by issuing new shares, if they meet  certain requirements.    To stabilize prices and at the same time to ensure smooth  flow of funds, growth of the total money supply (cash in  circulation plus demand and time deposits) will be pegged at  between 14 percent and 17 percent this year, Hong said.    Bank loans supporting government policies will be gradually  reduced, while the Bank of Korea will impose ceilings on  commercial banks when rediscounting notes they have already  discounted.    Corporations will be allowed to set up sales finance firms  overseas to help them increase exports, and companies developing  their own trademarks and designs will be accorded tax breaks to  encourage such development efforts.    Later, Construction Minister Kim U-suk revealed the creation  of a Computer Data Bank on 25 million lots of land across the  country by the end of the year in briefing the president on his  ministry's operating program in 1994.    Private capital will be invited for construction of selected  roads, tunnels and bridges, to make up for fund shortages in  infrastructure expansion projects, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 18 Apr (EFE) -- The peace proposal made by the  Shining Path [SL] on 16 April over a Lima television channel has  created some confusion and led to some speculation regarding  President Alberto Fujimori's relationship with the SL  leadership, which may end in amnesty for all terrorists.    The proposal made by one of the hooded terrorists who  appears  on the video sent to several television channels points out the  need for a peace agreement, under the condition that the  terrorists suspend their attacks and the government its  antiterrorist struggle.    During the political program "En Directo"  [Straightforwardly], broadcast on 17 April in the evening,  journalist Fernando Rospigliosi disclosed that President  Fujimori on 15 April visited the Yanamayo prison where several  terrorists, among them Osman Morote, who is the second or third  highest SL leader, are held under arrest.    According to Rospigliosi, Morote, with a smile on his face,  delivered a gift to the president, but as he could not get it  through the bars, the cell door was opened and Fujimori entered  it, where he exchanged brief comments with Morote.    This year Fujimori also shook hands with SL leader Edmundo  Cox in the prison where he is being held, and it is said that  Fujimori sent [Abimael] Guzman a letter on his birthday in  December, although that information was denied at the time.    According to Rospigliosi, these facts "are worrisome" and  may  end up with Fujimori, if he runs for reelection in 1995 and  wins, pardoning the terrorists.    However, recently Fujimori asserted that no sentence against  terrorists, whether they belong to the SL or the Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), will be reviewed.    The fact is that the SL leaders under arrest, since Abimael  Guzman sent his first two letters to Fujimori in September and  October 1993 proposing peace, smile and treat the chief of state  respectfully.    There are also versions stating that the terrorists'  attitude  is merely a SL maneuver, because in truth they continue their  attacks, headed by Oscar Ramirez (aka Feliciano) and a group of  women that have not paid heed to Guzman's order to halt acts of  violence.    In the opinion of terrorism expert Carlos Chipoco, the SL  wants peace because "it is very weak and virtually defeated from  the military viewpoint."    According to the monthly PERU-PAZ, since Guzman was arrested  on 12 September 1992, the SL "has been incapable of recovering  its guerrilla action power" it had before the leader was  arrested.    The latest data reveals that during the first quarter of  1994, 111 people died as a result of political violence compared  to 573 for the same period in 1993.</p>

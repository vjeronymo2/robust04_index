			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / EBRD board approves reforms: De Larosiere hopes to put the problem bank back on an even keel A RADICAL reorganisation of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the aid bank for eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, was yesterday approved by its board of directors. After the board meeting, the EBRD's new president, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, announced the changes with a bluntness he made famous from his spells running the International Monetary Fund and more latterly the Banque de France. 'I could not go on one week more with the problems we had,' he said. These problems were spelled out by Mr de Larosiere in a document he prepared for the board of directors, who represent the countries and agencies which own the bank: 'It has been stated that the current organisation leads to confusion among our clients and interested business partners. 'It is perceived as being bureaucratic, leading to conflicting approaches, procedural delays and lacking focus in terms of operations and country needs,' the document said. However, in his first press briefing since arriving at the bank on October 4, Mr de Larosiere stressed: 'I think the calibre of the staff is exemplary.' The most important changes are the abolition of the two main operational departments, for development banking and merchant banking respectively. Development banking was responsible for financing infrastructure projects in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, while merchant banking was in charge of encouraging privatisation. Their functions are being absorbed by two new 'banking' departments, one covering southern-based countries and the other for the more northerly countries. Most of the southern economies are less developed and will therefore require greater investment in their infrastructures. In the short term, the EBRD is more hopeful of encouraging the growth of the private sector in the northern economies. 'I think this reorganisation addresses the concern that the bank had insufficient country focus,' Mr de Larosiere said. However, he insisted that there would be no retreat from the EBRD's aim of encouraging the private sector, despite the abolition of the merchant banking division, which was a unique department among the international aid banks in working exclusively on privatisation projects. The bank is not abolishing its sectoral specialist teams altogether. 'We could have followed the World Bank model and had only country specialists,' he said. Instead, each department will contain teams specialising on individual countries and other teams concentrating on sectors which cross geographical boundaries. Some of these sectoral teams, covering agribusiness, power and energy, transport and privatisation, will be directly attached to the two banking departments. However separate teams, covering natural resources, financial institutions, nuclear safety, telecommunications and tourism, will be part of a new operations support group, which will feed in to both banking departments. What this means is that the elimination of duplicated functions has freed some staff for redeployment, while others will be made redundant. These moves will help him in his aim of preparing a 'lean budget for 1994'. He said: 'The first thing I did on arrival here to was institute a hiring freeze.' Subsequently he has asked each head of department to ensure that their groups are 'as lean and effective as possible'. Mr de Larosiere's contribution to this process has been to eliminate the presidential cabinet and the political department, both much favoured by his predecessor, Mr Jacques Attali, who resigned in the summer after widespread criticism of the bank's extravagance and poor management. In total, there will be fewer than 50 redundancies at the bank, possibly as few as 25, though the process of identifying jobs to eliminate has not finished. Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

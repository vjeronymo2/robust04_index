			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Hopes rise over Clinton healthcare bill Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan yesterday promised that the US Senate finance committee he chairs would start detailed drafting work on a healthcare reform bill next Monday, possibly signalling that President Bill Clinton's deadlocked reform initiative may at last be starting to move forward again. The finance committee has been regarded as the key to the healthcare bill. Because its membership of nine Republicans and 11 Democrats, including several centrist swing voters, closely mirrors the political balance of the full Senate, any bill that can't win the committee's backing is reckoned to have little chance of final passage. Mr Clinton and Mr Moynihan have engaged in a tug-of-war over the last few days. The bookish New York senator has repeatedly insisted that legislation guaranteeing universal health insurance coverage cannot pass Congress this year, while Mr Clinton has refused to back down on what he calls his single non-negotiable demand. Mr Clinton this week begged business leaders not to walk away from the healthcare debate, and castigated rival reform plans that might end up covering only 91 per cent of the population. 'Unless we can provide coverage for every American in a reformed system which focuses on both quality and control of costs, the deficit will grow, your costs will continue to grow and undermine productivity, and more and more Americans will lose their coverage or be at risk,' Mr Clinton told the Business Roundtable, a gathering of heads of some of the US's largest companies. By scheduling a committee 'mark-up' on Monday, Mr Moynihan seems to have blinked. Some officials said Senator George Mitchell, Senate Democratic leader, had appeared ready to bypass the finance committee and take a bill passed by Senator Edward Kennedy's labour and human resources committee to the Senate floor if Mr Moynihan would not move. But even if a mark-up takes place, many members of the Senate finance committee remain hostile to the idea of making employers pay 80 per cent of the cost of health insurance for workers, a mandate at the core of Mr Clinton's plan.</p>

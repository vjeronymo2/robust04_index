			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEACHES STILL CLOSED AFTER WEEKEND'S SEWAGE SPILL  </P> <P> Eighteen miles of Los Angeles County coastline will remain closed at least  through today while county health officials determine whether the water is safe  for swimming after nearly 8 million gallons of sewage spilled into Santa Monica  Bay over the weekend.  </P> <P> Despite warning signs, the beach closures did not deter visitors Monday. For  example, at Topanga State Beach, a number of people were enjoying their holiday  on the sand. Several surfers, undaunted by the closure, braved the surf.  Authorities did not intervene.  </P> <P> Health officials will test water samples -- taken from various points from  Topanga Beach to the Palos Verdes peninsula -- for coliform bacteria, which  survive for about 48 hours in saltwater and are indicators of hazardous wastes  that can cause diarrhea and other intestinal problems. If the results show a  continually high bacteria count, the beaches will remain closed longer, said  Jack Petralia, director of environmental protection for the Los Angeles County  Department of Health Services.  </P> <P> "Coliform only says that there may be a risk of disease and that's all,"  Petralia said. "They are an indicator of disease-causing organisms in the  sewage. They can be caused by the soil, from animal droppings, and from other  things, but the specific organisms which would cause the diseases would be  viruses or bacteria."  </P> <P> Since Monday's samples "may be high also," Petralia said beaches will probably  not reopen until Wednesday.  </P> <P> But officials from Hyperion Treatment Plant in Playa Del Rey, which diverted  the 7.6 million gallons of partly treated waste Saturday, said the beach water  is safe because the sewage had been carefully treated with high dosages of  chlorine, which lowered coliform counts.  </P> <P> Hyperion's environmental monitoring division, which conducts daily bacteria  counts, reported that the coliform count was high after the sewage was first  dumped, but the most recent tests showed that it had fallen dramatically, said  Sam Cheng, the division's acting manager.  </P> <P> "Environmentally, we did the best we could," Cheng said. "If there is another  storm, it's possible that this (sewage overflow) will happen again. But at  least we feel really good that we can provide a pretty good bacterial kill."  </P> <P> Normally, much of the sewage from the area is routed to Ballona Creek, north of  Playa del Rey, and is treated with chlorine there, said Hyperion plant manager  John T. Crosse. But because the heavy rains from the recent storm added to the  regular waste runoff, city officials ordered the sewage to be spilled into the  ocean to prevent it from overflowing onto city streets, he said.  </P> <P> "What we are really trying to do is to educate the public that whatever ends up  on the streets ends up in the ocean," said Hyperion plant manager John T.  Crosse. "There are other places up and down the coast which discharge into  Santa Monica Bay, but by far, Ballona is the biggest. We are looking at ways to  deal with storm runoff, but that's still a major problem."  </P> <P> Plagued with an aging sewage system and booming population growth, the city has  periodically dumped waste into the bay and has launched a $4-billion campaign  to reinforce normal sewage conditions and to deal with overflow from storms.  But new sewage lines will not be completed until 1993, Crosse said.  </P> <P> Environmental activists, outraged about the sewage dumping, remain skeptical  about how clean the water is. And many are not sure that chlorinated treatment  of waste is the best solution.  </P> <P> "It's better than nothing that we have this system, that they are doing some  settling out of the waste and then clorinating the heck out of it," said Mark  Gold, staff scientist for Heal the Bay. "But the thing is, no one looks at the  consequences of the chlorine, which can produce a lot of toxic compounds. Is it  really better to knock down some bacteria while producing toxic compounds at  the same time?"  </P> <P> Meanwhile, among the beachgoers at Topanga on Monday was Kenny Davis, 37, of  Marlow, Okla. Two weeks ago, Davis arrived in Southern California, expecting to  see "beautiful beaches." A few days after he arrived, the oil tanker American  Trader dumped 394,000 gallons of oil onto the coast of Huntington Beach. A  little more than a week later, sewage was dumped onto the beaches of Santa  Monica.  </P> <P> "Mother Nature, you've got to figure, she's got to be pretty mad at us now,"  Davis said.  </P></p>

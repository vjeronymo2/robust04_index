			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'VALMONT': A NOT SO DANGEROUS 'LIAISONS'  </P> <P> With "Valmont" (at the Coronet and Showcase), Milos Forman takes us back  between the sheets of Choderlos de Laclos' great 18th-Century novel "Les  Liaisons Dangereuses," back to all those seducers-with-abandon, and for a few  lulling scenes he seems to be on to something.  </P> <P> In keeping with the period, he's dropped the age of his sexual combatants, the  Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. They're now in their 20s, and  their erotic machinations seem more like the careless intrigues of youth  instead of the poisonous, knowing maneuvers of maturity. If it takes the  "dangerous" out of the equation -- and it does, oh, how it does -- the reward  is Annette Bening's dazzling Marquise, red-haired and purring-voiced. To have a  Marquise with buoyancy and humor, whose sweet concern might even be sincere, is  a startling idea; you can see how easily her fellow aristocrats might be taken  in by this warm, beautiful young widow. In Stephen Frears' version last year,  "Dangerous Liaisons," the wonder was that anyone would believe the Merteuil of  Glenn Close for a second; her layers of deceit were so elaborate and so  transparent.  </P> <P> "Valmont" is gorgeous, and for a while you can coast on its costumes and  production details. The novel's period has been moved back 50 years, turning  things into a Watteau dream. But seductive as his surfaces are, Forman's tack  doesn't hold for long. His changes have muted a great tale of betrayal by  intelligence and he has blunted the malign inevitability of Laclos' story.  </P> <P> By changing the fate of key characters, the innocent 15-year old Cecile  (Fairuza Balk) and the deeply pious Madame de Tourvel (Meg Tilly), Forman and  screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere may have thought they were underlining the  hypocrisy of the day. Instead, their conclusions are arch and obvious, like the  wink from the elderly aunt at the film's end.  </P> <P> The story unfolds roughly as before: The action is set in motion by the  imminent marriage of convent-educated Cecile to Gercourt, the ongoing lover of  the widowed Merteuil. To get even with Gercourt (Jeffrey Jones), Merteuil  schemes to have his 15-year-old's virginity taken by her confidant and equal  libertine, Valmont (Colin Firth).  </P> <P> Valmont is bored with the assignment of seducing a child who would "probably  flop on her back out of simple curiosity." Only when it becomes a bet between  the two equals in deviousness does he agree to take it on. If he wins, he may  claim Merteuil (although not for the first time) as payment; if he loses, he is  to shut himself in a monastery and repent his sins.  </P> <P> Visiting the estate of his elderly aunt Madame de Rosemont (Fabia Drake),  Valmont unexpectedly finds a quarry of his own, the unshakeably faithful  Tourvel, whose older husband, a judge, is away on business. This should be the  story's tragic liaison, with shattering consequences; to have its effect  trivialized is perhaps "Valmont's" worst sin. (Its R rating is for its ongoing  seductions, sometimes accompanied by selective nudity.)  </P> <P> Losing the great saga of Tourvel, we spend the first third of the film on  Cecile and her entanglements. And since she goes on to one of the film's newly  minted social triumphs, Cecile becomes little more than a John Hughes heroine  in period clothes who learns that sex is fun and you don't have to tell all.  Pfui.  </P> <P> From the first, Forman moves to emphasize details, perhaps afraid we'd miss  them. His adolescents -- Balk, who is 15, and Henry Thomas as her well-born  harp teacher, the young Chevalier Danceny -- frisk about, skittering on the  parquet floors. ("Return to Oz's" Dorothy and E.T.'s little pal, Elliot, as our  young lovers? It's enough to make even baby boomers feel ancient.)  </P> <P> Danceny can't pick up two things without dropping one of them, generally his  harp. It's the same "endearing" klutziness Forman used in "Amadeus" and it's  even less effective here. A chevalier of that day may have been young; he was  also worldly, sophisticated and cultivated, which Forman won't let Thomas play.  (He can be believably steely, however.)  </P> <P> If we have a warm-blooded, believable Merteuil, casting Jeffrey Jones as her  lover Gercourt is another mistake. Better to let Gercourt live in our  imagination. Jones may be part of Forman's stock company, after his dim Emperor  Josef II in "Amadeus," but why use his patented smugness here? Even taking into  account Gercourt's closeness to the King, to have Merteuil involved with this  popinjay makes her seem not calculating but masochistic.  </P> <P> Colin Firth's Valmont is pleasant, a dreadful thing to say about one of  literature's most magnetic seducers. Meg Tilly's translucence is more than  wasted here; for the first time, it is tiresome. It is lovely to see Sian  Phillips as Cecile's rightly alarmed mother, and Fabia Drake's grand, worldly  Madame de Rosemont, forever being awakened to discover that her card-playing  companions have tip-toed away, is the film's bright-eyed Doormouse.  </P> <P> But to consider "Valmont" in the light of Baudelaire's words on "Les Liaisons  Dangereuses" -- "This book, if it burns, must burn like ice" -- is to see just  how far down this ice has been watered.  </P></p>

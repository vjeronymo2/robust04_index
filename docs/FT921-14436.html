			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Economic Viewpoint: More on the not so sovereign pound The most reassuring piece of news about the British economy is that the Treasury forecasters have now flipped over and see little if any recovery in the period ahead. That must be a sign of relief ahead. Not surprisingly activist fiscal policy is once more a respectable subject of discussion. I do not mean that the true prognosis is always the opposite of what the official forecasters say. It is more that forecasts are bound to reflect the present and recent past, with a few twists and manipulations. Recent indicators have been unremittingly gloomy on the real side of the economy; and it is often darkest before the dawn. But there is genuinely cheerful news, and not merely hope, on the inflation side, which is an unmixed blessing. For it is the fall in inflation that provides the headroom for an eventual resumption of growth. Let us take an annual growth rate of the national income of 5 to 7 per cent as providing room for reasonable growth at moderate inflation. This is not a rate that can be guaranteed immediately. In the short term the course of the British economy is tied to the success of the Bundesbank in breaking the momentum of the German wage push. But eventually, nominal demand should be able to start growing again by 5 to 7 per cent, and the course of inflation will determine how much of that can be real growth. This Friday's Retail Prices Index will, as so often, be misleading, reflecting the echo effect of long-distant changes in the price of oil. The most encouraging data come from UK Producer Prices. These do not of course cover the whole economy, but do provide its leading edge. Excluding food, drink and tobacco, which were boosted by the excise duties increase in the last Budget, other producer prices rose by 3.8 per cent in the 12 months to last December, compared with the peak of 6.5 per cent as recently as last February. If you look at seasonally adjusted data, the core rate for producer price inflation is down to 3.2 per cent, taking the last six months at an annualised rate. This is the lowest since the series began, except for two months in 1986 which were affected by a dive in the oil price. If this withering of inflationary psychology carries through to the more insulated service sectors of the economy, the way will be open for a resumption of non-inflationary growth. The achievement is, however, a fragile one, which could easily be shattered by political short-termism without achieving any durable gains in output or employment in return. The main chart is an attempt to put the issue in longer-term perspective. It is an adaptation of the one I produced after the Maastricht Summit on December 12 to show how the purchasing power of the supposedly sovereign pound had fallen since the war. I have made two main changes. The index is now on a log scale, so that a given proportional fall in the value in the pound is always shown by the same vertical drop. Second, I have superimposed for comparison the experience of the US, Germany and Switzerland. The results repay study. First they show that a sum of money which would buy a pound's worth of goods in 1948 was worth just over 6.3p in 1991. The steepest rate of fall was during the Heath dash for growth and the subsequent Labour government. The dollar has also fallen steeply in real purchasing power. But at 17.5 cents it is still worth nearly three times as much as the equivalent amount of sterling. This fundamentally explains why Mr Alan Greenspan of the US Federal Reserve has more flexibility in combating recession than the Treasury or the Bank of England. The German D-Mark, as one would expect, has fallen much less in real value. But there have still been enough periods of creeping inflation to reduce it to 31.5 pfennigs today. A closer look at the chart reveals a remarkable phenomenon. Until the late 1960s, the dollar's purchasing power remained almost as much as the D-Mark. It was only with the inflationary financing of the Vietnam war and the floating of the dollar in 1971 that the value of the US currency really started to shrink. It is a myth to suppose that Switzerland's experience provides any comfort for a policy of going it alone outside the ERM. After a shock appreciation in the late 1970s which alienated local industrialists, the Swiss franc has been informally shadowing the D-Mark. An economist of Birkbeck College London, Mr George Alogoskoufis, has put the message in a more formal way in a series of papers. When floating exchange rates allow countries to control their own monetary destiny, inflation differentials between countries, once established, tend to persist. Moreover once inflation is pushed up by any shock, such as a wage explosion or an oil price increase, it tends to stay high. Under the Gold Standard or Bretton Woods system of semi-fixed exchange rates, on the other hand, there was no such 'accommodation' and inflation described a random path around a low or zero basic trend. In the UK, for instance, up to the 1967 devaluation, neither the advent of elections nor the identity of the party in power mattered for either expected or actual inflation. The ERM could perform a similar function if Germany can overcome its unification strains.</p>

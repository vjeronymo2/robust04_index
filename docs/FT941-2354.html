			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Russia's PM meets Yeltsin amid allegations of coup plot Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, cancelled talks with the head of the International Monetary Fund yesterday and flew to the Black Sea resort of Sochi for talks with President Boris Yeltsin, amid allegations of a coup plot. According to a document printed in the liberal daily Obshchaya Gazeta at the weekend, a group of senior officials had agreed to overthrow Mr Yeltsin because of his physical inability to fulfill his presidential duties. The group, which includes Mr Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime minister, General Mikhail Koslenikov, the head of the general staff, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the leader of the upper house and Mr Yuri Luzhkobv, the Moscow mayor, is a curious one, since most of its members have been close allies of the president. However, the allegations have been taken seriously in Moscow, and security services spent the weekend interrogating ministers on their possible participation in the alleged plot. Meanwhile, Mr Soskovets demanded that the public prosecutor investigate the matter. A senior official close to the government said last night that while there was some truth to the coup allegation, Mr Soskovets was not involved and his naming was a reflection of a bitter struggle for power now being waged around the president. The official said Mr Chernomyrdin had gone to Sochi to brief the president on the allegations. Mr Yeltsin is in Sochi because of his poor state of health, which is giving rise to widespread anxiety. The coup allegations caused alarm in the west. However, senior officials in Washington said last night that they had no information as to their veracity. Mr Chernomyrdin's unscheduled trip was said by one of Mr Yeltsin's press spokesmen to be no more than a routine meeting at a date convenient to both men. However, Mr Chernomyrdin broke an appointment with Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, which had been on his schedule as late as Sunday night. The Obshchaya Gazeta document said Mr Yuri Skokov, the secretary of the Security Council, had been due to appear on Central TV on March 10 to proclaim Mr Yeltsin's unfitness to govern and to present a video of Mr Yeltsin under the influence of alcohol. At the same time, a parallel process was to be set in train in parliament to transfer presidential powers to Mr Chernomyrdin, constitutionally the next in line. However, Mr Alexander Yakovlev, the head of Central TV, refused to countenance the broadcast and informed the president's office about it, after which, according to the document, Mr Skokov and Mr Koslenikov both went abroad. The document said, however, the conspirators then sought to persuade the head of the Gasprom state oil producing corporation, Mr R. Byakhirevo, to make the broadcast. The influential daily Izvestiya said today a plot had been hatched, but said 'once again a state coup did not take place'. Senior politicians said the upper echelons of government were in turmoil. Mr Boris Fyodorov, former vice-premier in charge of finance, said that 'it's clear something is going on, and that the situation is very tense'.

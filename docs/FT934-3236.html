			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Markets Report: FFr back in narrow band The French franc breached its old floor in the European exchange rate mechanism to trade in its former narrow band against the D-Mark for the first time since August 2, writes Conner Middelmann. After opening around FFr3.440 to the D-Mark, the franc burst through its former ERM floor at FFr3.4305. It reached an intraday high of FFr3.423 before ending at FFr3.424, up from Tuesday's FFr3.440 close. Before the virtual suspension of the ERM at the end of July, most currencies in the system were allowed to trade within 2.25 per cent of their central parities, with the D-Mark's fluctuation ceiling at FFr3.4305. Since August 2, most currencies can fluctuate by up to 15 per cent on each side of their central rates. The franc was boosted by hopes that the ongoing Gatt world trade talks would be concluded before the December 15 deadline. It was further underpinned by international buying of French stocks and bonds and switching out of German and into French assets. While the long end of the French yield curve rallied sharply, gains at the short end were limited by the belief that the Bank of France is unlikely to start easing rates more aggressively in the near term, in spite of the currency's recent appreciation. That was reflected by the French March three-month interest rate (Pibor) future, which rose only 0.04 point to 93.51 on moderate volume. The franc is widely expected to hold on to its gains and is set to test technical resistance at FFr3.4230 and FFr3.4180. However, today's publication of Bank of France foreign currency reserve figures for the week ending December 2 may put a temporary halt to the franc's recent ascent. 'If there is no indication that the Bank of France has taken the opportunity to rebuild its reserves (amid recent currency strength), that could damp sentiment a bit' by raising prospects for more central bank franc sales, said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS. The French currency also remains vulnerable to any last-minute complications in the Gatt negotiations. The D-Mark weakened against most European currencies as international investors shifted some funds into neighbouring markets. Throughout this year the D-Mark has attracted huge foreign inflows on the back of Germany's safe-haven status and the Bundesbank's reluctance to cut interest rates rapidly. But 'German rates are coming down now and a lot of the capital that went into Germany is starting to come out', noted Mr Robin Hubbard, chief economist at Paribas Capital Markets. Also dampening the German currency was continued softness in the German call money rate, which slipped to around 6.07 per cent, from about 6.15 per cent on Tuesday, after the Bundebsank added a net DM2bn at its allocation of 14-day securities repurchase agreements at a fixed rate of 6 per cent. Although Italy, Spain and Portugal were closed for national holidays, their currencies continued to strengthen against the D-Mark. The Italian lira rose to L979.2 to the D-Mark, from L983.1 late on Tuesday. The Spanish peseta climbed to Pta81.76, from Pta81.93, and the Portuguese escudo edged up to Es101.7, from Es101.9 on Tuesday. Among the ERM's core currencies, the Danish krone and Belgian franc also appreciated further after Tuesday's rate cuts in both countries. The krone climbed to DKr3.915 per D-Mark, from Tuesday's DKr3.933 close. The Belgian franc firmed to BFr20.82, from BFr20.83 on Tuesday. Sterling firmed slightly against the D-Mark, buoyed partly by the successful auction of Pounds 3bn of 6.75 per cent gilts. The pound hit a high of DM2.5560 before slipping back to finish at DM2.5500, up from DM2.5450 on Tuesday. In the money market, the Bank of England forecast an initial shortage of Pounds 1.95bn, which was later revised to Pounds 1.9bn. In the course of its market operations, it purchased Pounds 1.231bn of bills in the early operation, followed by Pounds 355m and Pounds 290m in later rounds. The US dollar was the only major currency to ease against the D-Mark, finishing at DM1.7050, after Tuesday's DM1.7055 close. In after-hours' London trading it slipped further to DM1.7020, but ended in New York at DM1.7090. In spite of recent economic releases indicating a US recovery, inflationary pressures remain subdued and the recent fall in crude oil prices is reinforcing the low-inflation outlook, easing the likelihood of imminent Federal Reserve tightening and keeping a lid on the currency. 'The idea of US tightening has been pushed on the back burner for now', supporting US long bond yields and pressuring the currency, said Mr Michael Burke, economist at Citibank in London. Traders will be closely eyeing producer price data on Thursday and consumer prices on Friday for further clues on the US inflation outlook. Elsewhere, the dollar firmed against the Japanese yen on reports that US Federal Reserve governor Wayne Angell said at a private briefing in London that Japan should target a rate of Y120 to the dollar to stimulate domestic demand. The dollar hit a high of Y109.15, though it slipped back in the course of the day to close at Y108.60, up from Y107.60 on Tuesday. It ended in New York at Y108.90.</p>

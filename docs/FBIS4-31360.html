			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Jovanovic: "Lack of Veneration"] </F>   [Text] The murder of two soldiers of Serbian nationality  the week before last, committed by Saban Bajram, an Albanian,  only heightened the tensions and intensified the dilemmas over  whether young men of the ethnic minorities should or should not  be called up to do their required military service in the Army  of Yugoslavia [VJ]. These questions are not, of course, anything  recent, but the general development of the situation indicates  that advocates of an ethnically pure (Serbian-Montenegrin) army,  in view of recent tragic events, are gaining more and more  adherents. The problem, however, is by no means a simple one:  The FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Constitution  establishes this as a civil state. And what is called  "depoliticization and deideologization" of the Army is taking  place, but what is happening is that one "belief" (brotherhood  and unity) is being replaced by another (the ethnic belief).    It seems that the new Army also has problems in its  inability  to replenish its ranks solidly with military conscripts, which  detracts essentially from combat capability. Speaking recently  in VOJSKA about the "intolerably undermanned peacetime units,"  General Jevrem Cokic, commander of the 1st Army, says that the  reasons are these: "The lack of veneration for the military  calling, the poor functioning of the law-governed state, and the  failure to take appropriate steps against those who have not  discharged their civic duty, the departure of inductees abroad  without the knowledge or approval of the competent regional  military commands, evasion of the serving of the summons for  induction, dishonest work by the PTT [postal, telegraph, and  telephone service] as the entity responsible for delivering  induction notices, uneven performance of the requests of  regional military commands to apprehend draft dodgers by certain  components of the MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs], and  draft-dodging by Skipetars and some Muslims and Hungarians.    Estimates of how many young men have evaded the draft by  going abroad from Serbia and Montenegro go as high as 300,000  "deserters." For a time, there was talk in "patriotic circles"  about prohibiting these people from returning to the country.  The situation, however, is no better here either: In the same  statement, Gen. Cokic complained of the insufficient reporting  of conscripts for military exercises, which in the 1st Army  (Sumadija and Vojvodina) averages 36 percent; the general  referred to Belgrade as "the weakest" within the territory under  his jurisdiction--at a disastrous 17 percent!  <H5>  Belgrade </H5>   It seems that an attempt was made to resolve the issue of  the  draft by recruitment under contract, but there are many  indications that this is going badly. In late 1993, they did a  two-day analysis of annual operation in the command of the  Podgorica Corps in which that corps' chief of staff, Colonel  Momcilo Damjanovic, was to say: "There is an appreciable lack of  interest on the part of some of the soldiers under contract, and  256 such soldiers have been discharged in the past year on those  grounds."    According to what many have said, this "lack of interest"  consists of more frequent fights and drinking bouts, i.e., a  considerable loss of discipline when soldiers under contract  arrive. This makes it more difficult to maintain the already  shaky authority of the officers.    One of the problems, it seems, is the food. Mento Mentovic,  M.A., chief of the Food Service Department of the VJ, said  recently in VOJSKA: "If regular inflow of budget funds is not  furnished to feed the fighting men, there will be a further drop  in the quality of the food.... Today, the energy value and  biological value of the soldier's meal is on the lower limit of  tolerance, and any further drop would adversely affect the  health of the soldiers.  <H5>  Bosnia </H5>   But what perhaps disturbs the families of VJ recruits the  most are the increasingly frequent stories about VJ forces  crossing the Drina and taking part in the war in Bosnia. There  is mention of death notices in the daily press, nighttime  transports of bodies in metal caskets, overflowing hospitals in  towns along the Bosnian border, and other details. There have  been no official confirmations that such activities are taking  place. It is thought, however, that the balance between the  Serbian and Croatian "regular" participation in the Bosnian war  certainly exists, and that there is a certain "threshold of  tolerance" on the part of the western governments.    At least three questions arise with the most recent crisis  around the northern corridor: Will the FRY enter the Bosnian war  even officially, who would issue the order for such a move, and  what would be the objectives of waging war in such an operation?  Absolute chaos prevails here: The federal and Serbian  Constitutions are at variance with respect to decisions on war  and peace. Affairs of defense and warfare are the concern of the  Serbian and federal presidents, the Defense Ministry, the  Supreme Military Council, the federal government, and the  parliament. In addition, of course, to the General Staff.    Additional confusion has come from the statement of Mr.  Radmilo Bogdanovic, vice president of the Chamber of Republics  and Provinces of the FRY Assembly, who many consider the  unofficial chief of the Serbian police--who said that "a  possible attack on Brcko would be proclaimed aggression, because  that is a free Serbian city." But he did not go so far as to say  whether the response would be the entry of Serbia and Montenegro  into the war.    A possible mobilization in that connection, of course, would  from the outset be deprived of the participation of the Muslims  from the FRY and probably that of members of other ethnic  minorities as well. On the other side, the response of the  "Orthodox" population is also under a big question mark. The  experiences of the war in Slovenia, and even more in Croatia,  provide best evidence of that.    The uncertainty is great and the "manning of peacetime  units"  would perhaps be better if those who were suspicious saw that  the wartime tasks of the VJ, that is, defensive tasks, end on  the right bank of the Drina. The prospects of that are not great  so long as there is shooting on the other side of the Drina.</p>

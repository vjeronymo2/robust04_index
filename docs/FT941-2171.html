			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Price cuts take toll on Swiss drugs group Ares-Serono, the Geneva pharmaceuticals group that specialises in fertility drugs, reported a 33 per cent slide in 1993 net income to Dollars 72.5m. However, the fall was exaggerated by an extraordinary Dollars 27.7m gain on the sale of assets in 1992. Net income from continuing operations was down 9.4 per cent. Sales fell 12 per cent to Dollars 755.3m, hurt by currency devaluations in Italy and Spain and drug price reductions imposed in several countries. Pre-tax profits were down 17 per cent to Dollars 100.6m.</p>

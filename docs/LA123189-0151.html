			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUSKIES MAKE IT LOOK EASY;  </P> <P> FREEDOM BOWL: FLORIDA'S EMMITT SMITH IS HELD TO 17 YARDS AS WASHINGTON PASSES,  RUNS TO 34-7 VICTORY.  </P> <P> It was difficult to know exactly why it all went wrong for the University of  Florida -- or how it all went right for Washington -- in the Freedom Bowl  Saturday.  </P> <P> But rest assured, Florida had a miserable day and Washington had a brilliant  one.  </P> <P> Florida's rushing game, led by All-American Emmitt Smith, ran smack dab into  Washington's rock-solid defense and was rendered useless. Averaging 244 yards,  Florida could scratch out just 121.  </P> <P> The Gators couldn't stop Washington's efficient passing game or its steady  rushing as the Huskies gained 217 yards on the ground and 242 through the air.  </P> <P> It added up to a 34-7 Washington victory before 33,858 at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> The Huskies (8-4) scored on their first three possessions, building a 17-7 lead  by the end of the first quarter.  </P> <P> Florida (7-5) had given up only 28 points in the first quarter this season,  just one more bad sign for the Gators.  </P> <P> Washington quarterback Cary Conklin threw a 21-yard scoring pass to Mario  Bailey on the Huskies' first drive.  </P> <P> Florida (7-5) came right back on quarterback Donald Douglas' 67-yard touchdown  run. But it proved to be the only resistance the Gators could muster.  </P> <P> After the Huskies' second drive stalled at the Gator four-yard line, John  McCallum kicked a 21-yard field goal.  </P> <P> Drive No. 3 ended in a 10-yard touchdown pass from Conklin to Andre Riley.  </P> <P> After that, Washington's defense took over, bashing Smith to the turf at every  turn.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure there was a game this season where we had all three (kicking,  offense and defense) going together for us," Washington Coach Don James said.  </P> <P> The most notable statistics were Smith's.  </P> <P> Smith, a junior who has twice finished in the top 10 in the Heisman Trophy  voting, was held to 17 yards in seven carries.  </P> <P> It was his lowest rushing total since the first game of his freshman season  against Miami. Then, as a promising but untested reserve from Pensacola, Fla.,  Smith gained 16 yards in five carries.  </P> <P> It was only the second time this season, and only the eighth time in his  career, that he was held to less than 100 yards.  </P> <P> "I didn't expect to come into the game and run all over Washington," said  Smith, who averaged 126 yards a game in the regular season. "When the defense  is designed basically to stop the run, you're not going to run over them. It's  not easy to run against an eight-man front."  </P> <P> Eugene Burkhalter, a junior safety who seemed to be everywhere for the Huskies,  thought it would be tougher to stop Smith.  </P> <P> "All we had to worry about was Emmitt," Burkhalter said. "It looked to me like  he didn't want to be out here. But I don't know if that's for me to say.  </P> <P> "(Smith) wasn't effective, but that wasn't because of him. That was because of  us."  </P> <P> To be sure, Washington's defensive front, anchored by 6-foot-4, 300-pound end  Dennis Brown and supported by Burkhalter, stifled the Gators. But time of  possession was a factor, too.  </P> <P> Washington controlled the ball for 41 minutes 52 seconds, leaving Florida the  remaining 18:08. In the end, the Gators didn't have the ball so they couldn't  run with it.  </P> <P> After Florida fell behind, Smith played sparingly. He had only two carries for  three yards in the second half as the Gators turned to the pass.  </P> <P> That didn't work either.  </P> <P> Douglas, a freshman, completed eight of 18 passes for 91 yards and one  interception. Lex Smith, another freshman who replaced Douglas in the second  quarter, was three of 10 for 57 yards.  </P> <P> "Shutting down both their quarterbacks was a key," Brown said. "We were in the  backfield causing a lot of havoc. And we had them confused for a while."  </P> <P> Washington increased its lead to 24-7 when Jaime Fields recovered a blocked  punt in the end zone for a touchdown.  </P> <P> McCallum added a 32-yard field goal with 18 seconds left and the Huskies led,  27-7, at halftime.  </P> <P> The Gators sputtered just as badly in the second half as their best scoring  chance ended with Douglas fumbling at the Washington seven late in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> Washington added a 20-yard touchdown run by backup quarterback Mark Burnell for  the final score.  </P> <P> Conklin left the game with eight minutes to play after competing 21 of 39  passes for 217 yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised the game was not close," said Conklin, who was named  Washington's most valuable player. "We executed everything very well. It was  fun out there. I felt like a doctor, just picking away. They weren't covering  up people the whole first half."  </P> <P> That was most evident on the Huskies' first touchdown.  </P> <P> Conklin found Bailey wide open down the middle for a 21-yard touchdown pass  play. The Gators tried to cover Bailey with inside linebacker Jerry Odom, who  was overmatched.  </P> <P> "I knew right off the bat that we had a mismatch there," Conklin said. "We had  the right play called and I knew (Bailey) could get a couple of steps on the  linebacker."  </P> <P> Washington's new one-back offense, designed to spread the defense, also made  the Huskies' ground game stronger.  </P> <P> Running back Greg Lewis found gaping holes on his way to 103 yards in 27  carries.  </P> <P> Washington's 217 yards rushing was the most Florida, fifth-ranked in the nation  against the run, had given up this season.  </P> <P> "Our offensive line manhandled them today," Lewis said. "When our offensive  line is going like that, it makes things easier for me."  </P> <P> Easy was the best way to describe Washington's victory.  </P></p>

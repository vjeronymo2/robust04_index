			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME COMPUTER: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> GETTING THE WORD  </P> <P> BACK IN THE 1950s, when Bishop Fulton J. Sheen was beating the pants off TV  comedian Milton Berle in the TV ratings wars, Berle complained that it wasn't a  fair contest because Sheen had better writers: "Matthew, Mark, Luke and John."  Nowadays, Berle wouldn't have that excuse -- not if he had Wordworker, the  Accelerated New Testament, in his personal computer. Wordworker isn't just the  New Testament on a floppy disk. It's a screaming data base, which is to say  it's so fast that the program practically jumps out of the screen at you. The  word window gives a list of 6,063 different words, arranged alphabetically with  their frequency of occurrence. God, it turns out, occurs 1,354 times, father  352, Satan 36, Caesar 21 and Gethsemane twice.  </P> <P> Searches are instantaneous. And the text with accompanying chapter and verse  appears in a window on the right of the screen while the list of search words  appears on the left. It's possible to search for individual words, lists of  words or words in a sequence ("Verily, I say unto you," for instance, appears  102 times.)  </P> <P> When you find the desired chapter and verse, you can export the pertinent  passage directly into your sermon, paper on comparative religion or letter of  encouragement to your son or daughter.  </P> <P> For additional commentary, Wordworker also cross-references the usage of each  of the New Testament's 7,956 verses to 12 standard Bible reference volumes by  the publisher, The Way International.  </P> <P> There's something intriguing (though still a bit shocking) about having the  Bible on a data base. Out of curiosity, you find yourself looking up every  reference to wine, blasphemy or adultery. Or comparing Matthew's account of the  birth of Christ to that of Luke. Men of the cloth have long known that even the  devil can quote Scripture to his purpose. Now with Wordworker, so can anyone  with a personal computer.  </P> <P>  Wordworker is a shareware program, available free or at minimal cost (without  a manual) from bulletin boards or software sources. A registered copy with a  bound manual is available from the publisher for $45 plus $2.50 shipping.  Contact The Way International Bookstore, P.O. Box 328, New Knoxville, Ohio  45871; telephone (419) 753-2523.  </P> <P> </P></p>

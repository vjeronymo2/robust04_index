			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Stake sale boosts Cairn to Pounds 2.3m The placing of a minority stake in a US offshoot enabled Cairn Energy, the oil and gas explorer and producer, to report pre-tax profits up from Pounds 818,000 to Pounds 2.31m in 1993. The Pounds 3.66m surplus made up for a write-down of oil and gas assets totalling Pounds 2.66m. Results were also helped by the acquisition of Teredo Petroleum in May and a firm US gas market. However, Mr Norman Lessels, chairman, warned that if the current low oil prices were maintained 1994 cash flow and profits would be adversely affected. Group turnover was up from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 18.2m. Earnings per share were 3.52p (3.03p). During the year the group sold its interest in the Hatfield Moors UK onshore gas field and an onshore New Zealand oilfield for a total of Pounds 1.9m.</p>

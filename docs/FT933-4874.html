			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Equal pensions for men and women LOBBYING by the UK life and pension industries has persuaded the European Court of Justice to delay by several months a key ruling on how employers are to provide equal pensions for men and women. The Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds were said to have argued that the advice given to the court on equalising pensions would result in inequality in terms offered to those with occupational pensions compared to those with private pensions. A ruling in the Coloroll case, expected this month, will now be delayed until December or January. In the case, involving the pension schemes of the former home furnishings company now in liquidation, the court has been asked to decide which elements of a pension have to be made equal for men and women.</p>

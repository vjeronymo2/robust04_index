			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: An offer that's all but dead and buried - SCI has made a hostile bid for Great Southern. Simon Davies reports on why it is unlikely to succeed The most intriguing fact regarding Service Corporation International's offer document for Great Southern Group, which was released yesterday, is that its 'premium offer by a premier company' has no apparent chance of success. However, the UK's first hostile takeover for a funeral business looks set to develop into a lengthy saga of power and possibly greed within the hither-to quiet traditional family-oriented world of undertak-ing. The US funeral giant's bid for a slice of Britain's funeral market got off to an inauspicious start, when JD Field &amp; Sons, which controls 56.1 per cent of Great Southern, spurned the offer within minutes of its arrival. Great Southern's own board, which comprises four Field family members, yesterday followed up its earlier rebutt-al. Mr James Smillie, chairman, said: 'The offer document contains no new information which would cause the board to change its view that SCI UK's unsolicited and unwelcome offers are totally inadequate.' Many might have considered the game was over, but Mr Bill Heiligbrodt, the former marine and unabashed Texan cowboy who is chairman of the company, has set himself the task of roping in Great Southern, and he is in no mood to give up. The stock market is giving him some credence. The share price closed unchanged yesterday at 614p, compared with a 600p bid, indicating the expectation that there is more to come. Mr Heiligbrodt, who arrived on May 30 hoping to line up a deal with the Field family, said yesterday: 'I'm happy to discuss my value with them, and if there is something I've missed, I'll talk about it. But if they just don't want to sell out, then they should say so.' He can afford some degree of confidence. His employers buried 205,000 people last year, and boast a 9 per cent share of the US market along with a large chunk of the Australian and Canadian markets. The UK is a logical extention. SCI has a market capitalisation of about Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.44bn) but it is faced with a mature market and enormous cash flow. In the past three years it has used this to increase its number of funeral homes by 54 per cent, and its cemeteries by 32 per cent, to consolidate its position as the world's largest private funeral operator. It has no interest in diversification - 'what other business has no inventory, a low asset base and no need for technology', says Mr Heiligbrodt  -but it wants to break into new markets with similar traditions. Mr Heiligbrodt says SCI has coped with the enormous cultural range of the US and has no fears of upsetting British traditions. It wants to use Great Southern as a base to expand into the fragmented UK market. SCI's document focuses on the slowdown in Great Southern's projected earnings per share growth, and sets this out against the fact that it made 20 acquisitions between 1988 and 1990, but only one in the past three years. 'If JD Field is to maintain its control of Great Southern, the potential to make acquisitions is limited in the future,' claims the document. Brokers have not been convinced. They claim the offer ignores Great Southern's expansion into crematoria, and its build up of Chosen Heritage, the pre-paid funeral business which has become a main money spinner. 'There is not much more opportunity for consolidation in the conurbations', said one analyst. However, at this stage JD Field &amp; Sons, the Field family's holding company for Great Southern, is the real issue, and it is proving an awkward adversary. The Field family have apparently been in the burial business since 1690, putting SCI's founding Waltrip family to shame - their initial Houston funeral home was not set up until 1928. Great Southern was listed in 1986, but the Field family have scarcely lightened their grip. JD Field is 26 per cent owned by patriarch Mr Edward Field and three sons, with a further 70 per cent owned by five family trusts. It is these trusts that have been targeted by SCI for a Pounds 458 per share offer, which compares extremely favourably with the last transaction in the shares, eight months ago, at Pounds 55. However, all of the trusts have a Field family member as trustee, and Mr Peter Wills, a family friend and company secretary of JD Field, is the other trustee for most of them. Since the JD Field board is unanimous in its opposition to the offer, there seems little hope, regardless of its merits. Mr Heiligbrodt remains optimistic that he is paying a generous premium and its value will shine through. But he may have to offer a lot more value.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Mr Major's error Forget 'Welsh windbag'. The way things look this morning, we may be about a month away from calling Mr Neil Kinnock the new Welsh Wizard. He is already credited with wizardry because he has converted what only three or four years ago was a ragbag of far leftists, unilateralists, xenophobes, and economic illiterates into a Labour party that looks electable. Of course, in that endeavour he had the assistance of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Her triumphs frightened Mr Kinnock and his party; they were obliged to change. No matter. The effect is the same. The Labour leader scents victory. As is the way of British politics, many of Mr Kinnock's present detractors will fawn upon him if he becomes prime minister. That this might come to pass as the result of a hung parliament is one reason why I am beginning to imagine that he may be using magic potions, or casting spells. He must be jinxing his principal opponent. It is difficult to think of any other explanation for Mr John Major's unfortunate timing of the election. Win, lose or draw, there has to be a question mark over either his ruthlessness or his strategic judgment. Think about it. He might have gone to the polls immediately after his selection by his party's MPs in November 1990, and won, or he might have coldly asked for a verdict while at a peak of popularity at the end of the Gulf war, and won, or he might have tried summer last year, or February this year, and stood a better chance of winning than he appears to do today. (I thought he would lose if he went last November. Some of his close colleagues disagree.) This is too bad. An incumbent prime minister is theoretically in possession of an advantage over the opposition. He or she can decide the date of an election. President Bush must envy this British device. He would have romped home last spring. But he could not have conducted his campaign for re-election immediately after the Gulf war even if he had wanted to. The US constitution does not allow such merciless opportunism. As a result, Mr Ronald Reagan's heir looks surprisingly vulnerable. On this side of the water, Mr Major had a rare opportunity to overcome the disadvantages of being heir to 12 years of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. He failed to grasp it. The war could have seen him returned with a comfortable working majority. Now the Conservatives may have to fight hard even to become the largest party in a hung parliament. The prime minister had the best of motives. He did not go in December 1990 because the poll tax was still in place, people did not know him, and the war was imminent. He stayed his hand in the early spring of 1991 because, understandably, it seemed improper to exploit the war - and, anyway, the wounds caused to his party by the departure of Mrs Thatcher were not yet healed. He declined to call an election later in the year because he had pledged himself to see the Maastricht negotiations on the future of the European Community through to a successful conclusion, which he did. That said, he made one supreme, and possibly fatal, strategic mistake. He believed the forecasts of his own Treasury. Along with many others he took the view that the end of the recession would have started by now, that people would feel the beneficial effects of the upturn, and that in consequence he could safely wait until this April or May before naming the date. I was myself susceptible to this rosy conventional wisdom at various times last year, but a prime minister, particularly one who has served in the Treasury, is supposed to know better. Mr Major did not. He is therefore on the brink of calling an election at a time when the slight advantage in the latest few opinion polls is Labour's. Governments usually lose or just hold on to support between the date of the announcement of the election and voting day. In 1983, the Conservatives gained a point, if you assume that they started with an average of the six polls taken immediately before the campaign began. In 1987, they lost a couple of points to the alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats. If that precedent holds true this time, the Conservative overall majority will vanish, and we will have an interesting parliament. There is no rule that would prevent Mr Major from postponing the contest until the end of June or the first week in July. The difficulty is that he is circumscribed by public expectations. He would be derided as scared if he gave a later date now. Here again, it is he who has boxed himself in. There are plenty of telling examples of previous prime ministerial tribulations (Callaghan in 1978-79 for one) which should have warned him not to get into such a pickle. But he is in it now. The Tories' last hope is that they will be rescued by this afternoon's Budget. They may be, but if not, Mr Major's choice of spokesman is likely to be questioned. I have deliberately used the word 'spokesman' and not 'chancellor' because it is as the purveyor of a party political broadcast that Mr Norman Lamont will be judged this afternoon. What he has to offer us in the way of tax cuts and talk of an end to the recession will be the principal selling point of the Tory case for re-election. For all I know, Mr Lamont may have produced the wisest set of public accounts of the present century, but it is how he presents them that will matter. On this aspect of the occasion, you will appreciate my doubts by imagining, say, Mr Nigel Lawson delivering the same speech. It may seem right to report back in different vein tomorrow. We may see a brilliant, nay, miracle, Budget this afternoon. Mr Lamont may show faint stirrings of unprecedented oratorical ability. We can then expect a stunning campaign, and the rescue of the Tories. Just do not ask me to believe any of that this morning.</p>

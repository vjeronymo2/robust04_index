			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Art, but not just for art's sake - Cartier is using sponsorship to raise awareness among the young Some company chairmen might be tempted to see their corporate art collection as a chance to indulge themselves by dabbling in the art market: but Alain Dominique Perrin, head of Cartier, the jewellers, prefers a business-like approach. 'It's pure marketing,' he claims. 'I'm passionate about art, but that has absolutely nothing to do with our corporate activities. Cartier began buying contemporary art 10 years ago - strictly for commercial reasons. It's been part of our marketing strategy ever since.' This month marked the start of a new phase in Cartier's art strategy with the opening of a stunning FFr120m (Pounds 14m) glass palace in the Montparnasse area of Paris designed by Jean Nouvel, the futuristic French architect. The new building will house the headquarters of Cartier France and the Fondation Cartier art collection. Art sponsorship is an established part of corporate life in France. A good corporate citizen is expected to support the arts: not simply by sponsoring occasional exhibitions but by forging a long-term relationship with a particular medium. The GAN insurance group has nurtured close links with the cinema: as has Credit Commercial de France, the bank, with photography. Cartier had a dual aim when it ventured into the cultural arena. Perrin decided in the early 1980s to 'give a face-lift to a 150-year-old luxury house' by raising awareness of Cartier among younger consumers and opinion formers. The company in 1983 conducted a research study that identified contemporary art as an appealing area to both target groups. It created the Fondation Cartier in the following year and gave it an annual budget (worth FFr26m in 1993) to build up a collection. The foundation has since staged exhibitions in a villa and park at Jouy-en-Josas near Paris and has sponsored shows in other countries. Cartier regularly researched the impact of the foundation's work. Perrin says that it has been 'clearly proven' to have 'a very positive impact on the brand' among the target groups. The foundation has also become part of Cartier's staff relations programme by organising regular visits and contemporary art classes for employees. After 10 years the foundation has completed its original objective of building up a contemporary collection. Cartier has decided to mark the move to central Paris with a change of direction. The core of the existing collection will be displayed at Montparnasse, but the bigger pieces of sculpture will be donated to museums in eastern Europe. The emphasis of the foundation's work will also switch from acquisition to organising temporary exhibitions and artists' residencies at Montparnasse. 'The foundation has achieved a lot over the past 10 years,' says Perrin. 'Now it's time to move on.'</p>

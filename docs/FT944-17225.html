			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Companies found to be worse off Manufacturing companies appear to be in a worse position, with lower wage productivity and profits and higher borrowings, than they were before the volatile business environment of the late 1980s, according to a report on medium-sized businesses in the Yorkshire area, Humberside and the north of England. Because profits in the late 1980s were used to reduce long-term debts, increase wages and invest, subsequent decline in demand has left survivors in many sectors with excess capacity and, in spite of considerable redundancies, a less efficient workforce, it says. The manufacturing sector has also suffered from increased competition from abroad and the emergence of cheaper imported goods. Many companies face a difficult path back to the high levels of profit, investment and employment enjoyed during the 1980s. It says medium-sized companies are an important vehicle for future economic growth, particularly in the Yorkshire area and Humberside. But essential pre-requisites to their success include wide-ranging skills, a global outlook, constant investment in the development of people and the harnessing of new technologies. 'Medium-sized businesses are substantial enough and flexible enough to meet this challenge, but have a poor economic foundation to build on,' says the report. It concludes that a 'developmental' stance needs be taken by investors, government economic policy and the businesses themselves to realise potential. Profitability Trends in Northern Industries.

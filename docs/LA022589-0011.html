			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI AND 'THE SATANIC VERSES'  </P> <P> In response to your editorial "No Safety Behind the Wall" (Feb. 15):  </P> <P> I, of course, agree with your disgust at the bigotry represented by the conduct  of many regarding "The Satanic Verses." But I was startled by your statement,  "The Ayatollah Khomeini is no more a religious leader than was the Borgia  Pope." That statement is simply untrue. Both men, by definition, are or were  religious leaders. You also noted that, "Such squalid goings-on have as little  to do with religion as they have with literature." Surely you have heard of the  squalid, religion-based goings-on in the Middle East, Northern Ireland,  Northern India, Pakistan, and the list could go on for pages.  </P> <P> History teaches very graphically that religion, no matter what its bent, has  never been a wellspring of tolerance for the beliefs of others. By its very  nature, religion is an absolute. Honest education and a free society, with all  of its imperfections, remain our only hope.  </P> <P> JOHN M. RAHT  </P> <P> Oceanside  </P></p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Banana move dismissed - European Court Court recently dismissed an application by the German government for interim suspension of the European Council's new regulation on the common organisation of the Community banana market (see FT, July 6 1993). Germany brought the interim measures application in the context of its application for judicial review of the new rules governing trade in bananas with non-Community countries. The main case challenging the banana regulation continues on its way through the Court. In parallel to the German case, banana companies - including Chiquita, Dole and Pacific Fruit, as well as banana importers, such as Anton Durbeck Gmbh and International Fruchtimport Gesellschaft Weichert &amp; Co - brought applications for judicial review of the banana regulation and for interim measures. Some also claimed damages against the Community, represented by the Council and Commission, for losses they say they will suffer under the new banana regime. The banana regulation imposes a tariff-quota of 2m tonnes for bananas from non-traditional African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and third countries. These are distinguished from ACP bananas traditionally given preferential treatment under the Lome Conventions in France, Italy and the UK and which have duty- and quota-free access to the Community. Bananas given preferential treatment under Lome Conventions are mainly dollar-area bananas grown in central and south America. Within the quota, both categories are liable to a duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 75) per tonne. Outside the quota, bananas from the non-traditional ACP are subject to a duty of Ecu750 and those imported from other third countries Ecu850. The regulation also allocates the tariff-quota among commercial operators. From July 1 1993, the regulation restricts 30 per cent of the quota to operators that have traded in Community and/or traditional ACP bananas which are not themselves subject to any quota. This leaves only 66.5 per cent of the quota to operators which have traded in non-traditional ACP and/or third country bananas. Only 3.5 per cent remains available to operators which entered the market as new entrants since 1992. The ECJ decided on its own initiative to consider whether the private companies had standing to seek judicial review. In a number of orders recently made publicly available, the Court dismissed all applications for judicial review on the grounds that the private companies could not show that they had sufficient standing, since they were not individually concerned by the regulation which was a legislative act of general application. They were affected only as members of the general class of economic operators to which the regulation applied. The applicants, therefore, failed to show that their legal interests were affected in a way that distinguished them from others individually as if the regulation had been addressed to them. On July 6, the Court president dismissed all interim applications by the banana companies on the grounds that the interim measures were linked to the main judicial review proceedings, which were inadmissible. The ECJ said that the question of the standing of the private companies claiming damages was unaffected by the inadmissibility of the judicial review proceedings. It confirmed previous decisions that damages claims are separate and independent actions. Consequently, the damages cases brought by certain companies claiming compensation for the damage caused by the adoption of the banana regulation will continue on their way through the Court just as the judicial review proceedings brought by Germany.

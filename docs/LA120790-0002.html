			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOR A MIRA MESA MOTHER, A PHONE CALL BROUGHT CHRISTMAS AND ANSWERED PRAYERS  </P> <P> For four months, Betty Hampson of Mira Mesa said, she has felt sick at her  stomach. But Thursday morning, she felt ecstasy, hearing news that for her  meant an early Christmas and answered prayers.  </P> <P> It was her youngest of three sons, Randy, on the phone from Iraq, where he had  been held captive since Sept. 4.  </P> <P> "Mom! Mom! Did you hear? I'm coming home! I don't know when, but they told us  we'll be leaving!"  </P> <P> And, his phone time limited, the 32-year-old electrical engineer asked his  mother for one quick favor: Please call his employer so that money can be sent  to him in London, where he wants to stop and see his girlfriend before coming  home.  </P> <P> "I promise I'll be home by Dec. 26," he pledged.  </P> <P> With that, Betty Hampson's burden lifted and her phone began ringing off the  hook with calls of relief and joy from friends, she said.  </P> <P> "I had been praying every day. After a while, that's all you would do. Pray.  And now they've been answered," said the 64-year-old woman. "He said he'll be  home the day after Christmas, but, for me, Christmas came today."  </P> <P> Randy had been calling home somewhat frequently recently, she said. The first  time was to wish her a happy birthday just before her Nov. 3 birthday. That was  the first she had heard from her son since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by  Iraq. Randy had spent four years in Kuwait as a contract employee for a company  doing work for private businesses there.  </P> <P> It was with that phone call, she said, that she learned that Randy had been  captured Sept. 4 by Iraqis, when he tried to sneak across the border into  Jordan with others.  </P> <P> After that, the Iraqis allowed him and others to call home -- but presumably  they monitored the calls and often would cut them off in mid-sentence, Betty  Hampson said.  </P> <P> She was able to learn, though, that her son apparently was one of five men  living in a five-bedroom house not far from an oil refinery, about 25 miles  from Baghdad. Randy presumably was part of Saddam Hussein's human shield.  </P> <P> The men ate three meals a day -- often chicken and rice -- and played  volleyball and ran laps for their daily exercise. There were no indications of  mistreatment, she said. Other hostages who had been freed in recent weeks had  called her, Hampson said, to share news about Randy, and they, too, said he was  in good health and good spirits.  </P> <P> The phone calls from her son were more frequent in the past month. "And I've  heard more from him in the last week than I did in three years," Hampson said  Thursday.  </P> <P> She said she feels confident that Hussein will not back out of his promise to  release Randy and the other captives.  </P> <P> "I think he (Hussein) is wising up a little bit. I think he knows he has to do  something."  </P></p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Observer: By appointment What would Sir Adrian Cadbury say about Queens Moat, whose shares have been suspended since Wednesday? On paper QM would seem to be following best practice on the corporate governance front. It has an audit and remuneration committee which is chaired by a non-executive director - Maurice Hart - who is also an accountant. However, Hart, who has been associated with the group since 1968, was formerly senior partner of Bird Luckin, Queens Moat's relatively unknown chartered accountants. A review of Bird Luckin's clients shows it has a single listed company - yup, you guessed it. Queens Moat.</p>

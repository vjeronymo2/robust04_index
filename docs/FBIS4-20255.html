			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Silvio Berlusconi, prime </F> minister-designate, with unidentified correspondents from the  Presidential Palace -- live]    [Text] [Announcer] Just before 1700 [1600 GMT] Forza Italia  leader Silvio Berlusconi went to the Presidential Palace, where  he was entrusted with the task of forming a new government by  President Scalfaro. Berlusconi has now finished his meeting  with Scalfaro. Fabrizio Ferrari reports from the Presidential  Palace:    [Berlusconi, broadcast in progress] Moderation and the  refusal of any kind of extremism and fanaticism are an essential  part of the style of government which I intend to follow. The  first point is morality in political life. The members of the  government whom I will name completely by myself and under my  responsibility -- in line with Article 92 of the Constitution --  will be unreproachable people who will be asked to behave in an  unreproachable way. The way the state works -- as far as the  power and the life of the government are concerned -- will be  examined [word indistinct] with the utmost transparency.    My predecessors, amid many difficulties and with no clear  political majority, tried to relaunch the economy. In order to  do so, a new climate of confidence for businesses and work must  be created. Public debt must be reduced, unemployment must be  reduced, savings must be protected, and investments increased.  There is also the need for a more just and simpler tax system.  One that is less of a burden for those activities that create  wealth. Little by little, we must give the economic system more  and more liberty and confidence in harmony with our country's  European commitments. The stock exchange trend and other  economic indicators confirm that this task is a difficult, but  not impossible one.    The third point is the unavoidable priority of social  solidarity. A modern state must be less intrusive and more  efficient. Parties must step back and public institutions must  become once again the center of government activity with the aim  of protecting the whole of the community, poor and suffering  people first. Social solidarity does not need beautiful words,  it needs efficient services, run at a cost that is compatible  with a market economy having a permanent and methodical fight  against waste. But there cannot be social solidarity without  giving law and order back to the whole country.    Italy is one country and cannot be split. It is a republic  based on local authorities. Government and parliament are the  center of a public system hugely decentralized. This includes  regions, provinces, and towns. A further effort towards forms  of territorial self-government, which reflects the present  debate on federalism, is desirable. But in order to have a  solid republican renewal, we must first have a stable government  capable of doing an undisturbed and long-term job. I will do  all I can, under my responsibility, in order to form a  government without paying any attention to the old political  games, to the rule of dividing up [power and posts], or to mean  personal interests. Parliament and the citizens will be  constantly informed -- it is their right -- about the policies  and the activities of the government.    As for the problem raised by many people about the  possibility of someone like me becoming prime minister, one who  occupies an important position in economic life -- including the  media -- I think I must give some precise information after the  head of state honored me highly by entrusting me with the task  of forming the new government. There is an antitrust law in our  body of laws: It created a guarantor of competition and free  market. He/she has the power to guarantee, check, and also  impose sanctions in order to protect the market and fair  competition. There is also law number 223 of 1990 which created  the guarantor for broadcasting and publishing: He/she has the  special power to guarantee, check, and also to impose sanctions  in areas which include the press, television, and advertising.  However, I really have a special desire to give the widest and  most objective guarantees on this issue. This is why I can  announce right now that as soon as the government is formed, I  will appoint a committee made up of three famous and respected  lawyers: Professor Antonio La Pergola, a former president of  the Constitutional Court; Professor Giorgio Crisci, president of  the Council of State; and Professor Agostino Gambino, commercial  law professor at the Sapienza University in Rome. They already  have said they are available for the job and the president of  the republic has already approved of them. Their task will be  to renew and complete the present laws so that the mere hint  that those who are in government are mixing their private and  public interests shall be avoided. I will take the proposals  put forward by the committee to the cabinet so that they are  transformed into bills to be approved by parliament. As for the  particular field of the media, pending a change of the present  law, I will entrust the same committee with studying a formula  which would give sufficient guarantees. However, I think that  the best guarantees of all are commitment, love for public  service, and lack of personal interest with which I am about to  carry out this task and possible future government activity.    As I was coming here, I met many people. There were crowds  outside my house and at the entrance to the presidency. They  wished me luck, they sent me kisses and reminded me of the  expectations people have right now. I realize this is a  difficult moment for our country and that there are serious  problems. I realize that there are great expectations and that  it would be easy to disappoint people. I believe I can  guarantee one thing: that this government, if we succeed in  forming a government, will be a balanced team, full of energy  and enthusiasm, with a lot of new faces. I will make every  necessary effort, work as hard as is required and make any  necessary sacrifice, in order to do all that is possible not to  disappoint anyone. I believe we can come through the current  situation. I do not believe anyone has a magic wand, nor that  anyone, even in government, can work miracles. However, I do  believe that our people and our extraordinary country can  achieve a real miracle. I believe that if everyone together  rolls up their shirt sleeves, the country can get back on the  road to growth and kickstart the economy, in order that we can  think about a country -- an Italy -- which is more just, more  open to the needs of those who are suffering, more modern, more  efficient, which is better thought of in Europe and the world,  and is more prosperous and more peaceful. This is the task I  feel I am taking on in the eyes of all Italians. My task will  be to give everything I possibly can and to make every effort  not to fail expectations, nor to let anyone down. Thank you.    [Unidentified correspondent] Excuse me [passage indistinct]    [Berlusconi] Of course not, even if I have begun to think  about candidates for every ministerial position, in order to  find the best man for the right job. To this end, I think it  would be opportune to make a final choice only after I have  completed all the work that I am undertaking, the work involved  in the consultations I am holding. To this end, I will spend  the last few days of this week finely tuning the first draft of  our program. I will also meet members of the political forces  in the Freedom and Good Government Alliance and start to hold  the consultations on Monday.    As for consultations, I think it would be a good idea to  change the order in which I have seen consultations held in the  past. I believe it is right that meetings start with exponents  of the world of work and production, followed by members of the  various [trades unions and employers] confederations, in order  to obtain from them an accurate picture of the current situation  in the country -- of the economy -- and to listen to the  solutions they think would be most likely to solve our problems.  Only at the end of this meeting will I meet members of the  political forces in order to discuss with them what has emerged  from the previous meetings. I will then take what has emerged  from these proceedings to both chambers of parliament for  approval.    [Correspondent] Excuse me, Prime Minister [passage  indistinct].    [Berlusconi] I have not set a final date and the president  agrees with this. I believe the most important thing is to  build the best team and to get the best program ready. I  believe this must be done in however much time it takes so the  best possible result is achieved. Therefore, I have not set a  final date even if I know the current situation is as it is and  too much time must not be wasted.    [Correspondent] You will be the first prime minister to own  and enjoy the support of three important television networks. Is  there even the remotest possibility that you will this year give  up ownership and control of at least two of these networks?    [Berlusconi] In this situation, I must say, for the time  being there is no immediate possibility that one of these  networks may be sold. They are -- and together they make up an  important communications group -- the most important group in  the country -- so they are not objects that can be disposed of  easily. Anyhow, I believe that the professionalism of all the  directors and journalists who work for these networks offers a  guarantee that the news services of these networks will operate  correctly.    I believe there is also the possibility, through the  committee we have appointed, to produce norms that can be added  to the system of norms that already exists in our legal system,  in order to give absolute guarantees to all. I know that our  laws, concerning the possible occupations of a prime minister  and of a government, contain a whole series of situations and  guarantees. Apart from a prime minister's conscience and his  interest in his image and prestige -- I believe you can all  understand how important this is...[pauses] I believe this  insuperable boundary comes first and should reassure everyone.    I believe that the functions of the other government  components are in themselves a control. Even if they are allies  they could find themselves in disagreement with the prime  minister. The parliamentary opposition also exercises a  control, as does the parliament as a whole. Professionals  working in the news services exercise a control. Public opinion  exercises a control. There is also the control exercised by the  media watchdog, the control exercised by the antitrust  authority, and the control exercised by public prosecutors'  offices. So, there is already a system of controls in place  that I believe should make people look at this problem in a less  partisan fashion than has sometimes been the case. To this I can  add the appointments of the three people I referred to earlier  -- I believe they will proceed to further examine all norms in  order to bring about a situation that offers absolute guarantees.    [Correspondent] Over the last 48 hours a lot has been said  about a possible division of the Interior Ministry. Is this  still being debated?    [Berlusconi] I do not believe from what we know so far that  decisions are possible or that ministries can be merged or that  single ministries can be split up or divided. I believe that it  is right that we must get to know the machinery of government,  of the state. I believe that only afterward can decisions be  made in one direction or the other. This is my opinion from  having deepened...[pauses] This is a contradictory term because  I must immediately and briefly add that having taken stock of  the ministries situation it was my intention to give a clear  demonstration of my determination to reduce public spending by,  among other things, reducing the number of ministries and  undersecretaries, but I realized, looking closely at the  machinery of public bureaucracy, that for now it is not possible  to make a decision that has been properly thought through. It  would be making decisions for the sake of decisions -- something  I want to steer well clear of.    [Correspondent] Could I ask two things? First, do you have  any idea how long the work carried out by the three wise men  will take -- the committee -- how long will it take? Second,  did you feel more emotional today, while you were reading your  speech as the prime minister designate, or on the day you  decided to enter the political fray? I think both days were  emotionally charged.    [Berlusconi] As far as your first question is concerned,  these men will be appointed immediately -- it will be among the  government's first actions -- and they will take the necessary  time to carry out what we are asking them to do. For this  reason I cannot predict how long it will take, but I do not  think it will be long -- a question of a few months, I think.    As far as feeling emotional is concerned, I think you have  the right to be emotional when on the one hand you change your  life completely, as was the case on the day I entered the fray  -- and I must say I feel emotional today as well because I feel  I have a great responsibility on my shoulders. I have been in  touch with the people over these last few months, and above all  with some of the poorest people. They told me about their  problems and wanted the state to do something to help them. I  feel I have an enormous responsibility to these people. I feel  this responsibility as I have never felt one before. I feel  that I am at the center of a huge responsibility. I believe  that I will be able to make every effort, to use all my  strength, not to let these people down, and to find in the  framework of what is possible -- via the machinery of  government, among other things -- to find answers and above all  improve the condition of these people and improve life in  general in our country. I have often asked what they really  wanted. The question [as heard] that I hear most often is that  they want something good to happen. I think we will make every  effort to do something good.    [Correspondent] This question is for a live news program on  RAI Due Television Network. You have just explained the main  points of what is basically a moderate program. How can it  satisfy the extreme demands made by some of your political  allies?    [Berlusconi] I cannot recall any extreme demand, any demand  that is not moderate, balanced, and measured. I think there  have been statements made by individuals. They were probably  exaggerated by the media. When I sit around a table with my  allies to discuss concrete problems, I find they are measured,  balanced, and full of common sense. In any case, this is the  style of government the prime minister will have to guarantee to  his allies, to parliament, and to the whole country. It will be  a government of people with common sense, experienced people,  people who can come up with original solutions and who have the  courage to change. They are balanced, measured, and reflective  people.    [Correspondent] I would like to ask you a question about  your  personal interests abroad. Have you come up with some solution,  as I think that the three wise men are maybe not in the position  to give advice....    [Berlusconi, interrupting] I do not have personal interests  abroad. The Fininvest group, which I left as far as operational  management is concerned -- as you know I have resigned from all  posts in the Fininvest group -- only has a stake in Tele Cinco  in Spain. This is the most important company. As for that  company, the present managers of the group are thinking about  solutions, and it has not been ruled out that the stake could be  sold.    [Correspondent] Your ally Bossi insists that he wants the  Interior Ministry. Some League's members said today that they  would enter the government. The Cusani trial is about to  finish. Are you still considering Di Pietro? [Di Pietro,  prosecutor at the Cusani bribes trial, has been repeatedly  mentioned as a possible candidate for the post of interior  minister].    [Berlusconi] I do not want to discuss the names of  ministers.  It is a very complicated issue, which will be tackled in the  next few days. We have this period of time, from today to the  day when we shall present the complete government team, to  consider, in all its aspects, the problem of who the ministers  will be. Allow me not to give you an answer on this issue.    [Correspondent] Can you tell me how you intend to proceed as  far as institutional and constitutional reform are concerned?  Do you have a schedule and do you intend to find an agreement  with the largest possible part of parliament?    [Berlusconi] There is a very precise law, there is the  Constitution, which is our first law. It says clearly how the  Constitution can be changed. It is clear that only that part  can be followed, and quite clearly if the reforms are important  ones, they will have to be submitted to the decision of the  Italian people through a referendum.    [Correspondent] After what you said, I think that the lists  for the European elections will be prepared before the  government is formed. Do you think that you are going to be a  candidate in the European elections in some constituency?    [Berlusconi] Allow me for the moment to be the figure I  represent, that is the prime minister-designate. That is,  someone who must consider the interests of all the Italians and  not the interests of one political side, even if mine is not a  party, it is only a movement. I am happy to answer your  questions but only if they are questions about the future  activity of the prime minister.    [Correspondent] [question indistinct]    [Berlusconi] As you know, we have always paid much attention  to what I call the other half of heaven, that is to the world of  women. Not only the brave women who work, but also the women who  remain at home and who sacrifice themselves to raise children  and to take care of the family. I think that we shall pay much  attention both to their situation and, more generally, to the  situation of families. I think that many of the measures we have  been working on already, and which are measures that I hope will  soon become law, concern precisely the family. And let me add  that, on this issue, our program will really stress our  tradition, our cultural tradition, which includes the values we  have learned, the basic values of Catholic religion. I can tell  you that we are seriously studying the possibility of a ministry  of family. I think that what we manage to do will be something  really new.    [Correspondent] A question about foreign affairs: will the  country's policies be followed, in particular as far as our  eastern borders are concerned?    [Berlusconi] We shall certainly continue the same policy. We  shall certainly confirm our love and admiration of the European  institutions and for a Europe that is increasingly moving toward  unification, even a monetary one. We shall confirm our Atlantic  policy. As for the borders, I think that things are already  clear. Even those who made certain demands have explained  clearly what they meant. I think that what is demanded is only  reciprocity as far as the Italian minorities in that state are  concerned. Thank you very much for being here. I am now going  to inform the speakers of the Chamber of Deputies and of the  Senate and outgoing prime minister Ciampi of the task with which  I have been entrusted. Thank you.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Semiconductors sense a scramble: As hopes of an end to recession start to brighten, economic barometers show mixed climate THE semiconductors market, a barometer of economic activity, is showing such strong signs of a pick-up in demand that it may experience a shortage of supplies by the end of the year, according to leading semiconductor manufacturers. In growing numbers, manufacturers in the UK report a strong surge in orders in the first quarter of this year. In some cases, they are seeing extended lead times as customers place product orders in advance. 'We have now come to the bottom of the semiconductor cycle,' says Mr Raymond Ambrose, manager of marketing development and research at SGS-Thomson Microelectronics in the UK. 'Recovery is under way and we are looking at 5 per cent to 10 per cent growth rates this year.' The growing demand has been driven largely by new applications in the computer, telecommunications and automotive sectors. Demand for semiconductors in the computer, or data-processing, sector has been driven by notebook computers and workstations rather than personal computers, says Mr Ken Sanders, managing director of Texas Instruments. The US company has also seen a steady improvement in demand since about November, and the trend has continued into this year. In the first quarter, Texas Instruments' net revenue from UK businesses, of which semiconductors comprise about 60 per cent, has been the highest since the early 1980s, according to Mr Sanders. In the telecommunications industry, demand is fuelled by growth in mobile communications. In the automotive sector, it is due to the consistent increase in the application of electronics in cars. Motorola, the US group that has enjoyed two separate months of record bookings and billings this year, believes there is 'a genuine increase in demand'. The rise is strong enough to support about 10 per cent growth in 1992, which it considers significant, as the market was basically flat last year. NEC, the Japanese group, said that if its first-quarter UK revenue were annualised, it would show a better result than in 1988, when the semiconductor industry was at the top of its last high growth cycle. The Electronic Components Industry Federation expects the automotive sector to show the strongest growth in semiconductor demand at 28 per cent this year and overtake the military sector in terms of the value of semiconductor sales. Most manufacturers say that if the increase seen in the first quarter persists, the industry might soon see another year of high growth, repeating its historical boom-and-bust pattern. 'I fully expect that we will go into another boom situation,' Mr Ambrose says. It will be a welcome break for the industry, which has seen demand and prices plummet in the past few years. The federation estimates that the sales value of semiconductors in the UK grew by just 0.8 per cent to Pounds 1.23bn last year from Pounds 1.22bn after a decline in the previous year of 5 per cent from Pounds 1.28bn. After the past lean years, however, As demand picks up increasingly later in the year, the market could very well experience constraints in supply. Faced with persistent sagging demand and collapsed prices, manufacturers have refrained from investing in new capacity. Supply constraints are beginning to appear in some areas. 'By the end of this year we could begin to see a bit of a scramble,' Mr Ambrose says.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- With Germany and France, Italy will  contribute to the development of the European Armament Agency  with equal rights right from the beginning. This was agreed by  FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union)  and Italian Defense Minister Cesare Previti (Forza Italia) in  Bonn on Tuesday [21 June]. French Defense Minister Francois  Leotard, who had arrived on the previous evening, also agreed to  it, Previti said at a joint news conference with Ruehe. Both  ministers welcomed Russia's signing of the NATO Partnership for  Peace, planned for this Wednesday in Brussels, as a "historic  event."    Ruehe paid tribute to Italy's cooperation in the development  of the European Armament Agency. "There is still a very long  way to go. What matters is who advances things," he said.  Major armament projects can no longer be carried out on a  national level. Germany and France have already cooperated very  closely in standardizing armament systems, above all by their  joint Eurocorps. Previti said that Berlusconi's government  insists on Italy bringing more authority to bear in this respect.    He is convinced that in the next few months an international  task force will be formed by Italy, France, and Spain. Then it  will be possible to employ it within the framework of NATO or  the Western European Union. Referring to Italy's possible  participation in a military action in Rwanda, Previti affirmed  Italy's known position: Italy will wait for the UN decision and  then decide. The condition is an international supreme command  and a humanitarian objective. Italy will not participate in  France's individual actions.    During his first visit to Bonn, Previti was received with  military honors. Ruehe paid tribute to the good cooperation  exhibited during the first German UN mission in Somalia.</p>

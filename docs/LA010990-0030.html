			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOCTOR WANTS TO CHANGE PLEA IN ACUPUNCTURE  CASE  </P> <P> Lawyers for a former state acupuncture official who pleaded no contest to  taking bribes in exchange for helping others pass licensing exams say that Chae  Woo Lew now wants to change his plea to not guilty.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contended in Los Angeles County Superior Court that Lew, 53, a San  Mateo acupuncturist, was paid at least $500,000 to rig the state licensing exam  from 1982 until 1988.  </P> <P> In exchange for Lew's no-contest pleas to two bribery-related conspiracy  counts, prosecutors had dropped 56 bribery charges, according to the district  attorney's office.  </P> <P> Lew's new lawyer, Ezekiel Perlo, said: "There is some question as to whether  Dr. Lew understood the intricacies of the case." A hearing on a motion to  retract the original pleas is set for Jan. 26. Lew's bail was increased last  week to $100,000.  </P></p>

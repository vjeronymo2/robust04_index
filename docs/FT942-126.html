			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Aux armes capitalists: Russian industry must restructure if the second phase of privatisation is to attract foreign investors Russian privatisation is at the end of its beginning: its first phase will be deemed complete today, its second starts tomorrow when a new tranche of enterprises is offered for sale to the public and, equally important, to foreign investors. The first stage of the privatisation process has, in the 18 months since it began, put 70-80 per cent of small businesses and shops into private hands; privatised 15,000 medium and large-scale enterprises, largely by giving vouchers to the entire population which could be exchanged for shares; made 50m Russians shareholders; transferred nearly two-thirds of the labour force out of the state sector; created more than 600 mutual, or voucher investment funds with 40m shareholders. 'We have,' says Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation, 'broken the back of the old system. We have created a broad base of shareholders who have an economic interest in the success of reform.' But the speed, and the explicitly political endeavour to create a bourgeois class much as the Bolsheviks strove to create a working class as their base, has left many problems unanswered - as critics such as Stanislav Shatalin, the veteran radical economist, and even participants in the reform process, agree. 'We can already say that the aims of the privatisation programme have failed,' says Shatalin, 'mainly because a large part of the companies have not the financial and material resources to carry through any kind of a production programme.' Maxim Boycko, head of the Russian Privatisation Centre, wrote in a harshly realistic assessment made with Andrei Shleifer, the Harvard economist who has assisted the privatisation process, that 'most enterprises continue to be run unchallenged by old management teams, which often lack the human capital and interest to initiate significant restructuring . . . enterprises that do want to restructure often lack the capital to move aggressively . . . private markets have not succeeded in delivering capital to privatised firms.' The programme moved so fast because it cut with the grain of just-post-Soviet society, where the workers and the managers possessed a huge passive power to block initiatives from the top. They did this throughout Mikhail Gorbachev's flailing efforts to improve the economy, and they mean to continue to fight any measures which threaten their jobs. Thus privatisation was skewed towards the insiders - the workers and the managers  -giving them, in the option chosen by some 80 per cent of the enterprises, the right to own 51 per cent of the shares for nothing or for nominal sums. According to Professor Yevgeny Yasin, head of a council of economic experts which advises President Boris Yeltsin, the insiders own on average some 70 per cent of the privatised enterprises, 'and want to keep it that way for what they see as their own security'. For these reasons, the next stage is, as Chubais puts it, 'the stage of strategic investment'. It is, or should be, the time when both Russian and foreign investors come forward with cash, not vouchers, and come into their rights of ownership. Such rights include changing management, cutting jobs, shaping up the companies for domestic and foreign competition. Chubais has fought legions of enemies, especially in the old Russian Supreme Soviet, who attempted to keep some kind of state control of industry. He has beaten most of them back, but to keep his shaky initiative he needs Russia's new capitalists to act as if they know they are capitalists. The plans which he has presented, approved by the government this week but which have not yet received presidential approval, are for a programme which reduces insiders' privileges. Investors will be able to buy, at most, 25 per cent of the company at favourable - but much less favourable than in the first privatisation wave - rates. The rest of the shares will be sold for cash. Regional authorities will be given more powers over the process, which is a dangerous matter, as Chubais and his colleagues realise, since many are commanded by anti-reformists. But it is politically necessary. Chubais' obsession in this second round is to empower the shareholders with vague rights of which they are mainly unaware. He points to some successes: his figures show that in 10 per cent of privatised companies, managements have been changed by shareholders' meetings. But he acknowledges that, for example, the present bureaucratic approach to bankruptcies means that the state and not the nominal owners of the enterprises has the final say on closing a company down. Further, Chubais wants to make sure that enterprises can buy outright the land on which they are situated; that agricultural land can be sold easily (a process which he believes will be lengthy); that a securities market should be encouraged to emerge; and that most attention be focused on separating out the enterprises' production functions from their social roles as providers of everything from cheap food, flats and kindergartens. The latter would mean a vast shift of responsibility onto the shoulders of regional and local administrations. A significant part of Chubais' strategy - though it is touchy, even inflammatory, in Russia's nationalist-tending political arenas - is to attract foreign businesses. These have not been wholly absent from the first phase of privatisation. There have been a number of quiet purchases of substantial blocks of shares, usually in the secondary market from workers who wished to sell. David Pitt-Watson of the Braxton Consulting Group, an international strategic consultancy, says: 'These will be like a massive win on the roulette wheel in many cases, because they were so cheap: but it will probably take around 10 years to collect.' Now, however, both Russian and foreign financiers are being wooed in earnest  -at least by some members of a still-divided Russian administration. The government's view is, as President Yeltsin said on Tuesday, that Russia is now 'more politically stable than it has been for years'. Top business people are divided. Says Pyotr Aven, a former trade minister under Yegor Gaidar, head of the political party Russia's Choice and former acting prime minister, and now chairman of Alpha Bank, part of the finance group Alpha Capital, says that 'we are now ready to invest'. He cites cement plants as one area where his group's capital is already placed, ready to reap the rewards of the already surging private housing market. But Vladimir Goussinsky, a prominent Moscow businessman, is more cautious, and thus more likely to continue to make much of his investment abroad. Mentioning the project to launch the new-generation Tupolov 204 airliner with advanced avionics and Rolls-Royce engines, he says that government persuasion of him and his fellow financiers to support the project has not worked. He says this is because he does not believe that US and European aircraft manufacturers will allow it into their viciously-fought markets, nor that the Russian government has the clout to promote it abroad. Yet aircraft - or at least airframe - manufacture is one of the few areas where Russian technology is competitive. If no investment here, then where? The answer is probably in more humble areas, such as cement plants. Foreign companies have bought dominant positions in breweries, printing ink companies, perfume factories, food-processing plants and some engineering concerns. Though they have invested, in the past six years, less than Dollars 3bn, they are expected (at least by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister) to jack that up to Dollars 10bn a year before the end of the decade. Some foreigners are enthusiastic: Percy Barnevik, head of ABB Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss power plant and engineering company has 16 joint ventures and 3,000 workers in Russia. Barnevik preaches an interactive learning process between foreigners and Russians, critically learning to trust each others' long-term commitments. 'The key turning point in our Petersburg plant Nevski Zavod,' says Barnevik, 'was when we said we would teach 100 managers to speak English. Then they said, 'these foreigners are not just here for the quick buck'.' Others are sceptical, like the increasingly bad-tempered oil companies, battered by taxation, bad or non-existent legislation, the hostility of the Russian oil barons and, now, organised crime rackets. The latter are losing their inhibitions about approaching foreign companies for protection money and prey upon the relatively highly paid, vulnerable Russian employees. If this is the end of the beginning, the beginning of the end is very far away. Restructuring, which means shedding management and workers who have tried to use the first phase as a shield against attack, will be harder than what has gone before. 'We are not accustomed to seeing ourselves in the world,' says Mr Sergei Dubynin, the acting finance minister, 'but now we have to compete with other former Soviet states, and with more successful countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Investment has a wide choice.' Choosing Russia - on the part of Russians as well as foreigners - will be the critical decision of the rest of this decade.</p>

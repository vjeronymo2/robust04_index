			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gerardo Bianco, Christian Democratic Party </F> floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies, by unidentified  correspondent in Rome; date not given: "Bianco: `We Need a Few  More Weeks'"]    [Text] Rome -- [L'UNITA] Deputy Bianco, what will the DC  [Christian Democratic Party] delegation tell the prime minister  this morning?    [Bianco] First of all, we will confirm our confidence in  him. We simply need to stress that our group is the one that has  been most consistent in supporting his government and his  policies, up to and including the approval of the Finance Bill,  even if it meant we had to make unpopular decisions.    [L'UNITA] Yes, but are there not many DC signatories to the  no-confidence motion as well?    [Bianco] Many colleagues have already clarified the reason  they signed. They were afraid that parliament would be  dissolved without them being consulted, and we would not have  accepted that. Others, like [Democratic Party of the Left  Secretary] Occhetto, felt such consultation to be superfluous,  whereas for us it is not superfluous at all. Many of the  signatures on the motion can be explained by the conviction that  it was the only tool likely to bring about a parliamentary  debate. Besides, even [Radical leader] Pannella today confirmed  his confidence in Ciampi.    [L'UNITA] But Pannella also wants a second Ciampi  government.    [Bianco] Nobody can stop him asking for another government;  the important thing is that we confirm our confidence. Pannella  also raises some serious questions, such as the possiblity, for  example, that Ciampi's ministers might take sides with one or  the other of the alliances taking the field in the forthcoming  elecion campaign.    [L'UNITA] Are there any conditions attached to your  confirmation of confidence?    [Bianco] We want the parliamentary debate to confirm  confidence in Ciampi and the legislative term to continue for a  few weeks more, although ideally we are in favor of the general  election being held in June, at the same time as the European  elections.    [L'UNITA] Why?    [Bianco] In these few weeks -- and I am talking about three  or four, until 10 February -- we could address the modification  to Article 138 of the Constitution, the right of Italians abroad  to vote, the Court of Accounts, the modification to the  preventive custody law, and the law on public contracts. Many  of these laws have already reached the legislative stage in  their respective parliamentary committees. And in any case the  tax decree and the decree on RAI [Italian State Broadcasting  Corporation] must be approved by a parliament in the fullness of  its powers.    [L'UNITA] So, in your view, the Ciampi government did not  finish its job with the election laws and the Finance Bill. Are  you asking for a renegotiation of the program?    [Bianco] The fact that the government passed two decrees at  the end of the year means that it sees them as essential for  this legislative term.    [L'UNITA] What if Ciampi were not to play ball?    [Bianco] I think that is unlikely, because Ciampi has always  been very respectful toward the will of parliament. We hope to  gain the agreement of all the groups. We are not going to cling  stubbornly to our position; we are prepared to discuss things  with others. We are asking for agreement to be reached over the  dissolution of parliament and for the essential things to get  done in the meantime. That is the position we are putting  forward.    [L'UNITA] Is it a position you need to adopt in order to  quell internal dissent?    [Bianco] We have faith in our colleagues' sense of  discipline. I have summoned a meeting of the DC group in the  lower house for 11 January, and that is when I will ask for  confidence in Ciampi to be confirmed.</p>

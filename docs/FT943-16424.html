			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Fragile Mideast peace awaits next step: Much depends on whether momentum can be sustained It could just work. This was the assessment of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process among Israeli government ministers and officials as the triumphant homecoming of Mr Yassir Arafat, the veteran Palestinian leader, went into a fourth peaceful day. Much depends on whether the momentum can be sustained and the next phase of the process - the extension of Palestinian self-rule from Gaza-Jericho across the rest of the West Bank - can be swiftly concluded. Will Israel confront the 120,000 Jewish settlers living in the West Bank and give Mr Arafat enough room to consolidate the fragile Palestinian support base for the agreement? The summit between Mr Arafat and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, in Paris tomorrow will provide much of the answer. For Mr Arafat, keeping the peace process moving is vital. The PLO leader needs to show opponents and sceptics that Gaza-Jericho is merely the first step on the road towards an independent Palestinian state in all of the Palestinian lands seized by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. A quick extension of Palestinian self-rule to the West Bank will vindicate Mr Arafat's negotiating gambit of incremental assumption of land and power and will confound critics who have warned the Gaza-Jericho deal was an Israeli ploy to leave Palestinians with a virtual apartheid-style 'bantustan'. Without such an extension of self-rule the economic arrangements between Palestinians and Israelis will quickly flounder because the heart of the Palestinian economy - agriculture, commerce and tourism - is centred in the West Bank towns of Ramallah, Nablus and Bethlehem and among the 1.1m West Bank Palestinian population. Furthermore, Mr Arafat will not be able to hold national elections and so prove his determination to meet Palestinian demands for democracy without extending his rule over the West Bank. Under the peace accord Israel is committed to redeploying its military forces out of Palestinian population centres in the West Bank three months after the assumption of self-rule in Gaza-Jericho and no later than the eve of elections, due on October 15. Israel is also pledged to transfer responsibility in five areas to Palestinian authority: education and culture, health, social welfare, direct taxation, and tourism - and any other additional powers and responsibilities agreed between the two sides. The Palestinians have said, however, that the Israeli withdrawal should be completed at least six weeks before the elections to allow Palestinians to organise a free and disciplined ballot. Mr Riyad al-Zanoun, Palestinian health minister, said Mr Arafat would ask Israel at the Paris summit 'to implement the redeployment of the Israeli army in the West Bank, to evacuate the populated cities in accordance with the agreement and to hurry up the transfer of authority . . . by August'. Israel is much more likely to be willing to listen now. Mr Arafat's conciliatory speeches about honouring and defending 'the peace of the brave' against extremists and opponents and the firm security grip the Palestinian police force have established on Gaza-Jericho, have bolstered Israeli confidence. 'All the doomsday prophesies about Arafat's return and Gaza erupting into violent civil war have not come true,' Mr Uri Dromi, Israeli government spokesman, said yesterday. 'We feel Arafat has shown political restraint and wisdom. He . . . is keeping his word. His visit has been a triumph of common sense and pragmatism and taking the success of the first phase we will be armed with more confidence about the potential of the next phase to succeed.' However, Israel has said no dates are sacred and has stressed the technical difficulties of the next phase of negotiations. There are 150 Israeli settlements in the West Bank housing 120,000 Jewish settlers. The painstaking negotiations about security for 4,500 Jewish settlers living in 16 Gaza settlements delayed implementation of the first phase for four months and will have to be repeated for the West Bank. More important, the West Bank is a much more sensitive domestic political issue in Israel than Gaza, which many Israelis were glad to give up. The prospect of Palestinian police spreading out across the West Bank will be met by fierce domestic opposition from the settlers and the Israeli right wing. Although Mr Rabin on Sunday bitterly attacked the 'radical right', vowed to strengthen peace with Palestinians and acknowledged the need to shore up Mr Arafat's political base, he is unlikely to move as quickly as Mr Arafat wants or needs despite the fact that a narrow majority of Israelis continue to support the peace process and direct negotiations with Mr Arafat. Another sensitive issue due to be discussed in Paris tomorrow is Israel's failure to honour its commitment to release 5,000 Palestinian prisoners, another emotional issue which gives fuel to Mr Arafat's critics. Mr Arafat can argue he has kept his side of the agreement. Attacks on Israelis are down by half since the implementation of Gaza-Jericho; the Palestinian police force is functioning well; the national authority is to be sworn in today; the Palestinians are getting down to tackling day-to-day problems; a plan for the October 15 elections is in place. Now it is Mr Rabin's turn to deliver.</p>

Some of the forces of the Russian 27th  Motorized Rifle Division in the Volga Military District and the  U.S. 3d Mechanized Division stationed in Germany will be  involved in the exercise.    Preparations for this, the first joint exercise in the  history of the two armies, are gaining momentum. The KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA editorial office learned that General Leonard Holder,  commander of the U.S. 3d Division, is arriving in Russia Sunday  13 February. After a brief stopover in Moscow he will head off  to the Volga Military District, where the exercise will be held,  and will meet there with Major General Anatoliy Sidyakin,  commander of the Russian 27th Division.    The coming exercise will be a command-staff exercise. It is  thought that around 250 men on each side will be involved in it  -- officers from both armies' divisions, regiments, and  battalions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Vitally Important Decision; </F> NATO--Cornerstone of European Security"]    [Text] Bratislava--Jan Lisuch, state secretary at the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic, on Friday [7  January] presented to representatives of the NATO member  countries' and Visegrad Group countries' missions in Bratislava  an aide memoire [French term used] on the coming NATO summit.  The same text of the aide memoire was presented by Ivan Mjartan,  Slovak ambassador in the Czech Republic, to ambassadors of NATO  countries residing in Prague.    The text of the aide memoire has concurrently been sent to  the Slovak Republic's representative missions in NATO member  countries and to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner. It  states:    On the unexplored path of transformation, the countries of  Central Europe are facing a number of difficulties and  challenges, including the lack of security guarantees. The  existing security vacuum and the possible destabilizing impact  of negative developments nearby could have a negative influence  on democratic structures and the process of economic  transformation in this region.    The Slovak Republic, like the other countries of the  Visegrad  Group, has made the vitally important political decision of  seeking integration into the European and transatlantic  political, economic, and security structures. The Slovak  Republic therefore launched a number of diplomatic activities  aimed at demonstrating its desire and readiness to be integrated  into NATO without needless delay. NATO, as the cornerstone of  the European security architecture, has demonstrated its  competence and ability in defending democratic gains.    The Slovak Republic assumes that the coming NATO summit will  mean the beginning of a new stage in building a higher form of  partnership with the Visegrad Group countries and will enable  the expansion of NATO through the admission of these countries  of Central Europe. The Slovak Republic expects the alliance to  provide a clear and unequivocal reply to the questions of  security of our continent, perceived as particularly acute in  our region.    The Slovak Republic evaluates highly NATO's Partnership for  Peace project, initiated by the U.S. Administration, and is  ready to join it and to actively participate in projects and  missions within its framework. This project will undoubtedly  contribute to a marked intensification of cooperation between  the Slovak Republic and NATO and its member countries on  political and military issues.    The Slovak Republic would like to express its conviction  that  the NATO summit of January 1994 will realistically assess the  present security situation in the new democracies of the Central  European region and that the United States and its allies within  the framework of the alliance will take into consideration the  expectations of these countries regarding NATO membership, will  not hesitate, and will offer to the countries of the Visegrad  Group NATO membership, thereby reinforcing the general stability  in this sensitive part of Europe.    In the spirit of the concept of accommodating foreign  policy,  the Slovak Republic pursues its own national interests--peaceful  cooperation based on guaranteed security in its region, freedom  of citizens in their democratic state, and economic prosperity.</p>

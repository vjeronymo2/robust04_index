			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Burnfield drops 78p on profits warning THE MARKET value of Burnfield yesterday plummeted 47 per cent to Pounds 29.8m after the specialist maker of pressure gauges and other industrial instruments warned on profits. The share price fell from 165p - on a par with this summer's rights issue price - to 87p. Less than two months ago, directors accompanied the announcement of a Pounds 1.1m interim pre-tax profit with a prediction of increased profitability in the second half. For the full year, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the company's broker, had forecast a rise to Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 1.17m). But following a sudden drop in UK orders from mid-September, the figure has been revised to Pounds 2.5m. The company has been reorganised by new management in the couple of years since Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive of Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, became non-executive chairman. It had started to grow by acquisition - Budenberg last year and Malvern Instruments this summer - accompanied by the 3-for-4 rights issue to raise Pounds 22.7m. Mr Ian Staples, chief executive, said UK orders at Isopad, a maker of heating products, had fallen by 50 per cent in September. Normally the fourth quarter was the strongest because its products are aimed at such tasks as frost protection, 'but the orders have not come through'. Isopad's sales were expected to be 11 per cent down for the year at less than Pounds 14m. This was due partly to a planned contraction in Germany, where the recession was deepening. Budenberg, the pressure gauge and thermometer company, had been enjoying a steady rise in orders, but the drop in mid-September amounted to 30 per cent. For the year, its sales would be flat at about Pounds 9m. Last year Budenberg was only included for seven months.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Blenheim shares plunge on downgrade SHARES in Blenheim Group plunged 43p to a two-year low of 355p yesterday after analysts sharply reduced their profit forecasts for the acquisitive international exhibition organiser. Analysts said the formerly highly rated stock had suffered a substantial blow to its credibility after BZW, the joint house broker, along with Credit Lyonnais Laing, cut its profit forecast for the second time in three months. Blenheim, which had seemed to survive the recession better than many other media stocks, suffered this downgrade in spite of reporting an 18 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 15.4m in the six months to June 30. Analysts were particularly concerned about the deteriorating situation in France, which accounted for 27 per cent of group trading profit in the first half. For the first time, the group said it might have to discount the charges it levels on participants in trade exhibitions. Mr Neville Buch, chairman, said: 'With only one-fifth of profits derived from the UK, Blenheim's results are heavily dependent on the economies of France, the US and Germany and their relevant sterling exchange rates, particularly in the second half.' The group said there had been some signs of revival in the US and UK, but France and Germany had continued to deteriorate, resulting in flatter overall sales volumes. Next year's profits will also suffer from the absence of the large biennial Batimat exhibition in France. Mr Buch also revealed an expanded launch programme of 26 exhibitions for 1994, which is likely to cost at least Pounds 4m. He said: 'Investment in new products is not expected to show an immediate return, but it is our intention to continue to improve the competitive position of our portfolio of events in the international exhibition market.' BZW cut its profits forecast for the full year from Pounds 49m to Pounds 45m and for next year from Pounds 55m to Pounds 43m. Smith New Court, which has long been bearish on the stock, is going for only Pounds 40m next year. There is considerable irritation in the City that the reduced profits outlook has emerged so soon after the June convertible share issue, in which Blenheim raised Pounds 75.8m to fund acquisitions in the US and continental Europe.

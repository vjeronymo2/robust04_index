			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The radiographer admitted that he violated NRC requirements by not observing the assistant as she radiographed welds and moved equipment from one location to another (in a later statement, the radiographer said he was aware he was responsible for the assistant but not aware that he had to observer performing radiographic operations 100% of the time). The assistant admitted that she violated NRC requirements by not performing a radiation survey after each radiographic exposure and by not locking the sealed radioactive source in the radiography device prior to moving equipment to another weld. The assistant stated further that after moving the equipment to another weld she noticed her survey instrument was ``pegged,'' an that her self-reading pocket dosimeter was off-scale, both indications that the device's radioactive source had not been returned to its fully shielded position or had been jostled from its shielded position when the device was moved. The assistant stated that her alarm ratemeter, a protective device which is set to alarm in a radiation field of 500 millirem/hour, did not alarm but added that it was probably turned off. Both she and the radiographer stated that she immediately brought this incident to the radiographer's attention an that he ``cranked'' the source into the device and locked it, and that they stopped work for the day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both the assistant and the radiographer stated that they prepared incident reports for their employer, Larry Wicks, the company president an RSO, and that the incident reports were false in that they falsely stated that the radiographer and the assistant were working together at the time of the incident and falsely stated that they had surveyed the device and locked the source in the device prior to its being moved. The Assistant claimed that she told Mr. Wicks at the time the reports were turned in that the incident reports were false, but Mr. Wicks denied this claim during interviews with the inspector and investigator and at the enforcement conference, stating that he did not know the incident reports were false until brought to his attention by the NRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Wicks stated during the investigation and at the enforcement conference that after learning of the incident he sent the assistant's thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) in for immediate processing along with other TLDs worn by company personnel during the month of July 1993. Mr. Wicks also stated that all of the TLDs were sent in the same package. However, the company that processes TLSs for WIX, Laudauer, Inc., stated, through its representative, to NRC personnel that while it had received TLDs from WIX for other employees for the month of July 1993, it had no record of receiving a TLD for the assistant for the month of July 1993 and no record of receiving a request from Mr. Wicks for immediate processing of any TLDs sent in for that month. Exposure records mailed by Landauer to WIX and retained by WIX contain no information regarding the assistant's exposure for the month of July 1993 (her exposure records for all other months are available). The assistant, whom Mr. Wicks placed on restricted duty pending a determination of their exposure, also told NRC personnel that she persisted in trying to obtain from Mr. Wicks her exposure record for the month of July and that Mr. Wicks eventually_about three weeks after the incident_told her that she had received 350 millirem. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Wicks stated during the investigation, however, that he never provided the assistant an exposure estimate based on Landauer's processing of the TLD because he did not have such a number to give her. The only explanation he has offered for not pursuing the question of her July 1993 exposure is that he was very busy. Despite the occurrence of the following events, Mr. Wicks has stated that he was not reminded of the need to evaluate the assistant's exposure from the incident or for the month of July 1993: (1) Placing the assistant on restricted duty from the date of the incident (July 31, 1993) until she left his employ in September 1993; (2) receiving Landauer reports for July 1993 which contained no exposure records for the assistant even though, according to Mr. Wicks' statement, he had sent in her TLD for immediate emergency processing; (3) preparing a summary of the assistant's radiation exposure history for her employer, which included the period in question (July 1993); and (4) responding in the fall of 1993 to a request from the NRC for the radiation exposure reports of terminated employees. In responding to the latter request, Mr. Wicks did not provide a report for the radiographer's assistant despite having provided one for her husband, whose termination date occurred five days after hers. As of the time of the inspection and investigation in January 1994, Mr. Wicks had not performed an adequate evaluation to determine the assistant's exposure resulting from the July 31, 1993 incident. After further requests from the NRC, Mr. Wicks submitted on March 8, 1994, an estimate of 6 rems for the assistant's whole body exposure and at the enforcement conference characterized that estimate as ``pure and simply a guess,'' noting that ``I had to have something to send you.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on its inspection and investigation of the July 31, 1993 incident, as well as the information obtained during the enforcement conference, the NRC has concluded that the Licensee and its employees violated NRC requirements by failing to: (1) perform an evaluation of the assistant's radiation exposure to ensure compliance with NRC limits, as required by 10 CFR 20.201, and send the assistant's TLD in for immediate processing when her pocket dosimeter had gone off-scale, as required by 10 CFR 34.33(d); (2) check the alarm function on alarm ratemeters prior to the start of each shift, as required by 10 CFR 34.33(f)(1); (3) perform a radiation survey of a radiography device following each exposure, as required by 10 CFR 34.43(b); (4) lock the sealed radioactive source in the device after each exposure, as required by 10 CFR 34.22(a); (5) ensure that radiographers supervise assistant radiographers who are performing radiographers operations, as required by 10 CFR 34.44, a repeat violation in that it occurred in July 1993, was discussed during the inspection in January 1994, and was found again in March 1994; (6) provide NRC a report of an individual's radiation exposure following the individual's termination of employment, as required by 10 CFR 20.408(b); and (7) ensure that alarm ratemeters worn by radiography personnel were calibrated at a one-year frequency, as required by 34.33(f)(4), a repeat violation in that it was found and discussed with Mr. Wicks following the inspection and investigation in April 1993, recurred in July 1993 and was found again in January 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

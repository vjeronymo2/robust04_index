			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Dublin budget sees slippage from Emu target IRELAND'S finance minister, Mr Bertie Ahern, yesterday unveiled a 1993 budget which conceded slippage in the fiscal targets required for economic convergence under the Maastricht plan for European monetary union. The slippage is similar to that experienced by other EC states. The ratio of government deficit to GDP will increase to 3.4 per cent, up from 2.9 per cent in 1992, and while the debt/GNP ratio declined last year to 103 per cent, it is now set to rise again in 1993 to 105 per cent as a result of the currency crisis and increased borrowing to meet rising social welfare bills. Mr Ahern predicted GDP would rise by 2.5 per cent in 1993, half a point lower than in 1992, while inflation would rise by half a point to 3.5 per cent. The budget calculations are based on an average sterling/punt exchange rate of 1.02 through 1993 and a fall in interest rates of 3 per cent by the end of the year. Mr Ahern said: 'While I am committed to maintaining downward pressure on public expenditure, it is clear the difficulties facing us cannot be fully met by a combination of reduced expenditure and increased taxation this year. 'Public expenditure will be kept under control. . However, there has to be some increase in borrowing. An over-stringent approach would have damaging effects on investment and employment.' The government's deficit target of IPounds 1.033bn 'will be as close to the Maastricht deficit guideline as is prudently possible in the present circumstances'. The main features of the budget include increased provisions for health and social welfare and an additional IPounds 500m capital spending programme, part of which will be financed from EC funds. On the revenue side, a temporary 1 per cent levy is to be put on all personal incomes over IPounds 9,000, with a small widening of income tax bands and a consolidation of VAT rates, leaving just two rates of 12.5 per cent and 21 per cent. There are also substantial excise duty increases on tobacco and cider. Total taxation revenue is expected to rise by IPounds 126m as a result of the budget measures. Mr Ahern issued a strong warning to public sector unions that no further pay increases will be contemplated in 1993, other than those already agreed. Public sector pay will increase by 7.4 per cent this year. Mr Ahern predicted that consumer price inflation would be 3.75 per cent this year compared with 3 per cent last year. Unemployment would rise to 309,000 from 302,000 now. He also said the government was willing to help Aer Lingus, the troubled Irish carrier, saying any convincing recovery programme would be supported.</p>

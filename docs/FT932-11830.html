			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses reduced in steadier trade PRESSURE ON stock index futures appeared to relax a little yesterday, much to the relief of London share traders. Although the stock market gave further ground, the final picture was much less gloomy. In spite of being upset at first by a fresh setback in UK government bonds, equities halved early losses after the FT-SE 100 Index bounced from the 2,773 area, regarded as the bottom end of the trading range. Good first-quarter results from ICI, now on the verge of its demerger move, helped sentiment. Managers at many of the big institutions were locked in meetings yesterday as final decisions were made regarding investment in Zeneca, the drugs and bio-science side of the demerged ICI. Early dealings saw the Footsie down by 23 points until some initial nervousness in stock index futures was offset by news that the Bank of France was lowering its two key interest rates. Rate cuts in France, following similar moves in German money rates, fulfilled hopes in the London markets, but the impact was muffled by the weakness seen in UK equities since the beginning of this week. However, the reduced pressure on the June futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was a more positive sign for UK equities. Shares rallied in modest trading and the fall in the Footsie had been trimmed to about 8 points when traders turned nervous again ahead of the opening of the New York market. Wall Street started cautiously, and the Dow Average was 16.75 off in London hours. But more important for UK traders was the absence of the cohorts of US sellers which hit the Footsie future on Wednesday. The stock market eased back towards the close but little selling pressure was reported. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 2,786.8 for a net fall of 10.5 points. Dealers said the final two hours of the session had seen a good deal of switching as securities houses put their books in order ahead of the three-day weekend in London which begins tonight. Basket trading between the futures and the underlying equity market continued, albeit on a reduced scale, so that business in blue chip issues again outpaced that in the second liners. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index shed 11.3 to 3,110.4, while non-Footsie business slipped lower to total around 56 per cent of the day's Seaq volume of 542.1m shares. On Wednesday, Seaq volume of 699.1m was worth Pounds 1.39bn in retail business, an average but not exciting daily figure. Market strategists expressed relative confidence in the new levels of the UK stock market. At Panmure Gordon, Mr Robin Aspinall commented that the setback prompted this week by action in the futures market only had such effect 'because the market has been so lacklustre'. Mr Nicholas Knight, London's super bull, reviewing the 'pros and cons' of the market, suggested that 'the pros are in danger of being conned by the bear move'. The strategy team at Natwest Securities headed its advice to clients 'Seller beware', stressing the better performance than expected from economic indicators. The easing of credit stance at the Bundesbank, Natwest comments, might have reduced the possibility of a rise in UK interest rates.</p>

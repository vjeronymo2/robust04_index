			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 1/6/1994 -- At the arrival from  the spring session of the North-Atlantic Assembly which took  place in Oslo over May 26-31, the head of the Romanian  parliamentary delegation, Ion Ratiu, and the president of the  Defense Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, Petre Roman, made  statements underscoring Romania's interest in the integration  within NATO at a date as near as possible.    "We can tell that we have affirmed our position with regard  to the Partnership for Peace. It was my duty to express  Romania's stance in the plenary session. Our position was very  much appreciated and we are waiting to see as soon as possible  the criteria that we have to match in order to integrate within  this organisation," said Ion Ratiu.    "We are supporters and active participants in the  Partnership  for Peace program with the clear intention to integrate within  the NATO structures. Our efforts must be sustained by an  internal evolution toward a stable and prosperous economy (...)  so that Romania is among the group of countries to be received  in NATO in the first five years," said Deputy Petre Roman.    "To the basic document called 'The NATO Enlargement' we have  contributed with some clarifications concerning Romania's  contribution during the war in the Gulf, its contribution to the  peace-keeping forces operating in Somalia, the price paid by  Romania because of the embargoes against Iraq and Yugoslavia and  the clear openness showed by Romania with respect to military  cooperation."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, March 31 (ATA) -- The Italian aid was not a  property of the Albanian state but of the Italian one, Perparim  Sanxhaku, the Nano's defence attorney said at yesterday's  session in Tirana.    Mr. Sanxhaku called "groundless" the charge on the defendant  Nano. Opposing the evidence presented at the court by the  prosecutors, Mr. Sanxhaku said the Levante Co. have been chosen  by the Italian side and not by Fatos Nano. Further on, Mr.  Sanxhaku read the main indications of contracts and invoices  related to the Italian aid. Attorney Sanxhaku said that the  partial knowledge with minutes of the investigation and the  short time at their disposal have not have made it impossible  for him to fully defence his client. At these circumstances,  Mr. Sanxhaku said "it is impossible for me to ask the innocence  or guiltiness for my client."    While Agim Tirana, the other Nano's attorney, tried to use  two testimonies made in the trial in favour of Defendant Nano.    The former premier Nano considering himself outside the  process by adopting the same stand toward the court, said the  charges against him have political motives. He said nothing  about the falsification of official documents and  misappropriation of the Italian aid for Albania.    The other three codefendants, Sokrat Plaka, former deputy  foreign minister, Robert Gjini, former secretary general at the  Ministry for Foreign Economic Trade and Relations, and Hasan  Hallko, former director of the Food Department at the ministry,  declared they were innocent and the procedure followed so far  has been unjust.    At the end, the court will hand down its final decision on  April 3, 1994.</p>

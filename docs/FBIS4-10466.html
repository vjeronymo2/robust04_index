			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Beatriz Garcia; from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] There will be no 1994 fiscal deficit in Mexico  despite the events in Chiapas and PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio's  assassination, said Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe Armella. He  has said the country's economic recovery began in November 1993.    [Begin Aspe recording] The agreement was ratified in  November. The economy had reached a deadlock in October, and we  already had a negative 3-percent drop in industrial production.  Ratification of the agreement took place in November, and  industrial production rose to 0 percent that month. Recovery  began in December, and figures for the industrial sector in  December show a 4.1-percent increase. The change was truly  dramatic. [end recording]    Secretary Aspe has said even though the events in Chiapas  and  Mr. Colosio's death were reflected in the financial market, a  progressive adjustment has occurred, and this has allowed us to  withstand the situation. He said all the country's sectors  reasserted their pledge with ratification of the pact for  stability, competitiveness, and employment to continue with a  gradual 3-percent economic recovery, a 7-percent inflation rate,  which is less than last year's inflation, and a zero fiscal  deficit.</p>

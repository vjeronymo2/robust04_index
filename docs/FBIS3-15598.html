Meanwhile the oblast prosecutor's office  has protested against the decrees because they do not accord  with the Russian Constitution and the president's edicts.    But the governor has rejected the prosecutor's office  protest  and has pretended not to notice the critical comments made by  communists, agrarians, and even "Democratic Russia" supporters  -- incidentally, to date the last-named group had supported  Podgornov. Since the regional elections complete the reform of  the authorities, they should calm the political situation. But  no -- the Vologda people have become even more worried.    "I am disturbed that the constitutional principle of the  separation of powers has been violated," Albert Volkov, senior  physician from the city of Sokol and candidate for the oblast  Duma, says. "Administration employees have been allowed to run  for the oblast Duma. I am afraid that our representative  authority will be swallowed up by the executive."    Volkov's fear is not without foundation. Eighteen officials  from the oblast and rayon administrations have been registered  as candidates for the 115 deputies' seats in the oblast Duma.  But experience of previous elections shows that authority  members have incomparably greater chances of winning electors'  votes than ordinary candidates.    But while the oblast Duma's future depends, if only to a  small extent, on Vologda inhabitants' choice, Podgornov has  unconditionally subordinated local self-government organs to the  executive branch. Under a statute approved by him, the dumas in  Vologda and Cherepovets will be run by the heads of these  cities' administrations, appointed by the governor. As for  rayon assemblies, they are generally being formed from leaders  of village and settlement administrations. Podgornov has  abolished representative authority in the ancient cities of  Totma, Belozersk, Velikiy Ustyug, Kirillov, and Ustyuzhna, where  it has existed for centuries.    The governor has called a referendum on the adoption of an  oblast charter at the same time as the elections on 20 March.  The draft of this fundamental law for the Vologda region has  been prepared by a narrow circle of people appointed by  Podgornov. Representatives of parties and movements were not  allowed to work on the project and, when the document was  finally published at the end of February, they saw that their  worst fears had come true.    "I personally cannot vote for this charter," Sergey Smirnov,  a leader of the Vologda branch of "Democratic Russia," says.  "Property must be under the control of two branches: The  representative branch disposes and the executive manages. But  under the draft charter the possession, use, disposal, and  management of all the oblast's property is effected by the  executive branch in the person of the governor. That is nothing  but dictatorship.    In the opinion of Russian presidential representative Guriy  Sudakov, the draft charter preserves the idea of separatism,  which the oblast Soviet tried to implement by proclaiming the  "Vologda Republic" in May 1993. All the oblast's natural  resources are proclaimed the exzclusive property of those who  live here, while there is not a word about Russia. And the  governor -- the effective owner of the Vologda region -- is  distanced from the federal authorities: Under the Vologda  charter he cannot be removed from his post even by the Russian  president.    The oblast has over 900,000 voters, yet the administration  printed the draft charter only in its newspaper KRASNYY SEVER,  whose print run is only 29,000 copies. So Vologda inhabitants  are familiar with the proposals it contains only through hearsay.    When RUSSKIY SEVER, another Vologda newspaper, ventured to  speak critically of the governor's actions, at a press  conference Podgornov called journalists a corrupt group of  people trying to discredit him on Moscow's orders and receiving  very large sums of money for doing so. The governor's monologue  was immediately shown by the "Vologda" television channel.  According to RUSSKIY SEVER journalists the governor is  determined to "remove" Chief Editor Vladimir Pantsyrev from the  newspaper and, if the editorial office opposes this, to evict it  from its building, which is oblast property.</p>

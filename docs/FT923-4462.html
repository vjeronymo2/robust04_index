			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / The Farnborough Air Show: Taiwan move threatens China deal FRENCH efforts to sell Mirage combat aircraft to Taiwan are holding back a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 750m) deal to sell European Airbus wide-body aircraft to China, Paul Betts writes. Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus chairman, said yesterday that he hoped to sign a firm deal with China for the sale of six A300-600 and six A330 jets by the end of this year. However, the deal was being delayed because of 'political problems between two governments'. Airbus, whose shareholders include British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France, Casa of Spain and Deutsche Aerospace has already signed two preliminary agreements to sell the 12 airliners but China has yet to make a firm commitment to buy the aircraft. China appears to have become increasingly irritated by efforts on the part of western aerospace companies to sell military hardware to Taiwan. Aerospace experts said that the US government's decision this year to supply Taiwan with F16 multi-role combat aircraft could also spark retaliation from China against sales of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas commercial jets. Mr Pierson said Airbus had clinched an order at the weekend for two A320 narrow-body twin-jet aircraft, worth about Dollars 100m, from Shorouk Air, a joint venture between Egypt Air and Kuwait. That brings total firm orders booked by Airbus so far this year to 79 airliners.</p>

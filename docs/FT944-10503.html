			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Book Review: Trapped in a protectionist world THE TRAP By James Goldsmith Macmillan, Pounds 7.99, 214 pages The world is seeing a new breed of pluto-populist. Men of vast wealth don the mantle of outsiders struggling no-bly on behalf of the little people. In the US, there is Ross Perot. In Italy, there is Silvio Berlusconi. Now there is the Anglo-French Sir James Goldsmith, recently elected to the European parliament on an anti-Maastricht and anti-Gatt platform. Sir James is not just a talented businessman who has accumulated a fortune. He sees himself as a philosopher. 'Global free trade, intensive agriculture and nuclear energy' are, along with the modern welfare state and Maastricht Europe, the main targets of his assault. This unholy trinity has 'profoundly destroyed our social stability'. They are also 'pure products of the enlightenment and as such are venerated by modern conventional wisdom', the latter synonymous, for Sir James, with error. The book takes the form of conversations with Yves Messarovitch, editor of the economics section of Le Figaro newspaper. Messarovitch asks bland questions. In return, Sir James pours forth a torrent of opinions. He is against the Gatt, intensive agriculture, nuclear power, the universal welfare state, the Maastricht treaty, the technocratic 'nomenklatura' that runs Europe, science 'separated from the ethical and the spiritual', and the enlightenment. He is in favour of 'families, communities, cultures and traditions'; regional free trade among countries that 'are reasonably similar in terms of development and wage structures', with 'mutually beneficial' bilateral agreements between them; a Europe of nations; a common (but not single) European currency; a social safety net; and participatory democracy. It is tempting to dismiss all this as the vapours of a self-publicising crank. That would be a mistake. These views matter: first, because they articulate a perfectly understandable dismay at the modern world; second, because a bit of what he says makes sense; third, because he also offers dangerous solutions that may attract an army of adherents; and, finally, because he has the means to ensure his ideas will not go away. Take his assault on free trade. Sir James argues that 'the damage (Gatt) will inflict on the communities of both the developed world and the third world will be intolerable'. For the former, the peril is mass unemployment as '4bn people enter the same world market for labour and offer their work at a fraction of the price paid to people in the developed world'. But, he argues, 'the application of Gatt will also cause a great tragedy in the third world'. Yet the main cause of unemployment in industrial countries is not trade with the developing ones. Such trade has merely added something - there is no agreement how much - to the pressures created by technology upon a rigid labour market. It is also untrue that labour costs are decisive in determining competitiveness. Differences in labour costs reflect differences in average productivity between countries. Nor are these differences surprising: investment per person in Germany, for example, is 25 times as large as in China, which is why Chinese labour is cheap. Protection, even of labour-intensive manufacturing, is a grotesquely inefficient means of promoting employment. What is too rarely understood - it is not by Sir James - is that a tax on imports also taxes exports. Import-competing industry would expand, but export industry would shrink. Even in import-competing industry, labour-replacing investment would continue and the tendency towards a steady decline in the jobs supplied by manufacturing would in no way abate. This depends on the growth in demand for manufactures, on the one hand, and productivity increases, on the other. Above all, if we are concerned about unemployment and the distribution of the gains from growth, the best and most politically honest policy is direct, rather than indirect, assistance to the workers. The combination of greatly improved education and training, generous employment subsidies and income transfers is both the best and the right policy. It is superior to protection, except politically. More surprising than arguments for protection in industrial countries is the view that free trade threatens the third world, too. 'It is the elites who are in favour of global free trade. It is they who will be enriched,' asserts Sir James. So the industrial countries can pull up the drawbridge against third world exports in the comfortable knowledge that it is, thereby, doing the poor good. Countries all over the former third world have become more liberal and more outward-looking in their trade policies. The obvious question is why. The answer is that they have tried the very policies recommended by Sir James, with disastrous results. The only path of development that has worked has been specialisation on the basis of comparative advantage, particularly when that advantage is in labour-intensive manufactures. The industrial world has not, as Sir James insists, imposed its model on a reluctant third world full of happy peasants. Nothing stops a country from closing itself off: China tried; Burma is still trying. The reason these attempts have failed is that the vast majority of men and women want the prosperity the west offers. In fact, they want a tiny fraction of what Sir James already has. Sir James alleges westerners believe 'any community which resists the absorption or destruction of its culture by the west is a threat to peace'. I, for one, do not. What is indeed a threat to peace is the view that the industrial countries are entitled to deprive billions of people around the world of the mutually beneficial trade that is their best hope for some prosperity.</p>

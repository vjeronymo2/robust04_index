			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: FG Wilson set for takeover by US group FG Wilson (Engineering), Europe's largest manufacturer of diesel generator sets, confirmed yesterday it had reached a preliminary agreement to be acquired by St Louis-based Emerson Electric. The privately owned Larne-based company, one of Northern Ireland's biggest private sector employers, would not disclose a price for the takeover. But it is believed that Emerson will pay between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m. The takeover, if it goes ahead, would be one of the biggest investments by a foreign company in Northern Ireland. It comes in the wake of the IRA's ceasefire announcement at the end of August, which has raised the confidence of overseas investors in the province. Mr Tom Wilson, managing director of FG Wilson, said talks were at a preliminary stage, but directors believed a partnership with Emerson would lead to considerable benefits for the company and its employees. FG Wilson already deals with several Emerson divisions in switchgear, electronic controls and generators. Mr Wilson said an alliance would enable the Ulster company to broaden its penetration of international markets through Emerson's worldwide distribution networks. Directors also believed the partnership would lead to expansion of FG Wilson's production facilities and to further job opportunities at its Larne site. The company employs about 1,000 people. FG Wilson had sales of Pounds 165m in the year to August. Profit figures were not available, but in 1992-93 it made about Pounds 18m. The company was formed in 1966, and exports some 80 to 90 per cent of its sales, mainly to continental Europe, Australasia and the Middle East. A link-up with Emerson could help sales in North and South America. Emerson makes a broad range of electrical and electronic products and had sales of Dollars 8.2bn (Pounds 5.2bn) last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The settlement of the Karabakh problems must be  based on the principle of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and  the inviolability of its borders, Azerbaijani President Gaydar  Aliyev told the permanent French representatives in the Minsk  Group.    He said that these two principles may lay a foundation for  talks on ending all combat operations.    Azerbaijan lays no claims on foreign territories, including  the territory of Armenia, he said. He also pointed out that  Azerbaijan was the victim of Armenian aggression.    Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov told the French  representatives that the status of Nagorno Karabakh might only  be discussed after the liberation of the occupied Azerbaijani  territories. This problem must become the subject of talks  between Karabakh's Azerbaijani and Armenian communities, said  Hasanov.</p>

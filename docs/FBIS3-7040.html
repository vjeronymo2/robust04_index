Genzu Watanabe, secretary of the Japan-South Korea Council  of  People's Solidarity, made a report and public figures speeches  at a meeting held in Tokyo on March 17.    They pointed out that the criminal purpose of the tour of  Japan by the traitor Kim Yong-sam is to strengthen the  Japanese-South Korean joint step against the DPRK, promote  political conspiracy regarding the past Japan's aggression on  Korea and colonial rule and build new relations between Japan  and South Korea.    They called upon the Japanese people to obtain a clear  understanding of the essence of Kim Yong-sam's tour of Japan,  strengthen solidarity with the South Korean people struggling  for independence, democracy and peaceful reunification and wage  a vigorous struggle in demand of a fundamental switchover of the  Japan government's policy towards Korea.</p>

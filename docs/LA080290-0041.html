			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL VOTES TO OPEN DOOR TO IMMIGRATION;  </P> <P> LEGISLATION: HOUSE MEMBERS SEEK TO INCREASE ANNUAL VISAS TO 775,000 FROM  540,000. THE ACTION IS INTENDED TO BENEFIT EUROPEANS AND AFRICANS.  </P> <P> Congress took a long stride Wednesday toward enacting major immigration changes  that would allow entry of at least 90,000 more foreigners each year and open  the door wider to Western Europeans, who have been all but shut out for a  decade.  </P> <P> The House Judiciary Committee voted, 23 to 12, for legislation that would  increase the overall number of annual visas issued to legal immigrants to  775,000 from the 540,000 in current law and the 630,000 proposed in a  Senate-passed measure.  </P> <P> It would be the first revision of legal immigration laws in 25 years and would  follow the enactment in 1986 of a statute aimed at stemming the influx of  illegal aliens.  </P> <P> While continuing a family reunification policy that has predominantly benefited  Latinos and Asians, the House bill places new emphasis on work skills and  establishes a new category for "diversity immigrants" to broaden the mix of  nationalities admitted to the country.  </P> <P> Both changes are intended to significantly increase immigration of Europeans  and Africans -- and, not incidentally, to expand political support for the  measure.  </P> <P> Other changes include a streamlining of applicant procedures for businesses  seeking to bring in workers with particularly needed skills. A key amendment  sponsored by Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) would prevent deportation  of spouses and minor children of people who were given legal status under the  amnesty provision of the 1986 law.  </P> <P> A bill passed by the Senate a year ago has a similar thrust but on a smaller  scale.  </P> <P> Congressional leaders expressed confidence that action can be completed this  year, despite an Administration veto threat over the proposed immigration  increases and other issues.  </P> <P> Democratic sponsors argue that "reasonable increases" of legal immigrants are  needed to reduce huge applicant backlogs, to balance out the numbers from  source countries and to provide the skilled workers needed to make the United  States more competitive in world trade.  </P> <P> "The business community is getting the things it wants. Labor unions are  satisfied. The family-based and diversity immigration groups are on board,"  said Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.), primary sponsor of the measure. "It is a  bill that has enough benefits and improvements for everybody."  </P> <P> Opponents, including both Republicans and Democrats, object that inflating  immigration levels would unduly burden social services, take away jobs from  American citizens and generally degrade the "quality of life" enjoyed by  American citizens.  </P> <P> On the House floor, critics will seek to have the proposed increases focus more  on employment skills and less on family-based considerations.  </P> <P> In committee debate, Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) said that while "most  immigrants have made solid citizens," there are "some limits to unbridled  generosity." Noting that schools and hospitals in his district are already  strained by immigrants, Moorhead said that "if you force them on us faster than  we can assimilate them, we will not be able to keep up our quality of life."  </P> <P> Berman rejoined that studies show legal immigrants quickly "produce jobs and  create money for the public treasury."  </P> <P> It is estimated that thousands of people would be affected by the Berman  amendment aimed at keeping together family members of newly legal immigrants.  The amendment would liberalize a "family fairness" policy announced by the  Immigration and Nationalization Service last year.  </P> <P> Under that policy, only spouses and minor children who entered the United  States before Nov. 11, 1986, are protected from deportation. Berman's proposal  moves the cutoff date to Jan. 1, 1990, responding to protests from Latino  groups that many family members who would eventually qualify for legal status  are being unfairly deported during the waiting period.  </P></p>

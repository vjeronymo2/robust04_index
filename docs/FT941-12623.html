			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Croat army bolsters fighters in Bosnia: UK suspends official aid convoys after driver is killed by gunmen Thousands of Croatian army troops, backed by tanks and helicopters, have been pouring into Bosnia to bolster the Bosnian Croat militia in its war against the Moslems in central Bosnia. The latest development in the nearly two-year-old Bosnian conflict, confirmed by highly-placed independent sources, could lead to a dangerous escalation of the fighting at a time when a peace deal appears as unattainable as ever. It could also lead to the imposition of international sanctions on Croatia such as those in effect against Serbia. The Croatian move coincides with the suspension by Britain of official aid convoys throughout former Yugoslavia after a British aid driver was shot dead and his two British companions were wounded in an attack in Zenica, central Bosnia. The three men, employed by the Overseas Development Administration, were hijacked in their vehicle by gunmen wearing military uniforms. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said he was 'shocked and distressed' by the attack. An announcement yesterday by the Bosnian government about the Croatian troop movements made public what has been an open secret in United Nations and European Union quarters in Bosnia for the past week. Calling on the UN Security Council to stop what it described as open military intervention by Zagreb in the Bosnian conflict, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Moslem Bosnian prime minister, said up to 12,000 regular Croatian army soldiers with tanks and helicopters had moved into Bosnia. Mr Silajdzic was speaking to reporters after his mainly Moslem cabinet called for an emergency session of the Security Council to condemn the Croatian military incursion. 'For about one week now, the intervention has become obvious, almost undisguised, and we fear escalation in the region of Prozor, Gornji Vakuf and Jablanica because of the presence and activity of these troops,' he said. Mr Silajdzic also claimed that Yugoslav special forces had entered eastern Bosnia to strengthen Bosnian Serb troops in what appeared to be a co-ordinated military campaign with Zagreb against the Moslems. Both the Bosnian Serbs and Croats have become concerned about recent military successes of the Bosnian Moslems in central Bosnia over the past few weeks and are worried about a possible Moslem spring offensive. Michael Littlejohns writes from the United Nations: After much agonising, the UN has authorised the use of air strikes in self-defence if necessary to ensure the rotation of 150 Canadian troops out of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, issued his authority in a letter to the Security Council, released last night. UK halts Bosnia aid, Page 2</p>

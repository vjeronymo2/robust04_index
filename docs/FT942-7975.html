			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Every which way but the right way: The UK government has yet to deliver a coherent transport policy An ambitious Pounds 2bn proposal to build the first east-west rail link across London comes to grief in a parliamentary committee of just four MPs. Despite the backing of not merely the government, but also the opposition Labour party and the capital's business interests, CrossRail is rejected because traffic projections have changed since it was planned in the late 1980s. CrossRail has, regardless of its merits, come to reflect a wider malaise in Britain's transport policy. Many experts, planners and transport operators, as well as the travelling public, agree that transport planning in the UK is failing to deliver the goods. Criticism has come from organisations as diverse as the Confederation of British Industry, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Council for the Preservation of Rural England. Many of the objections centre on the perception that the government favours the private car over public transport. High-profile public protests against a number of road schemes have spilled over into violence in some instances. More attention-grabbing demonstrations are expected against a bypass to the east of the picturesque Georgian city of Bath and against a motorway extension through an area of great natural beauty south of Blackburn. Meanwhile, congestion is stifling towns and cities while delaying commuters on their journey to work; cross-country motorways are clogged by traffic jams with increasing frequency, while rail services are in the throes of privatisation with a still uncertain outcome; London Underground suffers frequent breakdowns because of ageing equipment; the government has cut back on its Pounds 23bn 10-year roads programme and set more realistic priorities; and delays on a high-speed rail link between London and the Channel tunnel mean it will not be completed until at least eight years after the tunnel itself has opened for business. Yet across the Channel, French passengers enjoy inter-city trains travelling at speeds of nearly 190mph; German commuters travel on spanking new underground systems; and the Dutch get to work on a road network which provides extensively for the cyclist. Mounting public dissatisfaction over transport provision in the UK has pushed the issue to the top of the political agenda. Tory backbenchers have joined a revolt against a programme for building trunk roads and motorways. The main criticisms of the government's present transport policy are that: There is no long-term approach to planning transport infrastructure projects. As it takes several years to plan, prepare and construct a large transport link, a short-term outlook can make a nonsense of such a project. The reason is that traffic or passenger flows are subject to change during the planning and construction period. CrossRail provides a striking example of this. If traffic demand increases during the economic recovery there may once again be a need for a cross-London link and the whole planning process will have to start again. 'The British government machine, with its . . . year-by-year battles, is fundamentally ill-suited to dealing with the timescales intrinsic to transport decisions,' concluded the authors of Transport Policy-Making in Britain, a recent study by the London School of Economics. Parliament votes funds for one year; government departments are encouraged to think three years ahead; while the election timetable imposes a four- or five-year time frame on thinking. Contrast this with the long-term strategic planning, often backed by a guarantee of government funds, in many other European countries. Switzerland has embarked on a 12-year programme, Bahn 2000, to upgrade its rail network, while the Netherlands has a 15- to 20-year perspective for its Rail 21 project. There is little co-ordination of road building with public sector spending on rail or urban light railway systems in the UK. Transport projects are judged individually, largely by their contribution to reducing congestion in a specific area, says Steer Davies Gleave, transport consultants. Moreover, says Steer Davies Gleave, the way in which the UK assesses the merits of different forms of transport tends to favour the private car. The government offsets against the cost of a road construction project the money value of the time saved by users. But, in the case of public transport projects, it does not. German and French assessments do not reflect this bias. Tight control by the Treasury adds to the tendency to adopt short-term financial goals on transport projects. Each rail project requires separate Treasury approval, while schemes in the 10-year roads programme do not. The injection of more private sector finance was seen as a way round tough controls on public spending. But this, too, has run into the buffers of Treasury control. Private sector bids to modernise London Underground's Northern Line are due shortly, but problems have arisen over the degree of risk to be carried by the private sector. 'Government is discovering, says the LSE study, that 'you can either have control or majority private finance, but you cannot have both.' The government does not spend enough on the transport infrastructure. Last November of all transport expenditures the roads budget was most severely cut. Over the long term, however, it is public transport which has suffered most, critics say. John MacGregor, the transport secretary, points out that 40 per cent of his department's budget is spent on public transport although nearly 90 per cent of journeys are made by motor car. But overall spending on schemes involving all forms of transport is set to fall 13 per cent over the next three years to Pounds 5.4bn, according to transport department forecasts. The UK spends less on rail infrastructure than any other European country except Finland. Germany's superior commitment to rail, by contrast, is evidence in its plans to invest more in its rail network than in roads in the period up to 2010. What does the government say to such criticisms? It believes attempts to establish an integrated plan for transport would not succeed, 'We don't believe in a centralised system which tells people how to travel,' Mr MacGregor said recently. The government is, however, trying to create an overall framework which meets the needs of the economy. While it does so, it can draw to its critics' attention a shift in its own approach. This change is driven, in part, by a growing realisation of the environmental impact of an unrestrained increase in road traffic. Yet any shift is constrained by its calculation that even a 50 per cent increase in rail traffic would reduce the number of road journeys by only 5 per cent. The government is increasing fuel duties by at least 5 per cent a year to meet the Rio targets for CO emissions, implicated in global warming. There have also been potentially far-reaching changes in government planning guidelines, among them one in March calling on local authorities to limit the scale of out-of-town commercial developments and reduce reliance on the private car. Even more far-reaching are plans to introduce tolls on Britain's motorways. Indications are that, in the early stages, these will be set low, but they may still prompt a shift towards public transport. Government rhetoric on public transport is also changing. As yet, however, there is no commitment to extra funding. Without such a commitment, the travelling public and much of industry are unlikely to be satisfied. They await hard evidence of government determination to solve chronic transport problems and give coherence to planning, whose dislocation was so evident in the CrossRail debacle.</p>

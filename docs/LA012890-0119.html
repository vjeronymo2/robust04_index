			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A DAY IN THE LIFE  </P> <P> Producer Dean Hargrove spent much of last Sunday at his home in Brentwood  reading scripts -- so he faced Monday with that enthusiastic feeling of being  caught up. But it never lasts very long. He woke about 6:30 a.m. Monday to  confront his fitness trainer, Pete Steinfeld, who ran him through his sweats  for 35 minutes. Then off to the office through the thick morning traffic to  face a typical day. . . .  </P> <P>  9:20 a.m. Phoned David Shapira, Raymond's Burr agent, to discuss "Perry Mason"  overnight ratings of the previous night's show and possible writers for next  year.  </P> <P> Took a call from Julie Sommars, co-star on "Matlock," who told him about her  experiences at the Golden Globe Awards.

Put revised script into distribution for staff,  network, etc.  </P> <P> Called Bob Greenfield at Viacom business affairs to extend contracts with  "Dowling" staff for the two additional episodes ordered for this season by ABC.  </P> <P> Met with King at "Dowling" to rearrange air schedule.  </P> <P> 3:30-7:30 p.m. Met with Schlitt and Joyce Burditt, executive story consultant,  to discuss rewrite on "Dowling" episode. Re-outlined script and split up the  first three acts -- with each to rewrite an act.  </P> <P> During this meeting:  </P> <P> Spoke on phone to Dudley on "Perry Mason" "name" casting.  </P> <P> Three calls to Arata on a single casting on "Dowling."  </P> <P> "Loose Cannon" supervising producer Chris Hibler called from set to discuss  script rewrites.  </P> <P> Called Barry Steinberg, "Dowling" producer in Denver, on location for a stunt  in an upcoming episode.  </P> <P> Actor James McEachin called to clarify two script points and discuss wardrobe  regarding his guest role in "Dowling."  </P> <P> "Loose Cannon" producer David Solomon called to set up a screening of a  rough-cut, two-part episode.  </P> <P> Agent Dede Binder called to discuss using Nia rPeeples in "Perry Mason."  </P> <P> Called Moessinger on revising a "Fatman" story outline before Kimmer Ringwald,  the producer in Hawaii, starts the script.  </P> <P> Called NBC executive Brian Pike to set up lunch meeting with Steiger and  Burditt, also "Matlock" producer, to discuss plans for next season's "Matlock."  </P> <P> 7:30-8:30 p.m. Ran dailies for "Matlock," "Dowling" and "Loose Cannon."  </P> <P>  Hargrove then departed for home to eat supper and put his feet up. He ran "The  Detective," just released on videocassette, with Alec Guinness playing  priest-sleuth Father Brown. "I figure that since we traffic in this (as in the  "Father Dowling" intrigues), it would be useful to see," he said. Then to bed  at 11 p.m.  </P> <P> </P></p>

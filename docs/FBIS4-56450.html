			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by presidential candidate Jose Salvador Munoz of </F> the Doctrinaire Panamenist Party during the final presidential  "debate" sponsored by the Latin American Institute of Advanced  Study and the Media Presidential Debate Committee; place and  date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Fellow citizens: To every thing there is a season  and a time to every purpose under the heaven, Ecclesiastes 3:1.  During the past three months, we have, in one way or another,  witnessed or participated in the campaign to elect the new  president of the Republic of Panama. During this time, we have  seen and listened to, by virtue of multimillionaire political  campaigns on television and other kinds, prepared statements,  rehearsed poses and smiles, exaggerated promises, impossible  assurances, election-time music, and the squandering of money to  try to convince voters to favor one of the candidates.    This stage, however, has now passed. The time to vote has  come. In my long years as a lawyer, I have found that there is a  factor that is absolutely necessary to have a good, working  lawyer-client relation. That factor can be summed up in just  one word: trust. To have trust, we have to know the  professional. We must know his expertise, character, knowledge,  experience, and courage and we must be convinced that he is not  going to betray our interests. To govern a country, we need to  know the same things, not only of the presidential candidate but  also of those who accompany him on his ticket.    Julia Suira is the Doctrinaire Panamenist Party's second  vice  presidential candidate. Julia Suira is an exceptional woman.  She has dedicated 30 years of her life to the labor movement as  a union leader in the clothing industry. She knows the intimate  details of the Panamanian workers' toil, pain, sufferings,  anguishes, and problems. With her, the Panamanian working class  knows its interests will be protected, not betrayed, and that  exploitation and abuses will not be allowed.    Dr. Rodrigo Bernal is our candidate for the first vice  presidency. He is a medical doctor with 40 years of experience  in his field. His colleagues acknowledge that he is a pioneer  in his specialty and he has had a spectacular professional life.  His experience qualifies him to help us solve the health  problems we will confront beginning 1 September. Dr. Bernal is  a trusted man.    I am a man who has practiced law for 34 years. My clients  trust me. They trust me as all the people who have known me  since I was a child do. My campaign manager and I have been  friends for 43 years and I have never broken this trust. My  first vice president and his brothers and I have been friends  over 40 years and the trust has never been broken. All the  people who approach me know my friends and clients trust me and  that they will encounter generosity, affection, decency, and  everything a man who can be trusted can offer. No one can say  any of us has betrayed anyone. We give trust.    In past statements, I announced I would shakeup [revolcon]  everything that was wrong in this country. There were people  who laughed at this expression and others said it was an  unpolished one. Although I have explained this before, I want to  say that shakeup is a true Spanish word. According to the  Academy of the Spanish Language, in its first use it means to  roll over [darle la vuelta a uno] and in its second use to  defeat the enemy [vencer al adversario]. And this is what its  all about. We mean to shakeup and defeat everything that is  wrong in our country.    The hour has come to shakeup our educational system because  we have to improve our students' intellectual level and prepare  them for the forthcoming century. The hour has come to shakeup  public administration because it is necessary that we end  corruption to make this a decent country so it can develop and  be respected. The hour has come to shakeup the administration  of justice because our judicial system has to be efficient,  just, and expeditious. This will allow all our citizens to have  confidence that the cases presented to the judicial branch are  treated in accordance with the law. The hour has come to  shakeup and defeat unemployment because we have to end poverty  and underemployment in Panama. The hour has come to shakeup the  health system because all Panamanians have the right to receive  expeditious health services, not just when death is knocking at  the door. The hour has come to shakeup everything that runs  improperly in this country, in our Panama: garbage collection,  street repairs, traffic chaos, prostitution, crime, drug  trafficking, biased bidding processes, influence peddling,  nepotism, lack of courtesy, lack of water, the high cost of  electricity, in sum, all the things that need to be corrected to  improve the catastrophic situation in which we find ourselves.  The time for frivolities is over. There are six days to go  before 8 May. We invite the Panamanians to start this shakeup  on 8 May. Thank you.</p>

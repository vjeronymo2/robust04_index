			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Exports rise for small companies JUST OVER half of Britain's smaller exporters increased overseas sales in the 12 months to July, while a further 18 per cent maintained volumes. This is one of the main findings of a quarterly survey of smaller exporters published yesterday by the Small Business Research Trust for the Royal Bank of Scotland. Most exporters managed to maintain profit margins on export sales in spite of increased competition and the government's commitment to keeping the pound within its fluctuation range in the European exchange rate mechanism. In recent months exporters have become slightly more optimistic about overseas markets, the survey noted. There was some evidence that many small companies had successfully switched from the UK market to export markets with the expectation of improving their performance. Small businesses employing 15 or more people were more successful in increasing exports than companies employing fewer than 15. The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and the Middle East were regarded as the most favourable overseas markets but prospects in North America had deteriorated. The main competition for smaller British exporters came not from other UK exporters nor from local businesses in the export markets but from larger companies in third countries. Many new companies, particularly those based in Asia, had entered export markets. One of the biggest problems facing smaller exporters was the widespread copying by larger companies of products and techniques pioneered by small companies. The most common response to increased competition was for the British exporter to cut prices (58 per cent) followed by improving the product or service (53 per cent), switching to a new market (48 per cent) and introducing new products or services (40 per cent).

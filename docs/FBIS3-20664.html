In the last several years, Jiangsu  has experienced a growing gap in electric power supply and  demand which has severely impacted industrial and agricultural  output as well as the standard of living. As a result, the  province has placed a priority on power development, beefing up  the construction of the power infrastructure. In 1993, 2.38  billion yuan were invested in the province's power sector. Of  this amount, 749 million yuan came from the State, 1.19 billion  came from the province, 376 million yuan came from Huaneng and  other energy resources investment companies, and 65 million yuan  from foreign investors.</p>

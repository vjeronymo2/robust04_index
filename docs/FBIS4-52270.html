			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry said  Monday it has instructed the South Korean Embassy in Beijing to  make a thorough inquiry into the slaying of a South Korean  businessman in China that was reported in the local media over  the weekend.    Ministry officials said they had ordered the embassy in  China  to obtain information on the incident in which So in-sok, 53, a  resident of Cheju Island, was reportedly killed by ethnic  Koreans in Changchun city, Jilin Province, which he was visiting  on business.    A local daily has quoted So's relatives as claiming that So  was stabbed to death by second-generation Koreans living in  Changchun who tricked him into coming to Changchun and robbed  him of 10,000 U.S. dollars before stabbing him to death. So had  been running a trading company in Harbin city, Heilongjiang  Province, since May last year when he was invited to Harbin by  his two brothers who run a Korean restaurant there.    Ministry officials said So's kin had requested that it  intervene in the case, stressing they plan to act after learning  all relevant details.    However, they said, "We do not think the incident resulted  from any structural problem in bilateral relations."    Emphasizing that the incident may have been accidental, the  Ministry officials hoped the case would serve as a warning for  those wishing to travel to China.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (9): Judicious watchdog - Hans-Georg Zierlein of the constitutional court FOR the past few months Mr Hans-Georg Zierlein, director of the German constitutional court in Karlsruhe, has been watching with some horror the events unfolding in Moscow. It was not so much the collapse of the Russian economy, or the political confusion, or even the sight of tanks firing rockets at the Russian parliament, which shocked him. It was the extraordinary political behaviour of the Russian constitutional court. Mr Zierlein is director of the German federal constitutional court in Karlsruhe, spokesman for the court, head of protocol and chief of security, just to name a few of his functions. He is not a judge, although he is qualified to be one, and has written learned papers on the functions of the court. Indeed, if he were a judge, he would have been long gone from the job: they must leave after a maximum 12 years. Mr Zierlein has been in charge of the court's administration for 20 years, and in Karlsruhe for 23. And he remains irrepressibly enthusiastic. 'You must not think that we are remotely like that constitutional court in Moscow. The president of the court there appears to be totally political,' he says. 'We have never been anywhere near that. Very occasionally, this court is accused of stepping across the borderline between the law and politics. Perhaps it is inevitable. But we are talking about the 499th case out of 500. 'It is recognised everywhere, inside Germany and abroad, that this court is an independent court. Our independence has played an important role in the stability and credibility of the German Federal Republic.' If Karlsruhe features in the headlines of the German press, then the chances are that the cause is the federal constitutional court. Alongside the staunchly independent German Bundesbank, it is the institution which has done most to give German citizens a belief in the resilience of their post-war democracy, and the revival of a law-based state after the Nazi era. 'People trying to transform their countries from dictatorship to democracy look to our case as an example,' Mr Zierlein says proudly. The court is modestly tucked away in a grey marble-faced modern block in the palace gardens, self-effacing like so many of the federal republic's post-war institutions. Nonetheless, the court is being forced to play an ever greater role in German life, with a steady increase in the flow of complaints and appeals and constitutional quarrels being passed on to its judges by the political institutions of the state. For a supreme court, it has the unusual distinction of being a single entity, but it is divided into two chambers, or senates, each consisting of eight red-robed judges. 'In 1951, when the court was founded, there were 800 cases in one senate, and none in the other,' says Mr Zierlein. 'So they had to change the division of powers, to balance the workload.' The number of approaches to the court now totals more than 4,000 a year. This year, the second senate alone has had to deal with reform of the abortion law, challenges to the Maastricht treaty, the dispute on where and when German troops can serve outside the Nato area, and the complaint by former East German spies that they cannot be tried under West German law for their offences. The system is certainly creaking under the strain. But Mr Zierlein is not complaining. The court must remain scrupulously non-political, and seek to interfere in the political process as little as possible, he says - on the lines of the US Supreme Court concept of judicial self-restraint. The very fact that it is being used so much shows that it works.</p>

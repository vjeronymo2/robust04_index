			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / US poised to boost formal Taiwan ties The US is poised to boost formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan after its first policy review of bilateral ties in 15 years, amid congressional calls to rescind a ban on high-level exchanges between the two countries. The move would be the first official recognition from Taiwan's biggest longstanding ally of its transformation from a military dictatorship to a democratic state. The US has funnelled billions of dollars in aid to Taiwan since the ruling Nationalist government lost China's civil war in 1949. Observers said changes were likely to be subtle but would enhance the international profile of Taiwan, which is struggling to counter incessant diplomatic bullying by China, and pushing to join the United Nations. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, told the Senate foreign relations committee on Friday that improvements in ties would be made in line with a 'broad and deep review' of Taiwan policy by the Clinton administration to be published soon.</p>

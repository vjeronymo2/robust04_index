			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / ASB seeks cashflow suggestions The Accounting Standards Board yesterday called for suggestions on the revision of FRS 1, the accounting standard dealing with the cashflow statement. It wants comments on the details and the type of information the statement should contain. The standard was issued in September 1991 as part of the machinery of financial reporting created as a result of the 1989 Companies Act. It came into force for companies with financial year ends after March 23 1992. FRS 1 replaced SSAP 10, the standard which described the format of the complex source and application of funds statement. The new standard has since been criticised by accountants and analysts for a series of ambiguities and inadequacies. Among the issues it highlights for public comment are the definition of cash and cash equivalents and the treatment of short-term investments, the format of the statement and whether items should be shown net or gross. Comments should be received by June 30.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Two Irish state groups face financial crunch Financial crises in two loss-making Irish state enterprises came to a head yesterday. All 560 employees in Cork-based Irish Steel were laid off and the remaining 1,100 employees in Team Aer Lingus in Dublin, the aircraft maintenance subsidiary of the state airline, Aer Lingus, were warned that the company could close 'within days' if unions do not accept an ultimatum on cost-savings. Both companies are losing an estimated IPounds 1m (Pounds 989,000) a month, but efforts to find a compromise between managements and unions in recent weeks have failed. Talks at the weekend broke down. The government has taken a hard line with the unions, although the growing prospect of closure of both companies and the impact on unemployment figures in Dublin and Cork is causing growing nervousness on the backbenches of the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition. Four backbench Labour MPs voted against the government last week over the Team Aer Lingus dispute, in the first sign of serious strains within the coalition since it came to office 18 months ago. Some 850 employees at Team Aer Lingus have already been laid off, and the parent company yesterday announced it will no longer support its loss-making subsidiary. An Aer Lingus spokesman said that the remainder of Team's workforce would have to be laid off next week. 'We appear to be at the end of the road,' he said. Redundancy payments for the 2,000 Team employees could cause renewed financial problems for the Aer Lingus parent. Mr Pat Dineen, chairman of Irish Steel, said yesterday his company was now insolvent and was calling in a liquidator. Its Cobh plant produces around 300,000 tonnes of steel per annum, more than 90 per cent of it exported. A company spokesman said that up to 200 voluntary redundancies were being sought to lift productivity to around 1,000 tons of steel per man-year. Union negotiators at both companies have argued that management survival proposals will not guarantee their financial viability. The Team Aer Lingus workforce is insisting on having its own union survival plan for the company on the table, while the management - backed by the government - is insisting that a pay freeze and revised working conditions be accepted before further negotiations can take place. The deadlock is such that closure of both companies now appears increasingly likely. The Labour party, which campaigned in the 1992 general elections in support of the country's state enterprises, is likely to suffer the most from the political fall-out.</p>

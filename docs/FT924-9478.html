			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Rawlings heads for victory GHANA'S military leader, Flight-Lt Jerry Rawlings, was winning a majority in returns yesterday from the country's first presidential elections in 13 years, AP reports from Accra. The returns showed the 46-year-old former fighter pilot with 53 per cent, enough to avoid a run-off in three weeks with his leading challenger, Prof Albert Adu Boahen. Reuter adds from Accra: Local authorities have declared an overnight curfew in the central town of Kumasi after opposition supporters rioted in protest against election results.</p>

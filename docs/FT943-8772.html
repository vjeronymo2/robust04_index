			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Carlos 'the Jackal' flown to Paris after Sudan arrest Carlos 'the Jackal', the notorious terrorist and guerrilla, is being held in Paris after being captured in Sudan. Carlos, pictured above in Sudan before his arrest, is linked to many of the world's bloodiest terrorist attacks over the past two decades, including the 1972 massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics, the 1974 takeover of the French embassy in the Hague, and the 1976 hijacking to Entebbe, Uganda, of an Air France airliner. He has eluded the authorities by moving from country to country, notably Syria, Libya and Hungary, where he was given refuge by the former communist regime in the late 1970s. However, since the mid-1980s, with the collapse of communism and the improvement of relations in the Middle East, Carlos has found refuge more difficult, French officials said. Report, Page 16</p>

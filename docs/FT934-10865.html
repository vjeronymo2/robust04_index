			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Asbestosis claims charge pushes Cigna into the red A Dollars 244m after-tax charge to cover asbestosis and environmental claims pushed Cigna, the US insurer, into the red during the third quarter of the year. The company also took a Dollars 107m charge to cover 1,400 redundancies in its health and property/casualty businesses, which have already been reported, as well as a further 800-1,000 job losses expected in the next 18 months. The latest charges led Cigna, one of the leaders in the US health and life insurance businesses, to post a net loss of Dollars 94m, or Dollars 1.31 a share, for the period, compared with a net profit of Dollars 50m, or 70 cents, a year ago. The scale of the loss was reduced by a Dollars 48m benefit from the change in the US corporate tax rate. The results a year before had been struck after one-off items which led to a net benefit of Dollars 42m. Operating results during the period in health, pension and life businesses had been strong, said Mr Wilson Taylor, chief executive.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Arts: Noriko Kawai - Piano Recital In its first incarnation in the early 1980s the signal achievement of MusICA, and of its organiser Adrian Jack, was to identify and spotlight a whole collection of young composers whose work fell well outside the mainstream of contemporary music. Stylistically they belonged to a very broad church indeed, though Mauricio Kagel had been a vital influence in the artistic nurturing of a good many of them. The most striking talent, then as now, was that of Gerald Barry; MusICA introduced several of his early works and commissioned Barry's first opera The Intelligence Park, which eventually received its premiere at the Almeida in 1990. Noriko Kawai's recital in the New MusICA series on Sunday gave over its first half to Barry's piano music. It was a timely reminder of what an original and teasing musical thinker he is, and how his abstract brand of post-modernism can take the simplest material and fashion from it the most exhilarating and disconcerting discourse. Au milieu (1981) is like a Clementi study run wild: scales that tumble over themselves, replicate, accumulate and eventually colonise the whole keyboard. Swinging tripes and trillibubkins (1986) is a delicate little study in the highest register, hardly coming into focus before it is all over, while Sur les pointes (1981) is one of the finest piano pieces of recent times, exploding out of a sequence of tight metronomic chords into high flights of figuration and unexpected nuggets of luminous melody. Barry expects his pianists to have steely fingers and lightning reflexes, as well as an infallible ear for keyboard colour. Noriko Kawai's performances had evidently been scrupulously prepared; her attention to detail and voicing was exemplary. The second half of her programme was more conventionally demanding. Three of Adrian Jack's own pieces - Tin-Pan Tango, with its neat synthesis of dance rhythms and cheaply scented harmony, Foray on the Liffey and the tricksy Beginner's Fingers - as well as two items from Dave Smith's Third Piano Concert showed her ability for lively characterisation and bravura display. In both Guaracha and Toccantella Smith's writing has all the glamorous rhetoric of a Liszt paraphrase; it needs exactly that kind of larger-than-life projection. HK Gruber's Luftschlosser cast the only shadow over this attractively planned programme. It is a sequence of four pieces composed in 1981, continuing in the tradition of the German piano cycle, but proves to be no latter-day Kreisleriana: the material is unmemorable, the keyboard writing dogged. If it recalls any composer at all it would be Hindemith at his most didactic and utilitarian; a strange miscalculation for a composer of such regular wit and piquancy.

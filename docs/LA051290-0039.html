			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: REPRISE OF '88 PLAYOFF COULD BE ILLUMINATING  </P> <P> If the Edmonton Oilers play the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup finals, it  will be a rematch of the 1988 finals, which were swept by the Oilers.  </P> <P> The teams actually played five games, but the fourth game was canceled because  of a power failure at Boston Garden with the score 3-3 at 16:37 of the second  period.  </P> <P> NHL President John Ziegler announced afterward that the game would be replayed  two nights later at Edmonton.  </P> <P> That prompted Wayne Gretzky to say of the rescheduled game: "The Americans will  call it 4-A. We'll call it '4, eh?' "  </P> <P> Add hockey: The original Game 4 in 1988 also was unusual in that it was played  in a fog that resulted from high temperatures in the Garden. Several times,  play was delayed as the players skated in circles in an attempt to dissipate  the moisture.  </P> <P> Said Jari Kurri of the Oilers, a native of Helsinki: "There's a rink in Finland  that's comparable to this one. They don't play there anymore."  </P> <P> Trivia time: What two major league pitchers won at least eight games in every  season during the 1980s?  </P> <P> Wait a minute: Said former West Virginia quarterback Major Harris, drafted in  the 12th round by the Raiders: "Others drafted higher came out of the woodwork  and they didn't prove themselves."  </P> <P> Among the quarterbacks drafted ahead of Harris was Andre Ware of Houston, who  passed for 4,699 yards last season, set 25 other NCAA records and won the  Heisman Trophy.  </P> <P> Speed the plow: Harris, who is leaning toward playing for the British Columbia  Lions of the Canadian Football League, was asked if he felt as if he were being  farmed out. "They play on a field," he said, "so I guess it's kind of like a  farm."  </P> <P> Bottom line: General Manager Dick Steinberg of the New York Jets, asked by  Sports Illustrated about Harris and former Notre Dame quarterback Tony Rice,  who was not drafted: "What you had was 28 scouts who all saw the same thing --  that these are two quarterbacks who do not have NFL passing ability or the  skills to develop into NFL quarterbacks."  </P> <P> Twenty years ago: On May 12, 1970, Ernie Banks of the Chicago Cubs hit his  500th home run.  </P> <P> Home sweet home: Stuart Gray, traded this season by the Charlotte Hornets to  the New York Knicks, said of Los Angeles in the Hornets' in-house magazine,  Tipoff: "The whole attitude about life out there is really cold and callous.  </P> <P> "It's an I-got-mine and you-get-yours attitude. The general perception out  there is not to help your fellow man."  </P> <P> Gray, who undoubtedly will find friendlier folk in New York, played at Kennedy  High in Granada Hills and at UCLA.  </P> <P> For the record: Willie Mays will be 60 next May 6.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Nolan Ryan and Danny Darwin.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Billie Jean King, on 14-year-old Jennifer Capriati: "Jennifer's got  the best ground strokes I've ever seen."  </P></p>

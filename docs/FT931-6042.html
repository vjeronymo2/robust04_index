			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Abbey National falls 9% to Pounds 564m ABBEY National, the banking group, yesterday disclosed a 9 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 564m for 1992, compared with Pounds 618m in the previous year. Provisions for bad and doubtful loans more than doubled to Pounds 322m from Pounds 155m. The company, which complied with the financial reporting standard FRS 3, declared an exceptional loss of Pounds 138m for its estate agency business and an exceptional profit of Pounds 101m on the sale of 29m shares unclaimed from its 1989 flotation. Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman, announced that its estate agency chain was being offered for sale following a Pounds 126m write-down of goodwill taken through the profit and loss account, and a further Pounds 12m restructuring charge. Sir Christopher said there were grounds for 'cautious optimism' for this year because the low point in the housing cycle appeared to have passed. Pent-up demand in the market would combine with increased life insurance sales. Abbey's treasury operations reported a 61 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 100m. Its treasury assets rose 49 per cent to Pounds 23.8bn because of rises in sterling and dollar portfolios, and its finance leasing book. The company announced a provision of Pounds 47m (up from Pounds 12m) for its lending in continental Europe. European operations including operations in France and Spain incurred a total loss of Pounds 50m (up from Pounds 1m) and business in both countries have been restructured. Pre-tax profits in UK retail operations fell 8 per cent to Pounds 540m. The fall in base rates in the last quarter helped it to widen the margin between lending and funding rates from 1.91 per cent to 2.28 per cent. Provisions for UK retail operations rose to Pounds 275m from Pounds 142m. Abbey's post-tax earnings fell 23 per cent to Pounds 317m, producing earnings per share of 24.2p (against 31.6p). The 'abnormally high' effective tax rate of 44 per cent (against 33 per cent) was partly caused by its goodwill write-down. The company proposed a final dividend of 7.7p, giving a 9.5 increase in the total dividend from 10.5p to 11.5p, which was covered 2.1 times. Shares closed down 12p at 385p.

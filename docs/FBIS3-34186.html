			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on address by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to a </F> bankers' forum in Tel Aviv and an interview with political  correspondent Shlomo Raz in Tel Aviv on 4 February]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Over the past several days,  the prime minister has been saying that there is no hurry.  Speaking today before a bankers' forum in Tel Aviv, he said  that time is not of the essence, reiterating the famous phrase:  There are no sacred dates. Israel is committed to the political  process, hence, the date is less important. Last week he also  introduced another element that has to be concluded before the  agreement is signed -- the economic talks to be held in Paris.  There is a wide range of issues still to be discussed, which  will take a long time. Thus, there is no reason to assume that  the negotiations or the implementation will end by 13 April.    The prime minister told leading Israeli bankers today that  anything that is not finalized might turn into a detonator for  future mishaps. This is an agreement between two entities  which, to say the least, do not love each other and are  constantly in friction. Therefore, the current agreement on  Gaza and Jericho, as well as the agreement on the autonomy,  serve as a test case for the possibility of making progress  toward the permanent agreement. For that test case to succeed,  the appropriate conditions must be prepared and  misunderstandings should be avoided.    I would like to call attention to another remark by the  prime  minister regarding the events in the former USSR. National  forums are thinking about this and holding consultations on this  matter. Israel is definitely following and is worried by the  events in the CIS. After his meeting with the bankers, Rabin  spoke to the media. We will begin with the negotiations in Cairo  next week and the routine consultations that are currently being  held.    [Begin recording] [Rabin] I will not go into detail here.  When Peres meets 'Arafat in Cairo on 7 February, the goal will  be to wrap up the issues on which great progress was made in  Davos. I speak of wordings that must ensure clarity on the  issues of security -- including the border crossings and the  size of the Jericho area -- in order to really attain  agreed-upon, clear, and understood results. After this, we will  also have to advance on economic and administrative issues, and  arrange the Palestinian administration. Also, we have not yet  held an in-depth discussion on the structure and size of the  Palestinian police. Many issues are still pending. At the same  time, as far as the security issues are concerned, the heart of  the matter was dealt with in Davos, and I hope it will be  completed in Cairo.    [Raz] Are there differences in nuances between the Foreign  Ministry and the defense establishment?    [Rabin] Come off it. In the discussions there are different  officials from the Foreign Ministry and the defense  establishment. They have different views. In general, we are  speaking of matters that are not of prime importance, rather  about the a practical implementation of the issues in the  everyday life. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

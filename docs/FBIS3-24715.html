			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There was a meeting this afternoon at the Aflao  border post between Togolese and Ghanaian officers. The  Togolese delegation was led by Colonel Sei Memene, director of  national security, while the Ghanaian side was led by Colonel  Jasper Ahadzi, President Rawlings's special adviser for security  affairs. Johnny Kojo Maxwell, Ghanaian charge d'affaires in  Togo, also attended the meeting. It was the second time that  the two delegations have met. The first meeting took place on 10  January a few hours after the terrorist aggression against Lome.    Nothing filtered out of the meeting, which lasted 30  minutes.  Nevertheless, it is quite probable that the two parties are  trying to ease the tension between the two countries. Relations  between Ghana and Togo have seriously deteriorated since 5  January when there was a commando attack on the Interarms  Regiment camp where the Togolese head of state has his  residence. Togo accused its western neighbor of serving as a  base for the attackers.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / BT halves cost of electronic checks on cards British Telecom has reached a deal with banks and credit card companies to halve the cost of electronic fraud checks on card purchases. BT was warned that it might otherwise lose business to Mercury or US telecommunications companies. BT has agreed a new pricing structure with credit and debit card companies for 'on-line' verification of transactions that cuts prices in return for higher volumes. It might save banks a total of about Pounds 25m annually within three years. Mr Peter Macleod, BT's sales director, said yesterday that BT believed it could reach similar deals, discounting price in return for higher volume, in other corporate markets. He said BT had responded rationally to competitive pressures. Banks will be charged less per call the more on-line checks they make. Seven banks process transactions, and they were represented in talks, as were the Visa, Switch, Diners Club, American Express and Mastercard groups. BT could not disclose the new prices because individual contracts were being discussed. Banks said the cost per call would fall to between 2.5p and 3.5p next year, and to between 1.9p and 2.9p by 1996. BT has established a new network called 0800 Cardway Dial to handle the calls. Mr Macleod said: 'I think we have stolen a march on AT&amp;T (the US telephone company) and Mercury. No doubt they will respond in due course.' Mr Mervyn Gibson, Visa's director of interbank processing, said banks had co-operated because of the growth in card fraud. 'That galvanised them. If it had not been for fraud, they would have just haggled by themselves,' he said. About 200m checks are expected to be carried out this year, about a fifth of card transactions. Banks think the share of transactions checked may rise to 45 per cent by 1996, giving an annual volume of 1bn calls. Banks have blamed the high costs of calls for the fact that relatively few purchases have been checked until now. Some 90 per cent of card transactions are authorised in the US, and all Visa purchases there will be checked from next May. BT announced Pounds 125m price cuts aimed mainly at residential users this month. It faces competition for domestic corporate services from Mercury, and AT&amp;T is also seeking a licence to compete in the UK. Banks have become worried about the rapid growth of fraud in recent years. Fraud cost the industry about Pounds 165m last year, but the figure is expected to fall at least 10 per cent this year because of added security.</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> DIAL-A-RIDE PROPOSAL FUELS PETITION DRIVE  </P> <P> Upset that the county plans to cut back dial-a-ride service for everyone except  the elderly or handicapped and organized groups, a Costa Mesa woman has begun  circulating a petition to prevent the cutbacks.  </P> <P> "Many low-income families use it to take kids for doctor care, mental health  services, speech therapy and other appointments," Jeanne Thorpe said. "Try  walking three children, a stroller and a diaper bag to the bus stop in the  rain."  </P> <P> The board of the Orange County Transit District tentatively voted Monday to  limit the door-to-door service in a one-year pilot program. Board Chairman  Roger Stanton said the plan will allow OCTD to improve dial-a-ride for those  who really need it rather than those who use it as a convenience.  </P> <P> But Nellie Kaniski, coordinator of a support program for single mothers who  attend Rancho Santiago College and receive government aid, said that some  students use dial-a-ride because they can't afford cars and don't feel safe  waiting for a bus.  </P> <P> Irene Armstrong, a Fullerton School District board member who also opposes the  OCTD plan, said she thinks it is unfair to shut out the occasional user who  takes dial-a-ride when a car is unavailable and a bus is inconvenient.  </P> <P> Dennis Cain, a spokesman for the Orange County chapter of the National  Federation of the Blind, said members don't want to be treated differently.  </P> <P> "In the days when the county should be thinking about improving public transit  service and getting people out of their cars, they're thinking about cutting  back dial-a-ride," Cain said.  </P> <P> Although dial-a-ride's hours of operation wouldn't be cut, the number of people  served would be. A transit district spokeswoman estimated that only about half  of those using dial-a-ride are elderly or handicapped. Most don't have cars and  about half have incomes of $20,000 or less, she said.  </P> <P> Stanton said he has heard mostly praise for the plan, which would retain  Saturday service and service for groups that contract regularly with  dial-a-ride, such as Headstart.  </P> <P> "We had one complaint from a woman who said that she takes dial-a-ride to go to  Wild Rivers and didn't want to walk to the gate from the regular bus route,"  Stanton said. "I mean, come on, I don't think the general public has sympathy  for devoting this system to people who have choices."  </P> <P> But board member William Farris, who voted against the plan along with Richard  B. Edgar, said he wants to increase the service hours and keep dial-a-ride open  for anyone who wants to use it.  </P> <P> Thorpe said she hopes to gather thousands of signatures by the time the plan  returns to the board with final details next month.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.17(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature, or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Novel or Unusual Design Feature <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Dassault Aviation Falcon 2000 will incorporate an unusual design feature in that it will be certified to operate up to an altitude of 47,000 feet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA considers certification of transport category airplanes for operation at altitudes greater than 41,000 feet to be a novel or unusual feature because current part 25 does not contain standards to ensure the same level of safety as that provided during operation at lower altitudes. Special conditions have therefore been adopted to provide adequate standards for transport category airplanes previously approved for operation at these high altitudes, including certain Learjet models, the Boeing Model 747, Dassault-Breguet Falcon 900, Canadair Model 600, Cessna Model 650, Israel Aircraft Industries Model 1125, and Cessna Model 560. The special conditions for the Learjet Model 45 are considered the most applicable to the Falcon 2000 and its proposed operation and are therefore used as the basis for the special conditions described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Damage tolerance methods are proposed to be used to ensure pressure vessel integrity while operating at the higher altitudes, in lieu of the 1/2-bay crack criterion used in some previous special conditions. Crack growth data are used to prescribe an inspection program that should detect cracks before an opening in the pressure vessel would allow rapid depressurization. Initial crack sizes for detection are determined under &sect;25.571, as amended by Amendment 25&hyph;72. The maximum extent of failure and pressure vessel opening determined from the above analysis must be demonstrated to comply with the pressurization section of the proposed special conditions, which state that the cabin altitude after failure must not exceed the cabin altitude/time curve limits shown in Figures 3 and 4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to ensure that there is adequate fresh air for crewmembers to perform their duties, to provide reasonable passenger comfort, and to enable occupants to better withstand the effects of decompression at high altitudes, the ventilation system must be designed to provide 10 cubic feet of fresh air per minute per person during normal operations. Therefore, these special conditions require that crewmembers and passengers be provided with 10 cubic feet of fresh air per minute per person. In addition, during the development of the supersonic transport special conditions, it was noted that certain pressurization failures resulted in hot ram or bleed air being used to maintain pressurization. Such a measure can lead to cabin temperatures that exceed human tolerance. Therefore, these special conditions require airplane interior temperature limits following probable and improbable failures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continuous flow passenger oxygen equipment is certificated for use up to 40,000 feet; however, for rapid decompressions above 34,000 feet, reverse diffusion leads to low oxygen partial pressures in the lungs, to the extent that a small percentage of passengers may lose useful consciousness at 35,000 feet. The percentage increases to an estimated 60 percent at 40,000 feet, even with the use of the continuous flow system. Therefore, to prevent permanent physiological damage, the cabin altitude must not exceed 25,000 feet for more than 2 minutes, or 40,000 feet for any time period. The maximum peak cabin altitude of 40,000 feet is consistent with the standards established for previous certification programs. In addition, at high altitudes the other aspects of decompression sickness have a significant, detrimental effect on pilot performance (for example, a pilot can be incapacitated by internal expanding gases). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decompression resulting in cabin altitudes above the 37,000-foot limit depicted in Figure 4 approaches the physiological limits of the average person; therefore, every effort must be made to provide the pilots with adequate oxygen equipment to withstand these severe decompressions. Reducing the time interval between pressurization failure and the time the pilots receive oxygen will provide a safety margin against being incapacitated and can be accomplished by the use of mask-mounted regulators. These special conditions therefore require pressure demand masks with mask-mounted regulators for the flightcrew. This combination of equipment will provide the best practical protection for the failures covered by the special conditions and for improbable failures not covered by the special conditions, provided the cabin altitude is limited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, these special conditions are applicable to the Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000. Should Dassault Aviation apply at a later date for a change to the type certificate to include another model incorporating the same novel or unusual design feature, these special conditions would apply to that model as well under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action affects only certain design features on the Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000 airplane. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The substance of the special conditions for this airplane has been subjected to the notice and comment procedure in several prior instances and has been derived without substantive change from those previously issued. It is unlikely that prior public comment would result in a significant change from the substance contained herein. For this reason, and because a delay would significantly affect the certification of the airplane, which is imminent, the FAA has determined that prior public notice and comment are unnecessary and impracticable, and good cause exists for adopting these special conditions immediately. Therefore, these special conditions are being made effective upon issuance. The FAA is requesting comments to allow interested persons to submit views that may not have been submitted in response to the prior opportunities for comment described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 25 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Aircraft, Aviation safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority citation for these special conditions is as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 49 U.S.C. app. 1344, 1348(c), 1352, 1354(a), 1355, 1421 through 1341, 1502, 1651(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 1857f&hyph;10, 4321 et seq.; E.O. 11514; and 49 U.S.C. 106(g). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Special Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the following special conditions are issued as part of the type certification basis for the Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Operation to 47,000 Feet <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pressure Vessel Integrity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The maximum extent of failure and pressure vessel opening that can be demonstrated to comply with paragraph 4 (Pressurization) of this special condition must be determined.

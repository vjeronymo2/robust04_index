			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Hanson nearer continental buys HANSON, the acquisitive conglomerate, yesterday said it was more likely to buy into continental Europe now that the rules governing hostile bids were clearer. At an analysts meeting in Paris, Mr Peter Harper, chairman of Hanson's UK industrial division, said: 'We want to move into continental Europe. The opportunity for such a move we have not yet discovered.' He said Hanson had always been held back from buying a European company by the thought it could be thwarted by hidden laws, but now the European Commission has the power to rule on cross-border EC buys. 'We applaud that power,' he said. The shares yesterday rose 8 1/2 p to close at 212 1/2 p. Hanson last year unsuccessfully pursued a merger with Imperial Chemical Industries, partly to give it new businesses outside its Anglo-American base. For the year ended September 1991, turnover by geographical location, was Pounds 3.8bn in the UK, Pounds 3.5bn in the US and just Pounds 327m in the rest of the world. Analysts interpreted the announcement as evidence that Hanson had also decided that a UK hostile bid was too difficult in the present political climate. However, Mr Harper reiterated that Hanson was keeping its options open over its 2.8 per cent stake in ICI. Mr Harper added that Hanson would still prefer a friendly acquisition on the Continent. He said Hanson's borrowing power stood at Pounds 15.8bn after paying for Beazer, the building and materials group. Hanson had been looking for opportunities in continental Europe for the last three to five years, Mr Harper said.</p>

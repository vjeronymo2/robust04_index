			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Inactive Filing. A Large Trader may become inactive, thus exempt from the annual filing and disclosure requirements, upon filing its annual Form 13H for the previous full calendar year in which it has  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  effected: (1) aggregate transactions that equal or exceed the Identifying Activity Level;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (2) an aggregate calendar year total of 2,000,000 shares or fair market value of $30,000,000. Any inactive large trader that subsequently effects transactions that again reach the identifying activity level must make an initial filing within 10 business days after it effects the ``re-identifying transactions.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> D. Confidentiality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> All information disclosed on Form 13H may not be compelled to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA'') because the information is specifically exempted from disclosure by Section 13(h)(7) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the statute establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of information to be withheld. The Commission, however, is not authorized to withhold information from Congress, or any other federal department or agency requesting information for purposes within the scope of its jurisdiction, or complying with an order of a court of the United States in an action brought by the United States or the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Special Instructions for Form 13H and schedules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> A. Instructions for Form 13H_Cover Page.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Type of Filing. Indicate the type of Form 13H filing by checking the appropriate box at the top of the cover page to Form 13H.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the filing is an ``Initial Filing'' indicate the first date on which transactions were effected that reached the identifying activity level. An initial filing must include a manually signed Form 13H and all applicable Schedules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the filing is an ``Annual Filing'' indicate the ending date of the appropriate calendar year and list the specific Items or Schedules that are amended or changed. An annual filing must only include a manually signed cover page and those pages of Form 13H or Schedules that have been amended or changed. If no Items or Schedules to Form 13H have been amended or changed, indicate ``NONE'' in the space provided and only file a manually signed cover page to Form 13H.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the filing is an ``Inactive Filing'' indicate the date that the Large Trader last effected aggregate transactions that reached the identifying activity level. A Large Trader shall become inactive, and exempt from the annual filing and LTID disclosure requirements, upon filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the filing is a ``Corrected Filing'' indicate the type and date of the filing that is being corrected. This type of filing is not required but may be made to correct a previous filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All filings should indicate the applicable LTID assigned by the Commission and the Taxpayer Identification Number(s) of the Large Trader. Initial filings will not be required to include a LTID. In addition, all filings should disclose the Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') Institutional Delivery System (``ID System'') number(s) of the Large Trader that are applicable to the accounts identified in the specific Form 13H. An inactive large trader that effects re-identifying transactions will retain the LTID initially assigned to it by the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The unchanged or unamended portions of a large trader's form 13H and schedules need not be filed annually. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> B. Instructions for Form 13H_Items 1 Through 5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Item 1. Business of the Large Trader. Specify the type of business of the Large Trader by checking one or more of the listed business types. If the Large Trader is an individual, check ``Other'' and specify the occupation of such individual. Large Trader banks, trust companies and thrift institutions should check ``Other Financial Institution.'' If the Large Trader is engaged in more than one type of business, check each type that applies to the Large Trader.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The types of businesses checked should reflect the businesses of other large traders whose accounts are aggregated into the Form 13H by the Large Trader. For example, if the aggregated accounts of the Large Trader are accounts owned by other persons but controlled by the Large Trader only as an investment adviser, check only ``Investment Adviser,'' even though the Large Trader may be a division, subsidiary, or affiliate of a broker-dealer that has independently filed Form 13H.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Item 2. SEC Registrations. Indicate whether the Large Trader is an issuer of securities under the Securities Act of 1933, or registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or otherwise is required to file or report information to the Commission that is substantially similar to the information required in the Schedules to Item 4 (e.g., name, location and nature of the business of individual owners, partners, executive officers, directors, and trustees of the Large Trader). If ``Yes'' is checked, provide the applicable types of registrations and SEC or Central Registration Depository (``CRD'') file numbers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The types of registrations or filings listed should reflect the registrations of other large traders and persons whose accounts are aggregated into the Form 13H of the Large Trader. Therefore, if all of the persons whose accounts are aggregated into the Form 13H are covered by one of the listed registrations or filings, then the Large Trader is not required to complete Item 4 or any of the corresponding Schedules. However, if any person whose accounts are aggregated into the Form 13H of the Large Trader is not covered by one of the listed registrations or filings, then the Large Trader is required to complete Item 4 and the corresponding Schedule for the ``un-registered'' person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SEC file numbers may be obtained by calling the commission's public reference room and CRD number may be obtained by calling the member services office of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), during normal business hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Item 3. CFTC Registrations. Indicate whether the Large Trader is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a ``Reporting Trader'' pursuant to Sections 4i and 9 of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1974, or otherwise is registered under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1974. If ``Yes'' is checked, specify the number and type of registration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

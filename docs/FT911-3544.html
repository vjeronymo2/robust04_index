			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / India sees GDP growth at 4% GROWTH in India's gross domestic product is projected to slow down this year to less than 4 per cent for the first time in six years. The Reserve Bank of India expects GDP to rise this year by 'not more than 4 per cent', against 4.5 per cent in the previous two years, reflecting uncertainties that grip the economy. Mr S. Venkitaramanan, the bank governor, said yesterday that the difficult balance of payments situation, and the consequent disruption in the flow of imported inputs, will slow industrial growth, although agriculture is expected to maintain its growth rate. Cash deposits for opening letters of credit for certain categories of imports are now fixed at a stiff 200 per cent, up by half, to ease pressure on foreign exchange reserves. The World Bank has convened a meeting of donor countries in Washington on May 1 to provide emergency aid to India.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> IMAGES;  </P> <P> PORTRAIT OF A DISASTER;  </P> <P> 'OH GOD, HELP US'  </P> <P> IT IS TUESDAY, OCT. 17, 1989. San Francisco plays host to the World Series. The  nation is set to watch. Suddenly, with all eyes turned west, Northern  California offers an awesome surprise. TV screens go blank. When the picture  returns, baseball has vanished, replaced by the stuff of nightmares.  </P> <P> IN A QUARTER OF A MINUTE the earthquake delivers a full ration of misery. At  what was to have been a golden moment, a metropolis is brought to its knees.  Beneath the broken buildings, bridges and freeways, a grim human toll awaits  discovery. It will be days before the digging ends.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The 1906 earthquake that devastated San Francisco was later estimated by  seismologists to have reached a magnitude of 8.3.  </P> <P> </P> <P> San Francisco's Marina District suffered the city's greatest damage, although  it was more than 50 miles from the earthquakes's epicenter near Santa Cruz.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Nimitz Freeway was reinforced in 1977 in the first of a three-phase program  to earthquake-proof state highways.  </P> <P> </P> <P> "We're having an earth . . ." -- An unidentified voice on the ABC World Series  pre-game show as the picture turned to static.  </P></p>

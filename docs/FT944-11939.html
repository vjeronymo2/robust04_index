			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Komatsu benefits from public works projects Komatsu, the Japanese maker of construction equipment, posted a 5 per cent increase in non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - for the first six months of fiscal year 1994-95, helped by strong demand from domestic public works projects. The company, which is the world's second-largest integrated maker of construction machinery, increased recurring profits to Y7.4bn (Dollars 76.48m) from a previous Y7bn, in spite of a 3 per cent fall in sales to Y235.5bn from Y243.1bn. Net profits surged 21 per cent to Y4.3bn from. Y3.5bn. Strong demand from public works projects in Japan helped the company overcome a slump in private-sector orders, Komatsu said. As a result, domestic sales of construction equipment rose 5 per cent. However, the weakness of private-sector demand pushed domestic sales of its industrial machinery division down 38 per cent. In terms of exports, Komatsu suffered from sluggish demand for construction machinery in its largest markets in the Middle East, Russia and China, which aggravated the adverse effects of the yen's sharp appreciation. Exports of industrial machinery plunged 52 per cent as important customers among vehicle makers in Europe and Asia cut capital investment substantially. Komatsu exports mainly body presses for the motor industry. Komatsu expects the weak conditions in its export markets to continue in the second half. As a result, it has revised its full-year sales forecast down to Y500bn from the Y510bn forecast in May. However, Komatsu is restructuring its operations and expects to be able to achieve its earlier forecast for recurring profits of Y17bn, while forecasting net profits unchanged at Y9bn.</p>

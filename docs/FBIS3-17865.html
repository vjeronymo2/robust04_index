R. Ozolas'  diplomatic and legal discovery is that the agreement on the  status of Kaliningrad Oblast was reached immediately after the  war by the participants in the Potsdam conference, one of which  has "died." The philosopher has in mind the USSR. Thus, he  concludes, the CSCE still has to decide whether to allow the  USSR's heir, Russia, to continue to control this oblast.    This politician's statement could be dismissed and ignored:  What does it matter what someone says in the heat of polemics.  But two considerations prevent this. First, it would be  interesting to know how the independent states which have  appeared on the map of the former USSR would react if Russia  were to allow itself to address to them a small proportion of  such statements connected with the disputed nature of particular  territories. I do not mention the fact that Russia's immediate  neighbors often choose brief segments of history which suit them  and lustfully state their right to a particular region, playing  conjuring tricks with all kinds of international documents.    Second, Lithuania's official figures in contrast to R.  Ozolas  (actually, let us not forget he is a member of parliament) do  not allow themselves such speeches and nonetheless the subject  of Kaliningrad Oblast is increasingly present in their  statements "against" Russia. Before, Foreign Minister Povilas  Gylys said that the numerical strength of the servicemen in the  oblast is far smaller than some mass media claim. But in his  January letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher he  was already voicing great concern at the Russian Army  concentration in Kaliningrad Oblast and drew attention to the  need to demilitarize the region.    It is not hard to notice that the change in his position is  in the mainstream of the opinions of opposition forces and  right-wing movements. Back when he was chairman of the  Lithuanian Supreme Soviet, Vytautas Landsbergis frequently  expressed himself in the same spirit on the subject of  Kaliningrad Oblast. Members of right-wing movements, even if  they are not speaking directly of the need to transfer this  region to Lithuania, are hinting it. And on this plane R.  Ozolas' arguments are no great surprise.    The right-wing newspaper LETUVOS AYDAS states that  Karaljaucius (that is what it calls Kaliningrad) should be  demilitarized and its fate should be decided by an agreement  between Russia, Lithuania, and Germany. "At Potsdam Lesser  Lithuania was handed over to the control of the USSR proceeding  from extensive scientific material which argued that this  territory is ancient Lithuanian land," the newspaper asserts.  "The Kremlin leaders initially planned to hand it over to  Lithuania but later had second thoughts and by an edict of 7  April 1946 Lesser Lithuania was joined to the Russian Soviet  Federated Socialist Republic and called Kaliningrad Oblast."    This oversimplified assessment of a very complex historical  moment issued in many thousands of copies can indeed give rise  to quite specific feelings among some Lithuanian citizens. What  about the fact that at that time Koenigsberg had been German for  700 years? That the Prussian tribe subjugated by the Teutons in  the 13th century was a Baltic tribe -- related to the  Lithuanians but not Lithuanian? In my view the numerous  indications that elements of Lithuanian culture are present in  the region are also unproductive. So what? What if the Slavs  were to search for traces of their own culture in other regions  of the former USSR and not on Russian territory?</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Baghdad Republic of Iraq Radio Network  in Arabic at 2000 GMT on 30 April carries a "recording" of a  28-minute off-the-cuff address delivered by Iraqi President  Saddam Husayn to al-Anbar officials and residents during his  visit to al-Anbar Governorate on 30 April. Reception ranges  from fair to poor, with a number of indistinct passages.    Saddam begin his address by commenting on the speeches made  by the al-Anbar dignitaries. He observes that, in their  speeches, they began with history. This shows that the Iraqis  and Arabs care about history and the past, just as they care  about their future. He adds that the Arabs always stress the  nonmaterial meanings of the past, citing a speaker who  highlighted the historical status of al-Anbar in the past,  rather than its material possessions.    Saddam adds that the most important thing he wishes for the  people of al-Anbar is for history to record their positions so  that their grandchildren may take pride in them. He tells them  that every position has its rewards and consequences. Saddam  then recalls his previous visits to al-Anbar.    Saddam continues to elaborate on the link between the past  and the present, noting that the Arab nation is capable of  making great achievements when it relies on God and gathers the  necessary elements for success. He then talks about anti-Arab  trends in the Arab world that have cast doubts on the Arab  nation's present capabilities and argue that the past glory of  the Arabs is over.    Addressing people of al-Anbar on this point, Saddam adds:  "Your great role and the role of your people is that they have  created a vital link between the present and the past." He then  refutes charges that the Arabs do not know how to use their  minds or how to utilize science. Saddam says science emerged  first from Baghdad and then developed in other nations later  when Baghdad retreated for reasons familiar to all historians.  Saddam says this link between the past and the present is  important because it enables the people to look toward the  future with confidence. The present shows that the Arabs know  how to respond to the scientific age in a balanced, correct  fashion, because the Arabs have faith that puts science on its  proper track.    Saddam tells the people of al-Anbar that their sacrifices  provide strength to remedy the weakness on the part of certain  Arabs and Arab officials who, wittingly or unwittingly, have  taken a wrong course of action.    Saddam then recalls a conversation he had with an "Arab  official" during the war with Iran. He says he had told the  official that the Arabs should thank Iraq, not for the obvious  reasons -- that Iraq is the eastern gate of the Arab nation and  that it protects the nation, enabling many people to sleep  peacefully when they could not before -- but because Iraq  upholds the banner of the Arab nation and has given all Arabs a  chance to demonstrate an honorable position, whether in words or  by contributing money or troops. Saddam says that a right is  not lost if someone continues to claim this right and fights to  regain it. He recalls in this connection some battles fought in  al-Anbar to regain its lost territory, thus showing the Arabs  their history in the making. Saddam concludes his speech by  thanking God for everything that has happened and praising God  for everything that is yet to come.    The recording of the address ends at 2028 GMT.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Books: Simply the colour of Chinese blood RED SORGHUM by Mo Yan Heinemann Pounds 14.99, 378 pages THE DAWNING by Milka Bajic Poderegin Honeyglen Publishing, Pounds 5.95 365 pages BROTHER JACOB byh Henrik Stangerup Marion Boyars Pounds 15.95, 304 pages THE FINAL MARTYRS by Shusaku Endo Peter Owen Pounds 14.99, 200 pages EVERY COLOUR in the spectrum brings a train of associations in its wake. Red means anger, the rising sun, blood, potency, victory in war - and, of course, death. The barbarity of Red Sorghum, a novel that explores in great and compelling detail the fratricidal violence that engulfs three generations of a single Chinese family in the province of Shandong from the 1920s, is underpinned symbolically by the abiding presence of red sorghum in the fields, a crop that grows tall and dense and, in the autumn, 'shimmers like a sea of blood.' The novel is newly translated from the Chinese and written by a member of the cultural affairs department of the People's Liberation Army, Not since D H Lawrence's The Rainbow has the natural world so effectively aided and abetted the themes of a work of fiction. The characteristics that shock, disgust and exhilarate, in almost equal measure, in Mo Yan's narrative are two-fold: its headlong, almost unmitigated cruelty; and the breathtaking speed with which barbaric incident is piled upon barbaric incident. Almost every page seems to be taken up with the dirty, messy business of death, death-dealing and dying, and all these incidents are rendered in a language that possesses a kind of ritualised luxuriance. There are two kinds of warfare being waged in the book: that among the native Chinese themselves who, in the 1920s, seemed to be part brigands and part freedom fighters; and between the Chinese and the Japanese in an on-going war of resistance that reaches a climax of bloodletting in 1939. The backdrop is almost always the same: those faithful sorghum fields in which this orgy of fanaticism and cruelty is enacted. The re-publication of The Dawning by Milka Bajic Poderegin, the late Serbian novelist, is timely. The first novel in a trilogy that was never completed, this book, too, analyses the travails of an entire people largely through the effects on a single family, but Poderegin's manner of writing could not be more different from Mo Yan's. The novel spans the period from the mid-19th century until the outbreak of the first world war, and it is set in the small town of Plevlje in southern Yugoslavia. A Serbian family chronicle, its presentation is deceptively leisurely in a manner often reminiscent of Turgenev, but beneath all the painstaking attention to dress, social custom and domestic detail, there are profound forces for change at work. When the novel opens, Plevlje is being administered by the Turks and is also home to an Austrian garrison. By the book's close, the Austro-Hungarian empire is collapsing and the Turks have suffered defeat in the war of 1912, thus expunging five centuries of shameful memories of the historic Battle of Kosovo. This impressive, sombre document is, above all, an extended description of the passive, heroic suffering of that most oppressed of the social classes in the 19th century - women; but it also reminds us, chasteningly, how deep and extensive go the roots of present Balkan troubles. The Danish novelist Henrik Stangerup, has just completed the third book in a trilogy of novels (the first two were The Road to Lagoa Santa (1981) and The Seducer (1985)) that have explored what the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard regarded as the three essential stages upon life's way: the aesthetic, the ethical and the religious. Brother Jacob, the 'religious' conclusion to the trilogy, describes the life of a 16th century mendicant Franciscan friar who has been driven out of his native country by the dogmatism and sterility of the Lutheran Reformation, and flees to Mexico to minister to the Amerindians. Unfortunately, he then finds himself at war with the established forces of Roman Catholicism because of his belief that the Amerindians themselves, being human beings, have as much right to be ordained as priests as anyone else. Stangerup's novel is an impassioned piece of fictionalised historical research, compellingly learned and maddeningly abstruse by turns. Unfortunately, it lacks the inner momentum that every novel needs if it is to be anything more than a concatenation of fictional circumstances. The plight of Catholic believers in Japan is a theme to which the Japanese novelist Shusaku Endo returns repeatedly in The Final Martyrs, a new gathering of stories that have been written over the past 40 years. In his preface to the English edition of the book, Endo explains the reason for its principal weakness: the tiresome overlapping of themes (others include family disharmony and case histories in physical decrepitude, for example) from story to story. Endo writes that the short story form is useful because it enables the writer not so much to present characters and themes as to explore the possibilities of using them in more ambitious contexts elsewhere - in the next great novel that one hopes to write, for instance. On the other hand, no one can deny that an important writer's nail clippings are worthy of a certain amount of forensic attention.</p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: Renault plans stake in Czech bus group RENAULT, the French state-owned vehicle group, plans to take a 34 per cent stake in Karosa, the biggest Czech bus maker, Reuter reports from Prague. Mr Miroslav Hauser, a Karosa executive said: 'Renault is very much interested and we have jointly prepared a privatisation project which is up for approval in late January.' Mr Pavel Stejskal, head of the Czech privatisation ministry's general engineering division, said approval would pave the way for a joint venture with Karosa's main plant in Vysoke Myto. Renault has agreed to pay Kcs231m (Dollars 8.25m) within 30 days of a contract being signed and is willing to invest a further Dollars 8.25m within three years to acquire a majority stake. Before the fall of communism in 1989, Karosa was Czechoslovakia's sole large bus and coach manufacturer. Renault and Volvo, the Swedish vehicle maker, are to expand co-operation in the German car market to maximise advantages of the alliance between the two groups, Reuter adds from Bonn.</p>

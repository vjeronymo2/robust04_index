			<p>BFN     [Text] Observers in Zimbabwe says fears of pre-election  violence have grown after an opposition politician urged his  supporters to keep weapons to protect themselves from attack by  members of the ruling party. The leader of the Forum Party, Mr.  Justice Enoch Dumbuchena, said members of his party would be  ready to retaliate against assaults by youths who have been  urged by President Robert Mugabe to launch a house-to-house  campaign to drum up support for his ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African  National Union-Patriotic Front] Party.</p>

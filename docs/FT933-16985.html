			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Chemical sector raises environment spending BRITAIN'S chemical industry spent more than Pounds 1bn on the environment last year, according to figures released by the industry's trade body. That represents about 3 per cent of the industry's Pounds 29.9bn turnover. The Chemical Industries Association said the UK chemical sector was the first British sector to publish its spending and environmental emissions figures. It was also the first national chemical industry to publish such statistics, the association said. Mr John Cox, director-general, said the statistics would form a model for other industries to follow. The association reported that between 1990 and 1992, environmental spending increased from Pounds 830m to Pounds 1.032bn. Capital expenditure on the environment rose from Pounds 184m to Pounds 305m. As a proportion of total capital spending it rose from 8 per cent to 14 per cent. Environmental operating costs rose from Pounds 646m to Pounds 727m. Discharges of 'red list' substances - a list of 23 groups of chemicals defined by the government as being unwelcome in aqueous waste - fell 40 per cent from 403 tonnes in 1990 to 243 tonnes in 1992. The level of special wastes - a list of 29 classes of chemicals which require particular attention - disposed of outside chemical sites fell 9 per cent from 253,900 tonnes in 1990 to 231,800 tonnes last year. However, these emissions actually increased from 213,700 tonnes in 1991. The association said this was because companies had been closing down sites and disposing of waste such as asbestos. The industry's energy consumption fell 19 per cent between 1967 and 1990, although production increased 112 per cent. Energy consumption per unit of output fell 61.6 per cent. Environmental indices created for the 114 sites between 1990 and 1992, showed that 84 had improved their performance, while 30 had deteriorated. Mr Jim Whiston, head of health, safety and environment at Imperial Chemical Industries, said this showed the indices were credible measures of performance. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, called for the industry to publish a complete record of all toxic emissions. 'The industry is generally improving, but it has a long way to go,' said Mr Whiston. The figures were collated from about 256 locations, representing about 75 per cent of the association members' sites, 88 per cent of the capital investment and 62 per cent of the entire industry's capital base. The association said it expected more sites to join soon.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                   HOW MUCH POLLUTION HAS BEEN DISCHARGED  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                     No. of      1990      1991      1992    1990-92                      sites  (tonnes)  (tonnes)  (tonnes)    Change                                                             (tonnes)                                                             per cent  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Chemicals dangerous in water               37       403       334        243      -40  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Special waste disposed off-site              138   253,900   213,700    231,800       -9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

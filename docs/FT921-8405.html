			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / A deal that fails to heal divisions: The delicate agreement reached by Opec members in Geneva The international oil market was expecting a clear signal from the world's largest oil exporters gathered in Geneva last week that they were prepared to take significant action to bolster prices. It was disappointed by the fragile compromise stitched together by the 13 ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) that barely hides deep divisions within their ranks. As a result, North Sea prices began to slide early yesterday and closed almost Dollars 1 down at Dollars 17.50 per barrel for North Sea Brent crude for April delivery. This follows a Dollars 4 fall in prices since November, from around Dollars 22. When US trading opens today, after the President's Day national holiday, the price decline is likely to continue. The fall in prices will reinforce the feeling among many oil ministers that they came away from Geneva with a patchy and barely effective deal. 'This agreement will only keep the present situation - maybe prices will go down for a few days and up for a few days, but in general it will just keep them where they are now,' said Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Iran's oil minister. The market's judgment was harsh: 'My gut reaction is simple. It's an absolutely dreadful deal,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, manager of Smith Barney's petroleum desk in London. Traders were disappointed on two counts: first, the size of the production cut agreed - which will reduce output of Opec countries by about 1m barrels per day to about 23m barrels per day - was smaller than the market had expected. Second, the lack of unity among producers over the size of the output cuts could make it harder for them to agree decisive action in future. The discord between Opec's largest producers which had obstructed agreement during the four days of intense negotiations, was reflected when both Saudi Arabia and Iran expressed official reservations to the final deal. This undermines the credibility of the agreement, and signals that a fragile alliance between the two, which has steered Opec policy since the Gulf war, is under severe strain. While satisfied with the overall ceiling agreed in Geneva Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, was unhappy with the production level assigned to the kingdom and said he would produce more than the 7.88m b/d it had been allotted. Mr Aqazadeh was disappointed that the organisation had not agreed deeper cuts. He sought a production ceiling of 22.5m b/d in order to boost prices. The dissent within Opec is putting the delicate relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran under increasing pressure. Mr Aqazadeh is sounding more strident in his demand for increased prices and feels that Saudi Arabia is reneging on an understanding to push prices higher in the aftermath of the Gulf war. 'Iran could feel it has been misled by the Saudis since the Gulf war and that Mr Nazer is not really serious about wanting higher prices,' said Mr Mehdi Varzi, an oil industry analyst at Kleinwort Benson. Mr Varzi stresses that the Iranian economy is facing severe difficulties as a result of current prices. Political considerations also lie behind Iran's stance. Mr Aqazadeh has one eye on upcoming elections to the Iranian parliament, when moderate forces are hoping to gain a majority. The price of oil, crucial to the success of economic reform, will play an important part in maintaining support for the moderates. Saudi Arabia has traditionally favoured moderate oil prices which it believes are necessary for a recovery in the world economy. It is also sympathetic to the needs of the US, an important ally, which would suffer further economic difficulties from a higher oil price. 'The strategy is not to allow the price to fall further, but also not to let it rise and that must have the hand of the US hidden in it, whatever they say,' said Mr Varzi. It was a telephone call from King Fahd, the Saudi ruler that ruined Mr Nazer's compromise plan late on Friday. Under this plan Saudi Arabia would have cut to 7.9m b/d as part of an overall ceiling of 22.5m b/d to 22.7m b/d. Mr Nazer was instructed to stick strictly to 8m b/d which is what the kingdom says it will now produce even though its allocation under the agreement is for a level of 7.88m b/d. 'Maybe a rational man will ask - what's the difference between 100,000 barrels a day?' said one Opec official, 'but you've got to recognise the political sensitivities at work.' Saudi Arabia spent Dollars 5bn during the Gulf war to boost its production from 5.4m b/d to close to 9m b/d in January, at the same time increasing its market share for Opec oil to 35 per cent. The kingdom is unwilling to relinquish its hard-won market share. It also faces a budget deficit of some Dollars 8bn this year which restricts its ability to manoeuvre. The kingdom's insistence on maintaining its large chunk of overall output will inevitably bring it into conflict with other smaller producers. All Opec member nations are suffering the effects of low oil prices, most have budget deficits and most have based their economic plans for this year on a price closer to Dollars 20 a barrel than the current level of Dollars 17 (for the Opec basket which is usually about Dollars 1 to Dollars 2 below the North Sea price). Some members such as Algeria, which is under emergency rule, and Venezuela, which recently suffered an attempted coup, are pressed by political unrest at home which has partly been caused by lower oil revenues. Mr Celestino Armas, Venezuela's oil minister, called for a ceiling as low as 21m b/d at the opening of the Opec talks reflecting his desire for a sharp price rise. In spite of paying lip service to smaller producers' concerns, Saudi Arabia has reasserted its dominance over the discordant producer's club. Its assertive role is increasingly mapping out a future for Opec. One significant achievement at the meeting, long sought after by the Saudis, was a move away from historical production quotas to allocate output more closely in line with individual countries' capacity. 'It was a major event because you've seen a change in the basis for allocating production,' said Mr Paul Mlotok at Morgan Stanley in New York. 'They clearly haven't worked out all the details yet, but it's a very important step.' It presents, however, an opportunity for new disagreements. The danger of using production capacity as a basis for allocating output levels is that countries have a tendency to be over-optimistic in their assessments of their ability to pump oil. In addition, the new system will enshrine Saudi Arabia's increased clout within the organisation. Iran and several other producers are already fighting to reverse the move and return to historical quotas which were in place before the Gulf war. Mr Aqazadeh has called for a return to the quotas as soon as Iraq is able to re-enter the export market. Iraq is currently barred from exporting oil by UN sanctions and its production allocation under the deal is for domestic consumption only. But the Iraqi minister told Opec last week that it is now capable of producing 2m b/d. Similarly, Kuwait has said its output will reach 900,000 b/d in June rising to 1.5m b/d by the end of the year. If the return of the two countries to full production is not to plunge the oil market into crisis, other members will have to agree significant cuts. This will lead to tough talking between the disparate producers' coalition when the UN lifts sanctions. When ministers meet again at the end of April to review the effect of last week's decision, the call from smaller producers for deeper cuts will be louder if, as seems likely, the price is no higher. Their calls will be fuelled by the fact that some smaller producers found their new output levels were below those included in the old quota system. But despite the disagreements in Geneva, the spirit of co-operation in Opec is not dead. The more generous producers: the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Libya and Qatar, all agreed to cut production by more than the average 9 per cent required under the deal to compensate the disadvantaged, smaller producers.  ------------------------------------------ OPEC'S COMPROMISE  ------------------------------------------ New quota levels         mb/d      % cut  ------------------------------------------ Algeria                 0.760       5.00 Ecuador                 0.273       7.00 Gabon                   0.273       9.00 Indonesia               1.374       9.01 Iran                    3.184       9.03 Libya                   1.395      10.00 Nigeria                 1.751       8.23 Qatar                   0.377      10.24 Saudi Arabia            7.887       7.75 UAE                     2.244       9.63 Venezuela               2.147       9.68 Iraq                    0.505         - Kuwait                  0.812         -  ------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: ASC may act over Campbell bid complaints THE Australian Securities Commission (ASC) has reacted to criticism of the takeover bid by Campbell Soup, the US food group, for Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker. Mr Michael Braham, the ASC's New South Wales regional commissioner, said yesterday he had received complaints alleging shareholders had been misled by statements from Campbell which suggested the company would not extend its takeover bid beyond last week. Mr Braham said Campbell had now stated that its final offer of ADollars 9.50 for Arnotts would be neither increased nor extended beyond February 5. 'The ASC is concerned where directors or their advisers use ambiguous language during takeover bids when communicating to shareholders or speaking to the media with the result that shareholders are confused,' he said. 'The ASC is considering issuing a practice note setting out its views on statements made during takeover bids. The ASC believes that companies and their advisers should take care not to make statements which, while not factually inaccurate, may mislead shareholders and the market or create uncertainty.' MR John McCarthy, head of ANZ Bank's property and investment services division, has been appointed managing director of RJI, the New Zealand property company, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. RJI, with assets of over NZDollars 1bn (USDollars 526m), is the biggest property company listed in Australasia. Mr McCarthy's appointment follows the resignation of RJI's founder chairman and executive director, Sir Robert Jones, last year. Mr McCarthy said he would manage the business from Sydney, and did not rule out the possibility that the company's head office would be moved from Wellington. Although most of the company's shareholders were New Zealanders, he said 60 per cent of the property assets were in Australia.</p>

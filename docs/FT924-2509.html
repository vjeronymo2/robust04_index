			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Broking regulation boost THE SECURITIES and Futures Association, the self-regulatory body for stockbrokers, has told its 1,300 members it will be co-operating more extensively with auditors in an effort to improve the effectiveness of regulation and cut its cost. In a letter yesterday, Mr John Young, chief executive, said the association was making efforts to enhance the reports it receives from the auditors of association members. It is proposed that the association should brief auditors on issues including capital adequacy, new rules and regulations that are causing difficulties. The association hoped that auditors would provide information in exchange and said it was discussing such ideas with the largest six accountancy firms. The ideas have already been endorsed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Only a handful of auditors have taken advantage of the protection section 109 of the 1986 Financial Services Act to discuss issues of concern with the association. The letter emphasised that the exchange of information 'will be of a general nature and not specific to individual firms. There will be no names or pack drills.' It added, though, that the association may hold separate meetings with firms and their auditors, with their agreement, to discuss 'specific compliance issues'.</p>

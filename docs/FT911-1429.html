			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / International Company News: Mitsubishi in Netherlands carmaking deal with Volvo MITSUBISHI Motors, a leading Japanese car maker, has signed a letter of intent to begin car production in the Netherlands, in a joint venture with Volvo of Sweden and the Dutch government. It is to buy a 33.3 per cent stake in Volvo Car BV, Volvo's Dutch affiliate, from the Dutch government, giving the Japanese company its first production facility in Europe and making it an equal partner in the venture with Volvo of Sweden. Volvo Car BV, which currently produces the Volvo 400 series, is presently owned 30 per cent by Volvo of Sweden and 70 per cent by Dutch state interests. The long-awaited move by Mitsubishi Motors to establish a European car production base will add significantly to the growing Japanese car assembly presence in Europe. Nissan, Toyota and Honda are developing car plants in the UK, and Suzuki is to begin car assembly in Hungary. The three partners - the Dutch government, Mitsubishi and Volvo - plan to pump more than Fl 2.1bn (Dollars 1.1bn) into Volvo Car BV to modernise its production lines and to enable it to manufacture a new medium-sized 1.6-2.0 litre car with production beginning in 1995-96. New production capacity will total 200,000 cars a year shared equally between Volvo and Mitsubishi. According to Dutch officials, the new cars will be based on a common 'platform' or chassis with separate Volvo and Mitsubishi body styles and each marketed through the companies' own distribution systems. The letter of intent was signed yesterday in The Hague. A definitive deal is expected in September. Under the agreement, the Dutch state will reduce its 70 per cent stake in Volvo Car to one-third by selling a 33.3 per cent holding to Mitsubishi. It will also sell a 3.3 per cent holding to Volvo, which already owns 30 per cent of the company. The transaction will raise a total of Fl 240m (Dollars 123m) for the Dutch state. Each of the three partners will invest Fl 700m in Volvo Car in the form of interest-free subordinated loans. On top of this Fl 2.1bn capital injection, the company will also borrow Fl 500m from banks to finance its expansion. Mr Koos Andriessen, the Dutch minister of economic affairs, said the agreement granted the Dutch state a 'put option' for selling off its remaining 33 per cent in Volvo Car in the second half of the 1990s. Volvo of Sweden and Mitsubishi would each buy exactly half of the state's remaining shares, making Volvo Car BV a 50/50 joint venture. Mr Andriessen said Volvo Car, the Netherlands' sole automobile production company, was too small in its present form to ensure its long-term survival. 'If this hadn't happened, I would have had to fear for the future of the whole company,' he said.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (14): The early bird gets the worm - Consultant's Critique AN astronaut was once asked what was the scariest part of going into space. He answered that, looking around at all the high-technology equipment needed to keep him alive, it was the knowledge that the work went to the lowest tender. Westminster City Council wisely looked at issues other than price in choosing a company for facilities management (FM). Recognising that the IT system had the potential to totally disrupt operations, Mr Roots looked at other issues - particularly how the council felt that the company and they would work together. Facilities management is often described as 'out-sourcing your redundancy plan'. Westminster saw that as more and more councils looked at FM, there would be a glut of former IT staff. The first to act would secure the best deals in placing their people. FM is an example of obtaining advantage through efficient asset management. ITNet is doing nothing secret or proprietary. It is doing nothing that Westminster could not have done for itself except to provide management in specialist areas. Westminster council has decided that its core business is managing the city infrastructure and welfare. IT is not seen to be part of that core. ITNet also concentrates on maximising its human assets. It spent a lot of time selecting the people they wanted to transfer from Westminster City Council. ITNet used independent assessment centres and psychometric tests for senior personnel. Since the handover, it has used MORI to poll staff for their views. It seems that both sides benefit from the deal. Westminster is able to get its IT services at a competitive price and avoids most of the redundancy costs. ITNet gets a London base, some equipment and an excellent reference site for future contracts. Whether other councils will get such a good deal is open to debate. Lessons from this case: There is more to long-term contracts than the price. Stick to areas of management competence. The early bird gets the worm.

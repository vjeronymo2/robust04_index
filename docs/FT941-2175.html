			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: GiroCredit executives threaten to resign The four executive directors of GiroCredit, Austria's third largest bank, have threatened to resign at the end of June unless the long struggle over control of the bank is resolved. Mr Hans Haumer, chief executive, said he and his three colleagues were expressing their frustration at working in a strategic vacuum. GiroCredit was established by Austria's savings banks as their central clearing institution. It has used that platform to become a leading participant in capital markets. However, the two largest savings bank groups, Erste Oesterreichische and Bank Austria, which between them control more than half of Giro's equity, have come to regard Giro in recent years as a competitor, and so have stymied its development. For more than three years, Giro executives have been trying to promote a resolution of a stalemate on their supervisory board. A year ago, Erste attempted to assemble a group of savings banks that would buy Bank Austria's 30 per cent stake and take effective control. Last month, Bank Austria, which had become impatient with the delays in completing this deal, launched a unilateral counter-bid for 20.4 per cent of Giro shares. This would be enough to give it clear control. It soon became clear that Bank Austria would probably not achieve its target, so the stalemate would remain intact. In recent weeks, both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's have put Giro's credit ratings under review, citing the ownership uncertainty. The Austrian finance ministry has expressed its displeasure with the situation at the bank. Mr Haumer yesterday met Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, chairman of Giro's supervisory board and chief executive of Bank Austria, to present him with the decision of the four executives not to renew their contracts when they expired at the end of June. Mr Haumer said later it had become very difficult to run the bank, and the notices by the credit agencies proved that the situation had become untenable. He said that the bank was in a very strong financial situation, having raised its pre-tax profits last year by 55 per cent to Sch2bn (Dollars 167.4m) in spite of the uncertain atmosphere surrounding it.</p>

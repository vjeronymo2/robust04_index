			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TYSON'S CLINICS FULFILL SENTENCE  </P> <P> Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson sparred for half an hour and signed  autographs at a boxing clinic this morning as part of his sentence for speeding  twice here last summer.  </P> <P> Tyson held the clinic at St. Joseph's Youth Center in downtown Albany. He was  to hold two other clinics, featuring drug-related talks, later in the day at  the nearby Arbor Hill Community Center.  </P> <P> Tyson was ordered by Judge Stephen Safranko to hold the clinics and pay a $300  fine after pleading guilty in August to speeding. Tyson had originally been  ordered to hold the clinics by Saturday, but his attorney, John Hicks, struck a  deal with Safranko allowing an extension to today. Safranko said Tyson faced  resentencing if he failed to hold the clinics today.  </P> <P> "Anyone with a car gets tickets," Tyson said. "Just because I'm more famous  doesn't mean I did anything worse."  </P></p>

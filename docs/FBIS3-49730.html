			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bisera Vukasinovic] </F>   [Text] The Party of Democratic Action of Sandzak held a  news conference in Novi Pazar today. Party Secretary Rasim  Ljajic spoke about the latest Croatian proposal for the  settlement of the Muslim issue in Bosnia and the NATO  declaration. Bisera Vukasinovic reports:    [Vukasinovic] Tudjman's initiative for a confederation with  the Muslim state in Bosnia is not a serious proposal. The  initiative is hiding the desire to divert attention from the  Croatian aggression in Bosnia and avoid talks on Muslim access  to the sea, and at the same time to score new points with the  international community, Rasim Ljajic said. The frivolousness  of the proposal is illustrated by the fact that a similar  proposal by the Muslim side on the creation of a joint republic  was rejected three months ago, he said.    Commenting on the NATO summit, Rasim Ljajic said that the  session did not produce anything new, and that the threats with  bombing are seen to be more of pressure on the Serbian side than  a real possibility. Rasim Ljajic devoted most part of his news  conference to the situation in this region. He accused members  of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of carrying out searches of  villages in Pestera and taking in about 1,500 Muslims for  informative talks. He described this as a planned and long-term  strategy aimed at changing the demographic structure of the  population. We asked to be received by the head of the  Secretariat for Internal Affairs in Novi Pazar and [Interior]  Minister Sokolovic to discuss the brutal conduct by the police,  but our request fell on deaf ears, said Rasim Ljajic, secretary  of the Party of Democratic Action of Sandzak, at the news  conference in Novi Pazar.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PRACTICAL MIND: CONSUMER REPORTS 1990 BUYING GUIDE ISSUE BY THE EDITORS OF  CONSUMER REPORT (GREY CASTLE PRESS: $29.95)  </P> <P> One of the inadvertent byproducts of the Reagan presidency's gutting of the  federal regulatory system was to make Consumers Union -- never a friend of the  caveat emptor philosophy espoused by free-market advocates -- more powerful. As  the federal government grew deliberately more lax in ensuring the safety of  goods and services offered consumers, ordinary people needed some organization  they could trust to tell them whether what they bought was safe to use, and  whether it met its specifications or its users' needs.  </P> <P> Consumers Union, through its magazine Consumer Reports, has been doing just  that -- buying products at retail establishments, then testing them and  reporting the results -- for 54 years. Now CR now has a paid circulation in  excess of 4.4 million, making it one of the most important merchandising tools  in the United States (even though its tests cannot be used by a company in its  advertising or promotion).  </P> <P> A good review in CR means store shelves will be wiped clean of the product in  24 hours. A bad review in CR can hurt sales just as dramatically, as the  importers of Sterling automobiles surely can attest.  </P> <P> Every year, CR's tests from the previous year are gathered in a paperback book,  the "Buying Guide," distributed free to subscribers. Now, for the first time,  an oversized, large-type version of the "Buying Guide" is available.  </P> <P> One can argue that CR by its very existence supports the notion that our most  important function is to buy something (to be sure, in the case of CR readers,  the right something). A more practical problem is that CR's judgments are not  quite gospel when it comes to unquantifiable matters of taste. How do you rate  the sounds produced by stereo amplifiers, or the taste of peanut butter? The  testers work hard to nail down the elusive qualities of the perfect ice-cream  bar, but hey, they make chocolate and vanilla in the first place because people  agree to disagree.  </P> <P> But these are quibbles. It's CR, after all -- not rich, powerful TV networks  and stations, not most practitioners of daily print journalism -- that tells  consumers the story advertisers don't, and regularly publishes lists of  recalled, and often dangerous, merchandise, from a shockingly long list of  children's toys to cars.  </P></p>

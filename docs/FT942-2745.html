			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: French bank plans US expansion Credit Lyonnais, the troubled state-owned French bank, yesterday became the latest foreign institution to announce plans for expansion in its investment banking business in the US. Meanwhile, CS First Boston, the investment banking subsidiary of CS Holdings, signalled a step in the opposite direction, with a move into arranging loans for US companies. Credit Lyonnais' reputation in the US has been damaged by its involvement with MGM, the film studio it has owned since it foreclosed on a loan to Giancarlo Parretti. Mr Robert Cohen, the bank's chief executive in the US, said that business had been handled through the bank's Dutch operations, rather than its US bank. He indicated the US operations had been one of the most profitable parts of the group, making after-tax profits of Dollars 170m last year, equivalent to a return on capital of 24 per cent. Credit Lyonnais has grown to be one of the biggest foreign-owned commercial banking operations in the US in recent years, with Dollars 10.5bn in commercial and industrial loans and a staff of 700, up from 400 five years ago. Mr Cohen indicated that the bank intended to expand its 100-strong investment banking business at the same rate of about 60 people a year, mainly on the fixed-income side. The bank plans to sell European and US government bonds in the US, and to underwrite debt issues for both European and US companies, he added. Credit Lyonnais' fast loan growth echoes that of other foreign banks in the US. According to a study released last week by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, foreign banks accounted for around 47 per cent of all commercial and industrial loans in the third quarter of 1992, double the level of 10 years before. CS First Boston said it had hired Mr Robert O'Brien, a former managing director of Chemical Bank - one of the leaders in the syndi-cated loans market - to arrange loans for existing customers. The move, unusual among investment banks, is the reverse of steps taken by US commercial banks to extend into the bond markets. Loans originated by CS First Boston will be booked by Credit Suisse, the banking arm of CS Holdings.</p>

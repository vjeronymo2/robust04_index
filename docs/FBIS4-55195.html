			<p>BFN     [Text] No secret agreement exists between the current  government coalition and ethnic Hungarian political groups, nor  any other document overstepping the framework of the government  policy statement which was endorsed by parliament, said Lubomir  Lintner, director of the government's Press and Information  Office, in an interview with a TA SR correspondent today.    Lintner was reacting to the statement of former Prime  Minister Vladimir Meciar in the "Kroky" television program on  Sunday in which Meciar said that the current government is a  vassal of the Hungarian political parties.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, June 4 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in north-east  China's Liaoning Province are contracting more land and spending  more money to grow grain -- as a result of recent grain price  rises in many parts of China.    Many farmers who left their land to seek jobs in urban areas  came back in the first few months of the year to take a contract  for farmland again. They were also buying more chemical  fertilizers and collecting farmyard manure.    "I am accustomed to cultivating land, but in the past  several  years, a whole year's income from farming was nothing compared  with what you gained by working several months in town,"  complained Zhou Huiyao, a 52-year-old farmer in Shigangzi  Village in Yangshipu Township in Liaozhong County.    In the past, the farmer had contracted some 3.3 ha of fields  at the most. However, the acreage decreased year by year to  less than 1.3 ha last year. This year, he contracted four ha of  land.    "I regret that I did not plant enough grain last year. I did  not expect the price of grain to go up that much," Zhou said.  "So I have increased my grain planting acreage this year and  asked my sons to help me at home rather than let them go to seek  jobs in town."    The experienced farmer calculated that he would make about  3,000 yuan net profits per ha in the autumn, despite the rise in  price of chemical fertilizer and other expenses.    Liang Jihua, deputy director of the Liaozhong County  Agricultural Bureau, said that this year the county was seeing  the greatest farming enthusiasm since 1984.    Land totalling some 6,700 ha, including some sandy land, has  been leased out to farmers this year, four times as much as last  year.    Farmers across the province are pouring more investments  into  farming. Some two million tons of chemical fertilizer, similar  to the amount sold last year, have already been sold, but  experts said they expect farmers will buy more.    Farmyard and other manure, once deserted by farmers, is  again  become popular with local farmers.    Liu Laifu, a farmer in Chengguan Village in Changtu County,  for instance, spent 500 yuan to build a public latrine in the  county town to collect manure. More than a dozen farmers have  followed suit.    Provincial officials were happy with the farming enthusiasm.    The whole province will have three million ha planted with  grain and soy beans. A leading official of the provincial  agricultural bureau, said that he expects the province's total  grain output will top the record of 12.5 million tons, if no  major natural disaster occurs.</p>

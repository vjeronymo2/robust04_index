[Aliukoniene] Most goods are smuggled from Russia,  Kaliningrad Oblast, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and other former USSR  republics. People are bringing poppies and other narcotic  substances to our country. Such contraband usually arrives by  rail, because it is easier to hide poppies there. Post-Soviet  southern states also import arms, ammunition, and explosives.    [Laucius] What contraband is brought into Lithuania?    [Aliukoniene] In 1993, the Prosecutor General's Office  instituted eight criminal proceedings for drug trafficking. One  of the largest such cases is that of two Russian citizens,  incidentally, students, who tried to bring in 3.6 kilograms of  hashish hidden in the staff compartment on the  "Moscow-Kaliningrad" train. A criminal action was brought  against one Lithuanian citizen who tried to smuggle 15,200  packages of cigarettes worth 27,500 litai through the customs  house in Lazdijai. The largest contraband in 1993 was 4 tonnes  of quicksilver illegally brought from Belarus. Its value at  prices of that time was estimated at almost 4.5 million rubles.    However, a large number of goods are smuggled through border  crossing points, which are practically uncontrolled, rather than  customs houses. Knowing that Lithuania has 15 customs houses  and 75 border crossings, one can only imagine the scope of  contraband....    [Laucius] Is contraband usually brought in by Lithuanians or  by foreigners?    [Aliukoniene] It is mostly imported by  foreigners--inhabitants of Kaliningrad Oblast and southern  regions. Many problems arise due to this, because by applying  administrative punishments to foreigners, we do not have a legal  mechanism regulating the retrieval of money in cases when  foreigners do not have it....    Customs officers in Lazdijai are the most busy ones--the  road  to Europe runs through there. Last year, however, the largest  amount of goods was confiscated in the Vilnius customs  house--worth as much as 4,548,970 litai. [passage omitted]    [Laucius] Could you mention any cases where the largest  amount of contraband was detained?    [Aliukoniene] The Customs Department has instituted 13  criminal actions for arms contraband as early as this year. In  the beginning of this year, an aircraft fully packed with arms  and ammunition, shipped from Buenos Aires, landed at the airport  in Karmelava. The prosecutor's office of the Kaunas region is  conducting a preliminary investigation into this case.    Inspection on a transit train at the Kena railway post in  the  Vilnius region discovered a large number of gas pistols and  ammunition hidden in the restaurant car, which someone tried to  deliver to Moscow.    Transit shipments cause great concern because they do not  require customs duties. The so-called "fake transit" is  extremely widespread, when according to the documents goods seem  to travel to another state, while actually they remain in  Lithuania, and customs officials only mark in the documents that  the load was exported. Certainly, such services are well  rewarded.... [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> IRVINE;  </P> <P> PUNISHMENT FOR 2 STUDENTS CONSIDERED  </P> <P> Three administrators are deliberating over the weekend the punishment for two  Irvine High School students who allegedly beat and broke the leg of a fellow  student who reportedly told police about drug sales at the school.  </P> <P> A daylong disciplinary hearing was held Friday for the boys, ages 16 and 17, by  three administrators from other schools to hear evidence about the Jan. 18  fight on the Irvine High School campus. A school district official said the  three will deliver their recommendation Tuesday morning.  </P> <P> According to a police report, the 17-year-old punched the 14-year-old victim  several times around the head and face, knocking him down. The 16-year-old  severely kicked the victim several times, according to the report. The victim  underwent surgery for insertion of a pin in his leg, broken near the ankle, and  has transferred to another school, according to the report.  </P> <P> The two boys have been charged with assault with intent to commit bodily  injury, according to the report. Those criminal charges are pending. The  16-year-old is on probation for auto theft and also is suspected of beating a  companion of the victim, in a separate incident, the report said. No charges  were pressed in that incident.  </P> <P> The recommendation from Friday's administrative hearing could range from the  most severe -- expulsion -- to no punishment, said Gerald Rayl, special  assistant to the superintendent of the Irvine Unified School District. A  recommendation for expulsion would require action by the district's school  board, he said.  </P></p>

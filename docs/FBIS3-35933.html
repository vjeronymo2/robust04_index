The U.N. Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) was set up in  1993 to help end fighting between the Government of Georgia and  Abkhazian separatist rebels. The council resolution expressed  readiness to consider any recommendation from Secretary-General  Butros Butros-Ghali in the next few weeks to increase the force  up to a strength of 88.    It stressed the need for substantive progress in talks due  to  resume next month between the two sides on the political status  of Abkhazia, fully respecting Georgia's sovereignty and  territorial integrity.    Yuliy Vorontsov, permanent representative of the Russian  Federation at the U.N., expressed support for the Georgian  side's call to launch a full-scale peacekeeping operation  throughout Abkhazia to ensure the return of refugees. He voiced  regret that "at this stage the Security Council has been unable  to comply with the request made by the Republic of Georgia."</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: US halts production of Tate's sweetener HOPES FOR Sucralose, a calorie-free sweetener developed by Tate &amp; Lyle, have been further deflated by news that production has been halted in the US, pending regulatory approval. The US is estimated to account for 85 per cent of the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) a year world market for high intensity sweeteners, led by NutraSweet from Monsanto, the US chemicals group. But although Tate and its US partner Johnson &amp; Johnson have spent Pounds 150m in more than 15 years of development, the product is so far only on sale in Canada, where it gained approval a year ago. As stocks have piled high enough to satisfy Canadian demand 'for the foreseeable future' - which one analyst calculated to be four years - two US plants have been mothballed by J&amp;J. The product is described as 'highly stable' and so is not expected to go stale. J&amp;J submitted an application to the US Food and Drugs Administration in February 1987. The FDA would only say yesterday that the petition was still under review. J&amp;J said the length of time taken was 'not really unusual.' Aspartame, the NutraSweet ingredient, took 10 years. UK analysts were not expecting Sucralose to contribute yet to Tate's profits. But some recently downgraded estimates for the year just ended by about Pounds 8m, to less than Pounds 190m pre-tax, to allow for the write-off of previously capitalised development spending. Mr Mark Lynch, at SG Warburg, said the delay in gaining FDA approval did cause concern in terms of Tate's medium-term earnings prospects. One analyst said there had been a time when it seemed Sucralose and the fat substitute Stellar, launched last year, might become star products, like the blockbuster drugs that help the ratings of pharmaceutical companies. However, they now seemed insignificant alongside the factors affecting the main sugar businesses.</p>

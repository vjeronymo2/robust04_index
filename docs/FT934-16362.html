			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Ministers oppose plans for further deep spending cuts: Rifkind and Lilley resist demands by Treasury to squeeze budgets A FIERCE STRUGGLE has broken out in cabinet over attempts to make deep cuts in defence and welfare spending as part of the drive to meet public spending targets for the next three years. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is demanding a full-scale review of Britain's armed forces if the Treasury refuses to drop its demands for further cuts in his budget. Lady Thatcher last night stepped into the argument by warning against defence cuts. She told Young Conservatives in Blackpool it was vital for Britain to maintain a strong defence. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, is understood to have rejected a demand from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, for radical reductions in a range of welfare benefits. Several other departments have been forced already to concede in principle deep cuts in their budgets for the next three years. But senior Whitehall officials said the gulf between Mr Rifkind and Mr Lilley on one side of the argument and the Treasury on the other amounted to billions of pounds. The transport department's roads programme, the environment department's housing and urban regeneration budgets and the government's subsidy for local authorities are emerging as the main victims. The education and health budget also face a tough squeeze but have so far escaped the worst of the cuts required to meet a freeze in real terms on overall spending for the two financial years - 1994-95 to 1995-96. For 1996-97 the plans allow for an inflation-adjusted increase of 1 per cent. Senior Whitehall officials said the row over defence and social security had stalled the work of EDX, the cabinet committee charged with sharing out the spending cake. Until the two departments reached a settlement it would be impossible to finalise other Whitehall budgets. Mr Clarke admitted at the weekend that the bargaining in EDX had left 'blood on the carpet' in Whitehall. Mr Rifkind also alluded to the struggle in a speech to the Conservatives' Blackpool conference. The defence secretary warned that the cuts in armed forces spending agreed under the Options for Change programme following the end of the cold war had left the Pounds 23bn defence budget at close to its acceptable limit. Mr Rifkind, who earlier this year was forced into an embarrassing U-turn to save two threatened army regiments, has told the Treasury the additional billions it is seeking in savings over the next three years would seriously undermine Britain's defence strategy. The cuts could only be implemented after a full-scale re-evaluation of defence requirements and capabilities. The Treasury, however, is aware such a review could provoke a political storm in which Conservative backbench MPs would effectively veto significant spending reductions. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, has argued that the cuts are essential to meet the government medium-term spending targets. The gap between total Whitehall spending bids and the agreed targets is proving impossible to bridge for 1996-97. For his part, Mr Lilley has rejected Treasury demands for reductions in his Pounds 80bn budget going well beyond an agreed clampdown on invalidity benefit. Among the radical options under discussion in EDX are the 'means-testing' or taxing of child benefit and the transfer to employers of responsibility for sickness and industrial injury benefits. Mr Lilley has successfully fought off a suggestion that all benefits should be frozen rather than uprated in line with inflation next year. He is also arguing that most of the other cuts demanded by the Treasury would be defeated by Tory backbench rebellions in the Commons.

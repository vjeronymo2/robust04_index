			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> WRIGHT SURVEYS HOUSE ON PAY RAISE VOTE  </P> <P> House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), in an attempt to show that avoiding a vote  on a 50% pay raise for members of Congress is a "collective decision," said he  is conducting a secret survey of House members to ask their views on the  controversy. He also promised to schedule a vote if a majority of House members  demand to go on record for or against the proposed pay increases -- from  $89,500 to $135,000 a year. But Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced), the Democratic  Whip, predicted that there would be no vote despite widespread public  criticism. Wright and other Democratic and Republican leaders earlier had  decided to let the raise -- for members of Congress, federal judges and top  officials of the executive branch -- go into effect without a vote. In a vote  likely to come this week, the Senate is expected to reject the raise, which  must be turned down by both houses of Congress or it will take effect  automatically.  </P></p>

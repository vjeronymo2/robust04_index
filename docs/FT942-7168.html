			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: German auction withdrawal batters European prices Germany led a sharp decline in European government bond markets yesterday after the withdrawal of an auction of short-dated German government bonds intensified doubts over further cuts in official interest rates in the near term. The Bundesbank cancelled its auction of four-year 5.875 per cent bonds because of insufficient demand, the first time this has happened since September 1990. The next tender of four-year notes will be in August. The Bundesbank's decision was taken badly by investors, whose confidence had been undermined earlier this week by cautionary comments by Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer and data showing continued rapid growth in M3 money supply. Surveys showing an acceleration in Germany's economic recovery, and speculation that the Bundesbank would announce an auction of 10-year bunds early next month, added to the gloom. Mr Tietmeyer's comments on Monday, which suggested the market should not expect further interest rate cuts in the near future, were reinforced by comments yesterday from Bundesbank council member Mr Reimut Jochimsen that the recent high M3 growth posed an inflationary threat. Although the Bundesbank's decision to cut its repo rate by only three basis points, to 5.20 per cent, was in line with most dealers' expectations, it still disappointed the market. The June Bund future on Liffe reached a new low for the year, of 93.30, before rising to 93.55 in late trading, down 0.69 point on the day. The Bundesbank is due to meet today, but is not expected to take any action on interest rates. The fall in bunds dragged down UK government bonds already depressed by the higher-than-expected price realised at the Bank of England auction of the government's first convertible gilt since 1987. In late trading, the June long gilt future on Liffe was down  15/16 at 103 1/2 . A tail of four basis points, the difference between the yield on the average and lowest accepted bids, was greater than had been expected, and reflected the wide range of bids. The auction of the 7 per cent gilts due 1997, convertible into 9 per cent 2012 gilts, was covered 1.93 times. Analysts said this was a good result, given the uncertainty about the issue. The heavy fall in bunds weighed on other continental markets, most of which suffered losses of around one point. Italian futures were among the worst casualties, following news that more leading political figures had been ordered to stand trial in connection with illegal financing of political parties. By late afternoon, the June Italian government bond future on Liffe was trading at 109.76, down 1.61 point, in heavy trading of more than 80,000 contracts. In France, data providing more evidence the recovery is gathering momentum failed to support prices. On the Matif, the June notional French government bond contract fell as low as 118.82, before recovering to 119.04 in the late afternoon, down 0.06 point on the day. The Bundesbank's decision to cut only three basis points off the repo rate also depressed French bond prices - it rules out any easing by the Bank of France. Longer-dated US Treasury bonds recovered from earlier weakness after an afternoon auction of five-year notes proved to be a success. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 better at 86, with the yield easing to 7.352 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 27/32 , to yield 5.942 per cent. Early on, prices across the board deteriorated despite economic news that appeared favourable for bonds. The Commerce Department reported that orders of durable goods had risen by just 0.1 per cent in April, against expectations of 1 per cent. The data suggested the economy had grown at a measured pace last month, improving the odds that inflation was still in check. Traders, however, were unmoved, and focused more on the Treasury's auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes. Many were anticipating the market would have difficulty absorbing the fresh supply. In the event, the sale drew slightly better-than-expected demand.</p>

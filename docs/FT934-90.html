			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Land Rover increases output by 20% Land Rover, the four-wheel-drive subsidiary of British Aerospace's Rover Group, increased output by nearly a fifth this year in spite of the downturn in Continental new vehicle markets. Land Rover's managers believe that the Solihull-based company, whose workforce has increased by 600 to 8,700 over the past few months, is poised to enjoy the best year in its nearly half-century history. If output levels are maintained 1994 production is expected to reach 80,000 units, a 16 per cent rise on the record year of 1990 when 68,621 were built. Production this year at 68,159 was only 0.7 per cent below the 1990 record. Among factors boosting the company's confidence is the expected recovery next year in Continental markets, the launch in North America this spring of the Discovery, the company's biggest-selling model, and the start of sales through 400 Honda dealers in Japan of a Discovery model rebadged as the Honda Crossroads. About two-thirds of output is exported. Weekly production of 1,830 units has required the introduction of a night shift for the first time and compares with weekly output of 1,290 at the start of this year. Discovery output this year jumped 46 per cent to 35,620 from 24,347, helped by UK demand where 1992's total Discovery sales of 19,989 were exceeded in this year's first nine months. Output of the Defender was lower than in 1992 at 17,590 compared with 17,651, as was the Range Rover at 14,949 compared with 15,334. BAe sells offshoot, Page 13</p>

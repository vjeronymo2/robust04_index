			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Lebed, commanding General of the </F> 14th Russian Army, by D. Mosiyenko and R. Khotin, IMA Press,  special for LITERATURNAYA GAZETA; place and date not given:  "The Dniester Region Could Become a Second Yugoslavia, Thinks  Aleksandr Lebed, Commanding General of the 14th Russian Army"]    [Text] [Question] On the eve of the parliamentary  elections in Moldova, President Mircea Snegur announced that he  will insist on the complete withdrawal of your army from the  Dniester region in 1994. What do you think about this?    [Lebed] As the saying goes, there is desire, and there are  possibilities. When I am asked whether it is good when the  troops of one state are on the territory of another one, I  answer: It is bad. Must they be withdrawn? Yes, they must.  When, is a separate question. When will the economic and  political conditions be created under which it will be possible  to dispatch trains here for the redeployment of subunits, and so  that local women do not assault our units, as happened  previously... These conditions do not exist now: One and a  half years of peace did not produce anything, negotiations  between the sides in the conflict are not being conducted, and,  unfortunately, no political settlement is being looked into yet.  As for the economic conditions--well, troops have already been  withdrawn from Georgia and other republics, as a result of which  a hundred thousand officers and warrant officers are dangling  between heaven and earth without work, without apartments, and  without prospects. This is no longer acceptable, and no one  will support this in the future. Diplomatic problems also  exist. How, for example, will Ukraine see it if I start to  transport weapons and ammunition through it? After all, its  railroads will be overloaded, and, indeed, the freight, to put  it mildly, is not safe. There is also a technical side to the  matter. Taking into account the existing rail lines, loading  platforms, and the number of weapons, the redeployment will take  two years. This is if there is an uninterrupted pullout--night  and day, summer and winter, on workdays and holidays... How can  there be any talk of 1994?    To utilize ammunition here is also unrealistic. But now the  game is one-sided--leave, and that is all.    [Question] Some politicians, in particular Bundestag Deputy  Brigitte Schulte, the leader of the NATO group of observers at  the elections in Moldova, believe that the presence of the 14th  Army in the Dniester region will complicate Russia's  participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program.    [Lebed] For me, this German woman is not an authority and,  indeed, women have nothing to do here in general. Let her come  and try to withdraw this army from here. The former Soviet  troops have withdrawn from Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland,  Germany, Mongolia, and Cuba. This was the first wave and,  afterwards, following the division of the Union, the second  started. The Western Group of Forces left Germany and the  Northwestern left the Baltics. This entire mass of officers,  warrant officers, military equipment, and preposterous  apartmentless servicemen... The economic situation in Russia  and Ukraine is now such that it is impossible to solve the  present problem quickly. But since this is the case, it has to  be resolved in a humane way. When the question of the  withdrawal of the British Army of the Rhine from the FRG arose  two years ago, the English calculated that it would take nine  years. The Germans checked it out--yes, precisely so. This is  the civilized approach.    [Question] Who in the future could take the place of the  14th Army? Perhaps the UN "blue helmets?"    [Lebed] Let us agree that not long ago we were citizens of  one country and that we will come to an understanding between  ourselves quicker and easier than the Americans, Germans, and  English. There are, for example, trilateral peacekeeping posts  of Russians, Dniester region people, and Moldovans. There are  no interethnic problems among them. And the military commanders  know each other, inasmuch as they served in the same army at one  time. A certain military-political balance of forces has  developed in this region. If it is now crudely violated in a  unilateral way... Let us imagine that our army is not here  tomorrow--immediately the temptation arises to resolve in one  leap and in two hours a problem that set teeth on edge a long  time ago. Someone will fill this vacuum. Imagine there is a  leap, but victory is not achieved, and a long conflict ensues;  but this place is smart, and everyone owes something to everyone  else. The map of Europe was redrawn more than once according to  the results achieved by the victorious soldiers of one side or  the other. In the Dniester-Moldovan conflict it can be proven  that white is white and black at the same time, only in one case  it is necessary to get documents from the 18th century, and in  the other, the 19th century. Therefore, this may be a second  Yugoslavia. A lot of sound thought has to be put in before  disrupting this balance. I personally cannot yet conceive of  how to withdraw the subunits entrusted to me from here. Even if  tomorrow someone else is its commander, he also will be unable  to do this. The people are not chasing the army from the  Dniester region--on the contrary, they are holding on to it.    Because troops were pulled out of the far abroad in a  disgraceful record-breaking timeframe, complicated tasks came up  frequently: For example, disband a division in two months. And  then the question arose: Where is your place of birth? If you  are from Tiraspol, let us send you, lad, to the commanding  general of the 14th Army, and he will find you a place. As a  result, 51 percent of officers and 79 percent of warrant  officers I now have were born in this region. Everything got  mixed up in the home of the Oblonskiy: The Army is Russian, the  last name of the commander is Lebed, his combat deputy is  Melnichuk, armaments deputy--Dymar, rear services-- Perepadya,  and the relatives of all of them are more often than not in  Ukraine. But on the whole all this is gibberish that must be  stopped as quickly as possible. Ukrainians, Russians,  Belarusians-- all are Slavs, people of one destiny and blood,  and one faith. We have to think about not what disunites us but  about what unites us. But we are divided like Siamese twins that  have two heads and one body. If they are separated, you get a  hybrid from either one of  them. Well, we are now working on hybrids.    [Question] What are relations like between the command  authorities of the Army and the Dniester region leadership?    [Lebed] They were never simple. The Tiraspol leaders  introduced idiotic money (rubles before 1992 with a stamp  depicting Suvorov and a face value), they are poking their nose  into other people's affairs, having sent hundreds of assault  rifles in October to the White House. They are making decisions  on some kind of citizenship, they are introducing outlandish  legislation, they have privatized 30 kilometers of the Russian  pipeline that goes through the territory of the Dniester region,  and they have taken jurisdiction of the air space over the  Dniester-Moldovan Republic, while possessing no airport or  aircraft. I resigned my commission as a Dniester region deputy,  inasmuch as I am categorically against the rude interference in  the internal affairs of the state and in the army that I serve.  The kind of president and the kind of parliament to have is  Russia's affair. The Swedes, Czechs, or Dniester residents are  irrelevant here.</p>

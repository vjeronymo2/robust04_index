			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhong Jianyan (6988 0256 0917): "Strengthen Party </F> Building and Leadership"]    [Text] The Party Building Research Office of the CPC  Central Committee's Organization Department held a seminar a few  days ago. More than 20 leaders, experts, and scholars who have  long been engaged in the party's practical work attended the  seminar, studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the decision of the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and  probed the theory of further strengthening party leadership over  socialist economy, politics, and culture with Chinese  characteristics. Those attending the seminar held the consensus  that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics inherited and developed  Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and that strengthening and  improving party leadership constituted an important component of  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  It is necessary to vigorously, comprehensively, and correctly  study, publicize, and implement the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, and  apply them in seeking unity of thought within the whole party  and guide all fields of work.    As China's reform and opening up has entered a very  important  historic period, the attendants pointed out at the seminar, we  must follow the party's basic line and theories, seize the  favorable opportunity, exert ourselves, and strive to push  forward China's socialist cause. In view of the problems of  mass concern, the attendants made many good proposals: The  socialist market economic system, which is combined with the  basic socialist system, is different from the capitalist market  economic system. While establishing the socialist market  economic system, it is absolutely necessary to consciously  maintain and uphold the predominant position of public ownership  and distribution according to work and resist the ideas and  actions which attempt to shake the predominance of these two  factors. "Emancipation and development of the productive  forces, elimination of exploitation and polarization, and  attainment of the ultimate goal of common prosperity" proposed  by Deng Xiaoping is the scientific expression of the essence of  socialism and integrated thinking, which cannot be separated or  even willfully quoted out of context. The CPC is the core of  leadership for the building of socialism with Chinese  characteristics, while the masses of people, centered on  workers, peasants, and intellectuals, are the vital force for  this grand cause. It is very important to strengthen the  party's ideological, theoretical, and political building, launch  protracted struggles against corruption, and maintain purity of  the party's ranks to ensure that leadership of all levels is  firmly in the hands of those loyal to contemporary Chinese  Marxism. If we weaken party leadership, neglect party building,  forsake the mass line, diminish the status of master of the  working class, divorce ourselves from the peasants, and slacken  efforts to build socialist spiritual civilization, our cause  will suffer and even meet with failure. We must firmly bear in  mind the historic lesson drawn from being hard on one aspect but  soft on the other, do two types of work simultaneously and pay  equal attention to both, and ensure the healthy growth of  China's reform and construction.</p>

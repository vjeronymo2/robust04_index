			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Observer: A gaggle of governors Whether there was an unseemly press of chairmen of City merchant banks after the services of former Bank of England governor Sir Robin Leigh-Pemberton, now Lord Kingsdown, remains unclear, but at least one spokesman was able to confirm that his bank had not been rushing to hire Lord Kingsdown. 'Who's he?' asked the gentleman, whose blushes Observer will save. Former governors of the Bank have proved a versatile lot in their third age, though it is certainly a very long time since one actually graced the main board of a British merchant bank, as Lord Kingsdown is about to do at Hambros. Lord Richardson (governor from 1973-83) is now chairman of US investment bank Morgan Stanley International, while Lord O' Brien (1966-73) became a consultant to JP Morgan, though he also sat on Morgan Grenfell's international advisory council. Lord Cromer (1961-66) later became British ambassador to Washington, while Lord Cobbold (1949-1961) perhaps had the most entertaining time. He became Lord Chamberlain of her Majesty's Household, at a time when it was still the remit of that office to censor stage plays. While Hambros may not these days be at the very top of the merchant banking tree, it has long sustained something of a special relationship with the Bank. It was called upon in the course of a number of local difficulties - in the aftermath of Johnson Matthey and during the international tin crisis, which are likely to remain fixed in Lord Kingsdown's memory for some time to come. And, while the in-house cricket team may be in need of an injection of enthusiasm from the new non-executive, it is also to be hoped Lord Kingsdown will find the time to explore the croquet lawn on the roof of the car park on one of those slow days.</p>

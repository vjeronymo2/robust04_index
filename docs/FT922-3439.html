			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Israel's politicians seek out the immigrant vote / A look at how candidates in the coming election are targeting newcomers ISRAELI politicians campaigning for the general election on June 23 have taken to stopping in a gigantic caravan park which sprang up a year ago just outside the southern city of Beersheva, on the edge of the Negev desert. More than 1,000 mobile homes stand in the sand at Nahal Beqa, forming a huge staging post for some of the 400,000 immigrants who have arrived in Israel over the past three years. Since it opened last August, Nahal Beqa has become home to some 5,000 newcomers from the Soviet Union and about one thousand 'black Jews' from Ethiopia - interspersed by a few hundred Israeli university students strategically placed to forestall any clashes between people from such diverse cultures. What new citizens of Nehal Beqa - many of whom have a vote - want to hear from politicians is what they will do to create employment that will get them out of their immigrant ghetto into permanent housing and launched on the new lives they are seeking in Israel. 'Jobs - that is the most important thing to them,' says Mr Adi Habad, site manager. The impact of immigration has sharpened the issue of the economy in a country where election campaigns tend to be dominated by the big political issues of the Arab-Israeli conflict. With unemployment at record levels and little sign of improvement, the opposition Labour Party has put economic policy high on its list of attacks on the record of the ruling Likud party. This is not just to attract votes among the immigrants themselves, among whom unemployment is running at 40 per cent. Many of Likud's core voters in lower-income 'Sephardi,' or oriental Jewish, communities have also been feeling the pinch. Beersheva is a prime example. Some 20,000 immigrants have boosted the population from 113,000 to 135,000 in less than three years. Some 25 per cent of the veteran population are of Moroccan extraction, many living in poor neighbourhoods. Increased public services and construction activity have added to employment, but Beersheva has been hampered by industrial stagnation and cuts in big local companies such as Makhteshim Chemicals, an offshoot of the trade union-owned Koor Industries. In the 1988 election, Likud took 43 per cent of the vote in Beersheva to Labour's 28 per cent. Local Labour campaigners, who are stressing economic themes, are aiming for 35 per cent this time, a figure they say would imply a Labour victory nationwide. How bad is the state of the economy? Some indicators look pretty healthy. Growth last year was about 6 per cent. Employment grew. So did investment and business profitability and productivity. But these mask an underlying picture in which fast population growth has meant negligible per capita growth. According to the Bank of Israel, half of 1991 growth was due to a construction boom which is now over. 'In other industries there are as yet no signs that sustainable growth is about to set in,' the bank said. Exports shrank last year, an ominous development for a sector supposed to be the engine of long-term growth. Workforce growth outpaced job creation, leaving unemployment now at a record 11.6 per cent. Inflation hovers above 15 per cent. In early 1992, the bank detected a decline in investment and economic activity. Above all, it said, the government did 'too little and too hesitantly' to invest heavily in infrastructure cut heavy taxes and government spending and institute reforms such as privatisation of the big state-owned industrial sector and the banks - which in turn are big industrial owners in Israel. Labour - having shed its ideological commitment to socialism - now calls for all these prescriptions to be implemented. It says there must be a 're-ordering of priorities' - stressing that the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by the Likud on Jewish settlements in the occupied territories could be redirected to investment in places such as Beersheva. But the Likud, still proclaiming itself the party of liberal economics despite its poor record, has a point when it calls into question Labour's new-found market message. Mr Shalom Peri, Labour's campaign manager in Beersheva, makes no bones about what he is promising to voters who have lost their jobs in recent years. 'People know the government must come with public investment. The Negev area will never develop through the free economy.' Many Russian immigrants are justifiably cynical about both parties, regarding them as captives of the system and their own vested interests. They see Likud as being obsessed with the occupied territories and Labour still tied to the powerful Histadrut trade union federation which has resisted economic reform. 'It is absolutely chaotic. There is no serious progress to absorb the immigrants,' says Mr Vladimir Gontar, formerly a laser technology expert in the Soviet Union now working at Beersheva's Ben Gurion University of the Negev. 'Not the Likud, nor Labour has a serious programme for a new society based on the new brains which have come here, and that is perhaps the feeling of all the Russians,' says Mr Gontar. Meanwhile, in a severe embarrassment to the government, the message has got back to Jews still living in the former Soviet territories, many of whom have judged that economic prospects in Israel are no better than at home. Russian immigration has slumped from 20,000 a month at the peak to less than 4,000 in May.</p>

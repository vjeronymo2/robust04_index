			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 22 May (ABE) -- Today, Finance Minister  Rubens Ricupero clarified his position regarding the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. "It was neither aggressive  commentary nor political sociology," said Ricupero, who avoided  repeating the criticism he made of the party. On 20 May in  Porto Alegre, Ricupero said he was not campaigning for the PSDB  because he is a critic of the PSDB, which he compared to "a gay  who has not dared come out of the closet."    "I made a commentary in the hallway, but it was friendly,"  Ricupero said. This time he praised the PSDB cadres. According  to him, Senator Mario Covas (PSDB-Sao Paulo) was the one who  best interpreted his words. "I can only say that I made them in  a friendly tone," he added.

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Russia seeks bigger role in IMF RUSSIA, promising further radical economic reforms, served notice yesterday that it would fight for a much bigger role in the International Monetary Fund than the West is prepared to give it. Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, responsible for negotiations with international organisations, said Russia was seeking a quota of 4 to 4.2 per cent of the IMF's capital. The size of the quota determines the amount of Fund resources available to individual members. The Group of Seven leading industrial nations, whose influence is key in IMF decision-making, are proposing a 4.5 per cent quota for all former Soviet republics, including 2 to 2.5 per cent for Russia. Before a proposed IMF capital increase, this would rank Russia in 11th place, sandwiched between the Netherlands and China. The IMF expects its experts to agree with the G7 figures for Russia. But Mr Kagalovsky, whose country is also seeking a seat on the IMF board, said that such calculations were 'erroneous' because they were based on working out a quota for the former Soviet Union and then dividing it among the 15 republics. One compromise solution would be for the Fund to promise Russia a greater share of IMF funds in return for a lower ranking. The issue is delicate because national pride means that Russia, as heir to the former Soviet superpower, sees itself as closer to the US and Germany than to the Netherlands. The quota will be one of the main issues in membershp negotiations between now and April 27, when Russia and the other republics are expected to receive the green light for joining the Fund. Russia will be using as a bargaining chip its bold programme of economic reforms for 1992, which follows IMF recommendations to the letter. The main points of the programme are as follows: The removal of price controls on most goods and services by end of March except for rents, transport and services, domestic use of gas and electricity The freeing by April 20 of the domestic price of oil to reach an estimated Rbs2,000-2,500 (Dollars 19.6-Dollars 24.5) a tonne (compared with Rbs350); this will be accompanied by a 50 per cent tax on domestic sales, presumably to be paid by the seller. Mr Kagalovsky said he expected domestic energy consumption to fall by 10-15 per cent after the price liberalisation. The government aims to slow inflation to 1-3 per cent by the end of the year after an expected jump in prices overall of 50-75 per cent in April Reduction of the budget deficit to one per cent of GNP by the end of this year (according to Mr Kagalovsky) to be achieved mainly through a cut in subsidies to enterprises and military spending Restoration of value added tax of 28 per cent on all types of goods (following its removal from certain food sales) and its introduction for imports from July 1 1992 A unified regime of export taxes for energy and raw materials Introduction in mid-summer of system of one fixed exchange rate for the rouble for all current transactions, plus one rate for capital movements. One western embassy recently calculated that there were at least 10 exchange rates in force in Russia at the moment Further tightening of the central bank's monetary-credit policy including an increase in reserve requirements for commercial banks to 20 per cent in April Progressive tax on pay rises by state enterprises which exceed set norms more focused social subsidies for the worst off and the unemployed Mr Kagalovsky warned that the scope of the programme would have to be cut back if Moscow failed to receive sustantial foreign financial assistance. He said this should include a stabilisation fund of Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn (Pounds 2.86bn-Pounds 3.34bn) which is being put together by individual western states, not by the IMF, for the rouble, and further debt relief to free resources for social welfare, stabilisation funds, and increased imports. Britain has agreed to help Russia become a member of the International Monetary Fund, marking a further step forward in economic cooperation between the two countries, writes Peter Norman. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, announced yesterday that Britain would represent Russia's interests during the IMF's consideration of its membership application. The move follows a request for British help from Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian finance minister. Russia's application will be discussed soon by a committee of the IMF board of directors, which will also consider details such as the size of Russia's membership quota in the fund. Russia will make an initial presentation of its case to the committee and then leave Britain to argue the Russian case in detail. It is normal procedure for an applicant to appoint an existing IMF member to act on its behalf in this way. Britain's goal is to secure Russia's membership of the IMF at the next meeting of the fund's policy-making interim committee at the end of April. Mr Lamont, the UK chancellor, said he was 'delighted' that Mr Gaidar asked Britain to represent Russia.</p>

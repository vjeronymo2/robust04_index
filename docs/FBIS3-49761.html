They  were able to gain control of the northeastern entry to the city.  It added that the Muslims were able to cut the road linking  Vitez and Busavaca, which is now completely besieged by the  Muslims. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Bosnian Progress </H5>   Croatian army sources have said that the broad Muslim  offensive included Zepce, Busovaca, and Kiseljak, and that the  Muslims had sent for a large number of their soldiers from the  city of Zenta. It added that the British unit serving with the  international forces had undertaken patrols on the road between  Vitez and Busovaca to save refugees who had been forced to flee  these areas.    AL-HAYAH escorted the first phase of this attack, in which  the Muslims succeeded in placing the siege around Vitez and  reaching its suburbs.    AL-HAYAH has learned from a military source that Bosnian  President Alija Izetbegovic met for five hours the day before  yesterday with the commanders of the Bosnian army in the Konic  region, and that the chief of staff, interior minister, and most  senior military leaders took part in the meeting.</p>

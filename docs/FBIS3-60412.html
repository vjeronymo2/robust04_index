Public Health Minister Chen Minzhang was speaking as a new  body, the Chinese Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and  Treatment, was founded in Beijing.    Chen, who was elected chairman of the association, said it  would be a great help in the government's battle to control and  treat drug addiction.    The association is composed of medical experts and officials  from relevant State departments.    It will carry out publicity campaigns warning of the dangers  of drugs, treat addicts and abusers and guide medical units in  the clinical use of narcotics.    Narcotics are indispensable as effective painkillers, Chen  said, but their random use could be harmful.    A sample survey in Beijing found three in every 1,000 people  are dependent on drugs.    China now has 250,000 registered drug addicts, most of them  young and middle-aged men, in 17 provinces across the country.  But experts say the actual figure must be higher.    Most of the addicts, reliant generally on heroin and opium,  are concentrated in the south and northwest of the country.    Drug abuse has become the major channel for the spread of  HIV, which leads to AIDS.    Among the 1,159 HIV carriers reported from China's mainland,  about 60 percent got infected through intravenous injection of  narcotics.    Drug abuse, according to World Health Organization (WHO), is  the excessive use of narcotics, tobacco, alcohol and medicines  which may lead to addiction.</p>

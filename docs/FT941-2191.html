			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Keller floats with valuation of Pounds 70m Keller, a specialist in ground engineering, will be floated next month through a placing and intermediaries offer giving it an estimated market value of Pounds 70m. A former engineering offshoot of GKN, Keller was bought by its management for Pounds 26m three years ago, backed by funds led by Candover Investments. It will use the proceeds to repay debt and finance further overseas expansion. Projects outside the UK account for more than 80 per cent of sales. In spite of recession, Keller has increased operating profits by 46 per cent since 1991 from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 9.2m on turnover up by 30 per cent to Pounds 148m. Most of Keller's sales and profits come from Austria and Germany, where the company has benefited from infrastructure improvements. Although established by GKN as a site investigation business in the early 1950s, the group takes its name from Johann Keller, a German specialist company which it bought in 1974. In 1984, the group expanded into the US by purchasing Hayward Baker, a company specialising in grouting - strengthening ground and reducing waterflows. In January this year Keller paid Dollars 9m for Case International, a Chicago-based foundation engineer which it said would complement Hayward Baker and will lift the group's North American sales to in excess of Dollars 70m. The float is expected to raise about Pounds 30m of new money and about 75 per cent of the company's equity will end up being held by institutions and private investors.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Speaking of reunions, it will be just like the old days, sort of, when the  Jefferson Airplane plays a free concert in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park  Saturday, with the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir as opening act. Admission will be  one can of food, to be donated to the San Francisco Food Bank. But  demonstrating how some things have changed in the 20 years since free concerts  in the park were the norm in Frisco, a local radio station has had to take out  a $1-million insurance policy to cover the event. Producer Bill Graham, who has  staged many a concert -- free and otherwise -- with the Airplane and the Dead,  estimates a draw of 50,000 people. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

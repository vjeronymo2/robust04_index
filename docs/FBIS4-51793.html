			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, April 20 (YONHAP) -- Argentine Navy  vessels seized four South Korean fishing ships near the Falkland  islands Tuesday afternoon. The four Korean ships, 300-400 ton  large, are Petro 301 and Petro 303 of Taeung Deep Sea Fisheries  Co., Tongwon 311 of Tongwon Industries Co. and Chaewon 22 of  Chaewon Industrial Co.    The vessels, fishing within 200 nautical miles of  Argentina's  "territorial waters," tried to escape after the Argentine Navy  ordered them to stop but were later captured, Argentine  authorities said. Korean fishing sources here said four Korean  vessels are confirmed to have been captured, but the figure may  rise to seven. The incident marks the first time that the  Argentine Navy, instead of the Coast Guard, has seized several  Korean ships at a time for entering the zone and could cause a  diplomatic dispute, informed sources said.    The Korean ships' catch will be confiscated and they face a  fine of at least 500,000 U.S. dollars.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 13 (CNS)--Deputy director of the State  Administration of Foreign Exchange Control, Mr Song Haipeng,  speaking at an international seminar on finance recently held in  Shenzhen, revealed that the foreign exchange market in China  developed very rapidly in past years.    According to the deputy director, there are 2,292 financial  institutions engaging in foreign exchange businesses at present  across the country, of which 2,042 are domestically funded, 90  are foreign funded or Sino-foreign joint ventures. The total  foreign exchange assets are put at U.S.$230 billion.    The foreign exchange market in the country mainly includes  two parts. One is the foreign exchange swap market with over  100 foreign exchange centres of various kinds offering services  to enterprises and individuals for foreign exchange trading.  The transaction value of foreign exchange in recent years was  about U.S.$25 billion. Another part is the securities market  for capital raising. Chinese enterprises have, since 1991,  issued "B" shares for overseas investors. At present, some 30  kinds of "B" shares have been listed in the Shenzhen and  Shanghai Stock Exchanges with over U.S.$1 billion of foreign  exchange capital raised.    Mr Song said that several medium and large state-owned  enterprises were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last  year and, at the same time, China also raised foreign capital by  issuing bonds in foreign countries including Tokyo, London,  Frankfurt, Singapore, Luxembourg, and the United States. In  addition, China's foreign exchange capital market and futures  market are improving.    Mr Song was convinced that with the sustained and rapid  economic growth and the further opening to the outside world,  the unified foreign exchange trading market for inter-bank  businesses opened last April, replacing the foreign exchange  swap markets. [sentence as received] Such a unified market  will greatly speed up the circulation of foreign exchange  capital and increase the market supply and demand, which will  promote the development of the foreign exchange market across  the country.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report under the "Refugees" rubric: "There </F> May Soon Be 6 Million Migrants in Russia. Despairing Deserters  Get Together in `Death Squads'"]    [Text] Dmitriy Rogozin, leader of the Congress of Russian  Communities [CRC], and Garold Zavadko, cochairman of the "Union  of Russian Refugees," held a press conference yesterday at which  they told journalists about the position of Russian refugees in  Russia. They think it has deteriorated sharply today. As the  "Union of Russian Refugees" stated, a campaign has begun lately  to evict refugees staying in holiday hotels near Moscow.  Several court cases have been heard and have reached a decision  "to evict without providing [alternative] housing." In the  opinion of Mr. Zavadko, there is "collusion between organs of  state power against the refugees and a threat of their second  deportation."    Speaking about prospects for migration of the "Slavic  population" from CIS countries and the Baltic states to Russia,  Dmitriy Rogozin expects that some 6 million forced migrants may  arrive in Russia in the next two years. It was pointed out that  the real number exceeds that registered by the Federal Migration  Service. Pointing to the fact that under the government  directives of 1 May 1994 each refugee should be issued with 1  million rubles for resettlement, Mr. Rogozin told those present  to figure out the sum that will have to be earmarked from the  state budget. The CRC leader also sharply criticized the  current relief system. Dmitriy Rogozin hopes that during the  meeting which he may have with Boris Yeltsin during the coming  month he will be able to convince the president to give a tax  break to the charity tasked with providing real aid to refugees.    Mr. Rogozin and Mr. Zavadko singled out the problem of the  Russian draftees who have deserted from national armies over  politically motivated harassment by their fellow draftees. In  the opinion of Dmitriy Rogozin, the despairing deserters, unless  they get assistance, may take refuge in quarters close to the  shadow economy or even form the basis for "death squads" which  would "start taking vengeance on those to blame for their  plight."</p>

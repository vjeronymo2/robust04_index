			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (12): Time to catch up - Telecommunications PORTUGAL's first private telecom corporation began operations on October 18 when a Portuguese-US consortium launched a nationwide cellular telephone network. The start-up follows the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector in 1991. The new company, Telecel-Comunicacoes Pessoais, involving the US company Pactel-Pacific Telephone Systems and two Portuguese partners, will compete with an existing state-owned competitor. Both use advanced GSM-Pan-European Digital Mobile Phone technology. 'Private operators and the entry of private capital into existing companies will help Portugal prepare for the increasing competition the country will confront in international telecommunications sectors,' says Mr Joao Manuel de Mello Franco, president of TLP-Telefones de Lisboa e Porto. 'Private entrepreneurs will also help increase the flexibility of our companies and improve our management to face future challenges.' TLP is one of three state-owned companies operating public telecommunications services in Portugal. It operates the public network in greater Lisbon and greater Oporto. The area covers 37 per cent of the population, 60 per cent of the nation's purchasing power and 80 per cent of corporate headquarters. More than half of the country's telephone traffic is generated by TLP customers and a good 20 per cent of customers are corporate. Operations in these two large metropolitan areas make TLP one of Portugal's top business corporations, ranking fourth in terms of gross value added and net assets. The public network in the rest of the country and for European connections is operated by CTT-Correios e Telecomunicacoes de Portugal, which is shortly to be split into separate postal and telecom services. CPRM-Companhia Portuguesa de Radio Marconi, 51 per cent owned by the state, has a concession to operate intercontinental services via submarine cable and satellite. To bring these three separate companies together, the Lisbon government has created a holding company, CN-Comunicacoes Nacionais, to manage the entirety of Portugal's telecommunications services as a single conglomerate. 'This will enable us better to co-ordinate company strategy, avoid difficulties over frontier areas and invest all three companies with a solidarity aimed at achieving the same objectives,' says Mr Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, the minister for public works, transport and communications. More importantly, private capital will be admitted to the three corporations. A limit of 49 per cent will initially be imposed on private participation. But this will gradually be increased. 'If we completely privatised the companies very rapidly, only a few international corporations would probably be in a position to mobilise the large sums needed to invest,' says Mr Ferreira do Amaral. 'By deciding on a gradual process of denationalisation we aim to allow more companies, including Portuguese enterprises, to buy into Portugal's telecommunication services.' Besides privatisation of basic telecommunication services, Portugal is rapidly opening up complementary services to private investors. In addition to the private mobile telephone network, three private companies operating paging services will be launched at the end of 1992, to compete with an existing publicly-owned service. Many other new value-added services, including audiotext, videotext, electronic mail, electronic data interchange and videoconferencing, are generating strong interest from entrepreneurs and potential consumers. TLP and other operators are investing heavily in improving the basic telecommunications network in Portugal, partly to facilitate the growth of value-added services. Over the past five years, massive investment, which has been increasing at a rate of 22 per cent a year in real terms, has almost doubled the number of telephones in the country. From only 19 phones per 100 inhabitants in 1985, Portugal will have 30 by the end of 1992. This compares with a growth rate from 41 to 44 for Europe as a whole. In its urban centres, Portugal is nearing the average European rate of 40-45 telephones, with 38 telephones for every 100 people. Mr Ferreira do Amaral describes Portugal's unparalleled spending on telecommunications as 'a singular moment in our country's history,' needed to keep pace with the rapid growth of the Portuguese economy. Portugal's investment in telecommunications, estimated at Es130bn (Pounds 594m) this year alone, is already providing excellent opportunities for international telecom corporations and suppliers. The field for business will open even wider shortly with at least the partial privatisation of three major state-owned telecom operators and the granting of concessions for complementary services. 'No other country in the European Community is investing as much as we are in telecommunications,' says Mr Mello Franco. 'By the end of 1992 we will have converted 51 per cent of the network to digitalised local switching. The number will reach 75 per cent in three years' time.' Portugal is also increasing its fibre-optic networks to improve services and meet the growing demand from banks and similar corporations for private networks and to prepare for the advent of cable television. By 1995 a multi-purpose high-capacity fibre-optic link will join Portugal to Madrid, the Spanish capital, and to the rest of the European fibre-optic network. At the same time it will connect the country's 500 biggest cities and towns with each other.</p>

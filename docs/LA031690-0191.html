			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CAROLE MERLE WINS SUPER G TITLE  </P> <P> Carole Merle of France won the women's last Super G to take the season title in  the event, and Petra Kronberger of Austria virtually clinched the overall crown  by finishing third.  </P> <P> Merle clocked 55.17 seconds today, edging Michaela Gerg of West Germany by .9  seconds.  </P> <P> It was the fifth straight World Cup victory for Merle, who almost decided to  quit the season in late January after a five-month injury break.  </P> <P> Kronberger, who finished .44 behind Merle, netted 15 points and increased her  total to 341 with only two races left of the series. The 21-year-old  Kronberger, who had not won a World Cup race before this season, is almost  certain to become Austria's first women's overall champion since Annemarie  Moser-Proell in 1979.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] As has been reflected in a poll recently devised by  the Studies Center for the New Majority, during the past eight  years the trade unions appear as the principal victims of the  political violence in our country.    The same survey shows that the trade unions are followed by  the news media and the Armed Forces as the preferred targets of  those attacks.  <H5>  The Fluctuations in Violence </H5>   Within the aforementioned period, political violence  increased significantly throughout the second part of  ex-President Raul Alfonsin's administration, and declined  appreciably in 1990, during the term of President Carlos Menem.  It rose the following year, and declined again in both 1992 and  1993.    Based on the type of act whereby the aggression  materialized,  out of a total of 2,033 cases, 1,100 (43 percent) involved  physical attacks; 551 (22 percent), threats; 327 (23 percent),  bombs exploding; 306 (12 percent), shootings; 129 (5 percent),  bombs set that failed to explode; and 67 (3 percent), attacks of  an incendiary type. The remaining 26 (1 percent) belong in the  "others" category, since they cannot be ranked in the  aforementioned categories.    During 1993, there was an obvious heightening of  sociopolitical violence in the months preceding the elections  (July, August, and September). A significant decline occurred in  the final quarter, during which only the incidents that occurred  last December in Santiago del Estero Province demonstrated a  rise in that type of violence.  <H5>  Violence, Not Terrorism </H5>   The poll clearly indicates that the political violence in  Argentina has occurred on a level of harassment and  intimidation. It has not reached the level of terrorist acts, as  has happened in other Latin Latin American countries, such as  Peru and Colombia, or in Spain and Great Britain, on the  European continent.    From a geographical standpoint, it attests to the fact that  the Federal Capital and Buenos Aires Province account for over  80 percent of this type of incident.    Demographic concentration, added to the conglomerate of news  media in that area, help to explain this phenomenon.  bc/SIMMS/nls 22/1445Z Feb</p>

			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Row over rich and poor trains LABOUR yesterday attacked remarks by Mr Roger Freeman, the junior transport minister, proposing that railway operators could run 'a cheap and cheerful service at one moment in the day for the typists and perhaps a more luxurious service for the civil servants and businessmen who might travel in at a slightly different time'. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said: 'This reveals John Major's classless society to be a sham. This is Upstairs Downstairs on trains.' In an interview with London Weekend Television's The London Programme, Mr Freeman said there could eventually be a dozen different classes of commuter travel after the privatisation of British Rail. Commuter services would still have to be subsidised for many years to come, although it should ultimately be possible to run them at a profit. 'There's no reason why what I call a cheap and cheerful service which is a low fare but high density, high occupancy of train should not be profitable,' he said. Mr Freeman ruled out selling off the loss-making Network SouthEast - the busiest commuter network - as a separate entity. Under Mr Freeman's scheme the government would retain the power to regulate fares and prevent private operators closing essential services.</p>

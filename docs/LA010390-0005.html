			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: ENTREPRENEUR WITH PARKING SOLUTION  </P> <P> Loses His Patience in San Francisco  </P> <P> Bill Schwenker did not leave his heart in San Francisco.  </P> <P> The 43-year-old San Diegan thought he had a sure-fire idea for the chronic  parking needs of San Francisco: a West German invention called a Park Lift that  allows cars to be stacked, thus putting, for example, two full-size  Mercedes-Benzes in a one-car garage.  </P> <P> As a former broker for Shearson Lehman in La Jolla and former operator of  fitness parlors in Oceanside, Solana Beach, Escondido and Pacific Beach,  Schwenker also figured he knew something about being insistent and coping  </P> <P> with bureaucracy.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe it," Schwenker said. "I could never get a straight answer  on what permits I'd need and how long it would take. I saw city employees  drinking coffee, reading the newspaper, talking to their friends. One told me  if I really wanted to open a business, I should try Oakland."  </P> <P> The Oct. 17 earthquake, Schwenker concluded, has become an all-purpose excuse  for civic inertia.  </P> <P> In frustration, he wrote to Mayor Art Agnos. Nothing. He wrote to all 11  members of the Board of Supervisors. Nothing times 11.  </P> <P> He tried to call Agnos' $93,000-a-year deputy mayor for parking and  transportation. The $93,000 deputy mayor was out, and his answering machine was  on the fritz.  </P> <P> He wrote a scalding letter ("rudeness is so pervasive that I can only assume it  is city policy") to the San Francisco Examiner. The paper printed his letter on  Christmas but misspelled his name.  </P> <P> Next week, Schwenker will make another run at The City. He has decided that,  although San Francisco is rightfully proud of its highbrow life style, it has  disdain for most business ventures.  </P> <P> Still, he's got a stratagem for getting appointments with important officials,  a way to tweak the interest of even the most lead-bottomed bureaucrat.  </P> <P> He's going to tell them he wants to open a fancy restaurant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> When Less Means More  </P> <P> Here's what I hear.  </P> <P> * Newly elected San Diego Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt has surprised her  council colleagues with a mid-year request for two additional staff members.  </P> <P> Her rationale is interesting: Under the new district elections system I'm  responsible only for my own district. Thus I'm entitled to a larger staff than  my predecessor Ed Struiksma, whose responsibility was citywide.  </P> <P> More for less. If you don't understand the logic, you have a lot to learn about  government.  </P> <P> * The Union-Tribune has a long history of fighting against official secrecy.  The newspapers' attorneys have gone to court a number of times to protect the  public's right to know.  </P> <P> There are limits, however.  </P> <P> The U-T management asked the Newspaper Guild to agree to a news blackout on the  mediation sessions set to begin today. The guild refused.  </P> <P> * The cold and rain have meant an increased number of homeless people seeking  shelter in the downtown library.  </P> <P> On a recent morning, the men's room on the second floor was jammed with  homeless men changing their clothes, shaving and taking sponge baths. Others  were sleeping at reading tables.  </P> <P> * The Naval Academy Glee Club is scheduled for a free public concert Thursday  at the Balboa Park Organ Pavilion. The group has even gone modern, with a rock  'n' roll troupe that promoters promise is "a Naval Academy version of Sha Na  Na."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conservative Verse  </P> <P> Ready for Libertarian poetry? Here's some light-hearted verse from the San  Diego party's recent newsletter:  </P> <P> If you have two apples  </P> <P>  and I have but one  </P> <P>  it's unfair, not right  </P> <P>  undemocratic  </P> <P>  I'll join a union  </P> <P>  or a movement  </P> <P>  start a riot  </P> <P>  and kill you for your extra apple.  </P> <P>  Personally, I prefer "I once knew a liberal from Nantucket . . . "  </P></p>

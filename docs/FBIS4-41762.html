			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert ("AZG", "LRAGIR" dailies), 06/28/94--The  situation at the Karabakh fronts remains unchanged.    According to the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh]  defense army headquarters, the Azeri units continue shelling the  Karabakh defense positions in the Mardakertskiy and Agdamskiy  districts. The Karabakh units have been refraining from  returning the fire.    RMK military reconnaissance reports significant  concentration  and movements of the Azeri manpower and equipment in the  direction of the settlement of Agburun in the Martuninskiy  district.    "The RMK National Security Department has reliable  information about a new offensive, being prepared against  Karabakh by Azerbaijan," said Chairman of the department Kamo  Abrahamyan. He reported that new army summons have started in  Azerbaijan a few days ago. Men of different age groups are  called up to the army. At the same time, new batches of  weaponry, ammunition and food are being received from Turkey and  Ukraine. This all, as well as regrouping of enemy forces at the  fronts is evidence that the Azeri Government is not serious  about CSCE and Russian peace projects.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: NBC forms partnership with Mexican broadcast group NBC, the US network broad-caster, has agreed a partnership with Television Azteca, the recently privatised Mexican broadcaster. The US group also has an option to take a stake of between 10 per cent and 20 per cent in the Mexican company. The deal is the latest example of NBC's globalisation strategy - taking stakes or forming alliances around the world rather than simply selling individual programmes. Last year, NBC acquired Super Channel, the European satellite channel, and last month announced it would be transmitting by satellite into Asia. Initially, the deal with Television Azteca will involve NBC helping with everything from on-air promotions, programme scheduling and technology, to advertising sales and station management. Television Azteca, with its two channels, is challenging the four-channel dominance of Televisa, South America's leading broadcasting group. Mr Tom Rogers, head of NBC Cable and an executive vice-president of NBC, said yesterday that the deal fitted NBC's globalisation strategy, and he saw potential for growth in the Mexican market. Mr Richard Salinas, whose family owns the Elektra Group, a consumer electronics consortium, bought the two networks last July. Channel 7, available in Mexico City, is largely made up of US programmes and aimed at the young. Channel 13, a national channel, specialises in comedy, soap operas, news and sport. The value of Azteca, partly influenced by the NBC deal, is estimated to have risen from about Dollars 650m last year to closer to Dollars 1.2bn. Azteca will be able to offer programmes from NBC and Canal de Noticias, the company's 24-hour-a-day Spanish-language news service, and CNBC, the US company's specialty cable service, as well as locally produced programmes. NBC is making more effort to expand internationally than the main three established US networks - partly because it sees the network business in the US as an increasingly mature business. Mr Salinas said yesterday: 'NBC's name, image, management expertise and relationships will provide a unique opportunity to enhance the value of Television Azteca.'</p>

A newspaper reporter Sin, in Seoul, said when talking with  his colleagues about the situation:    "The dear leader Kim Chong-il with both literary and  military  accomplishments is an iron-willed brilliant commander with an  unshakable faith and a prominent master of politics with a clear  judgement and outstanding leadership ability.    "He is an eminent leader of the international socialist  movement who is guiding the movement for the reconstruction of  socialism in the centre of the world politics, meeting the  challenge of the imperialist allied forces with his matchless  grit and iron will."    An inhabitant of Seoul, showing his colleagues a book  entitled "Lodestar of the Age of Independence," said:    "To have a great leader is the highest honor, pride and  happiness for a country and nation.    "Our people's highest honor and greatest happiness and pride  is that they have sagacious Kim Chong-il as the leader of the  nation. As we have him, the day is sure to come soon when the 70  million Koreans will hail reunification."    A high school teacher in Seoul told his colleagues:    "The dear leader Kim Chong-il is possessed of rare wisdom,  broad magnanimity and noble virtues.    "There is no such great man and prominent leader in history  as the dear leader Kim Chong-il who enjoys undisputed trust from  people for his trust, love and benevolence for them, motivated  by his idea of `believing in the people as in heaven'.    "He is a great hero who leads not only a nation but also the  entire world."</p>

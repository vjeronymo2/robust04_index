			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / The high cost of bad advice: A UK regulator's report which offers hope for victims of a pensions debacle Alan Edge, an unemployed machine-tool fitter in Preston, Lancashire, would not normally pay much attention to the pronouncements of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator. But this week he is on alert for a potentially explosive report from the SIB setting out how tens of thousands of UK investors may be able to claim damages for having been poorly advised when they bought personal pensions. Even moderate estimates for the total compensation start at about Pounds 500m. Mr Edge took out his personal pension in 1990 after losing his job at Leyland Bus, the vehicle company owned by Volvo of Sweden. He was persuaded to transfer a lump sum of Pounds 26,000 from the Leyland pension scheme to a new personal pension. Mr Edge is unsure whether he made the right move - despite long discussions with the financial adviser who recommended the transfer and who has since assured him that the advice was good. Mr Edge, aged 52, plans to start drawing his pension in three years but is worried that when he does so, the cash could be significantly less than if he had left the lump sum in the Leyland scheme. 'When I made the move, all the pressure was on me to switch into a new pension; no one told me about the potential advantages of staying put,' he said. The SIB report, which will be published tomorrow, is expected to give Mr Edge the prospect that his case will be looked at again. The report, anxiously awaited by the retail financial services sector from the largest life insurers to the smallest independent financial advisers, will set out guidelines for compensating people who have been wrongly sold personal pensions. 'I've been in various financial crises, and I've never seen anything as messy or as big as this,' one senior industry figure said. It was late last year that a pilot study by accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick first raised the possibility that large numbers of people had been 'mis-sold' personal pensions on transferring a lump sum from a former employer's scheme. More than 500,000 pension transfers have been sold since they became available in 1988. The KPMG study suggested that in nine out of 10 cases, the recommendation to transfer to a personal pension had not been based on adequate information. Concern then spread to cases where people had opted out of an occupational scheme run by their employer to buy a personal pension. The resulting widespread public concern about the standards of pension sales agents has led to a sharp drop in the sales of personal pensions. The life companies now also face higher costs in meeting the tougher regulatory standards - to prevent the 'mis-selling' of pensions in the future - which the SIB announced in March. However, it is the question of how to provide compensation for past mistakes, the subject of tomorrow's report, that most exercises life companies and advisers. Despite widespread consultation on its contents, there is likely to be opposition to the SIB's proposals, with at least one of the large life companies considering a legal challenge to test whether they are bound to comply with the regulator's proposals. Life companies' concerns about what they expect from the SIB cover not only compensation payments but the process of spotting cases that should qualify for compensation. With cases of transfers out of former employers' pension schemes, the priority will be to review the cases of people who have already retired and those close to retirement. Others will be dealt with over a longer period. The total compensation for transfer cases may not, however, be the industry's biggest problem. There are circumstances in which taking a pension transfer was the right thing to do. Even where financial advice was not valid, the compensation involved could be relatively small. 'In transfers, even where the decision was based on bad advice, the difference is fairly marginal,' according to an industry expert. The most contentious issues now surround what to do about pension opt-outs, where people taking out a personal pension might have done better in their employer's pension scheme. One problem is identifying cases of 'mis-selling' in such circumstances. The number is thought to be much smaller than the number of transfers, but they are hard to pick out from files which may not show whether someone buying a personal pension was eligible to join a company pension scheme. The SIB is expected to say that all employed people who bought personal pensions since 1988 must be contacted, to see whether they were eligible for occupational pension scheme membership. This would be a massive and expensive exercise, particularly for individuals and companies which have poor records. A second problem is definition. While someone who has left an employer's scheme to take a personal pension is clearly an 'opt out', there are some personal pension holders who were - or would have become - eligible to join a company scheme. Whether a sales agent or adviser checked eligibility and advised staying out and taking a personal pension instead, could be decisive elements in assessing how much compensation should be paid. Ms Susanne Long, a 30-year-old marketing manager at the UK subsidiary of US computer company International Business Machines, is a 'non-joiner'. She started a personal pension in 1989, even though she had the option of joining an occupational scheme with her employer. She is now claiming compensation from the life company, saying it should have told her then that a better choice would have been to join the occupational scheme. The compensation for such cases could be enormous where the person affected is still with the same employer. They would need enough money to match the lost pension rights and reflect benefits for future years' service. On this issue, there is a crumb of comfort for the life companies. The National Association of Pension Funds is encouraging occupational schemes to allow people who have opted out to rejoin for future service. If this advice is followed, the life companies and advisers may still have to provide compensation to make up for the years missed. But they would not face the prospect of having to provide a defined set of benefits many years hence. While the life companies are struggling with such identification and compensation problems, the task may be almost impossible for thousands of small independent financial advisers. Among regulators and the big life companies, there is an assumption that large numbers of small advisers, with few staff and relatively little capital, will be forced out of business by the task. There is also the problem of dealing with pensions sold by independent advisers who no longer exist. A unit is being set up by the Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect the private investor, to review such cases. The bill will have to be picked up by the rest of the financial services sector, where those who have not sold pensions will resist attempts to involve them. Even with the publication of the SIB report, the scale of pensions 'mis-selling' will remain unknown. And it will take a long time for the industry and its customers to put the issue behind them. 'I am embarrassed by the episode,' said a former marketing director who took a pension transfer which he now believes could need a large top-up. 'I was greedy and took poor advice. I want the SIB report to outline a way I can back into my old scheme as quickly and as painlessly as possible.' Whatever the SIB says, the process is unlikely to be quick or painless enough for anyone involved.</p>

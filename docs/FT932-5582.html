			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Rise in late construction payments MORE THAN 60 per cent of construction contracts are paid late, according to a study to be published this week. The findings, which indicate that late payments owed to construction suppliers last year totalled Pounds 19bn, will give fresh impetus to demands from government and business organisations for companies to improve their payment performance. The Confederation of British Industry has said late payment is one of the main causes of business failures. The Institute of Directors last week called for improved court procedures to help small companies fighting to get paid on time. Construction Intelligence Data, an independent research and credit rating organisation, has examined the experiences of about 1,000 sub-contractors. Its findings, to be published this week, show that the record of construction companies, renowned as some of the worst payers in UK industry, has deteriorated even further in the past 12 months. According to the findings the proportion of contracts involving late payments jumped from an average of 45 per cent in the year to March 31 1992 to more than 60 per cent in the following 12 months. It is estimated that 90 per cent, or Pounds 31.5bn, of the Pounds 35bn spent annually on construction in the UK is channelled through specialist sub-contractors. Sub-contractors say that financially hard-pressed main contractors are holding on to cash as long as possible instead of passing on payments from developers and building owners to the sub-contractors actually doing the work. Their biggest concern is that contractors may fail before making payments. In these circumstances sub-contractors which have already spent money doing work can quickly follow the main contractor into receivership. The findings show that the average number of days for which payment was delayed, after the date agreed in the contract, had risen from 13 to 28 since the end of March last year. They also show that main contractors were automatically deducting discounts designed to encourage prompt payments, even when payments were late. Almost three quarters of late payments had discounts incorrectly deducted. It is estimated that nearly Pounds 350m had been incorrectly deducted, based on an average discount of 2.5 per cent of the contract value. The researchers say the number of sub-contractors starting legal action against late or incorrect payment had risen sharply.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- The Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) said Friday [28 January]  it will ease a rule limiting installment plans for credit cards  as part of the government's deregulation policy.    Starting from April 1, the range of stores allowed to be  members of such payment plans will be expanded gradually for  credit cards issued by distributors and manufacturers, MITI  officials said. At present, agents that can handle installment  plans for card issuers in the two sectors are limited to stores  in which the issuer has a 20 percent stake or more.    Under the new step, the scope will be expanded to include  stores having any ratio of capital relations with an issuer,  those with a franchising contract with an issuer and those  agreeing to use a shop name designated by an issuer and agreeing  to sell goods produced by the issuer, the officials said.    Convenience stores affiliated with supermarket chains and  sales outlets of electrical appliance makers will be allowed to  engage in installment plans under the new rule, they said. The  measure is one of 94 deregulation items envisaged in the  government's pump-priming package released in September last  year. The rule restricting installment plans will be completely  abolished in April 1995, they added.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL COMES CHARGING OUT OF THE STARTING GATES  </P> <P> In its first time at bat Wednesday, the National apparently hit a grand slam as  residents of Los Angeles, New York and Chicago raced to buy the first daily  newspaper to take sports from the back pages to the front page -- and every  other one, too.  </P> <P> The National's Los Angeles bureau chief, Steve Clow, said the paper's West Los  Angeles office has been barraged with telephone calls from people searching for  copies of the tabloid.  </P> <P> "We've gotten a lot of calls from people who want it and can't get it," Clow  said. "The only thing I know is I threw my daughter in the car at 7:15 this  morning, went down to the newsstand . . . and the guy had only three left" of  150 papers delivered early Wednesday.  </P> <P> The National, which printed 250,000 copies Wednesday, sold out at more than  1,500 newsstands in New York and Chicago, but results were not yet available  for Los Angeles, said Steve Hammond, the National's spokesman in New York.  </P> <P> In New York and Chicago, the National is being carried primarily at newsstands.  But in far-flung, car-dependent Los Angeles, the company is relying more on  retail outlets, such as 7-Elevens and liquor stores, as well as newspaper  vending machines, said circulation director Diane Morgenthaler.  </P> <P> In addition, thousands of copies of the National were handed out free Wednesday  throughout Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Sales were brisk Wednesday at about 2,200 outlets in Los Angeles County, said  Dick Mader, whose Culver City-based Mader News handles distribution of the  National in much of the county. It is also being sold in Orange County and  small sections of Riverside and Ventura counties.  </P> <P> "We got 35,000 copies," Mader said. "We probably could have sold double what we  got."  </P> <P> But bets are still being placed on whether the National's eagle logo will enjoy  a long flight.  </P> <P> "We're selling them by the handful," said Max, owner of Centerfold News in the  Fairfax District, who declined to give his full name. But he added that many  probably are being purchased for souvenirs. "There are a lot of people who buy  the first of everything hoping it will be worth three times as much in 10  years."  </P></p>

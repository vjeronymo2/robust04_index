They were addressing the opening session of the Second  National Women Workers Committee of the All-China Federation of  Trade Unions (ACFTU).    Xue Zhaojun, vice-chairman of the ACFTU, presided over the  meeting and was elected chairman of the Second Women Workers  Committee.    The National Women Workers Committee directly under the  ACFTU  was founded in 1991. So far, similar committees have been set  up in all the 30 provinces, autonomous regions and  municipalities across the country.    According to statistics from ten of the provinces, the  economic returns created by women workers over the past five  years amounted to 4.3 billion yuan. This came about because  women workers provided 3.87 million suggestions, increased  productivity, practiced economy and carried out technical  innovations.    The meeting called for close attention to be paid to  protecting the legal rights and special interests of women  workers, and to raising their abilities.    Wei Jianxing, chairman of the ACFTU, and other union leaders  also attended and made speeches at today's meeting.</p>

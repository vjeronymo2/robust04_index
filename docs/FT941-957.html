			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Venezuelan rebel released from jail The Venezuelan army officer who led an unsuccessful military uprising against the government in early 1992 and became a popular political hero was released from jail at the weekend after President Rafael Caldera had ordered a halt to all court martial proceedings against him. On his release, Lt-Col Hugo Chavez Frias, who has resigned from the army, told hundreds of supporters he would work with his own organisation 'to gain political power' and 'to show political schemers how a nation should achieve its true destiny'. He also warned it would be 'risky' to talk about another coup d'etat in Venezuela. The rebel leader's release forms part of a political 'pacification' by the president, who took office in February. He has ordered charges dropped against officers facing courts martial over the 1992 military uprisings, which left 300 dead. Fewer than 20 officers are still behind bars because of the coup attempts, and a group of officers is in exile in Peru. Lt-Col Chavez headed a rebellion against the government of President Carlos Andres Perez, who survived two coup attempts in 1992 but was forced to leave office in 1993 to face corruption charges. Reuter reports from Lima: Thirty-four of the exiled Venezuelan officers left Peru yesterday on a Venezuelan air force flight after talks with negotiators sent to Lima by President Caldera. Sixteen Venezuelan officers remain exiled in Peru.</p>

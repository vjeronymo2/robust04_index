			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 10 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government  today approved the bill which, in accordance with demands of  ethnic minorities and Slovakia's commitments towards the Council  of Europe, will introduce the use of bilingual  (Slovak-Hungarian) geographical signs in regions with strong  Hungarian minority population. If the law is passed by  Parliament, towns and villages in which ethnic minority makes up  at least 20 percent of the population will have bilingual signs.    Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner told journalists after a  cabinet meeting that the law would concern some 560 towns and  villages. Their names in the ethnic minority languages would be  set down in a special list. Deputy Premier Ivan Simko said that  the names had been studied by experts but Hungarian minority  parties had not been asked for their views as they would be able  to express them in Parliament.    The Slovak Parliament rejected the "names law" this January  with Hungarian deputies also voting against it because only  towns and villages with a 30 percent minority population would  have had the right to a bilingual name. There have also been  disputes about the very names in the Hungarian, with the Slovak  side trying to avoid names reminiscent of the Hungarization of  Slovakia in the past century or of Horthy's occupation of  southern Slovakia during World War Two.    The dispute over the law on names culminated with taking  down  of signs with the Hungarian names of towns and villages in  southern Slovakia last October, ordered by former Minister of  Transport and Communications Roman Hofbauer on the basis of a  1990 law which did not allow bilingual signs generally used  during the first Czechoslovak Republic. The Council of Europe  recommended that the Slovak Republic settle the dispute by  legislative means. Pittner said today that the bill approved by  the government met the demands set by the Council of Europe and  corresponded to the Slovak Constitution.    The Slovak Government also complied with the demands of the  half-million Hungarian minority last week, when it approved the  bill enabling ethnic minority members to use first names and  surnames in their original form. Hungarian women would not have  to add the Slovak -ova suffix to their surnames. The passage of  such a bill, which is to be approved by Parliament, is one of  Slovakia's most important commitments towards the Council of  Europe. The fulfillment of these commitments is to be assessed  by the CE Secretariat at its meeting on May 17 in Warsaw.</p>

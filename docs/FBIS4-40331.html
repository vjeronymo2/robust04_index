			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Kulagin] </F>   [Text] Almaty 15 June TASS -- A Kazakhstan Foreign Ministry  statement, circulated here on Wednesday, expresses the  Republic's concern over the situation on the Korean peninsula.  The situation has become seriously aggravated in view of North  Korea's decision to withdraw from the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA).    "Thus, another spiral has been added to the crisis which was  brought on by that country's withdrawal from the treaty on  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," the statement said.    Actions taken by North Korea of late "do not give grounds to  affirm that the country lacks a military nuclear programme," the  statement stressed.    "Emergence of nuclear weapons in the northern part of the  peninsula would pose a serious threat to both regional and  global stability and security.    "This is why Kazakhstan, which has joined the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as a non-nuclear state, and which  comes out in favour of strict compliance with the NPT regime  calls on North Korea to resume dialogue with the world community  to avoid a further exacerbation of the situation concerning the  nuclear problem on the peninsula", the statement said.    The Kazakhstan Foreign Ministry, positively appraising  Russia's proposals to convene an international conference on  security and on nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, with  the participation of North and South Korea, the United States,  China, Japan, and Russia, as well as U.N. Security Council and  IAEA representatives, urged all the sides concerned to show a  constructive approach with a view to settling the situation.</p>

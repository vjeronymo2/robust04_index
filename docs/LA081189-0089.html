			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRANSFORMER EXPLODES, SLOWS HIGHWAY TRAFFIC  </P> <P> An electrical transformer exploded in Newhall Thursday, leaving 2,500 customers  without power and snarling rush-hour traffic for more than an hour, the Los  Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported.  </P> <P> No one was injured in the 5 p.m. explosion at Placerita Canyon Road and Sierra  Highway, Sgt. Tom Davidheiser said. Cars were backed up for more than two miles  along Sierra Highway while deputies directed traffic because traffic signals  lost power, Davidheiser said.  </P> <P> Power was restored about 6 p.m., said Rosalie Gnam, Santa Clarita Valley area  manager for the Southern California Edison Co. The explosion was apparently  caused by a bird that flew into the pole-mounted transformer, she said.  </P></p>

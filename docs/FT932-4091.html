			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / World Trade News: US to re-ignite row on aircraft subsidies THE transatlantic trade dispute over commercial aircraft subsidies is set to flare up again on the eve of the Paris Air Show, the world's biggest, with growing signs that the US is seeking to lower the ceiling for direct government subsidies for new airliner programmes from 33 per cent to 20 per cent. The Clinton administration appears increasingly intent in renegotiating the bilateral agreement reached last year between the US and the European Commission on aircraft subsidies which fixed the 33 per cent ceiling on direct government subsidies for new aircraft programmes. Senior officials of the European Airbus consortium yesterday claimed during a Financial Times aerospace conference that the US was now trying to use a clause in the 1992 agreement calling for multilateralisation of the bilateral accord in which the subsidy ceiling would be reduced to 20 per cent. This is regarded by Airbus as a transparent attempt by the US to put into question the original bilateral agreement, which took five years to negotiate, while making no additional concessions on the level of indirect funding that the US aerospace industry receives. In the 1992 agreement, the amount of indirect subsidies were capped at 3 per cent of the annual turnover of the country's aerospace industry. Mr Wolfgang Piller, executive vice president of Deutsche Aerospace, one of the four Airbus partners, told the conference that the Europeans were now demanding 'complete transparency' from the US over its indirect support to its aerospace companies. 'The Europeans have a real handicap in that they are unable, at the present time, to match the indirect subsidies of the US, which, according to some estimates, amount to about Dollars 1bn a year,' he said. He described the Clinton Administration's stand on the aircraft subsidy issue as 'hypocritical and unfair'. The US has consistently attacked government subsidies for the Airbus programme as unfairly damaging US commercial aerospace companies, especially at a time when the whole industry was in recession. In recent years, Airbus has been aggressively increasing its penetration of the US airliner market. Other Airbus executives expressed concern over the latest US moves which they feel are designed to undermine the European consortium's efforts to develop a new very large aircraft, which would challenge Boeing's dominance of the jumbo market. The Airbus officials said the EC was expected to reject outright the latest US proposals to multilateralise the bilateral aircraft subsidy agreement. The original idea was to extend the agreement to cover other aerospace manufacturing countries, notably Japan. But the Airbus executives said if the US sought to use this process as a ploy to renegotiate the subsidy ceilings in the bilateral agreement, the EC would simply oppose the multilateralisation of the accord. Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine manufacturer, also noted that the US had so far refused to consider extending the aircraft subsidy agreement to cover aero-engines. The UK group said this reflected the fact that its two big US aero-engine rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, received significant more support from their government than Rolls-Royce.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- When answering a  reporter's questions today, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman  Wu Jianmin said: The attitude expressed by Japanese Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata in his oral message to Premier Li Peng on  his determination to prevent past unfortunate history from being  repeated is "sensible."    At today's news conference, a reporter asked: Has the  Chinese side received Prime Minister Hata's letter to Chinese  leaders? Does the Chinese side have any comments on Prime  Minister Hata's letter and on his inaugural address?    Wu Jianmin said: Japanese Ambassador to China Kunihiro  Michihiko conveyed to Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan  on 10 May an oral message from Prime Minister Hata to Premier Li  Peng on the remarks made by former Japanese Justice Minister  Shigeto Nagano in which Nagano distorted the history of Japanese  aggression against China. We have noticed Prime Minister Hata's  profound introspection concerning Japan's past aggression and  colonial rule that inflicted unbearable suffering on many  peoples. He indicated that past history shall be treated  correctly and that the young generation shall be educated with  the correct historical views. He is also determined to prevent  the past unfortunate history from being repeated.    Wu Jianmin said: "We believe Prime Minister Hata's attitude  is sensible and is in accordance with the trend of history, and  we appreciate his attitude."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Aida Ruales de Laso, the wife of the Putumayo State  governor, has been released after being held captive for 72  hours by a new guerrilla group. According to reports from  authorities, apparently a new subversive group calling itself  the Putumayo Liberation Organization [Organizacion Para la  Liberacion de Putumayo], whose members are EPL [Popular  Liberation Army] dissidents, was responsible for the kidnapping.  The objective of the guerrillas was to obtain money to  strengthen their movement economically.    [Begin Ruales de Laso recording] I told them this was not  the  way to help the country. I told them that if we all worked  together, but not the way they are doing things, Putumayo would  advance. [end recording]</p>

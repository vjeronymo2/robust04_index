			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme </F> Council of Ukraine, by Anatoliy Mykhaylenko; place and date not  given: " 'To Survive, Mankind Must Master the Lessons of  Chernobyl' -- Said Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch in a  Conversation with our Correspondent"]    [Text]    [Mykhaylenko] Ivan Stepanovych! Eight years have passed  since  the day of the tragedy that affected not only all of Ukraine,  but, as we now know, the entire planet. Much has been said about  Chernobyl, but not everything. As chairman of the Kiev Oblast  Executive Committee at the time, you took part in liquidating  the effects of the accident from the very first day. However, in  all these years, you have virtually kept silent, only rarely  referring to your participation. In light of all that we now  know about Chernobyl and in light of the office that you held,  is it not time to return to those days in April of 1986?    [Plyushch] I remember the first fire I ever saw. This was  after the war, and it was my aunt's house that was burning. The  memory of that fire has stayed with me all my life. Since that  time, I have known the rules at work at a fire. First, there is  the superstitious belief that you must not take anything from  the site of the fire because it brings bad luck. Second, people  rush to a fire to help: to carry water, or to beat down the  fire, but not to stand by and pass judgment. And no one I knew  ever bragged that he had done the most to put out a fire. In  other words, when that terrible Chernobyl fire, that global  catastrophe, broke out, the first thing we had to do was to put  it out.    I think that everything that has been said and written about  Chernobyl consists of first impressions and does not tell the  whole truth. These things do not begin to explain the real  meaning of Chernobyl, why it happened, and what needs to be done  to make sure that nothing like it ever happens again.    [Mykhaylenko] Do you believe that the whole truth will be  told in our generation's lifetime?    [Plyushch] That will depend on the direction in which our  society moves. If it evolves in the direction set down in the  Declaration on the State Sovereignty of Ukraine, I am certain  that we will still have the opportunity to say and write and  hear the whole truth. Above all, about the real causes and  effects of this accident. I urge you to read Vitaliy Sklyarov's  book, And Tomorrow There Was Chernobyl. I wrote a  foreword to the book, in which I stressed the service that  Sklyarov performed by describing the Chernobyl problems. As a  citizen and a professional, as a person who was in Chernobyl  from the very beginning, he told the truth. We were there  together, getting covered with radioactive dust together and  washing it off together at the bathhouse of the rayon electric  power system.    [Mykhaylenko] Perhaps I was not completely accurate when I  said that you have kept silent all these years. Undoubtedly,  many people remember the speech you made at a session of the  Supreme Council of Ukraine on 16 February 1990 during the  discussion about the ecological situation in Ukraine. You spoke  of Chernobyl in a way that none of the party or state leaders of  the time dared to speak. In effect, you accused the then  existing system from a high tribune of causing Chernobyl to  happen. Were you not afraid to say this at the time?    [Plyushch] After a tragedy of that magnitude, after  everything I had seen and experienced firsthand at Chernobyl,  there was nothing left to fear. Following a meeting of the  Government Commission in Chernobyl that ended in the early hours  of 1 May 1986, I had to return to Kiev because a blood test  showed that the dose of Roentgens I had received exceeded  acceptable levels. Shcherbyna, the commission's chairman,  surprised me by saying to me: "Ivan, you have turned out to be a  weakling." Not understanding the real meaning of his words, I  took his remark as a verdict that meant the end of me.    By fall, my blood had returned to normal, and on 15  September  I took up the watch a second time, this time to put the  ill-fated third reactor in service. It had to be put into  operation by the October anniversary celebrations no matter  what. To make it appear as if nothing had actually happened at  Chernobyl.    Thus, anyone who experienced Chernobyl firsthand, anyone who  went through the hell there, has nothing left to fear...    [Mykhaylenko] Let us return to your speech at the session.  You said: "The Chernobyl accident was not an elemental calamity.  There are specific culprits involved who should pay for the  losses they caused." You then went on to name those responsible  for the accident: the specific Union ministries and departments  -- the Ministry of the Nuclear Power Industry, the Ministry of  Energy, and the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Did these  entities ever attempt to compensate the losses they caused, be  it even partially?    [Plyushch] If we had lived in a civilized, rule-of-law  state,  then the departments which had run the nuclear power station for  many years and earned large profits from it would have been  compelled to pay for the losses. But the situation was quite  different in the society in which we then lived. Although it was  operated under Kiev's jurisdiction for the benefit of the whole  Union and a number of foreign countries, the station did not  contribute a single kopeck into the oblast budget. The local  authorities had to carry out the station management's demands  unconditionally and provide everything that was necessary for  the maintenance of its personnel. We were all the station's  drudges -- the Prypyat city authorities, the oblast authorities,  and even the republican government. Even Kiev had no  jurisdication over the Chernobyl AES. The station's managers  feared only the Central Committee, because this body could expel  them from the CPSU and that meant that it would take a long time  to find another job. They disregarded all other authority.    When we were in the former Union, we worried where to get  the  one billion karbovantsi we needed to provide medical care for  the residents of Kiev Oblast and to meet the needs of public  education. This program cost 1.7 billion karbovantsi in the  prices of the time. For a long time, we did not know where this  money would come from. But when the Chernobyl disaster occurred,  just in 1986 alone, close to 9 billion karbovantsi disappeared  seemingly without a trace to cover the costs of liquidating the  effects of the accident. For that, the money was found... But  that was for putting out the fire as soon as possible.    Thus, no one in Ukraine believed that anyone would  compensate  us for the losses we had suffered. Although the economy of the  former Union was strong, and it was easier to liquidate the  effects of the accident then than it is now.    Ukraine's national economy is only rising to its feet,  whereas, according to our modest and far from complete  estimates, the work that needs to be done requires over 15  percent of the budget annually. This would be too much to handle  even for developed countries.    Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to  apologize  to the people who suffered losses and for whom the state is  unable to show the concern they deserve. No matter how difficult  things are for them, I ask them to be patient and be assured  that as the national economy grows, the appropriations for their  needs will also grow. Because it is hopeless to count on any  significant aid from the outside world at this time. Of course,  the European and world community, which is showing some interest  in providing humanitarian assistance in liquidating the effects  of the accident, could do more to help us in our trouble...    [Mykhaylenko] At that same session, you spoke of the need  for  an integrated state program involving large-scale scientific,  medical, and socioeconomic measures. How urgent are these  problems today, eight years later?    [Plyushch] Just as urgent as they were then. This program  was  developed and is being implemented. But we lack the funds to  finance it adequately. I was present at a meeting of the Council  of Europe in Strasbourg when they discussed the safety of the  population that had suffered the effects of the Chernobyl  catastrophe. Leading specialists from the International Atomic  Energy Agency had prepared a thick volume of documents. But in  their speeches, they argued that no definite conclusions had  been reached whether, for example, it is safe for children to  live in Kiev.    I said to them: "There are nearly 70 of you here, discussing  a painful issue. After listening to the experts, you have  reached the conclusion that science has so far not demonstrated  that living in Kiev poses a danger to children. Yet we have no  idea how this will affect their health in the future. Which of  you will volunteer to go and live there yourself or send his  children?" Everyone present at the meeting smiled sadly. I then  said to them: I beg you not to draw any more such conclusions,  because they are inhuman and cruel. Just because there is no  money for financing assistance at this time does not mean that  we need to prove that this program is unnecessary. No, we need  to make an effort and look for funds. I believe that our public  organizations need to be more persistent in their appeals to  developed European countries and to other countries of the world  for help -- at least in providing medical treatment for children.    [Mykhaylenko] Four years ago you said that sympathy had been  dulled for people who require maximum consideration and  kindness. Has this insensitivity not increased even further with  time?    [Plyushch] We have been brought up in the spirit of  conducting campaigns. There were sowing campaigns, harvesting  campaigns, meetings, celebrations, anniversaries, etc. And once  these were over, we forgot about them. But Chernobyl is the kind  of tragedy that only grows more painful with time. Even back  then, in 1986, not all of those who should have been sensitive  to human pain by virtue of the offices they held exhibited such  sensitivity.    Only some five months after the accident, they were forcing  us to return the people evacuated from 14 settlements to their  homes. We returned people to two villages, but not the rest. I  was crucified for this by high-ranking officials. I remember  Col. Gen. Kozlov, who insisted at the time: "The commission  members have already drunk water from the well, and yet you keep  putting off bringing the people back into the zone." I told him:  "We will not send the people back until we are sure that it is  safe for them to live there." And we did not bring them back...    Naturally, all wounds heal with time. But Chernobyl is not  an  ordinary wound. This is the first wound of its kind in the  history of mankind. It will hurt even more, and it will fester.  Most radioactive elements need dozens of years to decay. The  results will be known in about seventy or eighty years. It is  our unlucky lot to be hostages of the atom, to be subjects of  the largest ever experiment -- to determine the effects of  radiation on man and on the rising generation.    The tragic experience of Ukraine, which has been burned by  nuclear fire, is not solely our internal affair. To survive,  mankind must master the lessons of Chernobyl.    [Mykhaylenko] Yes, Chernobyl is a phenomenon of worldwide  significance. But in all likelihood Ukraine will be left to  fight its aftermath on her own. Speaking at the UN conference on  the environment and development in Rio de Janeiro on 12 June  1992, you urged: "Let us make of Chernobyl a sphere of global  partnership and joint actions to decontaminate the destroyed  reactor at the Chernobyl AES, to decontaminate large territories  of land and water sources, to bury the radioactive wastes, and  to solve the painful human problems resulting from this  catastrophe." There was also an appeal from the president of  Ukraine to create an International Chernobyl Fund. Did the world  hear these appeals?    [Plyushch] I have not missed a single opportunity when  travelling abroad to broach some aspect of the Chernobyl  problem. Just as I did at the international environmental forum  in Rio de Janeiro, which was attended by representatives from  118 countries. These included such prominent world leaders as  Bush, Major, Demirel, Mitterand, Castro... I cannot say that the  world has remained indifferent. We received assistance. Although  it was not always used in the best way possible. But these  issues need to be repeated and raised at every European and  world meeting in order to draw public attention to Chernobyl so  that the world not grow complacent.    I would like to say some kind words about Cuba. This country  is going through a difficult time. But the old popular saying  still holds: a poor man is more generous. Cuba has assisted  Ukraine in the past and is still providing assistance in the  form of medical treatment for our children. We are sincerely  grateful for this. I do not want to say that the rich are not  helping, but their possibilities are much greater than Cuba's.    [Mykhaylenko] You stated that humanitarian aid is not always  used in the best way.    [Plyushch] Our legislation requires that all aid be  distributed under public supervision. The public organizes  unions and elects the leaderships of these unions. When any kind  of abuse is discovered, we look for someone in these unions to  put things in order. These public organizations and the leaders  of these organizations must be held accountable for any abuses  that occur.    [Mykhaylenko] Such expressions as "before Chernobyl" and  "after Chernobyl" have become part of popular usage. Just as  once we had "before the war" and "after the war." What does this  boundary mean to you personally?    [Plyushch] In my mind, this boundary has two dimensions. The  first is that nuclear energy is a Satanic form of energy. I am  convinced that Ukraine has not exploited all her available  natural resources in order to not have dangerous nuclear  reactors on her territory. Chernobyl was like a cold shower that  sobered us up. If it had not brought us to our senses, there  would be new reactors and nuclear power plants going up in  hernobyl, Crimea, and other places. In Odessa, there were plans  to heat buildings using water from the nuclear heat and power  station. Anatoliy Petrovych Aleksandrov used to say: the time is  not far off when even peasant houses will be heated with nuclear  fuel. Thank God that we never got that far.    The second dimension is that we feel the breath of Chernobyl  every day on our health...    [Mykhaylenko] Speaking of global problems, it would be  interesting to hear more of your firsthand impressions of the  events in which you were personally involved during those  terrible days.    [Plyushch] I heard the news of the accident at two o'clock  in  the morning at my dacha. They telephoned to tell me that a fire  had broken out at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. It just  so happened that a civil defense exercise had been planned for  the next morning throughout the oblast!    I thought that perhaps the telephone call was part of the  exercise, and so I rang the oblast administration of internal  affairs. They confirmed that there had indeed been a fire at the  fourth reactor but that the fire brigades had arrived and the  fire had been put out. When I arrived at the oblast executive  committee, I called the civil defense headquarters. They  informed me that they were determining the scope of the fire and  the degree of danger.    At seven o'clock in the morning, we were gathered together  by  the first secretary of the oblast party committee and assigned  our tasks in the planned civil defense exercise. Carrying out my  assignment, I started out for the rayon where the reserve  administration center was located. Instead of going to  Chernobyl, we traveled in the opposite direction. When I reached  Kaharlyk, I received a message that Shcherbyna, the chairman of  the Government Commission, and other commission members were  flying out of Moscow, and that I had been included in this group  and should return immediately [to Kiev], meet them at the  airport, and accompany them to the zone of the accident.    I did as ordered. From Zhulyany to Chernobyl, I rode in the  same car with Academician Valeriy Oleksandrovych Lehasov, Borys  Yevdokymovych Shcherbyna -- God rest their souls -- and Mykola  Fedorovych Nikolayevych, the deputy chairman of the Council of  Ministers of Ukraine. In Prypyat, we familiarized ourselves with  the situation. At seven o'clock that evening, we held the first  meeting of the Government Commission.    Shcherbyna reported to the highest leadership in Moscow that  everything was normal, that the people were reacting normally,  that several weddings had been held. At the same time, just in  case, preparations were being made to evacuate the residents.  Unfortunately, we were lying to ourselves and to the people. Not  deliberately lying. Incidentally, the evacuation was conducted  not because of radioactive contamination or radiation, but in  case the reactor should explode. If there had been complete  certainty that it would not explode, there probably would have  been no evacuation.    This tragedy, more than anything, showed the "advantages" of  our administrative-command, totalitarian system. On the one  hand, a crudely low standard of technical design and equipment,  and, on the other hand, a wholly unwarranted lack of concern and  an irresponsible attitude towards people. Had anyone known that  the time would come when they would be held responsible, no one  would have built such stations...    [Mykhaylenko] You spent a lot of time in all at the station  and in the zone, did you not?    [Plyushch] I think I spent a total of eighty-seven days at  Chernobyl. A lot of days and a lot of Roentgents...    [Mykhaylenko] What do you think of the books about  Chernobyl?    [Plyushch] I have tried to read the authors I know and whom  I  believe. I have no time to read books by those who wrote on the  basis of the accounts of others. I recall one brochure by a  doctor of physico-mathematical sciences who was also there from  the first day. What he wrote was not long, but it was the truth.  He also mentions me. He describes that the chairman of the  oblast executive committee was extremely economical and did not  understand what was happening around him. To load the sand they  were using to put out the fire in the reactor, the helicopters  were landing on the clover. This was early spring, the grass had  grown beautifully, and I ran around begging: "Careful, you'll  trample a lot of grass!" I knew how badly the farms needed this  grass. The author describes this with goodnatured irony. But  this fact itself shows that we did not realize the real scale of  the accident at the time.    [Mykhaylenko] There is frequent mention these days of the  notorious May Day demonstration held that year. They blame its  organizers... You remember it too?    [Plyushch] I do... I left Chernobyl at one o'clock in the  morning of 1 May and arrived in Kiev sometime after three  o'clock. In the morning, I was standing on the official  reviewing stand, and it seemed to me that the tower on the trade  unions building was swaying the entire time... I stood there  until the demonstration was over and then went to the  polyclinic...    Today we know that these festivities harmed people. But how  could we have known this at the time, if a top ranking official  in the USSR civil defense force reported at the meeting of the  Government Commission: "Two buildings have already been washed  down in Prypyat, there is zero radiation, the people can be  brought back." Specialists and officials were sending such  reports both to Kiev and to Moscow...    [Mykhaylenko] On what note would you like to conclude this  conversation about the planet's greatest tragedy?    [Plyushch] Let us pray to God that the people of Ukraine and  the world never experience another Chernobyl or anything like it.</p>

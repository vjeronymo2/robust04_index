			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Grand Met firm Big turnover in Grand Metropolitan ahead of interim results next week increased speculation that the stock may have turned the corner following the shares' recent poor run. They have underperformed the market by 8 per cent in the last quarter, weakened by sentiment over branded goods, uncertainty over a US drinks tax, and the decline in the dollar. Around half of group profits are earned in the US currency. Yesterday, SGST became the latest broker to turn positive on the stock, citing economic recovery in the US and UK and the shares low rating. NatWest Securities, BZW and Kleinwort Benson were also pointing out the stock's potential upside. Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest said Grand Met was the only group in the drinks sector likely to show earnings growth this year, yet was on the lowest rating. In a weak drinks sector, the shares rose 8 to 423p in turnover of 7.1m. Additional speculative support was leant in the morning session as Grand Met became the latest name to be linked with United Biscuits. Shares in the food manufacturer, which has been the subject of intense takeover activity in recent weeks, jumped sharply but faded to close a penny ahead at 421p. More takeover talk in the drinks sector was rekindled in old favourites Boddington and Devenish. Boddington was rumoured to be casting its eye on the brewing group it failed to capture in June 1991 but in which it retains a 19.1 per cent stake. Boddington then bid 210p-a-share, and yesterday Devenish closed steady at 300p, leading drinks specialists to suggest a 350p-a-share fresh bid which would be required was too expensive and out of Boddington's reach. Its shares finished 3 ahead at 271p. Vodafone continued to outperform the telecoms sector, the shares racing up 13 1/2 to 393 1/2 p, after 397p and threatening the 400p barrier according to dealers, as the market continued to assess the impressive new subscriber figures for April - the highest for three years. Turnover,in Vodafone was 10m shares, the heaviest single-day's trade for almost a year. A series of profits upgrades in now being predicted after the group announces what are expected to be good figures on June 8. Mr Patrick Wellington at NatWest Securities said Vodafone was 'On the cusp of a significant turn in the business, demonstrating the qualities of a growth cyclical.' Clyde Petroleum edged up 1 1/2 to 50p and were apparently unaffected by a bought deal executed by the company's stockbroker Hoare Govett. Two blocks of shares, one of 9.9m and another of 1.3m, the equivalent of a 3.5 per cent stake, were bought by the broker at 50p and placed with institutions at 50 1/4 p. Turnover in Clyde totalled 25m shares. The identity of the seller was not known in the market but Clyde has a number of big institutional shareholders notably Norwich Union, George Weston Holdings, Schroders and the Prudential. British Coal Pension Fund and Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management each hold stakes of below 5 per cent. There was continued poor sentiment towards Ladbroke Group, the shares sliding a further 3 to 157p. As well as well worn worries over debts upsetting some, dealers are said to be concerned that next month's cash alternative to the dividend, being offered by the group's joint brokers, will mean that a lot of stock may need to be placed. NatWest Securities was one broker taking a more positive longer-term view yesterday, however, focusing on the group's betting business potential. Hotel group Forte slipped a penny to 192p, with Nomura turning positive on the stock. There was a rumour that the group has been in discussions to sell its Harvester pub division. Drugs group Boots weakened as it announced it was slashing suncare products in reaction to similar moves from its competitors last week. The shares fell 10 to 336p and raised fears that Boots profitable OTC business could be threatened. Automotive engineering group GKN saw its shares tumble 13 to 461p ahead of the annual meeting on May 19 and talk of a forecast downgrading. Analysts said Credit Lyonnais Laing reiterated its sell stance and cut profit forecasts by Pounds 15m to Pounds 120m for 1993 and by Pounds 20m to Pounds 153m for 1994. ICI drifted 5 1/2 to 1259p in spite of confirmation by the London Stock Exchange that dealings in the unofficial 'grey' market in new ICI shares and those of the bioscience arm Zeneca will start again on May 12.</p>

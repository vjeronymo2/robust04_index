			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow follows overseas shares lower Wall Street FRESH weakness on overseas markets brought further pressure to bear on US share prices yesterday, which extended their recent sharp fall as investors worried about the effect on equities of today's expiration of derivatives contracts, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 13.64 lower at 3,274.12. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.30 to 400.96, while the American SE composite finished 2.25 down at 377.49 and the Nasdaq composite 4.07 off at 549.17. Turnover on the New York SE came to 225.6m shares. After opening lower following the big declines in Tokyo and London, the market found little comfort in the day's economic news. The April US trade deficit of Dollars 7bn was wider than expected, while the decline in weekly jobless claims was smaller than forecast and indicative of a weak labour market. One feature was investor wariness about buying ahead of today's expiration of futures and options contracts. With the market in its current vulnerable state, there was concern that the expirations, always a potentially disruptive force on underlying equity prices, could send shares into a prolonged tail-spin. Among individual stocks, Advanced Micro Devices plunged Dollars 5 1/2 to Dollars 9 in turnover of 8.3m shares after a federal jury ruled that the company cannot use a piece of Intel software in its clones of Intel microprocessors. The news lifted Intel Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 51 in turnover of 8m shares. IBM rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 94 5/8 after an earnings upgrade from broking house Merrill Lynch, which raised its 1992 and 1993 profits estimates for the computer group to Dollars 7.25 and Dollars 9 a share respectively. IBM's rise gave an initial lift to other big computer stocks, but afternoon selling erased the gains. Hewlett-Packard finished unchanged at Dollars 65 1/4 , Digital Equipment was off Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 36 1/8 and Compaq lost a net Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 23 5/8 . Apple, which similar to Intel is quoted on the Nasdaq market, fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 45 1/4 . Ashland Oil declined Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 27 3/8 after the company said it expected third-quarter net income to be well below the Dollars 1.19 a share earned a year ago. On the Nasdaq market, J &amp; J Snack Foods plummeted Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 9 after warning that third-quarter earnings will be below the 20 cents a share produced a year earlier. Canada TORONTO posted a modest decline in moderate trading after Wednesday's sharp fall. The composite index ended 11 points weaker at 3,357.2, while losing issues outnumbered advances by 288 to 235 after volume of 26.5m shares valued at CDollars 308.4m. Air Canada, up 25 cents at CDollars 4.95, said passenger traffic increased by 15.9 per cent in May from a year earlier. The company also announced that it intends to sell five freighter aircraft.</p>

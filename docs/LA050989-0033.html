			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NO SWEAT AS LENDL BEATS YZAGA FOR TITLE, 6-2, 6-1  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl wore sweat pants during the Tournament of Champions final Monday,  but he hardly broke a sweat.  </P> <P> The world's top-ranked player routed unseeded Jaime Yzaga of Peru, 6-2, 6-1, to  become the first three-time winner of this clay-court tournament on a chilly,  windy day at the West Side Tennis Club in New York.  </P> <P> "It was very cold and unpleasant," Lendl said. "I don't enjoy wearing sweat  pants because it's uncomfortable, but today it was necessary.  </P> <P> "I don't think he liked the conditions any better than I did. I was just able  to overpower him."  </P> <P> Lendl, who also won this event in 1982 and 1985, swept through five matches  without losing a set to win his fourth title of the year.  </P> <P> The temperature was in the low 50s and a brisk wind made it feel much colder,  but Lendl said he has played in worse conditions.  </P> <P> "I remember one time in Czechoslovakia in early May we had to stop because of  snowflakes," he said. "We were using white balls and you couldn't see them.  </P> <P> "I was moving very well (Monday) and I felt strong. Whatever was happening on  the court, I felt comfortable."  </P> <P> Yzaga, ranked 56th in the world, won a set from Lendl in each of their two  previous matches. But the 21-year-old Peruvian never posed a serious threat in  this final, which was delayed a day because of rain earlier in the tournament.  </P> <P> "He's the No. 1 player in the world and he's tough to beat on every point,"  Yzaga said. "He won't give you any free points, so you have to earn them.  </P> <P> "I was a little impatient in the first set. I tried to finish the points too  fast and that's why I made a lot of mistakes."  </P> <P> Lendl broke Yzaga in the opening game at love and went on to win the first set  in 34 minutes.  </P> <P> Lendl earned $82,450, and Yzaga received $41,255.  </P> <P> Guillermo Vilas and Jimmy Arias, two former standouts who are unseeded in this  event, pulled off upsets in the opening round of the $220,000 U.S. Men's Clay  Court Championships at Charleston, S.C.  </P> <P> Vilas beat fourth-seeded Dan Goldie, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, and Jimmy Arias defeated  eighth-seeded Bruno Oresar of Yugoslavia, 6-1, 6-3.  </P> <P> In the day's other match involving a seeded player, No. 6 Jay Berger defeated  Claudio Panatta of Italy, 6-1, 6-3.  </P> <P> "He was steady. He was playing well," Vilas said of Goldie. "He never slowed  down. I can't say I was lucky, but I had good timing today."  </P> <P> Unseeded Petra Langrova of Czechoslovakia upset ninth-seeded Nicole Provis of  Austria, 6-7 (7-5), 6-3, 6-0, in the first round of the $300,000 Italian Open  at Rome.  </P> <P> In other first-round matches, 12th-seeded Barbara Paulus of Austria rallied to  beat Olga Tsarboupolou of Greece, 4-6, 6-1, 6-1, and 19-year-old Marzia Grossi  of Italy beat Brenda Schultz of the Netherlands, 6-1, 7-5. Top-seeded Gabriela  Sabatini had a bye.  </P></p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Tenneco lifts earnings to Dollars 74m despite lower sales TENNECO, the Texas-based diversified industrial company, saw earnings jump in the first quarter, although revenues from all but its natural gas operations were lower than a year ago. The group reported income from continuing operations at Dollars 74m, or 46 cents per share, compared with Dollars 35m, or 22 cents, in the first quarter of 1992. Revenues were Dollars 3.25bn, against last year's Dollars 3.21bn. The company's Case farm and construction equipment division trimmed its quarterly operating loss to Dollars 17m, from last year's Dollars 77m. In spite of the operating improvement, Case's revenues fell 9 per cent to Dollars 814m. Tenneco said that North American sales of farm and construction equipment improved in the first quarter, but were offset by continuing declines in Europe. The company's natural gas pipeline operations saw revenues in the quarter rise to Dollars 818m from Dollars 514m a year ago, while income from gas operations rose Dollars 3m to Dollars 121m, from Dollars 118m last year. Tenneco said the income gain was the result of higher pipeline volumes and the inclusion of results from EnTrade, a gas marketing company acquired in the fourth quarter of 1992. During the first quarter, Case cut its worldwide production by 19 per cent from the same period last year as part of its effort to control inventories and balance production with demand. The Newport News Shipbuilding division recorded income of Dollars 55m, up marginally from Dollars 53m last year, in spite of a decline in sales to Dollars 452m, from Dollars 584m last time. Tenneco's Albright and Wilson chemicals business had flat results in the quarter, with operating income at Dollars 15m. Revenues in the division fell 7 per cent because of recessionary pressures from Europe. Operating income at the company's Packaging Corporation of America fell to Dollars 37m from Dollars 49m, partly because the European recession weakened worldwide linerboard prices.</p>

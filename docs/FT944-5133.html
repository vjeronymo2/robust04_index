			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (1): Industrialisation pays off - Thais are enjoying one of Asia's best economic performances. But pockets of poverty remain to be eradicated Thailand continues to lurch from one political crisis to another, but its economic performance has been consistently robust. Real gross domestic product growth averaged 7.4 per cent a year between 1971 and 1993, and is likely to average more than eight per cent from now until the end of the decade. Although Thailand is still regarded as a 'developing' country, industrialisation has already brought material benefits to most of its 59m inhabitants and made it into one of south-east Asia's most remarkable success stories. No fewer than 97 per cent of the residents of greater Bangkok live in a household with television, while 84 per cent have refrigerators and 52 per cent video cassette players. Outside Bangkok, the figures fall to a still-impressive 86 per cent for television, 50 per cent for refrigerators and nine per cent for video machines. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the mild-mannered prime minister who heads the coalition government elected in 1992, has started to redress the balance between the wealth of Bangkok and the relative poverty of the countryside by directing investment and government spending into the remoter provinces. His most important achievement, however, has been to extend compulsory education from six years to nine, a decision regarded as long overdue and essential if Thailand is to improve the skills of its workforce and compete successfully in high technology industries against other emerging Asian economies. It will take many years for education reforms to translate into better industrial performance - the first pupils to benefit will leave school three years from now - but in the meantime Thai exports continue to grow rapidly, with 'new' manufacturing industries making items such as computers and vehicle parts overtaking 'old' businesses such as textiles. Japanese companies seeking to escape from the high costs imposed by the strong yen in their home base continue to regard Thailand as a favoured site for new investments. Large corporations such as Toyota are now being joined by a growing number of smaller component manufacturers that want to take advantage of the lower manufacturing costs and new markets available in south-east Asia. Thailand can now see the advantage of liberalising various sectors of its economy hitherto protected as 'infant industries' from outside competition, and seems to be opening up the economy faster than its rivals in Indonesia and Malaysia. The government has begun gradually to liberalise the banking sector and the motor manufacturing industry, for example, because it believes this will help Thailand to become a regional hub for such activities. While the bureaucrats at the Bank of Thailand (the central bank) and the finance ministry perform their traditional function of controlling inflation and ensuring that the government pursues prudent macro-economic policies, Mr Chuan can focus his considerable political skills on keeping his government in power. Survival for a democratic government in Thailand is no easy task, although the armed forces, which have staged 17 coups d'etat 17 since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, are not seen as a particular threat at present. The last time they organised a coup in 1991 they quickly handed control to a civilian prime minister, and when they sought to keep power by parliamentary means in 1992 they were prevented from doing so by street demonstrations during which troops shot dead about 50 unarmed protestors. Mr Chuan's main problem is the fragility of his own five-party coalition government. The present parliament is largely a product of a corrupt system of politics wherein most rural voters elect influential patrons - who are expected to extract money from Bangkok for their constituencies - instead of choosing candidates and parties on the basis of their policies. If Mr Chuan stays in power for another two years, his would be the first democratically-elected government in Thai history to serve its full, four-year term of office. 'The Thai people will have to learn that the democratic system lasts four years,' sighs Mr Akapol Sorasuchart, a Bangkok MP for Mr Chuan's Democrat Party. 'They have never, ever experienced that any elected person, let alone a government, lasts more than three years.' Among the recent humiliations Mr Chuan has had to endure at the hands of his coalition partners were the unilateral decision by the Palang Dharma (Moral Force) party to change all its cabinet ministers (including the foreign minister) and a public rejection by Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, head of the New Aspiration Party, of the government's policy of promoting local elections. 'A cabinet decision is not God. It's just a piece of paper,' Gen Chavalit said. This prompted Mr Suthichai Yoon, a leading newspaper columnist and executive editor of The Nation, to comment: 'With coalition parties like the New Aspiration Party, who needs an opposition in the first place?' Opposition politicians, meanwhile, are happy to exploit the coalition's weaknesses. In their latest attack, they have criticised the government's much-touted land reform programme, suggesting that some land in the resort island of Phuket was corruptly distributed to the undeserving rich instead of the landless poor. Some of the government's accusers in the land reform scandal are not exactly angels themselves and Mr Chuan's government is probably more honest than most of its predecessors, but the endless twists and turns of Thailand's byzantine politics have had a debilitating effect on the prime minister's ability to take decisions and enforce them. Until now the Thai economy - driven by Sino-Thai entrepreneurs and free from the ethnic and religious divisions suffered by neighbouring countries - has prospered in spite of chronic political instability. But as the economy becomes more complex the need for good government and improved legislation and regulation becomes ever more urgent. The most notorious problem stemming from successive Thai governments' failure to do what governments are supposed to do is the chaotic traffic congestion in Bangkok. After two decades of negotiations involving dozens of contractors and government agencies, Bangkok has no mass transit system - and the three that are currently planned do not connect with each other. Such difficulties are not confined to transport. In telecommunications, private companies are finally installing millions of long-awaited new lines, but a duopoly of state organisations retains overall control and the regulatory environment is murky. Thailand needs billions of dollars for investment in infrastructure projects, but delays are due mainly to an inability to make decisions rather than lack of money. Thailand regularly runs a budget surplus, and the country's gross domestic savings ratio rose to 37 per cent of GDP in 1993 from an average of 22 per cent in the decade to 1980. Foreigners would make up any shortfall by investing in Thai infrastructure if they had confidence in the legal system and the government's ability to set priorities. 'I've always believed that our infrastructural problems have nothing to do with lack of capital,' says Mr Ammar Siamwalla, president of the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), an independent foundation. 'We require public sector decisions and that is what is missing.' Another concern is that the private sector is poaching the underpaid Thai civil servants who have hitherto kept the economy on an even keel through even the worst periods of political turbulence. According to the TDRI, a permanent secretary's salary in 1990 was worth only 15 per cent of its real value in 1909. In the finance ministry, says Mr Ammar, 'We're seeing the last of the mandarins departing this year and in the next few years.' Despite such obstacles, Thailand's recent history suggests that it will adapt to changing circumstances fast enough to achieve continued economic growth. Political stability, however, remains an elusive goal. At the very least, the methodical Mr Chuan will need the rest of his current term of office and a second term with a stronger mandate if he is to fulfil his aims of promoting development in rural areas, narrowing the widening gap between rich and poor, imposing the rule of law and strengthening democracy. Mr Chuan himself is aware that his coalition is fragile, and says he will be satisfied if he can lay the foundations for an orderly transfer of power. 'For a coalition government made up of five political parties, I'm satisfied with two years,' he says. 'For the remaining time it's important to support the system. Once the system is widely accepted any future changes will then go according to democratic rules.'</p>

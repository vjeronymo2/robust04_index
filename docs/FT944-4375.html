			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Renault and Peugeot to cut at least 2,900 jobs French carmakers Renault and PSA Peugeot-Citroen plan to shed a total of at least 2,900 jobs next year in spite of a strong recovery in French car sales, car company and union officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. Union sources at Renault, which was partly privatised last month, said the company planned to cut 1,735 jobs in 1995 through early retirement programmes. Since 1990, it has cut more than 21,000 jobs, or about 13 per cent of its workforce. Citroen plans to cut 1,180 jobs in 1995, and newspapers report that sister company Peugeot is also planning to trim its payrolls next year. The cuts are in addition to 18,400 job losses, representing nearly 12 per cent of PSA's total workforce, since the beginning of the decade. Although new car registrations in France rose 21.4 per cent in November from a year earlier, industry analysts said the magnitude of the recovery partly reflected the depth of the recession in 1993, and they added that it may be short-lived. Mr Jacques Calvet, PSA chairman, said recently he expected growth in west European car sales would reach about 5 per cent this year and then taper off in 1995, recouping only about half the 15.1 per cent drop in car sales recorded in 1993.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the government; place and date not </F> given; read by government spokesman Moctar Diallo--recorded]    [Text] [Begin Diallo recording] Since it assumed office,  the government of the Third Republic, in conformity with the  pledge it made in its general policy statement, has favored and  developed dialogue and consultations with all social partners in  order to find solutions to problems that have arisen. It will  notably be recalled that when in September 1993, in the face of  the serious economic and financial crisis our country had been  experiencing, it became necessary to look for cost-saving  measures that could remedy the situation, the government did not  at any time hesitate to undertake direct negotiations with the  Federation of Labor Unions of Niger [USTN] in order to agree on  the level of sacrifices workers had to make.    The government has always given the same attention to any  matter affecting the life of workers. Thus, as soon as the CFA  franc was devalued, various administrative and fiscal measures  were taken to minimize the effects of the decision on the living  conditions of workers. In this regard, apart from the  reintroduction of price controls, various tax alleviation and  inflation reduction measures on essential commodities were taken  to make them accessible to the general consumer and,  particularly, to workers.    In the same desire to protect workers' purchasing power,  salary deductions effected since August 1993 as part of the  cost-saving measures, were stopped as from January. Instead,  government workers' nominal salaries were automatically  increased by 10 to 20 percent. Furthermore, during the ongoing  negotiations with the labor unions, the government proposed an  across-the-board and immediate increase of 5 to 12 percent in  government workers' salaries. As it can be deduced, the  cumulative salary increase that the government proposed ranges  from 15 to 32 percent in relation to the predevaluation  situation.    Furthermore, after paying one -- that of March -- out of the  four months of salary arrears inherited from the transition  period, the government has undertaken to reduce the arrears for  the remaining months in the course of this year, according to  the following timetable. Nearing the 'Id al-Kabir festival, one  month's worth of salaries will be paid, and at the beginning of  the school term, another month's worth will be paid. At the end  of the year, yet another month's worth will be paid. In other  words, within 12 months, the government will pay the equivalent  of 16 months of salaries of which three have already been paid  to date.    It should also be recalled that from May 1993 -- the  beginning of the Third Republic -- to the end of March this  year, salaries have been regularly paid without taking the  months of arrears into account. Such efforts should not be  underestimated in view of all the economic and financial  difficulties that our country is battling with. All workers are  aware of such difficulties today. This is why the government is  greatly surprised to hear that despite these efforts, the USTN  has launched a strike order to demand a salary increase  following the devaluation, and a repeal of Ordinance 9302 of 3  September 1993 regulating government workers' right to strike as  well as Decree 9412 PRM of 3 February 1994.    The government is even more surprised because not only are  the negotiations initiated with the unions in connection with  the first point still under way, but especially because the  USTN, in the very words of its secretary general, plans to refer  the disputed law to the Supreme Court. How then does one  explain the decision of a labor federation, which claims to  respect republican values, to embark on a strike against a law  it intends to contest before the highest legal body of our  country without even waiting for a ruling on the matter. The  essentially unionist rationale for this form of struggle, as one  can see, is far from being established. This is why the  government is urgently appealing to all democrats of integrity  to foil the maneuvers of all those who, under the guise of  (?unionism), are trying to satisfy their personal ambitions.    At any rate, the government wishes to point out that since  Ordinance 9302 of 3 September 1993, which regulates strike  rights was enacted by the National Assembly, it will be fully  and rigorously enforced. It should be noted, in particular,  that failure by workers to comply with orders to go back to work  and interference with work freedom will be punished in  accordance with the law. Salary deductions corresponding to the  number of strike days will be effected on the salaries of  striking workers whose names shall be drawn up by the personnel  director and forwarded to the finance and planning minister.  Thank you. [end recording]</p>

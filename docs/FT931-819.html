			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Barclays sets a trap for fraudsters  -The latest deterrent BARCLAYS Bank will be using a new computer system from April 1 to trap fraudsters who try to use stolen credit cards. The system, known as Fraud 2000, will monitor 100,000 daily purchases on cards issued by Barclays. The bank is the largest issuer of credit cards in the UK with between 35 and 40 per cent of the market. Last year, it suffered worldwide losses from credit card fraud of Pounds 31.1m, down from the peak of Pounds 33m in 1991. Total plastic card fraud in the UK last year amounted to Pounds 165m. Fraud 2000 will compare the purchase with a range of common indicators of card fraud, such as the number of transactions made in one day or the amount being spent. If it becomes suspicious - something which Barclays expects to happen in 20 per cent of cases - the computer will then look at the customer's account in detail and compare the purchase to their normal pattern of spending. Barclays says this checking process will take only one fifth of a second. If the computer logs anything suspicious, it will alert Barclaycard's 24-hour fraud referral unit; Barclays expects this to happen in 250 cases a day. A member of the unit will then speak to the customer over the telephone to check that the card owner is genuine. Details of the credit card account will be sought as well as personal information. In cases where Barclays suspects fraud is involved, the unit will contact the police. The main difference with the existing Fraudwatch computer system is that data will be analysed 'live' instead of days later when the vouchers reach Barclays. 'Given that around a third of our customers fail to report their card as being lost or stolen within 48 hours, Fraud 2000 will eliminate the head start fraudsters have had in the past,' says Barclays. However, the new system can only be used for those transactions where the retailer authorises the card directly with Barclays, either electronically or by telephone. Authorisation operates in only 20 per cent of transactions but Barclays says it aims to increase the number of authorised transactions to one in four this year and to half by 1996. The Consumers' Association welcomed the initiative but said it was concerned at the potential for embarrassment to genuine cardholders called to the telephone in front of other customers. Barclays says it does not wish to lose customer goodwill. Its existing fraud control systems led to 3,500 arrests last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, May 5 (AFP) -- A British UN convoy blocked  since Saturday by Bosnian Serb forces finally arrived in the  Moslem enclave of Gorazde early Thursday after the Serbs gave a  go-ahead, a UN forces spokesman here said. The 51-vehicle  convoy carrying 168 UN peackeepers entered the enclave around  0115 (2315 GMT), said UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman  Yvon Desjardins. The British company will reinforce some 500 UN  troops already controlling the NATO exclusion zone and ceasefire  around the hard- hit enclave.    It left Sarajevo Saturday but was stopped at a Serb  checkpoint in Rogatica, only 35 kilometers (21 miles) east of  the Bosnian capital by Serbs objecting to what they said was  excess weapons and cameras. UNPROFOR said Wednesday in Sarajevo  it had been forced to bow to Serb demands to remove some of the  ammunition and cameras from the convoy.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: The NeXT step in the software battle - The fighting return of Apple Computer's former head Steven Jobs BODIES litter the short history of personal computing: Gary Kildall, who wrote the first operating system, Dan Fylstra, publisher of the first electronic spreadsheet and Adam Osborn of the eponymous portable computer, to name but three. They are wealthy, but no longer seem very influential in deciding the course the industry will take. Mr Steven Jobs, co-founder of Apple Computer and the creator of today's PC industry, should, by rights, figure among them. Ejected from Apple after a power struggle with former chief executive Mr John Sculley, his new venture, NeXT Computer led a precarious existence, culminating in the sale earlier this year of the hardware side of the business to Canon of Japan. Only last month he parted ways acrimoniously with its newly appointed chief operating officer, Mr Peter van Cuylenburg. Harmonious, enduring relationships with colleagues are not Mr Jobs' strong suit. 'Rough, tough and intimidating' are some of the kinder adjectives used to describe him. Yet here he is again. This time trying to convince the corporate world that NeXT's flagship software Nextstep is the answer to its data processing problems in the face of competition from the industry giants International Business Machines, Microsoft, Novell and Apple. In his favour is the quality of the software itself - Nextstep has attracted good reviews since its introduction - and his own brooding charisma. The other side of the 'boss from hell', as Fortune magazine has described him, is a smooth tongued charmer who does his homework well. He is candid about mistakes. The NeXT management failed to realise how quickly prices would fall in the personal computer market. It also raised too much start-up cash: 'That insulated us from the reality of giving our customers what they really wanted.' What every company wants is a way of developing business software in less than the two to three years traditionally demanded by data processing departments. How does NeXT fit the bill? Shorn of its hardware side, it is a software house. Nextstep was designed to make it easier for companies moving from expensive centralised mainframe to networks of smaller, less costly computers to write software specifically for the business. It is based on Unix, which many believe will be the operating system of the future, and the technology in Nextstep, object orientation, is undoubtedly one of the keys to the software of the future. It is a technique which enables pieces of software to be re-used rather than starting completely from scratch. IBM and Apple have a joint venture, Taligent, to develop an object orientation system; Microsoft's equivalent, code-named 'Cairo', is at least 18 months away from launch. Mr Jobs believes NeXT is five years ahead of the competition. 'We believe we are going to sell 25,000 copies in the second half of this year and 100,000 copies next year. We already have 60,000 copies on order,' he says. 'If we can do that, we will be the world's largest commercial supplier of Unix systems. Then we will be poised to do what we want to, which is to provide an alternative to Microsoft. Microsoft will not be able to compete with us technically. It can compete only on size and scale.' Microsoft is the world's largest software company with annual sales of close to Dollars 4bn. NeXT, in its present incarnation, has yet to see a profit. Yet there are parallels between Mr Jobs' strategy and his earlier experiences with Apple. The Apple 11 computer was a hobbyist's toy until accountants realised its value in creating electronic spreadsheets. The Apple Macintosh, which introduced 'mice' and 'windows' to the masses, was in danger of becoming a cult machine until its importance as a vehicle for desk top publishing became clear. 'This is how we are selling Nextstep' Jobs says. 'In the same way that the Macintosh was the Trojan Horse of desk top publishing'. He has trenchant views on the major players in the industry, applauding the efforts of Hewlett-Packard, the California-based electronics giant. 'I think it has got its act together better than any of the other large manufacturers,' he says. He takes a gloomy view of his old company: 'Apple is in serious trouble. Once it was ahead on vision and technology but Microsoft caught it as if it was frozen'. A predictable view perhaps. HP is NeXT's partner in selling Nextstep while Mr Jobs is still clearly rattled by his expulsion from Apple. He cannot help but exude schadenfreude at the news that Mr Sculley has resigned from the company. Today, few people think Mr Jobs has much chance of establishing Nextstep as a standard in the industry but his truculent persistence is viewed affectionately by his peers. One software specialist said: 'He is a true pioneer and like all pioneers he takes the arrows in the back.' Where Mr Jobs differs, it seems, is in resolutely refusing to lie down and play dead.</p>

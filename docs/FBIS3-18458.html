Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Ferhat Ataman told a  weekly  news conference that the Ministry asked for information on the  issue. "However, Russia has yet to inform us on the meeting,"  Ataman said. Ataman said Foreign Ministry official Bilgin Unan,  who is currently in Russia for official talks, could bring the  issue up.    A conference was held in Moscow last month by a number of  organizations which are believed to have ties with the  separatist terrorist organization. Russian Minister Valerie  Samsurov [name and title as received] was in attendance at the  Moscow meeting of the PKK supporters.    Russian Ambassador to Turkey Albert Chernyshev was summoned  to the Foreign Ministry and was asked to inquire about the  meeting. He assured Foreign Ministry officials that there has  been no change in his country's policy.    Ataman said a delegation from the Foreign Ministry arrived  in  Moscow on Tuesday to discuss relations between Turkey and Russia.</p>

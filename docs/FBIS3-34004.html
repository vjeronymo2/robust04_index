			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, 3 Feb (MENA)-- An informed Palestinian source  has told Tunisian paper AL-SABAH today that the agreement  reached in Davos between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres includes a number of  points, primarily the Israeli consent to let the Palestinian  side take responsibility for receiving travelers to and from the  self-rule areas.    The Palestinian source added that the agreement provides for  setting up a Palestinian checkpoint that receives travelers to  and from the self-rule areas. An Israeli checkpoint will  exercise electronic control from a distance. Travelers wishing  to enter Israel will be permitted to head for the Israeli  checkpoint without being intercepted.    The source pointed out that the corridor linking Gaza and  Jericho will pass through the nearby township of Idnah, Hebron,  in the context of initial Israeli consent to let travelers from  the self-rule areas cross into the West Bank. These travelers  will be given enough time to cover the distance between the  first Israeli checkpoint in the self-rule areas and the first  Israeli checkpoint after these areas, and then proceed to the  first Israeli military checkpoint in the destination area.    The Palestinian source affirmed that the Davos agreement  included Israeli consent to put the Palestinian authority in  charge of arranging all rituals during religious seasons in the  al-Nabi Musa area, which Jewish pilgrims visit three times a  year. In return, Christian Palestinians will make pilgrimages  under their own flag to the area of al-Maghtis [where Christ was  believed to have been baptized] without being harassed or  intercepted by Israel.    The source added that Israel has agreed to let the national  Palestinian authority extend to the Dead Sea coast and consented  to the establishment of tourist resorts and economic  establishments. He pointed out that the Palestinians insisted in  the Davos draft of keeping control on the international borders  and crossing points between Gaza and Egypt and between Jericho  and Jordan. That point is still disputed.    The Palestinian source concluded that this agreement might  be  signed in the next stage by 'Arafat and Rabin in the presence of  Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, and the  Greek foreign minister, since Greece chairs the European Union's  current session.</p>

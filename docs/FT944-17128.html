			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / International Company News: Ups and downs of the rollercoaster - Simon London charts the career of property developer John Broome Mr John Broome, the property developer who planned to build a leisure complex on the site of London's Battersea Power Station, has always worked on a grand scale. His 1,200 acre Carden Park leisure development in Cheshire, to which receivers were appointed last week, is only the latest in a string of ambitious projects. The Carden complex boasts an 18-hole golf course and one of Europe's most northerly commercial vineyards. Work so far has involved planting nearly 30,000 trees, 10 acres of vines, and restoring 14 miles of dry stone walls. Aimed squarely at the corporate hospitality market, sports on offer include croquet, bowls, fly-fishing, game shooting, hot-air ballooning and archery. More than Pounds 20m has been spent, with planning permission granted for more. Mr Broome's commitment to Carden is not in doubt: he owns the estate in person, rather than through a shell company, and last year he sold Stretton Hall, his country home to raise funds for the development. Carden, however, needs new equity. The Bank of Scotland, sole lender to the project, last week appointed Grant Thornton as receivers. The firm will look for a buyer or some form of refinancing. In his previous ventures, Mr Broome has tasted both triumph and disaster. In the early 1980s he turned Alton Towers into one of the country's biggest tourist attractions. His involvement with the Alton estate dated from his marriage in 1973 to Jane Bagshaw, whose father owned the former seat of the Earls of Shrewsbury. By the time it was sold for Pounds 60m in 1990 to Pearson Group, the media and leisure company which owns the Financial Times, Alton Towers was the UK's most popular paid tourist attraction outside London. Disaster came in the shape of Battersea Power Station, Gilbert Scott's masterpiece on the banks of the Thames. When Mr Broome bought the Grade 2 listed building from the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1987 he was seen as one of the few entrepreneurs capable of seeing the project through. The Battersea complex was supposed to accommodate 7,000 visitors an hour at peak periods, many of them shuttled to the site by a 'Battersea bullet' train from Victoria station. Work started in June 1988, with Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, performed a renaming ceremony. But problems beset Battersea from the outset. The foundations, both physical and financial, proved inadequate to take the strain and Battersea Leisure Group was put into liquidation last year. Hong Kong property developers George and Victor Hwang bought the company's debt at a discount and now have effective control of the site. Work on a re-designed leisure and retail complex is expected to start next year. But financial reverberations are still being felt. In June, Battersea Leisure's liquidator issued a writ seeking the return of Pounds 16m transferred from the company to Alton Towers six years ago. Former colleagues of Mr Broome describe him as flamboyant but deadly serious. The Battersea episode clearly rankles after the commercial success of Alton Towers. Carden Park was another attempt to show that a grand vision could bring rewards.                            *       *       * JOHN BROOME 1943: Born near Chester, the son of a headmaster. 1968: Elected a county councillor. 1973: Marries Jane Bagshaw, whose father owns Alton Towers. 1987: Buys 1,200 acre Carden Park estate for undisclosed sum. 1987: Buys Battersea Power Station from Central Electricity Generating Board for Pounds 1.5m. 1990: Sells Alton Towers to Pearson Group for Pounds 60m.

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Tokyo urged to intervene on NTT fall THE HEAD of Japan's most powerful business group has urged the government to take steps to help restore confidence among individual investors in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Kyodo reports from Tokyo. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), said yesterday that NTT stock was a symbol of speculative fund management known as zaitech. As a result, the sharp decline in NTT share prices in recent months had soured enthusiasm among individual investors in the stock market as a whole, he said. Mr Hiraiwa, however, did not specify what measures the government might adopt to revive the price of NTT shares, which have plunged from a high of Y3.18m in late April 1987 to Y638,000 a share yesterday. Calls have been heard in the market for cutting the face value of NTT shares to make it easier for investors to purchase the stock. Mr Hiraiwa said Tokyo stock prices have seemed to have hit bottom and that volume was increasing. However, he added the key to a further recovery in the market was the participation by more individual investors.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / People: McKinnon joins Morrow, again Sir James McKinnon, the combative boss of gas industry regulator Ofgas, seems to be making the most of his friendship with Sir Ian Morrow. Since they met many years ago through the Scottish Institute of Chartered Accountants - of which they have both been president - Sir James has now joined two boards of which Sir Ian is chairman. Earlier this summer, McKinnon, who has said it may not be appropriate (in the light of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's wide-ranging inquiry into British Gas) for him to see out his term to September 1994, became a non-executive director of evening primrose oil manufacturer Scotia Holdings (previously Efamol). Now he is also joining the board of MAI, the money-broking to media conglomerate of socialist peer Lord Hollick. Sir James, finance director of Imperial Group from 1967-1986, says he has always been 'fascinated' by the money markets, and relishes the idea of getting back into the 'mainstream business'. The prospect of television - 'from the other side' of the camera' - also interests him. 'I am intrigued about how you go about acquiring and keeping a franchise.' MAI holds a majority share in Meridian which has successfully bid for an ITV franchise. While some have seen him as a possible successor to 80-year-old Sir Ian in the chair at MAI, Sir James, himself 63, vigorously denies any such ambitions. 'He (Sir Ian) is incredibly energetic and capable, and looks as if he will go on for ever.' With Sir Ian playing the Liberal Democrat to Lord Hollick's Labour views, Sir James will not divulge what colour he will contribute to the kaleidoscope of political views already represented on the board of MAI. 'My Ofgas job renders me apolitical,' he says cagily.</p>

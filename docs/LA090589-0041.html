			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBLEMS WITH DIALING 911  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department and the 911 dispatcher involved in the dreadful  Navarro murders have been getting a lot of flak about what should or should not  have been done. I think the situation was handled by both the dispatcher and  Navarro without one element that might have prevented the horrific outcome --  common sense.  </P> <P> Why didn't the dispatcher suggest that Navarro remove herself from the premises  or at least ask if Navarro had taken some safeguards to protect herself? Why  didn't Navarro disband the party?  </P> <P> Maybe this is hindsight. Certainly, the behavior of the 911 deputy and Mrs.  Navarro showed no foresight.  </P> <P> CHRIS MARCONI  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

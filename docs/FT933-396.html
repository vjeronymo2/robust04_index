			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Councils will face cost of cover if firefighters strike THE PRESSURE on local authorities to settle their pay dispute with firefighters increased yesterday after Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, told employers that they must meet the full financial cost of emergency cover in the event of any strikes. The employers said that would probably cost them far more than meeting the pay claim in full. Mr Howard gave an equally blunt message that the firefighters must not have any wage rise in November higher than the government's 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit for this year. 'There is no justification whatsoever for giving firefighters preferential treatment this year,' he told them. 'They are expecting a special deal when over 3m employees - including doctors, nurses and police officers - have already accepted pay settle-ments of 1.5 per cent or below.' Mr Ken Cameron, the Fire Brigades' Union general secretary, said a dispute now looked 'inevitable'. 'This is an extremely dangerous situation. To put the public at risk for what is a marginal amount of money to settle the dispute is a nonsense,' he said. The local authorities may well decide to defy the government's pay policy by meeting the firefighters' wage formula award in full to avoid industrial conflict - although perhaps in stages. The government's earnings survey for 1993, to be published tomorrow, will provide the basis for the pay award sought by firefighters. Their pay rises have been linked since 1978 to the annual increase in earnings of the upper quartile of male manual workers. If this year's figure, based on the 12 months to April, is not much above 1.5 per cent, the employers are expected to settle. The crucial negotiating session between the employers and the leaders of the FBU will be on Friday. If that fails to secure a settlement, the union's 50,000 members will be asked to vote from next Monday for a series of one-day strikes. They would begin on November 8 or shortly afterwards if a majority support action. Mr Howard told the employers the government had no objection to the restoration of the firefighters' pay formula in 1994 but he also warned them no extra cash would be available from the government to pay for it. The employers told him that local authorities who had their spending programmes already capped by the government might be unable to meet next year's firefighters' pay award, while other councils would be forced to cut staffing levels and safety standards in order to meet next year's wage bill.

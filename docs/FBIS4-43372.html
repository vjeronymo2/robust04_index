			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "DW": "Controversial Cooperation"] </F>   [Text] Berlin -- After the municipal elections in four new  laender, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is partly  prepared for cooperation with the Party of Democratic Socialism  [PDS]. Yesterday, SPD Deputy Chairman Wolfgang Thierse no  longer ruled out such a cooperation for his party in eastern  German municipalities. The PDS representatives must not be  treated like lepers and thus turned into martyrs, he said. All  parties are obliged to cooperate in order to solve the pending  problems. This is something completely different from  coalitions with the PDS on the land and federal level, which he  considers impossible.    First offers have already been made by the successor party  of  the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. For example, Wolfgang  Methling, PDS frontrunner in Rostock, stated that the PDS does  not want "to govern the city at all costs." Methling announced  coalition talks with the Alliance 90/Greens and the SPD.  According to the preliminary result, in the Hanseatic city the  PDS gains 20 seats, the SPD 16, the CDU 11, and the Greens six.    In Thuringia, however, the SPD has basically opposed  coalitions with the PDS. Last evening, the land executive  committee of the party still wanted to discuss a recommendation  to the district and local associations not to form any  coalitions with the PDS on a local level.</p>

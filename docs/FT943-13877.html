			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Hope for future of coal The European Commission's drive to eliminate subsidies and deregulate markets will greatly improve coal's long-term chances of survival as a fuel for power generation and as a replacement for unpopular nuclear power, according to a new energy forecast by DRI, the energy specialists. DRI says coal's share of the fuel mix will decline between now and the end of the decade because of the growth in popularity of natural gas. But the shift to market-driven prices, as well as the growth of clean coal technology, will raise its attraction as a fuel in the next decade. DRI expects coal to show relatively small increases in real cost between now and 2015 as expensive indigenously produced coal is replaced by cheaper imports.</p>

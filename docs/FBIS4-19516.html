			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "Nordic Countries To Coordinate </F> Their UN Operations"]    [Text] The Nordic countries intend to reinforce the Nordic  UN presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This will be achieved  through Sweden and Norway gradually decreasing their UN forces  in Macedonia. To compensate Finland is prepared to contribute  more personnel to Macedonia. Denmark is represented in Bosnia  relatively "heavily" with the majority of its UN force in the  Tuzla region and is not likely to redeploy its men to any great  extent.    This in broad outline was the outcome of the Nordic defense  ministers' coordination meeting in Oslo on Sunday [17 April].    "We are agreed that it is important that we are flexible in  the way in which we make UN forces available. The most  effective help is achieved when we can deploy forces where they  are most needed," Norwegian Defense Minister Jorgen Kosmo said  after the meeting.    Finland is prepared to take the Nordic responsibility for UN  personnel in Macedonia, Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn  confirmed.    "But the Finnish Government has not as yet discussed the  size  of the force with which we will increased our UN personnel in  Macedonia," Rehn said.    The Americans have said that they are willing to increase  their presence in Macedonia as the Nordic UN force's operations  are shifted more and more to Bosnia.    Finland has a force of 230 men in Macedonia. It also has a  force of observers in Bosnia and a unit in Croatia.    The Norwegian Government intends to propose to the Storting  that the country should put a new 370-man force at the UN's  disposal in Bosnia, Defense Minister Kosmo said. If the  Storting approves the proposal, the new force will be ready to  leave for Bosnia in about three months' time. Once Norway has  reduced its operations in Macedonia the Norwegians will have a  UN force of around 850 men in the former Yugoslavia, a little  more than today.    Both Denmark and Sweden each have around 1,300 men in the  former Yugoslavia. The Danes are heavily represented in Bosnia  with almost 1,000 men.    Neither Denmark nor Sweden has plans to increase its efforts  in the former Yugoslavia. Swedish Defense Minister Anders  Bjorck said that his country currently has 140 UN soldiers in  Macedonia. A little over 100 of them have said that they are  willing to move to Bosnia. They will travel home to Sweden next  week for training. Thereafter it is planned that they will be on  the ground in Tuzla in mid-May.    The Nordic defense ministers also took the opportunity to  discuss the general situation in Bosnia after the events of  recent days.</p>

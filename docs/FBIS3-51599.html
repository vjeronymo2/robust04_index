This situation has  permitted civilian authorities to carry out their normal  activities and direct their efforts to provide humanitarian  assistance to the population.    Soldiers continue to assist the civilian population by  transporting and distributing supplies, blankets, and medicine  to the affected towns. These actions are also being carried out  freely by different social groups, the Red Cross, and  nongovernment organizations.    The Army will continue to participate in these humanitarian  tasks and will assist civil institutions and organizations that  require its assistance.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL'S BELTRAN DOWNSHIFTS, TAKES 4TH AT UC RIVERSIDE  </P> <P> Marcial Beltran tried a change of pace Saturday.  </P> <P> The Occidental College cross-country runner took a more relaxed approach while  running in the UC Riverside Invitational in Riverside and the result was an  impressive fourth-place finish.  </P> <P> Beltran, who grabbed the lead midway through the race in the Fresno  Invitational two weeks ago but faded to ninth, stayed off the pace Saturday  before moving into a lead pack of eight by the third mile. The group was  whittled to five by the fourth mile before Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's Scott  Hempel, UC Riverside's Shannon Winkelman and USC's Mitchell Sloan broke away.  </P> <P> Hempel won the 8,000-meter (4.96 miles) race in 25 minutes 21 seconds, followed  by Winkelman (25:29) and Sloan (25:31).  </P> <P> Beltran finished in 25:36, four seconds ahead of the Jamal Toads Club's Danny  Martinez.  </P> <P> "I started in the middle instead of trying to put an all-out effort today and  win," said Beltran, a junior transfer from Fullerton College who holds the  national junior college record in the marathon (2:17:26).  </P> <P> "I started to move a little bit at a time and I felt stronger (than at Fresno)  at the end and didn't burn out. I'm still learning to run a five-mile race (a  mile longer than a junior college race)."  </P> <P> Emmet Hogan (13th), Jose Garcia (17th), Konstantine Kindreich (30th) and Mike  Anker (64th) rounded out Occidental's scoring as the Tigers placed fourth with  128 points in the team competition.  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo won with 69 points, 14 ahead of the Jamal Toads. Arizona State  was third with 122 and Cal State Fullerton was fifth with 155.  </P> <P> Occidental's Laurie Schuster, the defending Southern California Intercollegiate  Athletic Conference champion, placed eighth in the women's 5,000-meter race  (18:23) and teammate Becky Kopchik was 22nd (18:45), helping lift the Tigers to  fifth place in the women's standings with 233 points.  </P> <P> "I wanted to go out fast and I was among the top 20 throughout the race," said  Schuster, "but I was hoping to run in the 17s."  </P> <P> Patti Blunk, competing unattached, won the race in 17:48. Arizona State won the  team title with 71 points, followed by San Luis Obispo (91), UC Irvine (124)  and UCLA (156).  </P> <P> Former Valley College standout Gretchen Lohr-Cruz finished 12th in 18:26.  Northridge held out its top two runners, Darcy Arreola and Derik Vett.  </P> <P> Laura Doering and Martha Segura were Northridge's top finishers, placing 40th  and 48th, for the eighth-place Matadors. Northridge's Fernando Fernandez  finished 78th in the men's race as Northridge placed 16th.  </P></p>

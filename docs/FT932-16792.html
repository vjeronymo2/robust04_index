			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / West to reschedule Dollars 15bn of Russian debt: Eve of summit deal offers boost for Yeltsin reforms WESTERN CREDITOR nations yesterday moved to bolster the position of Mr Boris Yeltsin and Moscow's beleaguered reformers by agreeing to reschedule the bulk of Russia's estimated Dollars 20bn (Pounds 14bn) debt service obligations due this year. The agreement comes on the eve of this weekend's US-Russian summit between Mr Yeltsin and US president Bill Clinton in Vancouver. The summit will focus, for the first time in the history of great power summitry, on economic and financial rather than military and security issues. Yesterday's agreement was signed in Paris by a Russian delegation led by Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister, and the so-called Paris Club of official creditors. It effectively reschedules over 10 years more than Dollars 15bn of the total Dollars 20bn in capital and interest due this year on Russia's foreign debt. In Washington, the International Monetary fund said it was working on a new temporary financing facility to help Russia and other former Soviet republics 'facing particularly disruptive systemic shocks' in their transition to market economies. This is the IMF's contribution to the debate on how to get money to Russia with less stringent conditions than usual for an IMF standby agreement. The finance would be part of an international aid package which the Group of Seven leading industrial nations is working on. But officials said the facility - which might provide more than Dollars 2bn to Russia - was only one of several options being considered by the G7. The way is also now clear for commercial banks, grouped in the London Club, to negotiate a similar rescheduling of private Russian debt servicing obligations later this year. Mr Yeltsin will be flanked at today's summit by Mr Shokhin and Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister who is involved in a fierce domestic struggle for mastery over monetary policy with Mr Viktor Geraschenko, the chairman of the central bank. Mr Clinton is expected to mark his first summit by emphasising US desire to offer practical support but limiting the hard currency on offer to the Dollars 1bn or so which can be found from the existing US budget. The US is keen to target Russia's fledgling private sector for special attention while underlining the US commitment to a broader aid effort from the G7 countries, including Japan which is hosting this year's G7 summit in Tokyo this summer. Japanese diplomats say Tokyo will increase its contribution to a G7 aid package, despite a continuing dispute with Russia over the future of the Kurile islands which has limited Japanese involvement to date. Estimates of Russia's total foreign debt range from Dollars 80bn to Dollars 87bn, of which Dollars 38bn is owed to official creditors and another Dollars 20bn to commercial banks. The rest mainly comprises unsecured trade and other credits. Page 3 Clinton tries to lead out the cavalry</p>

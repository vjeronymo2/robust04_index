			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Islamic Consultative Assembly [Majles]  deputies, in a statement today during an open session, condemned  the bestial act of the monafeqin [Mojahedin-e Khalq  Organization, MKO] in violating Muslim sanctities and bathing in  blood the innocent pilgrims to the immaculate grave of His  Holiness Imam Reza, peace be upon him. In their statement, the  Majles deputies, criticizing the silence of international forums  regarding that atrocity, call upon world parliaments to condemn  the perpetrators of the crime, especially America. The  statement stressed the need for swift identification and  punishment of the crime's perptrators.    According to a report by our parliamentary correspondent,  Majles speaker Nateq-Nuri considered the monafeqin's crime on  the day of Ashura at the immaculate shrine of the Eighth Imam to  stem from their despair and hopelessness regarding their future.  He pointed out: Such incidents make our nation and government  more united and determined in the fight with world arrogance and  its mercenaries.    The Majles speaker stressed: The crime in Mashhad does not  only belong to the monafeqin; they are not the only ones to be  condemned. They are tools in the hands of world arrogance and  all governments that somehow support the process of creating  discord. The monafeqin are involved in that atrocity.    Criticizing the untrue statements made by Western  authorities  concerning the fight against terrorism, he added: Until the  special UN committee for human rights and its representatives,  including Galindo Pohl, make the Mashhad atrocity the axis of  their investigation, we shall have no confidence in them.

			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television No apologies for picking an old film tonight. If . . . (10pm Channel 4) stands head and shoulders above most of the cinematic dross foisted on us over the past few days. The director Lindsay Anderson once upbraided me for apologising for my excessive enthusiasm, so let me declare defiantly that this is simply one of the best British movies ever. Anderson's 1968 tale of public school revolt is funny, surrealistic, even romantic. It has been interpreted at various levels, notably as an attack on the Establishment, which of course it is; but the director himself pointed out that it was nothing so crass as a mere hatchet job on public schools - the thread of nostalgia is deliberate. However you take it, direction and acting are superb, not just from Malcolm McDowell's non-conformist schoolboy but a host of stalwart performers like Peter Jeffrey (a blandly fatuous headmaster), Graham Crowden (a convincingly dotty history master) and Arthur Lowe's bumbling housemaster, piping Purcell's 'Fairest Isle' with his wife in the dark watches of the loveless night.</p>

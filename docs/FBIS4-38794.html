			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Mykhaylo Kolomiyets: </F> "Ukraine Is Concluding the Most Advantageous Oil Agreement in  Its History"]    [Text] As became known to the UKRINFORM correspondent from  reliable sources, Ukraine's acting Prime Minister Yukhym  Zvyahilskyy had reached an agreement with Western investors on  granting Ukraine an interest-free credit for purchasing crude  oil.    Thus, it has become possible to purchase 12 million tonnes  of  crude oil, mainly from Russia, at $60 per tonne.    This is the lowest price at which Ukraine has ever managed  to  import oil after the prices of energy sources within the former  USSR were raised to those prevailing in the world. Petroleum  products from this oil will, primarily, be channeled for  satisfying the needs of the country's agriculture. Owing to  this contract, the problem of fuel for agricultural needs has  largely been resolved. This will make it possible to conduct  the entire necessary cycle of agricultural work in full and in  good time.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Outrage unites French political parties INSIDE a National Assembly virtually surrounded by protesting farmers, France's political parties yesterday sought to outdo each other in opposing the European Commission's draft Gatt accord with the US on agricultural trade. Opposition complaints that Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, was seeking to turn the anti-Gatt consensus into a vote of confidence in his weak Socialist government obscured the fact that the only real point dividing the two sides was whether a French veto of the deal should be threatened now or later. Mr Beregovoy's declaration, which was approved last night with Communist support, committed the government 'to veto any draft agreement contrary to France's fundamental interests'. The prime minister had been anxious to leave himself, and President Francois Mitterrand, who had wisely left town for a Middle East trip, some flexibility in the possible use of a veto which would provoke a crisis in the European Community. But, pushed by the opposition, he pledged that France would use its veto at any stage once it was presented with a legal text enshrining the draft Gatt deal. Mr Alain Juppe, secretary-general of the RPR Gaullists, fearful of a hot political potato landing in the lap of a right-wing government after next March's elections, had urged that the government immediately inform its EC partners that it could not accept the deal and insist talks with the US were re-opened. Even while supporting his own party in power, Mr Laurent Fabius, the Socialist party leader, said: 'There are moments when one has to say No (to the Gatt deal), and this is one of them.' Yesterday's debate may yet prove to be the point of maximum French political fury, with protesting farmers outside putting pressure on politicians who only learnt during the session that Brussels considered the Gatt deal compatible with reform of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy. The main feature of the debate was an anti-Americanism, which was predictably most virulent from Mr Andre Lajoinie, leader of the Communist deputies. He denounced 'the American attack on world trade'. Far from winning reciprocal US concessions in non-farm aspects of the Gatt negotiations, EC agricultural concessions would only 'reinforce American arrogance'. The only reason why the Communists backed the government was that they are the party with most to fear from a premature election. But most other party leaders joined in the denunciation of the US, which Mr Juppe accused of wanting to 'dominate the world food market'. Other targets were Britain and New Zealand. Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, leader of the centrist UDC coalition, took a side-swipe at Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, whom he said should be 'sanctioned for his scandalous behaviour' in forcing the Gatt deal through as a member of the current British presidency of the EC. He added that if the New Zealand prime minister could hail the Gatt accord as 'exceptionally good', it must be 'exceptionally bad for France'. The left, in the persons of Mr Fabius and Mr Lajoinie, hit back at the right, but hardly in terms that would provide comfort for proponents of free farm trade. Both men denounced past conservative French governments for acquiescing, in 1962, in duty-free entry for US animal feeds into the EC, while Mr Lajoinie said it had been a mistake to have let the UK and its former colonies dilute Community preference when Britain joined the EC in the early 1970s. From the opposition and government alike came a common plea for France's EC partners to show the sort of solidarity that France had shown to Britain over that country's EC budget rebate and to Germany over its unification.</p>

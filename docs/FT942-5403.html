			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Vodafone rings the changes - The week ahead VODAFONE, the UK mobile communications group, is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits of between Pounds 350m and Pounds 370m on Tuesday, compared with Pounds 322m last year. Vodafone's shares have been depressed by the recent malaise in the telecom sector. BAA announces its results on Monday when pre-tax profare expected of around Pounds 320m, up from Pounds 285m the previous year, reflecting buoyant airport passenger traffic. ANGLIAN WATER is expected to return a 2 per cent advance to Pounds 190.2m when it announces annual results on Tuesday. There will be little to shock here, with declining industrial demand offsetting price increase gains. Anglian is expected to be somewhat behind the sector in cost-cutting in spite of its corporate shake-up. The dividend is expected to increase by 7 per cent to 22.7p. NORTHERN FOODS, the former stock market favourite, is expected to show a modest increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 153m to between Pounds 155m and Pounds 160m when it announces its full-year figures on Wednesday. The results will reflect continued problems in the meat business and the decline of doorstep milk deliveries. But another good performance is expected in chilled foods. RACAL: A poor performance by its data communications business is expected to hold back results at Racal, which also reports on Wednesday. Flat pre-tax profits of around Pounds 51m are expected before a Pounds 20.2m provision announced already. ELECTROCOMPONENTS: On the same day, Electrocomponents is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits of around Pounds 71m compared with Pounds 51.9m the previous year. The group should have been a beneficiary of the recent upturn in UK manufacturing activity. SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric: Also on Wednesday, Scottish Hydro-Electric is expected to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 165m compared with Pounds 146.4m last year. PILKINGTON: On Thursday Pilkington, the glass group, is expected to announced that pre-tax profits more than doubled in the year to March to around Pounds 105m, compared with Pounds 41m in 1993. The figures will be buoyed by exceptional items, primarily the proceeds from the sale of spectacle lens business, Sola. Profits before exceptional items should amount to around Pounds 65m. Further exceptional profits will be written into present-year forecasts following Friday's sale of Pilkington Insulation and the expected flotation of its Australian interests. CHUBB SECURITY: Also on Thursday Chubb Security, the electronic alarm and locks group, is expected to reveal pre-tax profits of around Pounds 76m (Pounds 64.2m) for the year to April. The company came out with 37 per cent profits growth at the interim stage. POWERGEN'S full-year profits on Thursday are expected to have increased to about Pounds 470m from Pounds 425m last year helped by fuel and other cost savings. LONRHO'S aloof approach has left the City with little guidance on the interim results out on Thursday. Estimates are for pre-tax profits before exceptional items rising from Pounds 22m to Pounds 32m. The City will be looking for insights into plans for revamping Lonrho's expensive financing arrangements. The dividend is likely to be maintained at 2p. BRITISH LAND, the property company headed by John Ritblat, is likely to announce on Thursday that its asset value has increased from Pounds 3.07 to about Pounds 4 a share in the year to March. British Land's relatively high gearing has helped it to benefit strongly from the sharp increase in the value of investment property over the past year. Pre-tax profits, which last year stood at Pounds 28.5m, are likely to increase to around Pounds 50m.</p>

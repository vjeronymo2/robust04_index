			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Zhagel report: "New Finance Minister Called `Mr. No' </F> Behind His Back"]    [Text] News agencies have disseminated a report on a  Russian presidential edict appointing Sergey Konstantinovich  Dubinin, who had hitherto been first deputy finance minister, as  acting finance minister.    The question naturally arises of why S. Dubinin has been  appointed in an acting capacity rather than as finance minister  straightaway. Will a new candidate for this important post  "emerge" in a few days' time?    But, according to confidential information obtained from the  presidential entourage, S. Dubinin will in due course be  confirmed as finance minister. And the "acting" formula  creates, as it were, a diplomatic pause, during which the public  reaction to the new appointment can be assessed. After all,  this key government post is now coming in for heightened  attention from the media.    I think that the reaction to S. Dubinin's appointment as  finance minister will be positive or, at any rate, calm. After  all, he was recommended by Boris Fedorov. Moreover, it was  under B. Fedorov that S. Dubinin came to the Finance Ministry as  first deputy, and he has always been seen as a man close to the  former minister, which guarantees at least in general terms the  maintenance of a tough financial policy.    Admittedly, reacting positively to his successor, B. Fedorov  nonetheless voiced doubt that he would be able to withstand the  pressure from top government officials who, following the  obvious change in economic policy, will start demanding more and  more loans from the Finance Ministry. But it should be stressed  at this point that whenever B. Fedorov went anywhere on a trip,  he always left S. Dubinin "in charge." And it was during these  periods that the latter earned the moniker "Mr. No!" -- a clear  reference to his uncompromising attitude as regards various  financial demands.    Incidentally, it is always easier to refuse when you are a  deputy -- even a first deputy -- than when you are a minister.  But I think that we will very soon learn whether the new  minister's nickname is accurate or not.    Unfortunately, we do not yet know the view of S. Dubinin  himself on how financial policy will turn out in the coming  year. After all, the acting finance minister's first day in his  new job was spent in interminable conferences and consultations  with his immediate entourage. At any rate, that was what his  office told us.    We can also report that S. Dubinin is 43 and a doctor of  economic sciences. He was at one time a senior lecturer at the  Moscow State University Economics Faculty, worked in the  president's apparatus in 1991-1992, and later worked as deputy  chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Economic  Cooperation with the Commonwealth Member States before finally  moving to the Finance Ministry in March 1993.</p>

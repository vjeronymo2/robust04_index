			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESSMAN LISTENS  </P> <P> I just returned from a brief business trip to Washington, D.C., and took the  opportunity to "drop in" on several congressmen. I think your readers would be  pleased to know that, at least in one instance, it appears the taxpayers are  finally getting their money's worth.  </P> <P> This particular congressman didn't have the luxurious, expensive furnishings  like many others. His staff was hard at work, not talking to potential Friday  night dates on the telephone, as I saw in another office. There were mounds of  paper work on his desk and on those of his staff, too.  </P> <P> Most important, this congressman took the time to do more than simply shake  hands and quickly retreat to his office. He took time out from his obviously  busy schedule to listen -- yes, listen -- to my concerns. And in his dignified  but not stuffy manner, he expressed genuine interest.  </P> <P> Who is this extraordinary congressman? Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad). And, in  case you're wondering, no, I'm not a registered Republican. No one asked nor  paid me to write this letter. I'm not even in Congressman Packard's district. I  just wish I was.  </P> <P> MARK S. SCHWARTZ  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

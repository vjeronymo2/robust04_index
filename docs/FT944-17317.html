			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Quote . . . unquote I have noted your periodic advice about establishing losses on shares of negligible value; however, I assume this applies only to quoted shares. What is the position, please, concerning unquoted shares? There is no difference in principle between quoted shares (or shares which had been quoted before the price collapsed) and shares which have never had a quotation. The difference in practice is merely that it is usually easier for a shareholder to establish the facts for a public company, without having to submit documentary evidence of the shareholding's negligible value. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

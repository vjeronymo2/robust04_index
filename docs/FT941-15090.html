			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Concerns of oversupply caused by last Friday's announcement that the finance ministry would be selling government bonds outright for the first time in 11 years, are expected to continue this week. The yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark, which closed up 11 basis points at the week's high of 3.165 per cent on Friday, may rise further as investors take profits on their positions. The government, which usually sells bonds with repurchase agreements, expects to sell about Y900bn to fund the forthcoming economic support package. The MoF sold Y800bn worth of bonds without repurchase agreements in 1978, Y300bn in 1981, Y1,500bn in 1982 and Y900bn in 1983. The outright sales via the Bank of Japan could start this week. Meanwhile, hopes of a discount rate cut have receded due to the recent strength on the stock market. The Nikkei index gained 4.7 per cent last week on active buying by foreign investors, and analysts expect fund flows into Tokyo could last if Asian stock markets continue to slide. Investors are expected to focus on political developments this week. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa wants to push the political reform bill through on Wednesday. A delay in the upper house could further postpone the economic stimulus package, due to be announced Thursday.</p>

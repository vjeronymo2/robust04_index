			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Cost of motor and house insurance drops The cost of motor and house insurance is tumbling as a result of increasingly intense price skirmishes between UK insurance companies. Big insurance groups confirmed yesterday that premiums on many motor, building and house content policies had fallen significantly in the past year. The drop reflects the increased profitability of underwriting domestic insurance, after two years of sharp premium increases. But it suggests higher profit margins will not be sustained, particularly as the growth of the direct insurers, which sell by telephone and advertising, forces prices down. For consumers, recent falls may be reversed by the government's imposition of 2.5 per cent insurance premium tax this month - although some companies are absorbing at least a part of the increase. A survey by investment bank SG Warburg this week suggested motor premiums will drop about 5 per cent this year. Similarly, research by AA Insurance suggested that if the insurance tax is excluded, house building and contents premiums dropped 2 per cent between July and October. Although companies say premiums have fallen partly because of improved risk assesment - and not all motor or house premiums will fall - price is becoming increasingly important, particularly in motor insurance. Direct Line, which last year became the UK's biggest motor insurer, said: 'Competition is hotting up. Consumers should see very competitive rates over the coming year.' Ms Gill Clark, marketing manager at Eagle Star, said premiums on the company's motor and contents policies had fallen between 5 per cent and 8 per cent in the past year. Falling prices might persuade building societies to set up their own insurance operations if, as expected, they are given the legal freedom to do so, rather than sell composite insurers' policies. Mr Desmond Hudson, Britannia building society's head of lending, said his group was considering forming its own Lloyd's of London syndicate to underwrite policies.</p>

In his words, Chernomyrdin has managed to persuade the  President and form a cabinet of his own choice, an indication of  a gradual shift of federal authority to the Prime Minister.    For his part, RC public relations officer Kirill Ignatiyev  said the party would ensure political support to its five  ministers in the cabinet carrying out RC goals.    These are Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays, Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev, Science and Education Minister Boris Saltykov,  Minister of Culture Yevgeniy Sidorov and Environment Minister  Viktor Danilov-Danilyan.    Saltykov in turn has said he will remain in the cabinet as  long as he can implement reforms within his area of  responsibility.    Yushenkov hopes the Russian President is well aware of how  fatal it will be to wind up reforms and will be able to muster  up enough strength to take appropriate decisions.    He said that under the constitution, Yeltsin can name a  Prime  Minister but not individual ministers.    The RC is ready to bring a non-confidence motion against the  government if it adopts unacceptable resolutions including one  on the budget, Yushenkov said.</p>

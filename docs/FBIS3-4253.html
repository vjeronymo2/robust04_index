Thousands of workers at the US$3.7  billion (HK$28.5 billion) Ertan Dam project on the lower reaches  of the Yalong River in southwestern China were involved in the  strike that ended on March 15, the SUNDAY MORNING POST has  learned. Officials at the plant, who declined to be named,  confirmed the strike had ended but refused to provide further  details. The project, perhaps the largest foreign joint venture  in China, is a partnership between German companies Philipp  Holzmann and Hochtief AG, together with Ge Zhou Ba (Chinese Dam  Company). Sources say at least two of the partners are bidding  on work at Three Gorges.    The bitter labour dispute, which has not been mentioned in  the official Chinese media, illustrates the kind of widespread  worker unrest raging across the country. Official Chinese  sources have confirmed 10,000 industrial actions nationwide in  1993. Despite a vigorous campaign to curtail illicit labour  groups, including the arrest of suspected leaders, direct action  by workers is gaining popularity. "There is clearly widespread,  spontaneous industrial unrest emerging in China," Robin Munro,  director of Human Rights Watch/Asia (formerly Asia Watch) said.  "These are wildcat strikes, not organised actions." A  crackdown on labour groups has widened in recent months to  single out worker leaders, according to a new Human Rights Watch  report, China: New Arrests Linked To Worker Rights. The report  details the cases of four labour organisers arrested this month,  with three -- Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbin and Wang Jiaqi --  still in custody.    A U.S. State Department official told the SUNDAY MORNING  POST  that worker leaders had come under increasing government  scrutiny since the crushing of the student democracy movement in  1989. Documents released by Human Rights Watch suggest the  grassroots network of labour activists in China is developing  into a more cohesive organisation. A group calling itself the  League for the Protection of the Rights of the Working People of  the People's Republic of China released a five-point petition on  workers' rights. Among the demands were: the establishment of a  nationwide worker network offering information and support  services; an arbitration system to settle labour disputes;  protection of worker rights; the right of peasants to form  unions; the public declaration of the income of officials, all  the way up to the Politburo leadership; protection of migrant  workers; workers in joint ventures receiving the right to form  unions and conduct collective bargaining.    Mr Munro said labour activists, although small in number,  were beginning to form a formidable network. "Rather than  espouse more abstract notions of democracy, many of them are now  talking about worker rights and labour concerns." Under a 1992  law, collective bargaining in China is only permitted by workers  in private enterprises, which involve less than five per cent of  the Chinese workforce. All labour activity by law must be  through the government-controlled All-China Federation of Trade  Unions.    At Ertan Dam, workers risk their lives daily in gruelling  conditions for the equivalent of $200 to $300 per month. The  massive excavation project has been plagued by industrial  accidents. Many workers have been killed. Workers at the plant  had reportedly been promised bonuses for speeding up work on the  dam and to complete a water diversion tunnel before the arrival  of Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua. The dispute was sparked  when payments were less than workers expected. It was resolved  only after salaries were raised to $300 to $400 per month, a  source said. Costs for the massive Three Gorges Dam project  were estimated to be at least 50 billion yuan in 1990.    Philipp Holzmann, among the world's largest construction  companies, was recently among the bidders for a share of the  work on the West Kowloon Expressway.</p>

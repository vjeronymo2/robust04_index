			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (9): To advise and to guide - Brokers are being pushed in new directions THE reinsurance broker is becoming less a clearing house for capital and capacity and more a professional adviser active in the development of the market. Clients demand more evidence of the broker's value than a promise to improve on the rates, though the ability to find capacity at a reasonable price remains important. In a market where capacity is tight and solvency is a key issue, the broker can provide a real service to the ceding insurer and also to the reinsurer who is looking for catastrophe protection of its book. Those who do not are likely to find their business dwindling in the face of competitive pressure. Brokers compete with reinsurers for business. Ceding insurers do not have to use a broker; traditionally the professional reinsurance companies, mainly based in continental Europe, have written most of their business directly. One of the main reasons has been their close relationship with their domestic, direct insurance market. Dieter Losse, chairman and chief executive of the respected international reinsurance broker Greig Fester, said: 'The serious brokers are all clear that they can only justify their position in the chain if they are genuinely adding value.' In territories, such as the UK, which are broker markets, the reinsurers have been happy to take business from brokers with the proviso that the broker must not block the relationship between the direct insurer and the reinsurer. Reinsurers are increasingly insisting on knowing just what risks they are taking. Cedants have to submit to scrutiny or they find themselves short of reinsurance, according to European insurance analyst Tim Dawson at Lehman Brothers in London. 'The flight to quality works both ways. Reinsurers can pick and choose from which insurers they want to accept business.' Michael White, deputy chairman of international reinsurance at Willis Corroon, also says that over the last two or three years brokers have had to spend far more time on renewal analysing the business and objectives of the cedant and discussing the best approaches to the business. Clients and potential clients demand more evidence of the broker's value than a promise to improve on the rates. One way that brokers have been enhancing their value to cedants has been through the development of research and analytical tools to help them understand the implications of what they have been writing in terms of catastrophe exposures, the geographical spread of their book in terms of perceived natural hazards. Explained Dieter Losse: 'The broker is in a unique position to help the insurer understand the nature of their exposures from the reinsurance perspective, particularly in a hard market, and advise on a range of options.' In addition to preparing and placing programmes, brokers may handle claims and help prepare documentation in response to the reinsurers' requirements for increased information. They also monitor the solvency of reinsurers and reinsurance markets. The need for specialist skills is increasing reflected in the results of firms such as Greig Fester and another London based international reinsurance broker, the Benfield Group. Since 1988, Greig Fester's turnover has risen from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 42.8m at the end of 1992. Benfield, which is an excess of loss specialist, nearly tripled its turnover between 1990 and June 1992 with a rise from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 39.8m. Benfield, under its chairman Matthew Harding, plays an active role in developing the excess of loss market since the demise of the notorious LMX, or London market spiral. For example, it insists that the ceding insurer takes a co-insurance of at least 10 perent of any programme. In this way, Matthew Harding believes, the direct insurer retains an interest in keeping claims down, which in turn pleases the reinsurer and promotes a good, long term relationship. And against the trend of brokers distancing themselves from underwriting activities, Benfield has now announced that, subject to approval from the Department of Trade and Industry, it will set up a UK based excess of loss reinsurer. The new company will have fully paid up capital of Pounds 50m (Dollars 75m) and is intended to begin underwriting effect from January 1, 1994. No other details have yet been released, but it seems almost certain that the co-insurance principle that Benfield applies to its brokered programmes will be a fundamental part of the new company's underwriting policy. Direct insurers also look to their reinsurance brokers to help in analysing security, particularly in a hard market when they may not be able to get all the capacity they want from their traditional sources, reinsurers. Solvency is a considerable worry, following the collapse of once important London market firms and problems in the Scandinavian market. New capital has been coming into the reinsurance market, but its willingness to provide continuity is untested. Faced with an insolvent reinsurer, the broker not only has an unhappy client, for whom finding replacement cover may be difficult in a hard market, but it also faces an administrative headache. The London market system of 'net accounting', which is highly convenient when all the parties are solvent, is a source of major problems for the broker if one of them fails. Leading insolvency counsel Gabriel Moss QC explains that typically the broker acts as a 'clearing house' for payments between insurers and reinsurers. However, in an insolvency, only the principals to the contract, the insurer and reinsurer, are permitted to set-off the amounts they have outstanding with each other. The broker's standing effectively vanishes. Increased expectations from clients coupled with competition for scarce reinsurance capacity is putting pressure on the skills of brokers and further rationalisation is likely in the London market. Although there is no register of reinsurance brokers as such, the fall in the number of Lloyd's brokers to 218 with 42 resignations and only five admissions last year is likely to indicate the trend. Those who can offer the expertise will play an essential role maintaining the reinsurance market. Lee Coppack is an insurance writer and analyst</p>

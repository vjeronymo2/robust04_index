			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. GERMANS RUSH TO WITHDRAW SAVINGS BEFORE UNITY MOVE  </P> <P> East Germans rushed to their banks Wednesday to withdraw their savings, hoping  to get the best possible exchange rate with the mighty West German mark.  </P> <P> While official delegations from both Germanys met behind closed doors in East  Berlin to forge a plan for monetary union, worried people stood in long lines  outside their banks, eager to rescue some of their savings.  </P> <P> The high-level negotiations now taking place are based on a Bonn proposal for a  basic 1-for-1 exchange rate for wages and pensions.  </P> <P> However, savings accounts would be swapped 1-for-1 only up to 4,000 marks.  Under the current exchange rate, 4,000 East German marks is worth about $767,  while 4,000 West German marks is worth about $2,300.  </P> <P> Savings above 4,000 marks would be exchanged at a 2-for-1 rate.  </P> <P> "I've withdrawn all but 4,000 marks and am putting the rest in the account of a  friend," said a construction worker on East Berlin's Alexander Square who  refused to be identified. "That way we can both end up with more."  </P></p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: No volte face on N Ireland Sir, Observer's talk of 'an impressive volte face' in my speech to the Ireland Fund on Wednesday, is odd ('Troops in or out?'). As I said in my speech, we put the troops into Northern Ireland in 1969 to protect the Catholics against the B-Specials. When I walked through cheering crowds down the Falls and Crumlin Roads a few weeks later, I was accompanied by two leading members of the IRA. The terrorist problem developed in 1970 when Labour lost power. In March 1972 I supported Harold Wilson's decision to talk in Dublin with Joe Cahill of the IRA, and I supported William Whitelaw's official talks with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuiness in July 1972. Perhaps Observer was asleep during this part of my speech. Too much Bushmills? Denis Healey, House of Lords, London SW1</p>

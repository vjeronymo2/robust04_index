			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (26): Cash-rich Volvo wary of new alliances - Sweden: Hugh Carnegy finds the two niche producers profitable but introspective Volvo and Saab Automobile, Sweden's two car manufacturers, are once again savouring the rare taste of profits after several turbulent years of losses, heavy restructuring and, in Volvo's case, the trauma in 1993 of its aborted plan to merge with France's Renault. Volvo, still Sweden's biggest manufacturing company, is at group level enjoying a resurgence of profitability to rival the pre-recession boom days of the mid- and late-1980s. In the first six months it posted a pre-tax profit of SKr9.02bn, compared with SKr380m in the same period last year. Although inflated by capital gains of SKr4.08bn, the operating profit of SKr4.47bn was far ahead of the SKr166m returned in the first half of 1993. A 20 per cent rise in unit car sales during the period, to 189,000, was an important factor in the group result. The car division, which has stacked up heavy losses throughout the 1990s, finally returned to an operating profit of SKr1.47bn from a loss on SKr70bn last time. Sales were particularly strong in the US, Volvo's biggest market, where the company outsells all other European car makers. At Saab, the picture is less dramatic but no less significant, given the trouble it has been in since the US's General Motors bought a half share in the company in late 1989 and took over the management. In the second quarter, as the benefits fed through of the successful launch last year of the new Saab 900 car, Saab produced its first quarterly profit for five years, and the first since GM became joint owner with Sweden's Saab-Scania. This allowed Saab to show a first-half profit of SKr104m - a modest figure, but a very welcome relief for GM after accumulated losses since 1989 of SKr11bn and capital injections of more than SKr8bn. But if the two companies are now able to look to the future with more confidence than they have for some time, there remain big question-marks over what shape they will be in when the motor industry cycle takes its next downturn. Volvo, in particular, is still in the process of a deep strategic rethink, following the collapse last December of the plan to merge with Renault. Pehr Gyllenhammar, the former chairman, wanted, in effect, to transform Volvo into a diversified industrial group through moving the car, truck and bus operations into a merged Renault-Volvo operation in which Volvo would have a 35 per cent share. The two companies, which had operated a strategic alliance since 1990, were to develop jointly their new car model ranges for the mid- and late-1990s, sharing as many systems and components as possible, including common 'platforms' or chassis. The rejection of the merger by shareholders and senior management - and the resignation of Mr Gyllenhammar - threw previous assumptions about product development into the air. The new Volvo chairman, Bert-Olof Svanholm, says it set back the product development process at least six months. Under Mr Svanholm and Soren Gyll, the chief executive, Volvo's new overall strategy is to sell off up to SKr40bn worth of non-core assets and concentrate on its core car and truck operations. This, along with resurgent profits flow not expected to peak until 1996, will provide the financial backing needed to fund the next generation of cars and trucks. 'Volvo will be an extremely cash-rich company,' says Colin Whitbread, motor industry analyst with Swiss Bank Corporation in London. 'It will probably be the strongest in balance-sheet terms in the industry in Europe. The question is: what will they do with the money to earn a better return than they get at present from their other assets?' Volvo says it will not complete until later this year a thorough reappraisal launched after it broke off the Renault marriage of how to develop its present narrow range of three basic car models, the medium-sized 400 series, the new 850 and the largest 900 series. The underlying aim is to break out of Volvo's traditional limited market appeal based on safe, reliable but rather dull cars. A significant start on producing more dynamic models, giving greater 'driving pleasure', was made with the launch of the 850, the sportiest full-sized saloon ever made by Volvo. A new medium-sized car, code-named the V40, is due out within 18 months. But Volvo has some way to go to establish a sportier style while it is facing ever stiffer competition in its traditional stronghold of safety-first, spacious estate cars from a range of rivals. Volvo has also missed out on other opportunities - such as the big growth in the US and Europe of 'people carrier' minivans (like the Renault Espace) and four-wheel-drive Land Rover-type vehicles. It also missed the surge in popularity in Europe of diesel-engined cars. The company faces a dilemma in addressing these issues. It does not have ambitions to go beyond being a niche car producer. With a total production capacity likely to hit 425,000 cars a year next year, against expected 1994 sales of 350,000, it is approaching capacity limits, but does not intend big production increases that could lead to dangerous overcapacity it experienced in the early 1990s. But such relatively small output figures mean Volvo faces the problem of how to produce strong profit margins while carrying high units costs  - especially if it wants to launch wholly new models such as a Volvo people carrier. This raises the question of whether Volvo will look for a new partner to succeed Renault. Such a move would match conventional motor-industry wisdom that producers must share high development costs to get full returns. But Volvo does not seem in the mood for another major alliance  - even if a partner were readily available. It does already have a venture in the Netherlands with Mitsubishi of Japan and the Dutch government, which produces the 400 series. This venture will make the V40. But beyond that, the signals from Volvo are that it will seek co-operation agreements with other manufactures on parts of cars, such as engines, gear boxes and other systems, rather than a new strategic alliance. Meanwhile at Saab, the priority is to consolidate the return to profit, rather than to take any bold new leaps. Saab this year expects to sell 94,000 cars, well up from last year's 73,600 and comfortably over the new break-even level of 83,000. The next step after the all-new 900 model is to revamp the bigger 9000, a development which is now under way. But Saab has yet to say whether it will go ahead with a third model line GM once talked of adding to the range.</p>

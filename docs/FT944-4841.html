			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Euro-security summit fails to find accord over Bosnia A European security summit of more than 50 nations disagreed over the conflict in Bosnia yesterday in an ominous sign that international consensus on the war is crumbling. Bosnia's Moslem-led government objected to a passionate ceasefire appeal by German chancellor Helmut Kohl on the ground that the wording did not specify that the Serbs were the aggressors. Earlier, Russia had blocked a series of resolutions it viewed as unfair to the Serbs. Delegates at the summit in Budapest said it was the most spectacular diplomatic failure at an international gathering since the end of the cold war. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is supposed to be building a new security grouping of all countries from Vancouver to Vladivostok, was unable to reach agreement over the fighting in Bihac, the northern enclave of Bosnia virtually surrounded by the Serbs. Mr Kohl, who was encouraged to make his ceasefire call by Russian president Boris Yeltsin, pleaded unsuccessfully with Bosnian officials to lift their objections, in a dramatic closing session of the summit. 'I do not want to go home and to answer the questions over what we did about Bihac,' the German leader said. '(Shall I say) that we talked and got bogged down in formalities?' Mr Kohl said he understood the Bosnian government's view that the wording of the ceasefire was not ideal, but he insisted: 'Only 300 kilometres from here, people are dying of hunger . . . and it will be catastrophic if we don't seal an armistice and provide some help.' In the end, the summit's Hungarian presidency issued an informal appeal for a ceasefire which was said to reflect the views of most, but not all, participants at the summit. Bosnian officials said they could not accept the ceasefire call because it made no distinction between the internationally recognised government of the republic and the Serb forces that occupy about 70 per cent of its territory. The Bosnian delegation complained bitterly that Moscow had vetoed a separate series of statements running to thousands of words that would have called for an end to Serb encroachments on Bihac and condemned the behaviour of Serbia, which has been suspended from the CSCE. Six pages of carefully drafted pronouncements were discarded after Russian officials called them unbalanced and unfair to the Serbs. The resolutions would have condemned the Serbs of Bosnia and Croatia for encroaching on a nominally UN-protected area in the Bihac enclave, and called on the 'aggressors' to accept a ceasefire.

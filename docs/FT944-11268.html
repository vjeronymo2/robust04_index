			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up Pakistan Regent Pacific, the Hong Kong based Asian fund management and financial services group, has formed a joint venture with the National Investment Trust of Pakistan and Dar-al Maal Al-Islami Group of Saudi Arabia for an asset management and financial services company in Karachi. The Emerging Investment Company, with a paid up capital of Rp100m (Dollars 3.3m), plans to float both closed-end and open-end investment vehicles in Pakistan, and hopes to launch the first closed-end fund by the end of the year. South Africa The International Finance Corporation launched new stock indices for South Africa from November 1, thereby increasing its coverage of emerging markets to 26. The new indices - global and investable - are weighted by market capitalisation. South Africa, with a per capita GNP of Dollars 2,670 at the end of 1992 qualifies as an emerging market under World Bank definitions, and as such is the world's largest with a total market cap of Dollars 218bn. China The People's Bank of China is understood to be considering opening 10 more major cities, including Beijing, to foreign financial institutions. The insurance market in Shanghai would also be opened up to foreign companies on an experimental basis. India The finance ministry has announced new rules for takeovers saying buyers must disclose intentions ahead of acquiring large blocks of shares in target companies. Edited by John Pitt.

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Forte/Compass On the surface, it seems curious that Forte should be selling a contract catering business which has stood it in good stead through the recession. It is a low margin operation, however, and one which requires capital spending, especially on the in-flight catering side. The negotiations centre on a price of more than Pounds 500m which means that the sale will be scarcely dilutive and will free resources for Forte to expand into European hotels. If its share price barely responded to yesterday's announcement, it is partly because the move has been strongly rumoured for some time. Besides, Forte's European hotel plans are still vague. The recession exposed the weakness inherent in the UK concentration of its hotel business which is in stark contrast to Queens Moat. Whether Forte can successfully hedge itself against the next UK recession depends on exactly what it manages to buy in Europe and at what price. Compass is expected to pay some Pounds 450m for the part of the catering division it is buying. That is a large morsel which will require a hefty rights issue as well as an increase in debt that will leave it once again with negative net worth. The Forte division may represent a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and Compass can almost certainly squeeze out some extra margin. But the need for continuing capital spend leaves the price looking somewhat ambitious.</p>

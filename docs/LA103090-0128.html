			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to Reorganize: The nation's biggest securities firm  announced a sweeping management overhaul that could lead to several hundred job  cuts. The reorganization replaces Merrill's separate consumer and capital  markets groups with six business divisions, eliminating a structure in place  since 1984. It also creates a mechanism for the replacement of Chairman and  Chief Executive William A. Schreyer, who will retire in 1993 at 65.  </P></p>

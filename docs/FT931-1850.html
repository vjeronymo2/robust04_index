			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Tanker routes to change BRITISH shipowners yesterday launched a voluntary code for routeing oil tankers away from the most environmentally-sensitive areas around the shores of the UK. The Chamber of Shipping proposed that oil-laden tankers keep away from 12 of the most sensitive areas in the wake of the Braer tanker disaster off the Shetland Islands. A task force was set up by the chamber following the incident in January, when the tanker ran aground and spilled 84,000 tonnes of oil. Mr Les Atkinson, chairman of BP Shipping who headed the task force, said: 'The code essentially deals with major aspects of poor quality of operation. 'Compliance with this is not going to solve all incidents of tanker pollution, by any manner of means, but it should help a great deal.' The task force looked at 15 environmentally-sensitive areas around the coast where existing routeing procedures did not offer specific advice for tankers.</p>

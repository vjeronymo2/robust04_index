			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (20): Recession the watchword - Country Analysis, The UK / Some companies slipped deeply into the doldrums RECESSION has been the watchword for UK companies this year as the economy continued to contract in the first six months. There was a slight rally in the third quarter, thanks to the oil sector. Yet, because the London stock market looks several months ahead - in this case to recovery - the value of UK stocks in the survey tended to rise from their cheap levels on the way into recession, compounded by the Gulf crisis. Taking the snapshot dates for the FT500, the FT-SE 100 index rose by more than 10 per cent between the end of June last year and September 30 this year, although it then fell back. The rise helps to explain the additional 16 UK companies in the top 500, taking the total to 181 (not counting double listings such as the survey leader Royal Dutch/Shell). This is almost three times the representation of France and Germany, where far fewer companies are quoted and the takeover-based trends towards multi-nationalism and concentrations within industries are far weaker. Yet whatever the hopes for recovery in some sectors, others slipped deeply into the doldrums and this is reflected in their declining rankings. The testing conditions also vindicated a few theories about recession-resilience and highlighted the quality of some individual managements. Perhaps the worst affected family of sectors was property and building, with repercussions to insurance through the underwriting losses on mortgage indemnities. Even Land Securities, the largest and most robust property company in the UK and one of the very few to manage an interim profits increase, drifted down from 94 to 101. Ladbroke, the hotel and leisure group, and Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, which is also involved in construction, were vulnerable not only through their property divisions, but through stretched balance sheets. Both had rights issues - another theme for the year. The previous annual record of nearly Pounds 7bn raised in 1987 was surpassed within the first eight months of this year. Companies took advantage of rising share prices to repair balance sheets or to strengthen their hands in bids for struggling targets. By December, about Pounds 9bn had been raised. But not all the calls were well received, particularly as heavily tapped institutions became more selective. Most ignominious was the less than 5 per cent take-up of British Aerospace's Pounds 432m issue. Construction companies were fairly well represented in the rights issue roll, but the leading house builders were not among them after a bad year on all fronts - including their share prices. Tarmac and Wimpey, duly fell down the rankings as private housing starts sank to about 130,000 this year, about 90,000 - or 40 per cent - fewer than in 1988. Meanwhile, the insurers of over-mortgaged individuals lost a lot of money - Royal Insurance announced underwriting losses of Pounds 173m for the nine months to the end of September. While it was clearly easy for companies and individuals to defer buying property, some aspects of life went on regardless. Those stocks dealing in such non-discretionary items as food and health duly proved their resilience. Glaxo, the drugs company catering for ailments as prevalent as ulcers, asthma and migraine, rose from 10th to third and Wellcome also progressed impressively from 64 to 27. Drugs companies have proved to be good examples of several positive factors valued by equity analysts: they operate in growth markets and have extensive international earnings. The increasing sophistication of treatments justifies higher prices and the specialist products are, by definition, aimed at niche markets. This provides all the ingredients for that lucrative cliche 'high added value' and it can be seen in Wellcome's pre-tax profit margin of nearly 25 per cent in its latest set of interim results. Food has also provided a haven for many an investor this year. J Sainsbury and Tesco, two aggressive expanders of their supermarket chains, have both jumped more than 20 places to 33 and 47 respectively. But they still lag behind Marks and Spencer, which has applied both the value for money and added value formulae to a wider range of goods. Other retailers dealing in the modern versions of staple goods, such as toothpaste and toilet rolls, follow a similar pattern, with Boots as an obvious example. Food manufacturers also did well - Northern Foods, for instance - and the makers of alcoholic drinks were largely unaffected by the conditions, with Guinness as a prime example. Allied-Lyons, spread across drinks, food and retailing, benefited accordingly. There was even a positive spin-off for companies tranporting the necessities, such as NFC. It could almost be called the year for essentials when the rises of companies associated with heat, light and water are added in, following in the wake of longer-established brethren in the oil sector. British Gas rose from 14th to 7th, close to British Petroleum in ranking but still less than two thirds of its value. The water companies, new to the index last year, rose strongly headed by Thames at 197 (254). Southern and Welsh were new entrants. But the most prominent performance was the entry of a dozen electricity concerns, following this year's privatisations. National Power came in at 87, the second highest new entry behind Vodafone at 65, in the growth market of mobile communications, which demerged fully from Racal Electronics in August. Vodafone's parent, on the other hand, was the biggest faller, from 96 to 351. Its vulnerability sparked a bid from Williams Holdings, a rapid riser through its exploitation of acquisition opportunities.</p>

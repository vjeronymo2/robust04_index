The  Palestine Liberation Organization is headquartered in the  Tunisian capital. The Russian foreign minister will hold talks  with the Palestinian leadership, in particular he will meet  Yasir 'Arafat and will pass to him a personal message from  Russian President Boris Yeltsin.    The main goal of the visit is to assist in bringing together  the stances of the PLO and Israel and to achieve a compromise  with regard to resuming the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue as soon  as possible. This dialogue was frozen two weeks ago after a  Jewish settler opened fire on Arabs during worship at a mosque  in al-Khalil on the occupied West Bank.    The MENA news agency reports that Andrey Kozyrev intends to  set out Russia's viewpoint to the PLO on the current stage of  the Middle East peace process, which is above all the need to  implement the PLO-Israeli agreement on self-government for  Palestinians in the Gaza strip and the Jericho area.    The Russian foreign affairs head and the PLO Executive  Committee chairman are expected to begin their talks within the  next few hours. Also, during his stay in Tunis, Andrey Kozyrev  is expected to be received by Tunisian President Zine El Abidine  Ben Ali.    The Russian minister arrived in Tunis from Israel, where  today he held a series of intensive consultations with his  opposite number Shim'on Peres and met Jewish Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin.</p>

They stated this today at the end of their  talks.    The aim of the exercises is to enhance the ability of the  two  countries' armies to cooperate during peacekeeping operations.  The exercises will be the first experience of major armed  cooperation between the UK and Russian armed forces since the  World War II.    The exercises will be "of both military and political  significance." As such they will be completely in keeping with  the spirit of the idea of "partnership for peace" proposed at  the NATO summit in Brussels in January 1994.</p>

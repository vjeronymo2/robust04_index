			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE  </P> <P> Oceanside's growth-control law received another setback Wednesday when the  state's 4th District Court of Appeal refused to hear the city's plea to  overturn a lower court ruling against Proposition A.  </P> <P> Without comment, the three appellate judges let stand Vista Superior Court  Judge Herbert Hoffman's decision on Aug. 22 that Proposition A fails to  guarantee that the city will provide its regional fair share of lower-income  housing.  </P> <P> The Building Industry Assn. of San Diego, which along with developer Del Oro  Hills filed suit against the slow-growth law, had hailed Hoffman's decision as  helping invalidate Proposition A.  </P> <P> However, the city asked the appellate court on Oct. 20 to set aside Hoffman's  ruling, claiming he had incorrectly interpreted the law in reaching his  decision.  </P> <P> But the appeals court's unwillingness to hear the matter means the litigants  return to Superior Court on Feb. 11 to begin a new trial on another aspect of  Proposition A.  </P> <P> While the first trial before Hoffman focused on whether Proposition A made  enough housing available, the next phase will concern whether the  growth-control law is necessary under state law to protect the health and  safety of the city.  </P></p>

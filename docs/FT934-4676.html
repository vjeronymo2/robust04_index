			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (3): Volatility is likely to continue - The foreign exchange markets One of the striking features of international financial markets this year has been an outflow of funds from the US as investors there seek higher yields. It has not been so much a question of retail money moving abroad. Small investors prefer to stick with their own market, but their push into US stocks and bonds has driven up local values to the point where institutions have felt compelled to seek better opportunities overseas. Since this development coincides with a feeling among large institutions that they are underweight in international issues, many have begun to increase their foreign exposure to 20 per cent - or even more - of their total portfolio. That, however, only serves to aggravate the nagging worry about the currency risk they may be running, especially given the widespread perception that, after years of cyclical decline since the Plaza agreement of 1985, the dollar may tend to strengthen once US interest rates start to rise. US investors could then see their foreign market gains wiped out by currency loss. Besides, currency volatility in the second half of last year was as high as it had been since 1985, says Ms Margaret Waller of Pareto Partners, the London-based currency advisers. 'There is no evidence that volatility is going to turn down, particularly given the changes to the ERM (European exchange rate mechanism). If anything, it's going to become more of an issue.' Thus it is no surprise that US fund managers should be expressing increasing interest in currency management techniques such as overlay, whereby currency and investment decisions are taken separately and appropriate hedging arrangements put in place for the latter. A recent survey of US funds by Rogers, Casey, the Connecticut consultancy, shows more than half of them expected active currency management of their international investments to increase over the next three years, and 71 per cent expected currency overlay to reduce the volatility of these investments. According to Mr Reza Viskai of Rogers, Casey, the appeal is enhanced by the perception that active currency management can add value to the portfolio. 'You can actually enhance the return on your international investment,' he says. One way this can work is if investors change their hedge ratios as currency rates move, so that they increase their exposure to a strengthening currency and reduce it to a strengthening one. Some investors go further and engage in active currency investment for its own sake, through the derivatives market. That increases the return compared with a conventional overlay which cannot use leverage, but it also increases the risk. The slowly growing popularity of the latter approach to currencies is, however, an admission that currency decisions involve some active judgment. Using outside advice to put a currency overlay in place can provide comfort for the fund manager who does not wish to take full responsibility for the impact of exchange rate movements, but it does not provide automatic protection. Judgments are easier to make when currencies are moving in a clear long term trend. They are harder when the waters are simply choppy, as may be the case at the moment. Nor is an active hedging policy easy to pursue in every type of investment. Emerging market portfolios are difficult to hedge, for example, because of the limited instruments available in individual currencies, and because high real short term interest rates in developing countries would often make hedging expensive. Indeed, the only currencies where hedging is easily available are the yen, the larger European currencies and the dollar itself. Emerging market exposure can be hedged by using the dollar as a proxy for developing country currencies which are often linked to the US unit, but hedging by proxy can produce some nasty surprises, as some US investors found when the ERM collapsed. While the ERM was holding together, the D-mark could count as a proxy for the smaller currencies in the system, which also, incidentally, carried higher interest rates. It was thus tempting, if only on cost grounds, to use the D-mark to hedge exposure to, say, Irish pounds or Spanish pesetas. That looked a lot less sensible when the high interest rate currencies started to devalue. Partly because they are more used to taking currency exposure as a matter of routine, UK fund managers remain less drawn to overlay theory. 'Using currency tactically is something we do all the time, but it's part of the overall iterative process,' says Ms Caroline Burton of GRE. She does not believe that it makes sense to separate the decisions on whether to have exposure in yen and whether to buy European bonds. One important relationship, the sterling dollar rate, has been remarkably stable over the past year, but that does not mean currency management does not help. Mr Tom Crombie of Scottish Equitable says that while the Japanese market may have room to rise, the yen's appreciation against sterling has probably just about run its course. Low interest rates in Japan mean it actually saves money to hedge Japanese exposure against a fall in the yen. Scottish Equitable has covered half its exposure in this way. Cleverly, it has also used the savings to buy an option that allows it to benefit if the currency continues to rise. That looks like the best of both worlds.</p>

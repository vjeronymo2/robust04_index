			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 60m American bridge development BALFOUR BEATTY, based at Thornton Heath, Surrey, has received its largest-ever civil engineering contract in the United States with an USDollars 86m (Pounds 60.1m) award to replace a rail viaduct and drawbridge in Bridgeport, Connecticut with new and partially refurbished structures. The project for the Metro North Commuter Railroad involves the replacement of Peck drawbridge and the refurbishment of Bridgeport viaduct which together carry passenger trains on the line running from New York to Boston as it passes over the Pecquonock river. A temporary crossing of the river will be constructed to carry two lanes of rail traffic during the demolition and while the rebuilding work programme is in progress. Once the temporary crossing is fully operational the drawbridge will be completely demolished while the viaduct will be dismantled in stages. The new 1.25km structure will be constructed using concrete and structural steel. The contract is scheduled for completion in 1998.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by State President F.W. de Klerk </F> during the declaration of the old Parliament Buildings and  Tuynhuys in Cape Town as national monuments on 17 February; on  the "PM News Wrap" program -- recorded]    [Text] President F.W. de Klerk says IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi's negative reaction to the  government and the ANC's [African National Congress] latest  constitutional proposals may still change. President de Klerk  was speaking at a press conference in Cape Town.    [Begin recording] [De Klerk] I basically say that there is  time left, and, as I heard him when he was quoted directly in  his own voice, it was not all that negative. I really hope that  all the parties, who have not joined in the election as yet,  will very seriously consider their position, make a proper  study, and not take hasty decisions. I think that the initial  negative reaction might still change to a more positive one. I  have spoken to him last night. It is not impossible that at the  moment members of my party and of the government are in  discussion with members of his party and of his government. We  have been trying to put it together. It might be taking place  right at this moment. I haven't been informed. I have been too  busy thus far.    [Unidentified correspondent] Is this your final offer?    [De Klerk] It is not a question of a final offer. This is a  substantial improvement from our own vantage point and from the  vantage point of the Freedom Alliance, as it was. It addresses  the heart and the core, maybe not exactly as they would  like....[pauses] They would have liked it to be addressed, but  it addresses the heart and core of what has been on the table  and on the agenda. I think it offers substantive reassurance on  issues of fundamental importance to them and to us as  federalists, and I think the new principle that the powers will  not be diminished, that is what it says in essence, in a final  constitution is a very important reassurance that central  government will not be in a position, and a new central  parliament will not be in a position, to undermine the  fundamental federalist principles already built into this  constitution. I think it offers a good basis, a good platform  from which to enter into a final constitution-writing process,  and I think the right of the provinces, without prescription, to  determine the composition of their own executors and  legislators, is also tremendously important. I really think  that out of hand rejection of this is not justifiable and that  they should look very, very carefully at it. This is a  reasonable improvement which forms, in another sense of the  word, a basis which nobody can any longer say that I am  justified to stand aside and to disrupt what the overwhelming  majority of all South Africans want--and that is an election on  27 April.

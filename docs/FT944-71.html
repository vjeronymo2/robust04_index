			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Mandela days - War and Peace (Warmongers and Peacemakers) In the year in which southern Africa laid the foundations of a lasting peace, two images stand out. In the first, Nelson Mandela, right hand raised, is sworn in as president of the newly democratic South Africa, in a ceremony which formally ended more than three centuries of white rule. Six months later the same grey-haired septuagenarian is again in front of the cameras, this time posing proudly with a beautiful young woman, the hint of a tear in her eye, resting her head on his broad shoulders. With an enthusiasm for Whitney Houston's charms that belied his years, Mandela declared: 'I'm only here to shine her shoes. She is one of the unpolished jewels in the anti-apartheid struggle.' 'I love you Madiba,' replied Houston, a singer, her eyes glistening, using the clan name for Mandela. Clearly Mandela, now a sprightly 76, is enjoying the status that his personality and newly acquired power have brought, but that does not diminish speculation about his capacity to stand up to the demands of office. Indeed, some observers suggest that Mandela's reverence for Houston smacks of an infatuation that is a sign of approaching dotage, and point out that his aides and doctors have urged him to ease his punishing schedule. It seems unthinkable that Mandela should step down. Ideally, say senior ANC officials, they would like Mandela to see them through the five-year life of the current parliament - none, however, are prepared to suggest that it might already be time for Mandela to retire. Yet age eventually takes its toll - even of a man as resilient as the one who walked out of Cape Town's Pollsmoor prison nearly five years ago. Together with former president FW de Klerk, fellow recipient of the Nobel peace prize, Mandela went on to achieve the seeming impossible - a negotiated end to apartheid. In steering their country through one of history's most extraordinary political transformations, they also liberated southern Africa itself. White South Africa's defence of apartheid had been at the heart of conflicts that have devastated the region, beginning with wars for independence in the early 1960s, and the end of apartheid marked the end of Pretoria's destabilisation of its neighbours. Mandela has since made his influence felt beyond South Africa's borders, playing a leading role in southern Africa's informal grouping known as the front line states, intervening in Lesotho, Angola and Botswana to help secure peace and democracy in the region as a whole. Today, six months after being sworn in as president in Pretoria, Mandela's achievement remains no less remarkable, but a crisis of expectations is developing which will put all his skills to the test. Election euphoria is over, and young blacks are impatient for the fruits of victory. 'We in office, but not in power,' quips one senior official, pointing out that they are the inheritors of a white dominated economy, and dependent on the implementation of reform on a white-dominated civil service. Meanwhile the party itself is showing signs of division within its ranks, and there is a whiff of corruption in the air, as a growing black elite enjoys the benefits of office. South Africa is fortunate to have outstanding potential successors to Mandela, such as Thabo Mbeki, the deputy president, and Cyril Ramaphosa, the party's secretary general. African tradition, however, suggests that 'Madiba' will stay, like other partriarchs of the continent's liberation - Jomo Kenyatta, Houphoet-Boigny, Hastings Banda. Yet this tradition carries a warning. All three countries - Kenya, Ivory Coast, Malawi - initially thrived when these men were in their prime, but went into steep decline as aged, enfeebled, and increasingly autocratic, they kept their people and their parties in harmful thrall.</p>

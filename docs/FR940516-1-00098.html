			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes this method of determining annual limits is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most appropriate for the small SI engine industry. EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing the minimum annual limit of two because manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may change production during the model year. If a manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passed an SEA early in a model year, the manufacturer might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequently implement changes in its production process which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could increase engine emissions. With an annual limit of two,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA would have the flexibility to audit a manufacturer early in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the model year, and then return later in the model year if that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer implemented a change in production which could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase engine emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described above, EPA is also proposing that manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with projected annual production of 100,000 small SI engines or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more may have an annual limit of more than two. EPA believes it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might be necessary to conduct more than two SEAs on larger engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers when they have a large variety of engine families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When manufacturers have a variety of engine families, an SEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might only check a small portion of the manufacturers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production. Therefore, by dividing the number of engine families  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified by larger manufacturers by five, EPA could establish a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher annual limit for those manufacturers with a variety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine families with different emission characteristics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers with lower production should be assured that EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not overburden its limited test facilities with SEAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Annual limits would act as a cap and would not necessarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be the actual number of audits a manufacturer received. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not exceed a manufacturer's annual limit unless the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had reason to believe noncompliance was occurring. EPA requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on the proposed method for determining annual limits. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SEA program strives to encourage manufacturers to perform self- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> auditing and promptly remedy the emission noncompliance it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discovers. Therefore, EPA would consider reducing the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits conducted by the Agency, minimizing audits of engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families which are unusually burdensome to audit, or both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options, if the manufacturer provided substantial data to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate conformity of actual production engines with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable emission standards. EPA suggests that manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unfamiliar with self-auditing review existing on-highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, such as CARB's Quality Audit Program or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers' Assembly Line Test Data, for guidance in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing an in-house auditing program. Examples of audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs are available in the docket for this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA would review self-audit data and procedures used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquiring the data to assess the validity and representativeness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of each manufacturer's self-audit program. The primary criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA would use in evaluating the in-house programs are sample  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size, randomness within the family of the audited engine(s),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency of testing, and the applicable required test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures. EPA would discount the value of any self-audit data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the Agency received indications of noncompliance or concluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the data were invalid, incomplete, unrepresentative, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insufficient. In addition, manufacturers with a comprehensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> self-audit program would be subject to spot checks with EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oversight to provide EPA assurance of compliance. EPA requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers would be notified of an SEA by means of a test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order. This test order would specify the engine family to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audited. EPA might also specify an engine configuration or range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of configurations from a family to be audited. However, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would reserve the option to select all configurations within an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine family for an SEA. To minimize the burden on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers, EPA would consider requests by manufacturers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclude particular engines or engine configurations from a test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sample. Justification for such requests could be to avoid a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delay in shipment of urgent customer-ordered engines or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize test cell set-up time by selecting engines of similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical configurations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Test orders would include information relevant to the SEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The test order would indicate any specific procedures, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time to begin selecting engines, during the course of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit. Additionally, the test order would authorize EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement officers, upon presentation of enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credentials, to inspect engine production, test facilities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage facilities, and records necessary to establish compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with nonroad regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to differences between the small SI industry and the on- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highway industry, EPA is proposing that some aspects of the on- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highway SEA program be modified for small SI engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically, on-highway engine SEAs have been conducted on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine configurations: a specific engine family, an engine code,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a rated speed and an emission control system. EPA believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making an entire small engine family subject to an audit would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lead manufacturers to use extra care when grouping engines in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family. Consequently, EPA is proposing that nonroad SEAs be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted by sampling engines from within an engine family. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comments on this aspect of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SEA engines would typically be selected from a point of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final engine assembly or from a storage or shipping facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most often, this selection point would be at the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine assembly line, where no further quality control procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> happen or parts would be installed on the engines. Selection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported engines could occur at a port of entry. SEA engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could not receive any additional inspections or quality control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than that of normal production engines and pre-test safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> checks. Engines would be tested in the same order as they were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected. EPA requests comment on the feasibility of selecting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, then removing the engine for audit testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes to include ports of entry or storage locations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the United States as locations for EPA selection of foreign-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced small SI engines for SEA emission testing at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratories in the United States. The location of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selections could be designated by the manufacturer to minimize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disruption and shipping costs. The manufacturer would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for ensuring that a test facility in the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States was available for SEA testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

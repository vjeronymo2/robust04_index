			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Outdoors: As Swiss as edelweiss - FT Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They are currently in New Mexico. When we pulled back the curtains of our luxurious apartment at the Chalet Montesano, we were greeted with a picture-postcard Alpine scene. As the snowflakes cascaded among the fir trees, a large Swiss flag fluttered gently from the wooden balcony. In a country which loves to imitate Europe, it doesn't get much more Swiss than Taos Ski Valley, New Mexico - small village, big skiing. Taos was, after all, invented by Ernie Blake, a German-born Swiss, and Swiss themes dominate the resort. Two of the principal hotels are the St Bernard and the Edelweiss. There is a Kandahar Lodge and Swiss flags abound. The Chalet Montesano is owned by Victor Froehlich, a ski instructor and pastry chef from Davos and once a Swiss junior international goalkeeper. It is named after the chalet in Gstaad where his wife Karin went to finishing school. There is even a sign saying: 'Achtung - Private Parking.' Lew Wallace, governor of New Mexico between 1878 and 1881 and author of Ben-Hur, complained that 'every calculation based on experience elsewhere fails in New Mexico'. Not as cruel, perhaps, as: 'Poor old New Mexico - so far from heaven, and so close to Texas.' Many skiers these days like to think Taos is heaven. Several runs cut through steep and picturesque glades reflecting the Swiss/German connection: Edelweiss Glade, Tell Glade, Winkelried, St Bernard and even Sir Arnold Lunn. And there are other, more dramatic Teutonic connections. Blake worked for Allied Intelligence during the second world war, and grilled one or two big fish such as Goering. To honour some of those who tried to rid the world of Hitler, he named the best runs in Taos after them. Hence Tresckow, Fabian, Oster and Staufenberg. Churchill is not forgotten, either. Both Winston and Spencer's Glade are tough, expert runs. We thought we should stick to Taos's legendary tough runs, because we were being watched. The whole resort knew we were there because Chris Stagg, vice president of marketing and Blake's son-in-law, had put our names on the day's lift ticket. All 500 of the skiers in Taos that day had 'Welcome Arnie and Lucy, Ski The World' written on their lift tickets. (Five hundred is not bad for early December in Taos.) Froehlich, who was one of the original instructors, said that when Blake started the ski area in 1955, you could squeeze the entire ski school and its clients round one table for dinner at the old Hondo Lodge. Much of the grooming was done by hand, with shovels. 'There were only two radios in those days,' he said. 'Ernie had one and the ski patrol had the other.' Sometimes Blake told the then teenage Karin Froehlich to 'go groom Porcupine'. Karin, just about the only woman in the resort in the early days, continued to make an impression on her boss by living in a freezing old trailer which she called the 'ice box', and, determined to be independent, refused to eat the hot meals Blake organised for his staff. Said Victor: 'I thought this would be a good woman to get to know better.'</p>

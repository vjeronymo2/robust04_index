			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by T. Aldoshina, including recorded comment by </F> Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko -- from the  "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] [Aldoshina] Kaliningrad Oblast will never become a  demilitarized zone. This statement was made today by Vladimir  Shumeyko, just back from the region.    [Shumeyko] The world is so far organized in such a way that  a  sovereign state must have an Army. We have one, and it is our  business, Russia's business, where this Army is stationed. If  we believe it should be in Kaliningrad Oblast, that is how it  will be.    [Aldoshina] Shumeyko disagrees strongly with those who say  Russian troops are hampering the development of the region's  economy. On the contrary: Just three months after the edict on  Kaliningrad Oblast was passed, the oblast already has several  distinctive features of a free economic zone. Shumeyko believes  the time has come to create conditions for competition for the  right to work in the oblast, so that entrepreneurs putting their  stakes on the opportunities of the free economic zone invest  their funds in the construction of port facilities, the  development of fishing, and in solving other local problems. At  the same time, the status of a free economic zone requires that  traditional relations between the center and the oblast should  be changed. As early as this spring, a treaty on delimitation  of powers is to be signed with Kaliningrad, similar to the one  concluded with Tatarstan earlier.    [Shumeyko] We will have to take a very close look at the  text  of the treaty: How many rights the federal government devolves  to the region, and how many it retains; who is accountable to  whom and in what way, for the operation of the oblast in the  context of Russia as a whole.    [Aldoshina] Kaliningrad Oblast becomes a kind of a testing  range for new economic relations. That is why an entire  government delegation at the deputy ministers level was working  in Kaliningrad alongside Vladimir Shumeyko.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The Japanese police  committed another fascist brutality through a wholesale  crackdown on the Kyoto Prefectural headquarters of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) in broad  daylight on Monday morning amidst the ever more intensifying  hostile acts of the Japanese authorities against Chongnyon,  Tokyo-based Korean News Service was quoted as saying.    They mobilised in an attack on the headquarters more than  250  police on the false charge of the violation of the "land law",  who also searched 27 places including houses of Chongnyon  officials under the headquarters.    This is another unpardonable fascist suppression by the  Japanese police following its crackdown upon the Osaka  Prefectural organisation of Chongnyon.    The Japanese authorities are these days becoming all the  more  malicious in their attempt to stifle the DPRK through their  conspiracy and tieup with the U.S. imperialists over the  fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, while intensifying  suppression of Chongnyon.    The Japanese authorities' acts of incriminating and  suppressing the righteous activities of Chongnyon, a dignified  organisation of overseas citizens of the DPRK, are an expression  of their undisguised hostile policy towards the DPRK and  Chongnyon and a grave challenge to them.    The Chongnyon organisation and Koreans in Japan are turning  out in a massive protest against the outrageous suppression by  the Japanese police.</p>

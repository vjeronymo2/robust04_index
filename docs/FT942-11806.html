			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: MEPs must tackle issue of unnecessary legislation Sir, Your editorial, 'Europe's parliament' (April 3) makes many valuable points - notably that the parliament is 'a case study in unwieldiness'. However, the key problem to which you refer - our traipsing between Brussels and Strasbourg - is forced on us by the governments of the member states, including Britain. They have insisted that this costly and absurd state of affairs shall continue. Do not forget Luxembourg, too, the place MEPs never visit, but where parliament's main library is forced to remain; nor French blackmail over the elections to the European parliament, forcing a disgraceful signature by the parliament's president of a lease for a new, unnecessary hemicycle in Strasbourg at great benefit to the French. There is much to sort out. There are two crucial issues: increasing the effectiveness of our communications with industry in the early stages of consideration of the laws we make; and reducing (and repealing) unnecessary and costly legislation of which we have had too much in the past five years of the Labour-dominated European parliament. Interest in this parliament is justified by its legislative power to affect lives, jobs and Europe's wealth. That is why the European elections on June 9 matter. Christopher Jackson, Palais de l'Europe, Strasbourg, France</p>

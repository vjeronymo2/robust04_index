			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Driving down car costs Next week's Budget is expected to bring further changes in the tax treatment of the company car. But whatever the chancellor decides there are ways in which companies can reduce costs, according to a new guide* to company car management. Managing a car fleet and preparing budgets depends on keeping records of previous performance. Manual records must include copies of all invoices including the original purchase invoice and registration date. A full service history can increase the sale price of the vehicle. Several software packages are also available so careful choice needs to be made to ensure you get the right one. These should allow you to compare performance and cost with make, model, mileage and department. Many companies allow drivers a free choice of vehicle within a price range without giving consideration to the reliability or service costs. Incentives to employees if they maintain their vehicles in good condition can help to ensure they are looked after properly. If you use an outside garage for servicing do not allow individual employees to make a choice without vetting their selection and agreeing labour rates. Try to use as few garages as possible to build up a good working relationship and always ask if you can get a discount on parts. Keep to the manufacturers' recommended service schedules though this does not necessarily mean using main dealers. Main dealers can charge Pounds 25-Pounds 50 an hour for labour but other, still reputable, garages can charge only Pounds 16-Pounds 18, even in central London. Tight control must be kept of fuel bills. A fuel card can be used to keep control of costs nationwide. The fuel card company will usually provide an itemised bill twice a month. This not only controls unauthorised spending; it reduces administration time and provides useful management information about the efficiency of the car fleet.

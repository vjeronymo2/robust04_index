			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Decline in building industry eases THE PACE of decline in the construction industry has slowed in the past three months and there has been a modest improvement in inquiries from potential customers, the industry said yesterday. But construction companies still expect output to decline by a further 2 per cent this year, following a 5.5 per cent fall last year. The Building Employers Confederation said that its latest workload survey of more than 600 companies showed a slight improvement in the proportion of companies reporting an increase in inquiries from potential customers. The decline in production in the past quarter was less steep than in the previous three months. Companies expected to shed fewer jobs as the year progressed. In spite of this the confederation still expected 50,000 construction jobs to be lost this year, taking the number of jobs axed since summer 1989 to more than 500,000. A fifth of companies continued to work at less than half capacity even though there had been a rise in inquiries. Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said: 'The fact that inquiries for new work are stabilising and that firms are being increasingly successful in tendering and negotiating for new work is welcome news for the industry. 'But there remains a worrying lack of confidence among manufacturers, which are continuing to fail to invest in new buildings. 'There also appears to be a disappointing lack of repair and maintenance work being done - and for small firms, employing less than 25 people, there are few signs of encouragement in this survey.' Some small companies have only enough work to last them another three months. Medium-sized companies say they have work for up to nine months, while the main contractors have a large enough workload to last 12 to 18 months. Sir Brian said the industry needed further interest rate cuts.</p>

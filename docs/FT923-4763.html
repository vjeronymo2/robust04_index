			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pancontinental stages turnround PANCONTINENTAL Mining, the Australian mining company, staged a turnround to an operating profit after tax of ADollars 55.6m (USDollars 40m) in the fiscal year ended June 30, swinging from a year-earlier loss of ADollars 106.3m, AP-DJ reports from Sydney. Group sales advanced to ADollars 214.8m from ADollars 179.3m last time. Pancontinental said it was well positioned to take immediate advantage of any further firming in the weak cyclical upturn in certain commodity prices. It said this would be assisted by the recent fall in the Australian dollar/US dollar exchange rate.</p>

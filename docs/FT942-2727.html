			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Hong Kong to cut stamp duty The Hong Kong government is to reduce stamp duties on stock borrowing and lending to encourage a more active market, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. The duties are said to have discouraged short-selling in the stock market. At present, duties are payable on stocks borrowed for periods exceeding 14 days. The duty-free period will be extended to 12 months. No date has been set for the reforms but they are expected to be implemented soon, a government spokesman said.</p>

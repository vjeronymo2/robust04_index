The council will work  along with Common Market institutions, and its role will be to  promote and assist in the economic affairs of the Israeli  business sector in the Common Market.    The initiative to establish the Israeli-European council is  that of the coordination bureau of the economic organizations in  Israel. The council will be headed by two chairmen--the Israeli  one will be Dan Proper, president of the coordination bureau and  president of the Industrialists' Association. Dani Gillerman,  president of the Society of Commerce Bureaus, will serve as his  deputy. The European chairman has yet to be selected.    The council's administration will include 12 members who are  representatives of economic organizations and representatives of  the business world from Israel, and 12 addition ones from among  the Common Market countries.    The council, which will serve as a sort of lobby to promote  Israel's dealings in the market and vice versa, will open its  office in Brussels, and a portion of the financing of its  activities will be executed by institutions of the European  Community (EC).    Present at the festive meal in Brussels were Foreign  Minister  Shim'on Peres; Common Market President Jacques Delors, who  welcomed its establishment; Dan Proper; Yoram Blizovski,  director-general of the Industrialists' Association; and Marcel  Shaton--Israel's commerce representative in Brussels.    The leadership of the Industrialists' Association stayed in  Brussels for three days for talks with representatives of the  Common Market and administrators.    "We feared a significant change in mood toward us," Proper  related upon his return. "The market revealed a willingness for  a series of benefits for Israel's position. Among other things,  we reached an understanding on the subject of their extremist  declaration regarding the disgrace of the Arab boycott," he  added.</p>

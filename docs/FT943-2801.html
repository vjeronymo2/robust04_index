			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / The candidate and the TV magnate: Subtle media manipulation has boosted Cardoso, the favourite in Brazil's election - A look at a real-life election 'novela' that is prompting complaints from opposition Brazilian TV, better known for screening scantily clad women, is running a strange commercial. Paid for by one of the country's largest construction companies, the advertisement talks of the need for improvements in education and advises viewers to elect a president in next month's elections who 'knows how to teach'. The commercial seems a clear attempt to lift support for Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former finance minister and government candidate. Mr Cardoso was a university professor while his rival, the left-wing Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, barely finished high school and has a slight lisping accent, which is the target of middle-class derision. Such support for Mr Cardoso from business and the media has helped consolidate his lead in opinion polls and led to complaints from Mr da Silva that the elections are no longer fair. The claim seemed to gain weight when Mr Rubens Ricupero was forced to resign as Brazil's finance minister earlier this month after remarks he made in a private interview were broadcast by mistake. Mr Ricupero let slip that TV Globo, which is sometimes watched by half the country's 157m people, was using him regularly on programmes as a way of supporting Mr Cardoso. Globo's owner, Mr Roberto Marinho, has not concealed his support for Mr Cardoso, nor his unease with Mr da Silva. Mr Ricupero's indiscretion is embarrassing for Globo, especially since the station wanted to regain credibility lost when, in 1989, it helped elect former president Fernando Collor, who later resigned amid corruption charges. Mr Cardoso's extraordinary rise in the polls, from about 20 per cent in June to more than double that figure today, would not have been possible without the Real, Brazil's new currency launched on July 1. Mr Cardoso planned the new currency when he was finance minister before Mr Ricupero. Monthly inflation fell from 50 per cent to 5 per cent, giving poorer wage earners an apparent increase in purchasing power. Mr Cardoso has also benefited from the optimism which has swept Brazil since the currency's launch. This is partly a reaction to 10 years of economic and political bad news. But it has also been manipulated by the media, in a country where only 30 per cent of Brazilians complete eight years of primary school, and where in some states illiteracy is above 40 per cent. TV Globo has been scrupulously fair in the time it gives each of the main candidates in its evening news broadcasts. But the station then fills the rest of its reports with feel-good news stories about the success of the Real, thereby lifting Mr Cardoso's credibility. After the news comes the TV 'novela', or soap opera. Novelas are extremely popular in Brazil and play an important political role. Globo launched a new novela in July to coincide with the election. Called 'Minha Patria' or 'My Country', it is an upbeat tale of success and love in a Brazil with a future. This is in sharp contrast to the highly critical vision of Brazil which Globo ran ahead of the 1989 elections, when its candidate, Mr Collor, was campaigning for change. de Lima of Brasilia University. The support for Mr Cardoso has prompted complaints from Mr da Silva's Workers' party, the PT. Pointing out that Mr Cardoso is supported by the government, most businessmen and the media, Mr da Silva said recently: 'These elections are not as free and fair as we would like.' The PT complains that media ownership is too closely concentrated in the hands of too few, largely right-wing, people. According to some estimates, nine families - of which Mr Marinho's is the most important  - own 68 of Brazil's 71 TV concessions. But if Mr Cardoso wins the elections as expected, the PT is unlikely to succeed in its efforts to widen media ownership. Mr Cardoso's main backer, Mr Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, , owns the TV Globo franchise in his home state of Bahia, as well as several radio licences. He and other of Mr Cardoso's supporters are unlikely to welcome moves to break their monopoly.</p>

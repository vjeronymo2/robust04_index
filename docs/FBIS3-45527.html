In order to ensure the smooth  implementation of a number of important reform proposals and  sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170  4958 1816 6643 1696 1660] development of the economy, the  macroeconomic policies should focus on countering inflation.    As an economic expert in close contact with decisionmakers,  Sun Shangqing studied national economic performance and trends  toward the end of 1992 and recommended that the macroeconomic  management for 1993 should focus on preventing economic  overheating. This assessment later commanded much attention  from various quarters.    Sun Shangqing believed that China's economy has entered a  stage of rapid growth. The growth rate in 1994 will remain  high, and any attempt to keep the growth rate unnaturally low  will cause major fluctuations that will undermine national  economic development. Considering that growth in 1994 will be  based on the high rates of 1992 and 1993, it is appropriate to  set the target growth rate at 9 percent.    He said: We have a weak economic base. Speedy development  is bound to create tension in various economic relationships and  put a strain on energy, communication, important raw materials,  currency, and financial expenditures. Under such circumstances,  the important reform measures to be promulgated this year will  probably all cause some shocks and lead to instability in the  economy. Therefore, one should be both optimistic and cautious  when analyzing the economic situation. It is necessary to fully  consider the risks in the course of reform and prepare for  possible trouble.    Sun Shangqing pointed out: The most critical risk is  probably inflation. China's economy is still quite vulnerable,  as is the mentality of the general public. Development is  unbalanced in different localities, and there are major  discrepancies when it comes to personal incomes. We should be  soberly aware of these facts and should not overestimate the  society's threshold of tolerance for inflation. In 1993, the  general retail price index went up 13 percent, and the cost of  living in 35 large and medium cities increased by 20 percent.  This "tailspin [qiao wei 5062 1442]" has constituted a great  source of pressure this year. Therefore, special precautions  should be taken against a possible increase in the inflation  rate caused by the persistently large investment in fixed  assets, the unification of exchange rates, and the price hikes  of some energy and agricultural products, and efforts must be  made to keep the inflation rate under 10 percent and prevent  stagflation.    Sun Shangqing maintained that what is important for 1994 is  to properly handle the relationship between reform and  development and that between speed and efficiency.  Macroeconomic policies must be directed to specific issues, and  the central bank must effectively control the money supply. The  management of the national economy must achieve the following  two changes:    First, the quota supply system that used to be based on rare  resources should be changed, and the predominance of  supply-based management should be converted to demand-based  management. On a microeconomic scale, production should be  arranged according to market demand; on the macroeconomic scale,  it is necessary to keep a close watch on overall demand trends  and the demand structure.    Second, attention should be given to the improvement of  economic efficiency. It is necessary to seek the qualitative  improvement and quantitative growth of the national economy in  the context of optimized economic structure and overcome the  tendency to place excessive emphasis on speed.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Swedbank takes 7.5% stake in Finnish bank Swedbank, the Nordic region's biggest bank by asset value, yesterday made its first move to take a stake in a foreign bank, buying a 7.5 per cent stake in Finland's Aktia Bank for SKr47m (Dollars 6.25m). The Swedish bank is to take up 1.5m of 2.5m new shares being issued at a price of FM20 a share by Aktia, a small bank with assets of FM8.6bn. Aktia intends to apply for a listing on the Helsinki stock exchange next year. Aktia's main market is in Finland's small Swedish-speaking minority. Swedbank, with assets of almost SKr490bn, has become a force in Sweden. It emerged in its present form when a group of Swedish savings banks were thrown together in 1992 following the loan loss crisis which hit Sweden's banks. It has become profitable this year and plans a listing on the Stockholm stock exchange in 1995. However, the bank said its Aktia acquisition did not signal any strategic diversification overseas.</p>

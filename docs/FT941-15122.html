			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Iri announces shape of next Italian bank sale Iri, the Italian state holding company, has announced that it will privatise its 57 per cent stake in the Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) in February. A minimum of 40 per cent of the shares being sold will be reserved for a public offering. The bulk will be set aside for Italian and foreign institutional investors, with a limit of 2 per cent set on each institutional investor's holding. The decision on the size of institutional stakes has been the subject of intense lobbying. Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, is widely believed to have wanted to aquire a big foothold in BCI. The latter currently has an 8 per cent interest in Mediobanca. By opting for diffused share ownership, Iri is following a similar path to that of Credito Italiano, its first bank privatisation in December. As in the Credito divestment, a 1 per cent ceiling has been imposed on individual investors purchasing via the public share offering. Iri currently holds 482.1m ordinary shares while a further 88.6m savings shares will be converted by February 11. It said that it expected to retain some 30.7m shares to exercise, if necessary, an over-allotment option. A further 40m would be offered to BCI employees. In a related move on Friday, Iri set in motion the process of unwinding a deal arranged last March with its telecommunications arm, Stet. This involved a L340bn (Pounds 130m) cash payment by Stet to Iri's hard pressed treasury to cover the use of three years' anticipated dividends from BCI. The deal covered 440m shares, equivalent to 52.3 per cent of the total BCI shares. Stet last year received L137.5bn in BCI dividend payments. A price has yet to be placed on Iri's stake in BCI, which has net assets of L6,900bn and generated a 1992 operating profit of L,1380bn. Lehman Brothers are advising on the offer and the promotional roadshow is due to begin on February 11. At Friday's close, BCI shares were being traded at L4,900. If a similar strategy is adopted to that of Credito, then the discount would be near to 10 per cent. In this case the offer price would be about L4,400, with Iri likely to receive around L2,500bn from the disposal.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Dismay greets proposed complex for Manchester a Pounds 200m proposal for one of the UK's largest out-of-town shopping centres - was greeted with dismay by local authorities, developers and retailers who fear it will further increase already fierce competition, to the detriment of the many shopping centres in the greater Manchester area. A consortium of eight of greater Manchester's 10 metropolitan district councils and five large property developers, which opposed the Dumplington proposal, is considering whether to mount a High Court challenge, its spokesman Mr David Kaiserman said yesterday. Mr Kaiserman, senior assistant city planning officer for Manchester City Council, said: 'We see development of this type making it even more difficult to achieve regeneration in the inner parts of the city. A large peripheral development appealing only to people who have cars is not doing anything at all in our view in net terms for urban regeneration.' Mr David Brown, president of the Manchester Chamber of Trade and manager of the city's Arndale Centre, said: 'Something like this will have an effect on all levels of trade in the city of Manchester and other surrounding towns and will inevitably lead to job losses in the city centre. It will affect the big multiples and the small guys.' Mr Brown said there was already a 'massive choice' of retail outlets in Manchester and the 10 large towns in an outlying 10-mile radius: 'There isn't really a need for another major shopping complex of this size.' The free car parking likely to be part of Dumplington was of particular concern. The consortium for which Mr Kaiserman speaks includes P&amp;O, owners of Manchester's Arndale Centre, MEPC, Land Securities, Norwich Union and Shudehill, a company formed by the Co-operative Insurance Society and the Co-operative Wholesale Society. Shudehill has planning permission from Manchester City Council for a 500,000 sq ft retail development on a rundown site it largely owns beside the Arndale Centre. Mr Kaiserman said Shudehill had indicated it would have to reconsider its plan in view of the Dumplington decision. Boots, the chemists chain, said it was opposed to the Dumplington development because of concerns about how it would affect city-centre shopping. Mr Roger Tym, a development economist representing Boots, said several other retailers and developers were also opposed to the centre: 'In short, it's not over yet.' He said there was evidence that similar out-of-town developments such as Lakeside, Meadowhall and Merry Hill had damaged city-centre trade. 'At Lakeside, one major national retailer has found that 95 per cent of its new store trade had come from other stores within a fairly tight circumference of that development,' he said. Dixons, the electrical retailer, and Marks and Spencer, the food and clothing retailer, said yesterday they would probably examine the development, although both have several large stores in the Manchester area. However, Trafford Metropolitan borough council, in whose area Dumplington lies, welcomed the decision by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary. Mr Michael Crawley, senior assistant director for planning, said it would contribute to regeneration at Trafford Park and complement rather than adversely affect other cen-tres.</p>

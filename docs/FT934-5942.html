			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / CIS peace-keeping tops CSCE agenda: The organisation seeking a new framework for Europe Foreign ministers from the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) meet in Rome next week to push forward the complex task of building a new co-operative framework for a Europe no longer divided into blocs but still beset by ancient fears and resurgent historical rivalries. Top of the agenda will be discussion of the latest EU-inspired peace plan for Bosnia, Russian efforts to gain western support for Russian and CIS 'peace-keeping' missions in Trans-Caucasus and central Asia and a review of the other fault-lines of post-cold war Europe. The CSCE originated in the 1970s as a Soviet-inspired proposal to legalise and formalise the post-war division of cold war Europe. It helped instead to end that division by the west's insistence on the inclusion of human and civil rights in the so-called 'Basket 3' of the CSCE Helsinki Final Act signed in 1975. The end of the cold war was celebrated in November 1990 at the CSCE heads of government summit in Paris with signature of the Charter of Paris. Prematurely, the charter proclaimed 'a new era of democracy, peace and unity'. But a few months later war broke out in former Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union disintegrated into its 15 component republics. The former Soviet states were admitted into the CSCE at the Prague meeting of foreign ministers in January 1992. The CSCE writ runs therefore way beyond Europe. It extends from Vancouver to Vladivostok, taking in Siberia and the central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union as well as the transatlantic Nato bastions, the US and Canada. Its remit likewise has broadened. The Paris summit agreed to set up its own secretariat, a Conflict Prevention Centre, based in Vienna, and an Office for Democratic Institutions and Human rights based in Warsaw. But it has only minuscule bureaucratic back-up and a revolving chairmanship. In short it is a friendly, well-intentioned but unwieldly creature. But it is charged, rather like the UN itself, with an impossible variety of difficult tasks thrown up by the re-emergence of ethnic and historical rivalries. Many of its members, while mildly grateful for the psychological reassurance which CSCE membership provides, would much prefer to be full members of a security organisation like the West European Union (WEU) or Nato. The CSCE's inability to prevent the violation of all its principles by the warring forces in former Yugoslavia remains a perpetual source of embarrassment. At the same time however conflict in the Balkans has spurred the CSCE into devising ways of calling on Nato and the European Union to provide muscle for the CSCE's peace-keeping aims. A set of conflict prevention/crisis management measures were at the heart of the final document, entitled 'The Challenges of Change', approved at the Helsinki summit in July 1992. This empowered the CSCE to call on Nato, the WEU and others to help with peacekeeping. A new Forum for Security Co-operation was set up with a mandate covering arms control, disarmament and security building. Since then, however, deep divisions within the EU, and between the Europeans and the Americans in Nato, have revealed how thin these institutional arrangements are. Meanwhile, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, created a minor panic at the last meeting of foreign ministers in Stockholm a year ago when he made a spoof speech purporting to signal a sea-change in Russian foreign policy back to the confrontational 'nyet' politics of the Soviet past. The minister has been more circumspect in the run-up to this week's Rome meeting. But his message remains essentially the same. Russia wants, and feels it deserves, western moral support and financial assistance to help Moscow shoulder the burden of peace-keeping in the Eurasian landmass, and especially along the ethnic and religious fault-lines of the trans-Caucasus and central Asian regions. In an October speech in London, Mr Kozyrev reinforced his argument by adding 'No substitute for our efforts here is in sight. . . Russia's withdrawal from its peace-keeping role would threaten the former Soviet Union with a Yugoslav scenario.' It is an argument which cuts little ice with the Baltic states, still battling to get Russian troops and installations out of Latvia and Estonia. But in some west European chancelleries support is growing for carefully monitored, case-by-case, western backing for CIS peacekeeping activities, together with the dispatch of small teams of western observers to monitor the modalities.</p>

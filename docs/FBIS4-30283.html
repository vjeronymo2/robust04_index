			<p>BFN     [Text] The Journalists Association of Thailand last month  organized a seminar entitled: "Thailand and a Money Laundering  Law." Speaking at the seminar were Police General Chawalit  Yotmani, secretary general of the Office of the Narcotics  Control Board; Pricha Suwannathat, MP from Bangkok; Chatchai  Sutthikrom, director of the Assets Examination Division of the  Anticorruption Committee; and Dr. Bandit Nitthawon, deputy  director of the Technical Department of the Bank of Thailand.    The seminar, designed to find legal measures to facilitate  suppression of international narcotics trafficking syndicates,  was motivated by the legal charge by the U.S. Government against  Thanong Siriprichaphong, a former MP of the Chat Thai Party from  Nakhon Phanom Province, for his alleged involvement in  international drug trafficking. However, Thailand has no law or  any evidence to prosecute the accused.    Without a law against money laundering, narcotics prevention  and suppression works in Thailand are fruitless. Authorities  are unable to trace sources of dirty money or money earned  through illicit means. Dirty money, especially drug money, is  purified and legalized after it has passed through the hands of  financial institutions. Authorities can never confiscate it or  take legal action against its owner.    Money laundering is defined as an act of purifying through  financial institutions money that is earned from illegal  activities. The money is used to invest in stock markets or  other businesses to prove that it is legally earned. After the  laundering process, authorities cannot confiscate it or use it  as evidence against its owner.    An attempt was once made in Thailand to pass a money  laundering law in accordance with the Vienna Convention. The  Office of the Narcotics Control Board, Police Department, Office  of the Juridical Council, Office of the Supreme Attorney  General, international organizations, and the U.S. Drug  Enforcement Agency worked together to draft the legislation.  However, the Bank of Thailand and several domestic financial  institutions voiced their disagreement by saying that  enforcement of an anti-money laundering law would constitute a  violation of individual privacy and was against the secrecy law  which prohibits commercial banks from releasing personal  information about their clients.    But now the Bank of Thailand fully supports the passage of a  money laundering law. Bandit Nitthawon, deputy director of the  Technical Department, said that since Thailand is a financial  hub, so it must adjust itself to meet world standards and  enforce a money laundering prevention law. The law will also  serve as a deterrence against all types of economic and  political crimes and corruption.    An anti-money laundering law is, therefore, a measure to  prosecute law violators. The law will enable authorities to  trace the origins of dirty money and gather evidence to  prosecute its owner.    Without a money laundering law, authorities will encounter  enormous difficulties in filing criminal cases because they do  not have evidence, nor can they use the illegally-earned money  as evidence.    The anti-money laundering law to be promulgated by the  government must cover money from not only drug trafficking, but  also other unscrupulous activities such as stock manipulation,  weapons and contraband trade, and corruption.    Moreover, financial institutions must be obliged by the law  to keep authorities informed about accounts of their clients  when amounts of money reach a fixed level. They are also  required to keep records of the real and family names of  depositors and notify agencies concerned about any suspicious  transactions of money made by their clients so that authorities  can take appropriate follow-up action.    Promulgation of an anti-money laundering law is certainly  not  detrimental to investment or the free monetary policy of the  government. On the contrary, it will assist efforts to turn our  country into the financial hub of the region. It is beneficial  in the long run because it can be used as a tool to trace the  origins of illegally-earned money. Therefore, the government  must expedite passage of this law in order to suppress  wrongdoers.</p>

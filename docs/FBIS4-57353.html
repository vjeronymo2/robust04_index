			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Grand Front, FG, leader Deputy Carlos </F> "Chacho" Alvarez by Fernando Nole in Buenos Aires; date not  given]    [Text] [Nole] How do you explain the FG's spectacular  growth in such a short time?    [Alvarez] Several special circumstances favored this growth.  The Argentine bipartisan system has been suffering a slow  process of crisis, which is not too visible when there are few  alternatives, but which is obvious with the appearance of  options that allow people to change their party loyalty and seek  credibility elsewhere. I think a combination of factors fueled  our rapid growth.    [Nole] How did the movement start?    [Alvarez] We bolted the Justicialist Party in 1990. On that  occasion eight of us, all deputies, split following the pardon  [of some military officers involved in the military  dictatorship] and because the Justicialist Party became clearly  conservative and accepted without criticism an Argentine liberal  recipe. In 1991, we participated in the congressional election  and obtained 3 percent of the votes. In 1992, Fernando "Pino"  Solana ran for a seat in the Senate representing the capital and  obtained 7.5 percent of the vote. On 3 October [1993] we ran as  the FG for the first time. The FG is an alliance between the  Front of the South and the Front for Democracy and Social  Justice. We obtained 14 percent in the capital. That was  excellent. We did a good job in the Chamber of Deputies where we  worked hard against corruption. Then Raul Alfonsin and Carlos  Menem signed the Olivos Pact [to reform the Constitution] which  created an important vacuum. Many people saw the pact as a  leadership arrangement, an ethical surrender, and as a deal  leaving the government without opposition. We have profited the  most from that political vacuum.    [Nole] Do you think your movement can continue to grow if  the  alliances you are negotiating with other parties succeed?    [Alvarez] One of the lessons of this election is that the  number of people who will vote for a party regardless of what  their leaders do is decreasing. I cannot say we will maintain  our electoral strength no matter what we do. Neither can I  affirm, as some people say, that our votes were borrowed and  will return to their parties in the presidential election. All  of this will depend on how we perform in the future. We are the  third strongest political force in Argentina. First we must  fulfill another requirement. We must create a firmer  institutional base to prevent the front from appearing as a sum  of other parties' leftovers. We face the challenge of creating a  project for 1995 based on a clear program. This project must be  clearly feasible from an economic and social perspective. This  country tends to reject the left, even though it is a democratic  left. The word leftist has a damned connotation. We are building  a center-left project with the purpose of going beyond [Economy  Minister Domingo] Cavallo's plan, which is what is sustaining  this administration's credibility.    [Nole] Do you think you can challenge Carlos Menem's  reelection if you are successful with your alliances?    [Alvarez] If we can organize ourselves well in the provinces  we will be able to challenge Menem as a third option. I am not  singing victory. I am very careful with my evaluations. We have  a very serious responsibility. In sum, I do not know how far or  close we are from competing for the presidency. We must be  prepared because society is already requiring that we behave as  if we were a serious possibility of becoming government in  Argentina. In the street, people tell me: "Chacho, do not  disappoint us," and; "People believe in you." An important part  of society believes in us.    [Nole] Can we talk of the resurgence of the leftist vote?    [Alvarez] No. There is a need for a new progressive force. I  think these 10 years of democracy can be divided in two stages.  First there was great expectation with the Radical Civic Union  [UCR] progressive project, which advanced in some aspects like  the democratization of society, but which ended up failing at  the social and economic levels. This stage was followed by  Carlos Menem and his entirely conservative project. We may  inherit that group of people who were disappointed by Raul  Alfonsin's administration. This is why I believe we must  strengthen the center-left identity. Today the UCR is again  speaking through its most conservative spokesmen.    [Nole] Historic Peronism also seems to have disappeared.    [Alvarez] We should no longer talk about Peronism. We must  talk about how the center-left identity can revitalize parts of  the Peronist identity which are still very important for humble  people. Issues such as social justice, human rights, income  redistribution, people's participation, and a more integrated  society are very important for them. There is much to rescue. We  must redefine or bring back issues that are very strong in the  Peronist tradition and which marked the memory of Peronists.    [Nole] If the FG gains the presidency, would you revise the  economic transformation being implemented by Menem?    [Alvarez] Aside from abuses, the so-called irregularities, I  believe it is very difficult to propose a way back in the  Argentine society. I believe it would be very harmful to revise  past events. To go back would be tantamount to reinstating a  State that did not serve the people. Liberalism won the battle  in Argentina because the State had been seized by the most  powerful economic groups, involving a patronage-oriented,  subsidy-oriented State. The State was a disgrace for the people.  Public services were a disgrace. A Telephone company worker who  collected a bribe to repair the phone was a disgrace. This was  also the case with the gas, electricity, and water company  workers. In other words, the recent image was that of a State  that had turned its back on society's interests. To suggest a  revision is tantamount to playing along with Menem and to making  the people believe the idea of reinstating an inefficient State,  a State entirely opposed to common good. We must build a new  State because Menem has left us without a State. No one controls  anything here. No one controls our food, medicines, beverages,  or services.    [Nole] In your opinion, how should the state have been  revamped?    [Alvarez] First, a debate deprived of so much ideology  should  have been conducted because market fundamentalists have been  involved here, saying all public enterprises are bad and all  private enterprises are good. Of course, a mixed system might  have been proposed for some enterprises while this was not  possible for others. I do not believe all public or state  enterprises are necessarily bad.    [Nole] Yet yo believe the State may become involved in  activities that are not proper of a State like producing  manufacturing objects or elements?    [Alvarez] No. I do not believe in a State that is a  proprietor. I do not believe in it because it is too utopian for  Argentina today. We want a State at the service of the people, a  State that will establish rules and a plan, keeping pace with  the economy.    [Nole] Should I assume therefore that you have an entirely  critical opinion of the convertibility plan?    [Alvarez] From a social viewpoint, the stability programs  like the one implemented in our country are highly  retrogressive. Instead of discussing convertibility, I believe  it is necessary to strengthen stability, enabling us to discuss  the type of country that is being planned. We want to begin this  discussion with stability, even though this stability has a  retrogressive bias. It is necessary for stability, like  democracy, become an integral part of the conscience of  Argentines and to discuss projects on this basis.    [Nole] Another issue. Various problems have arisen within  Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. What is more advantageous  for Argentina; regional integration or NAFTA?    [Alvarez] In a choice between Mercosur and NAFTA, I believe  our country must firmly choose Mercosur because we would be  entirely engulfed by the U.S. market if we choose NAFTA. The  United States has great possibilities for exporting and we will  have nothing to sell to the United States, Canada, or Mexico. We  must firmly commit ourselves to the Mercosur. Mercosur must  integrate the most significant economic circles with small- and  medium-size enterprises. We must jointly review the competitive  and distributive advantages and Argentina must correct its  significant trade imbalance with Brazil. In a nutshell, I see a  great future for Mercosur. Furthermore, I believe the bloc's  integration is inexorable because there can be no economic  solution unless we project our industry and commerce on a large  scale and integrated into regional blocs. The best way to  protect the domestic market is not by subsidizing enterprises  for this domestic market but by assisting and fostering  industries that might successfully compete abroad.    [Nole] In conclusion, did you use the experience of the  Uruguayan Broad Front [FA] as an example when you formed the FG?    [Alvarez] No. We have always respected and recognized it. We  were greatly encouraged by the Uruguayan experience because in  your country there was also a marked bipartisan system. The FA  was established in 1970. It endures, it has been able to  withstand time, and it could achieve a majority in your country.  The FA won the Montevideo mayoralty and has a good rating on the  polls to contend for running the government. In this regard, we  have always viewed the FA with great recognition and it is very  encouraging to see how this party has been able to keep up and  grow. I believe countries develop a progressive democratic  alternative in keeping with the characteristics and beliefs of  societies.</p>

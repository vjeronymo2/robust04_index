			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on press conference by Foreign Minister Antonio </F> Martino in Paris on 26 May: "Freeze Between Italy and France"  -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Excerpt] Paris -- [Italian] Foreign Minister Antonio  Martino was not reticent, and indeed dealt forcefully with the  subject of the dispute sparked by [French President]  Mitterrand's remarks and the Palazzo Chigi [Italian government  seat] note. Martino arrived in Paris Wednesday evening [25 May]  as the press agencies carried excerpts from the French  president's interview with LA REPUBBLICA and four other European  newspapers. He arrived in France for the first time in his  capacity as Italian foreign minister, without the list of  appointments that would be normal for someone representing a new  government in a friendly and allied country. There was no  bilateral meeting with his French counterpart, Alain Juppe.  "Too little time," the diplomats explained. But there was  enough time for him to say, 24 hours later, just before leaving,  that the French chief of state's remarks were "unacceptable."  We cannot remember a time when relations between Rome and Paris  were so tense, ever since the two capitals have shared the same  Europeanist ideals. It is worth starting the story at the end.  When Martino -- having declined an invitation to the Elysee  presidential palace for a reception for all the participants at  the conference on stability in Europe (though according to  diplomats, "he declined some time ago because there was not  enough time") -- summoned reporters to a room in the UNESCO  building. There were plenty of journalists there waiting to  hear what had happened. The questions came thick and fast.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Did you discuss Mitterrand's remarks with  Juppe?    [Martino] I thought about doing so, but I met with Juppe  together with my counterparts from several other countries. And  I did not want to embarrass him. In any case, he cannot  consider himself responsible for statements made by Mitterrand.    [LA REPUBBLICA] So was there no official reply to  Mitterrand?    [Martino] I think that the best answer to give to Mitterrand  is that which he himself gave in 1981 when he decried as  "unacceptable" the criticisms made of him over the presence of  Communist ministers in the government that he had just  appointed. So the remarks made by Mitterrand to a number of  European newspapers are unacceptable to us.    [LA REPUBBLICA] So do you consider the presence of Communist  and neo-fascist ministers in a European government equivalent?    [Martino] It is not a matter of equivalence. I am just  saying that a chief of state of a friendly and allied country  should refrain from commenting on the independent vote of  another friendly and allied country.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Has any official step been taken vis-a-vis  the Elysee Palace?    [Martino] Definitely not. After the Palazzo Chigi note, that  would mean attributing greater importance to Mitterrand's  statements. Which, by the way, are very strange.    [LA REPUBBLICA] But Mitterrand's remarks are not the only  ones. Other countries have expressed suspicion of the new  Italian Government.    [Martino] That is true of the press in several countries.  But as far as governments are concerned, Mitterrand is an  isolated instance. No other chief of state has made any such  remark.    [LA REPUBLICAN] The Palazzo Chigi communique says that those  remarks are attributable to French domestic political problems.  Do you agree?    [Martino] I do not consider it scandalous to say that these  remarks are a result of the pre-election climate in France. If  we consider the distribution of the various critical statements  made in France in our regard, most of them come from the  Socialists, who are now having difficulties. They are easier to  interpret from this viewpoint.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you not consider [National Alliance  member] Mirko Tremaglia's election as head of the lower house  foreign affairs committee a provocation to those abroad who have  expressed fears about the presence of neo-Fascists in our  government?    [Martino] No comment. I did not take part in the vote.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORALITY AND LYLE WHEELER'S MISSING OSCARS  </P> <P> How pathetic it is that because of some quirk, a Long Beach couple, Sherry and  Tom, came to possess the five Oscars of a talented art director ("The Diary of  Lyle Wheeler's Oscars" by Daniel Cerone, Feb. 8). It is a measure of the  caliber of these people that they refuse to be identified by their last names.  </P> <P> JESSICA DAVIS  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: BellSouth in novel telecoms plan BELLSOUTH, the Baby Bell regional telephone company serving south-eastern US, yesterday announced an unusual plan to allow outside parties to attach new telecommunications services to its advanced computer-based network. US telecommunications companies usually deny outsiders access to their computer networks and BellSouth, the largest of the Baby Bells, claimed yesterday that it was the first to propose 'significant opening of its reservoir of advanced technologies to other service developers'. The plan provides further evidence of the rapid convergence of the telecommunications, computer and media industries and the decline of the monopolies enjoyed by US local telephone companies. Under the BellSouth plan, customers and developers of enhanced telecommunications services would be able to plug in to the company's Advanced Intelligent Network, the telecommunications industry's equivalent of a computer's basic operating software. Mr Duane Ackerman, president of BellSouth telecommunications, said the move would spur the development of new services, such a voice recognition and personalised telephone numbers which followed individuals wherever they went. 'Doubtless we'll create competition for some of our own advanced services,' he said. 'However, our extensive research clearly indicates that increased growth of our network by our own customers, coupled with usage growth generated by new enhanced service providers, will increase our AIN revenues overall.' The company stressed that the plug-in capability would not allow an outsider to delve deeply into the network and compromise the integrity of the network. BellSouth filed its plan yesterday with the Federal Communications Commission, the government agency which oversees the industry and must first approve the proposal.</p>

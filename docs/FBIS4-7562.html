			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Michele Kayal: "Slovaks Taxing European </F> Union's Patience"]    [Text] The last remaining tie of the broken marriage  between Czechs and Slovaks--the special trade relationship  between the former federation partners--suffered a serious blow  last week when Slovakia slapped a 10 percent import tax on  nearly everything crossing its border.    The measure, announced without warning on March 3 by the  Slovak government, immediately imposed the tax on all consumer  goods from all countries. It was the second trade barrier thrown  up by the Slovaks in three weeks.    Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, rushing to protect his  country's exporters, responded with a 3 percent devaluation of  the Czech crown in relation to the clearing ECU (the European  Union's currency unit for trade payments between the two  republics). The move effectively made Czech goods 3 percent less  expensive in Slovakia and Slovak goods 3 percent more expensive  in the Czech Republic.    Slovak Finance Ministry officials described the tax as an  attempt to raise money to shore up the country's trade deficit  with the Czech Republic. They said it would remain in place for  six months.    "It's only temporary," said ministry spokesman Miroslav  Polacek. "We have to get a better position for the balance of  payments for the Slovak Republic. It's not for the defense of  our internal market."    Since the Czech-Slovak monetary union ended in February  1993,  Slovakia has run a consistent deficit with the Czech Republic.  Bratislava paid Prague $100 million to cover its deficit for  December 1993 and January 1994. In February, however, Slovakia  did not owe the Czech Republic anything, according to a  spokesman for the Czech National Bank.    Klaus said he recognized the move as "legitimate," but added  that the two sides should reevaluate their customs union, the  special arrangement that allows the two countries to be treated  as a single trading bloc.    "[The customs union] will exist," said Czech government  spokeswoman Klara Pospisilova, "but probably the rules will  change." Officials would not comment on details of possible  changes, but Klaus will likely meet Slovak Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar next week.    The new Slovak tax also raised the hackles of the  international community, which had previously voiced loud  opposition to a Slovak measure introduced on February 11 that  suddenly required that certificates of quality for foodstuff  imports be presented at the border.    "We are not opposed to the measure as such. We are aware of  their economic difficulties," said Gerhard Sabathil of the  European Union's Prague delegation. "[But] there's a clear  obligation of the country to consult such measures beforehand  with the EU. And as we told them this three weeks ago when they  introduced the certificates, it's really disappointing."</p>

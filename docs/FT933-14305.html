			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Printing clash over bargaining THE GPMU print union and the British Print Industry Federation yesterday clashed over the results of this year's company-by-company bargaining which followed the breakdown of national pay bargaining earlier this year. The GPMU said 1,334 companies - about 60 per cent of the total - had agreed to the union's minimum terms of a Pounds 6.50 rise in weekly pay on the skilled rate, an increase of about 4 per cent. The federation said two-thirds of the 858 companies it surveyed had paid below the union claim and 235 had enforced pay freezes. It says the average settlement is 1.9 per cent.</p>

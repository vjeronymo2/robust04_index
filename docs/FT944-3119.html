			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / E German rail sale in sight Advent International, the Boston-based venture capital company, is expected to confirm today that it has bought Deutsche Waggonbau, east Germany's giant railway manufacturer and one of the last remaining industrial complexes under the Treuhand privatisation agency. The sale will be announced during a special meeting of DWA's board, according to Treuhand officials and the IG Metall steel and engineering union. The DWA acquisition will pose a considerable challenge for Advent and its technological partners, who have yet to be named. DWA - which once employed over 24,000 workers before German unification but now employs 6,600 - was regarded as one of the most difficult cases for the Treuhand, which winds up operations on December 31. To make the enterprises's five subsidiaries more attractive to investors, the management will have to cut 1,835 more jobs after next July. The Treuhand recently agreed to extend a further DM400m (Pounds 163m) as part of DWA's restructuring programme and to find new markets. DWA last year had a turnover of DM1.2bn, but this is expected to fall to DM1bn on losses and debts of DM390m for 1994.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (21): Projects will cost Dollars 300bn - Taiwan: Finance CONSTRUCTION companies are used to perusing glossy brochures containing details of grandiose national development plans. Mostly they come to nought. Much of eastern Europe, Africa and South America can easily identify great need for new construction. Unfortunately - in many cases miserably for their populations - ambitious spending programmes often run well ahead of a country's ability to pay for them. Asia is one of the few regions where a need for new construction in transport, water and energy services is matched by the financial strength of some of the world's fastest-growing economies. This is most apparent in Taiwan which last year launched a six-year development plan to modernise its infrastructure and remove bottlenecks which are constraining manufacture and transport of goods and services in the country. The programme is expected to cost more than Dollars 300bn between 1991 and the end of 1996. The country has enjoyed continuous economic growth for more than two decades. The average annual rise in GNP between 1981 and 1990 was 8 per cent. It was almost 9.7 in the previous decade. Foreign reserves at the end of last year totalled about Dollars 80bn while the country had a balance of trade surplus at the end of 1991 of Dollars 15.7bn. Central government borrowings as a proportion of annual spending only once exceeded 10 per cent between 1981 and 1991. In three of those years, government debt as proportion of its annual spending was less than 3 per cent. This state of affairs may change as state, local authorities and public sector corporations increase borrowings to pay for new construction, Taiwan Power, the state-owned electricity generating corporation, has estimated that it will need to raise domestic and international long-term debt of Dollars 70bn by the year 2001. The money will meet three quarters of the cost of a Dollars 94bn power station development and expansion programme. In the fiscal year to the end of June, the government is expected to have raised TDollars 235bn (Dollars 9.5bn) in treasury bonds. This is likely to represent about 24 per cent of central government spending in the current year and would be a threefold increase on the value of the previous year's government bond issues. The pace of public sector borrowing is likely to be sustained as construction of large-scale projects gets underway. There is some concern about the impact this may have on domestic inflation and interest rates. Inflation in the year to the end of March rose to 4.5 per cent - the fifth month in succession that annual inflation has been more than 4 per cent. Traditionally inflation has been running at less than 3 per cent a year in Taiwan. Mr Wang Chien-hsien, finance minister, has said that he will not pursue developments at the expense of Taiwan's strong economic and financial position. Budgets, he stresses, will be determined annually according to the prevailing economic climate and will be trimmed back if necessary. It is difficult, however, to see how Taiwan can avoid a big increase in public construction given the shortcomings of its infrastructure which has reached the point at which it is restraining further economic growth. Last summer, demand for electricity outstripped the productive capacity of power stations, leading to a series of power cuts across the country. Congestion on the roads, particularly in Taipei, the capital, causes serious delays and inhibits the free movement of goods and services essential for a healthy economy. There is also concern about growing social unrest as people demand improvements to their way of life. About one third of Taiwan's domestic waste is estimated to be disposed of on illegal dumps because of the shortage of landfill sites. There is an urgent need to ease the strain on large cities. One of the most important aims of the six-year plan is to encourage greater commercial and industrial development away from the cities to rural areas. This will require large-scale pump-priming of public sector investment in land and services before private investment in new factories, process plant, offices and shops will follow. There will be some opportunities for private sector investment in infrastructure but these are likely to be only small in comparison with the overall cost of development. The Finance Ministry has indicated it would prefer the proposed TDollars 40bn mass transit link between Chiang Kai-shek international and Taipei domestic airport to be financed by private investors. This compares with the T444bn construction cost of the first phase of the Taipei Mass Transit system, currently under construction, all of which is being funded by the public sector. There are also plans to privatise small sections of the proposed new national motorway network as well as the new high-speed rail link down the western corridor of the island. In most cases, however, public investment will have to bear at least the brunt of the initial investment. The expected pace of development during the next few years, therefore, is likely to lead to a big increase in public sector capital programmes. Annual investment in construction by the public sector is forecast to rise from an average of about 7.5 per cent of GNP during the mid-1980s to an average of almost 14 per cent between 1991 and 1996. While there is concern about the impact that this level of spending will have on inflation and interest rates, there is sufficient room within the Taiwanese economy to carry out a large slice of a programme to which it seems firmly committed.</p>

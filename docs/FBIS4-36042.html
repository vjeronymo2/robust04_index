			<p>CSO     [Text] 17 Ordibehesht [7 May] KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News Service  -- Last year more than 2,000 compatriots living in Germany  obtained Iranian visas from Iran's representatives in this  country after continued asylum was denied to them. Half of them  have returned to the country.    The public relations office of Iran's Embassy in Bonn  reports  that these people left Iran without authorization for various  reasons, including such things as the fact that they were  forbidden to leave, their obligatory military service status was  unclear or they were planning to continue their educations.  However, following KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's interview with Deputy  Foreign Minister Manuchehr Motaki and the clear announcement of  the Iranian Government's new policy to grant Iranian visas to  all compatriots outside the country lacking identity papers,  they went to our country's representative offices in Germany and  obtained visas.    According to the report from the public relations office of  the Iranian Embassy in Bonn, last year more than 1,000 Iranians  who obtained visas returned to the country from Germany.    Based on the same report, thousands of Iranians living in  Germany, using the facilities created for them, are happily  reporting to Iran's Embassy and Consulates and preparing to go  to Iran with hopes of returning to the embrace of their families.    Also, one month prior to this, KEYHAN-E HAVA'I reported the  issuance of visas for 150 compatriots living in Rome and the  return of many of them to Iran.    It is worth mentioning that on page 1 of KEYHAN-E HAVA'I  issue 1,078 it was reported that the number of Iranians living  in Germany who obtained Iranian visas last year was 1,000, but  the correct figure is 2,000.</p>

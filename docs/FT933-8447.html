			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Builders report summer upturn RECOVERY in the housing market has picked up again after concern that it might be faltering, the House Builders Federation reported yesterday. It said reservations had improved in the normally lean month of July after the pace of recovery slowed in the previous two months. Mr Tony Hillier, federation president, said: 'I am certainly encouraged by these figures, particularly as the increase in reservations has come during summer, always the leanest of housebuying times.' The balance in the federation's survey between companies reporting a rise in net reservations and those reporting a decline compared with 1992 was 25 per cent in July compared with 19 per cent in June and 27 per cent in May. The survey also says that 68 per cent of housebuilders surveyed expect their sales to increase this year.</p>

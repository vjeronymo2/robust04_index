			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Norway struggles to rekindle Community spirit: Opposition to EC membership is as strong as it was in 1972 when it was rejected in a referendum NORWAY'S ruling Labour party is gearing up to lodge a fresh application for membership of the European Community by the end of this month. But it will be hard-pressed to win acceptance from an electorate that is not only deeply sceptical about joining the EC but also increasingly opposed to the minority government itself. Opposition to EC membership is as strong as it was in 1972, when it was narrowly rejected in a bitterly divisive referendum. Recent polls put the No vote at 51 per cent, with 30 per cent in favour and the rest undecided. Before neighbouring Denmark narrowly rejected the Maastricht treaty in June, Norwegian support for EC membership had grown to an unprecedented majority. But the Danish vote came as a blow and resistance to Europe has been further strengthened by growing opposition in Sweden, where 53 per cent of the electorate now say they would vote against membership if a referendum were held today. Meanwhile, support for Norway's Labour government was put at 24.6 per cent in an opinion poll published yesterday, its lowest level ever. Norwegians are particularly angry about unemployment, running at a post-war high of 7.6 per cent, including those on government training schemes. Yet Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the indomitable prime minister, is seeking a mandate from the party's annual conference on Sunday to file a fresh EC application. Mrs Brundtland argues that EC membership will give Norway the chance to help shape future EC law which could affect the country. After an uphill struggle, the government in September succeeded in pushing through parliament the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, a 19-nation trade pact encompassing the EC and Efta, of which Norway is a member. The EEA, considered by many a stepping stone towards EC membership, will take effect from next year, but it is vague about the powers Efta countries will have over future EC legislation. Mr Finn Kristensen, Norway's energy and industry minister, said recently that Norway would use a 'veto' if the EC refused to consider the country's wishes in a draft proposal for an energy directive. Norway is western Europe's biggest oil producer alongside Britain, with daily average production of about 2.2m barrels. It argues that the state owns all petroleum reserves under the seabed off the country's coast and should be able to decide who exploits these reserves. Many Norwegians, sceptical about the EEA as well, fear Norway will lose sovereignty over vast natural resources and will no longer have a say in agricultural and fisheries policy. At least two-thirds of Labour's 300 conference delegates are expected to support a new application, with opposition coming mainly from northern regions where fishing and agriculture are the main source of income and unemployment is the highest in the country. To pacify opponents, Mrs Brundtland said that an application did not necessarily mean Norway would join the EC. 'What we experienced 20 years ago is repeating itself,' she admitted this week. 'People in this country have a strong fear of being taken over by outside forces.' But she argues that Norway should seek to join with Sweden and Finland, which have both applied, and that being the only Nordic country outside the EC, with no one to plead its case, would have more serious consequences for the country than joining. By mid-November, the Labour government is expected to inform parliament of its decision to reapply for membership. This will be followed by a formal parliamentary debate in which at least 100 of a total 165 MPs are expected to support a new membership application. It is important that Norway stick to this schedule if it is to enter negotiations with Brussels next year alongside Sweden and Finland. This means an application will have to be delivered before the Edinburgh EC summit in December. It would then be submitted to a crucial referendum in 1995.</p>

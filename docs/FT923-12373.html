			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / EMS: hanging on to Germany's coat tails PETER NORMAN looks at the reasons for Mr Norman Lamont's economic strategy. Q. In 1990, Britain pegged the pound to other currencies in the European Monetary System to achieve low inflation, low interest rates and steady growth. What we have is somewhat lower inflation, high interest rates and virtually no growth. What's gone wrong? A. German unification. Nobody knew in October 1990 that it would cause such a surge of inflation in Germany, which the Bundesbank, the independent German central bank, is fiercely committed to bring down. That has meant ever higher interest rates in Germany, forcing other EMS members to keep rates high. Q. But isn't Germany having such difficulty absorbing east Germany that this might weaken its economy for years? And doesn't this mean that the idea of Germany as the anchor of the EMS is no longer valid? A. Yes and no. The German economy is no longer the powerhouse that it was and the D-Mark is no longer omnipotent. On the other hand, the D-Mark has such a formidable reputation that nobody thinks it will be devalued. Q. But Germany has an inflation rate higher than that of France and, on some measures, above that of the UK. Why can't we just cut interest rates below those of Germany? A. A good question. Financial markets still think Germany will beat inflation and are happy to invest in the D-Mark. That means the D-Mark interest rates set a floor for other currencies. Q. But isn't there a mechanism for dealing with this? It seems crazy to have a system that forces everybody to follow German rates. A. The EMS was designed for flexibility. Its rules allow for realignments of currencies within the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS. In theory, sterling could be devalued or the D-Mark revalued. Q. So why hasn't that happened? A. Ask the politicians. In recent years, EC finance ministers have become increasingly determined not to alter parities in the system. The last significant realignment was early in 1987 - more than five years ago. Since then, EMS members have held their existing parities, believing that: Devaluation against the D-Mark would weaken their own battles against inflation. It would force them to push interest rates even higher to convince the financial markets that they haven't softened their stances against inflation. It would been seen as a setback on the way to European economic and monetary union. Also, governments hate devaluing their currencies because it smacks of weakness. Q. But surely questions of prestige are secondary when you have an economy mired in recession and suffering from rising unemployment. Why do we stay in the EMS? A. The government says there is no alternative. It might have a point. After all, the UK stayed out of the EMS throughout the 1980s and experienced a savage recession and inflationary boom before slamming on the brakes again in 1988 and 1989. In that period of 'go-it-alone' policies, UK interest rates were lower than Germany's for only 16 weeks. Q. What could happen if we left the EMS? A. It would be uncharted territory. No EMS member state has left since the system was set up in 1979. Without the protection of the ERM, which enables Britain to call on its partners to help defend the pound, the currency might slump, triggering more inflation and forcing interest rates higher. Q. Are there no conditions under which we could leave the EMS without triggering a sterling crisis? A. Anything is possible in theory - but the government would have to persuade the markets that it had a completely convincing monetary and counter-inflation policy. That would require even tougher and more unpopular measures - big cuts in public spending and even lower wage rises to beat inflation. Q. Could we change the way the EMS works to allow member states more flexibility to raise or lower interest rates? A. Britain already has the advantage of allowing the pound to fluctuate in a wide band of 6 per cent either side of its central rates in the system. That compares with 2.25 per cent for most other countries. An even wider band would offer no discipline and no protection and would gain no support from other EMS members who already expect Britain to move to the 2.25 per cent band. Q. OK. But look at the US, Japan, Australia. Unlike sterling, they have floating currencies and they have all been able to cut rates. A. First, it is far from clear that low interest rates are producing a sound recovery in the US. Second, floating sterling with the aim of cutting rates would be a leap into the unknown. Britain's track record for going it alone is not good. Don't forget that just before we joined the EMS, bank base rates were 15 per cent. They are now 10 per cent. Germany's Lombard rate was 8 per cent. It is now 9.75 per cent. The narrowing difference is largely due to the the protection of the EMS. Britain's trade with the rest of the world might suffer. Any strong depreciation of sterling would risk higher import prices and a new inflationary spiral. Q. But a bit more inflation would not matter, would it? A. Any policy that has a whiff of being soft on inflation will be punished cruelly by financial markets, leading to even higher interest rates. Q. So what can we do? A. Not a lot. We just have to hope that Germany will get inflation under control. The difficulty is that there is a weak coalition government in Bonn. With a German general election in 1994, that situation may well get worse rather than better.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Jobs at 10 threatened pits likely to be safe until spring MINERS AT the 10 pits ear-marked by British Coal for early closure seem assured of jobs until at least well into the spring after the government yesterday gave consultants until the middle of March to report on the mines' viability. The likelihood is that there will be several weeks, or months, of debate even after the report is completed. Unions have already said that they do not accept consultants John T. Boyd as the independent scrutineer called for by High Court judges last month. The March 15 deadline set by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, may slip further. He acknowledged this in the terms of reference which say that he may agree to a later date. Before the High Court decision, British Coal had planned to make the miners redundant on January 29. The corporation said yesterday that no decisions would be taken on the pits' future until all consultations were complete. Betws, in south Wales, yesterday became the last of the 10 to cease production with representatives of the 90 miners there saying they had figures showing it was heading for a Pounds 1m profit this year. Perhaps the best hope for the 10 pits will be if the Commons trade and industry committee recommends saving them when it reports this month. Members of the committee will today receive ideas from Mr Richard Caborn, the Labour chairman. However Dr Keith Hampson, a Conservative member, said he thought about half the 31 pits initially suggested for closure could be saved.</p>

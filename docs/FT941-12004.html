			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / IMF in Moscow visit: Western delegation fails to raise loan hopes A mission from the International Monetary Fund flew into Moscow yesterday amid fading prospects of quickly unblocking a new Dollars 1.5bn loan and of forging a new type of IMF support package for Russia. Despite announcing that the new government planned to use 'non-monetary' methods to fight inflation, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, has still talked of continuing market reform and of expecting western financial support for his efforts. He was expected, however, to be out of Moscow for most of this week. 'It's very difficult to tell what will happen, whether the delegation will spend most of its time visiting museums or whether we will find a new language of mutual understanding,' said one western official. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the new economics minister, has called on the IMF to help the government draw up a budget for 1994, and to help it design industrial and social security policies. The IMF has been berated by Professor Jeffrey Sachs for not providing enough money when the radical reformers he used to advise were still in power. It is now anxious to 'show the flag' so that it is not accused of indifference and a lack of understanding of Russian problems. However, it has clearly left its most powerful shareholders - the world's seven richest nations who make up the G7 - to decide whether it should abandon demands for progress on Russia's inflation and budget deficits as a condition for financial support. 'What will we give Russia in March if we give the Dollars 1.5bn now?' asked a western official, referring to the second tranche of a special loan designed to help countries move from communism to capitalism - which Mr Chernomyrdin wanted to receive this month. 'We seem to have to give Russia money periodically. It's like breathing. Now they're going to say they have to pay the bills left behind by Gaidar and Fyodorov (the radicals attacked for not honouring spending commitments made by the state in order to keep down inflation),' he said. 'The injection of money into the economy will create a sense of normalcy but then there will be new inflation and they will tighten up again. It depends on how deeply they breathe. If they are very careful, the same person who does the expiring will also do the inspiring.' But the western official added that the IMF and the G7 seemed happy to agree on a 'wait and see approach' until the new government's reform policies became clearer. He pointed out that the G7 was expected to discuss Russia in detail at the end of February.</p>

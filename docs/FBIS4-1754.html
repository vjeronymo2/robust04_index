			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 26 (XINHUA) -- The Beijing Municipal  Government's persistent efforts in boosting the high-tech  industry has proved rewarding with a large number of high-tech  giants mushrooming all over the ancient capital city.    Statistics show that high-tech enterprises in Beijing  totalled 4,443 last year, including 980 joint ventures, creating  profits worth more than 11.3 billion yuan.    Among them, 15 boast revenues exceeding 100 million yuan  each  and another 130 have made profits topping the 10 million yuan  mark.    The Beijing Municipal Government has attached great  importance to the exploitation of new and high technology during  recent years as part of the efforts to boost overall prosperity.    In order to open more channels for fund-raising and to  better  adapt the management and operating mechanism to international  standards, the local government has encouraged various high-tech  enterprises to introduce the joint-stock system.    Stone Corporation and the Beijing Legend Computer Group  Company, the country's two leading high-tech enterprises, have  both been listed on stock exchanges and raised more funds for  further development.    Beijing has the country's largest number of scientific  institutes, universities, all kinds of talents and China's first  technology-intensive scientific zone -- Zhongguancun in Haidian  District -- providing a firm foundation for the burgeoning of  the high-tech sector.    Success of the Beijing University Founder Group Company,  which has quickly built a good reputation in the past several  years, is based on the scientific and technological strength of  the country's top school of higher learning.    Color laser photocomposition developed by the company has  ushered in a new era in China's industry in printing Chinese  characters, the world's most complicated written characters.    The founder company created record profits worth 900 million  yuan in 1993 (more than 100 million U.S. dollars according to  the current exchange rate) and is confidently heading toward the  vast domestic market of high-tech electrical telecommunications  products.    Praised as the "dark horse" by its counterparts, Lantong  Electronics Co., Ltd in the Beijing high-tech experimental  development zone has miraculously occupied 60 percent of the  domestic display screen market almost overnight. Aggregate  sales of the company also soared to 100 million yuan from the  initial 16 million yuan last year.    Collective or individual high-tech enterprises founded by  state scientific research institutes and universities have also  shown great vitality.    The Huasheng Computer Co., Ltd., under a department of the  Ministry of Electronics Industry, has become a big profit earner  with a yearly income of 300 million yuan.    The Violight Group Company of Qinghua University, the  country's number one school in natural sciences, has put  100-plus of its latest inventions and technological achievements  into production and produced great social and economic benefits.    According to reliable sources, the Beijing Municipal  Government plans to promote new high-tech zones that have  gradually taken shape including a land information center in  Haidian District and two science and technology zones in  Changping and Fengtai Districts.    A technology development zone in Qinghua University and a  biological garden in Beijing University are also to be set up in  the near future.</p>

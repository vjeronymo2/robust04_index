			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Arts: ENO revivals - London Coliseum Two of the February revivals at English National Opera have, at some time or another, been connected with anniversaries. The highly-praised Xerxes was mounted in 1985 to mark 300 years since Handel's birth and now that has been joined by a revival of Rossini's The Barber of Seville for his bicentenary, which falls at the weekend. Unfortunately the latter is not much of a birthday present, especially to a composer who was a leap-year baby and deserves all the attention he can get. Both operas were entrusted to producers of known intelligence, but it would seem that there was nothing in The Barber of Seville on which Jonathan Miller's rapacious intellectual appetite might feed. The cupboard of ideas was bare from the beginning and this revival offers only a few crumbs of interest. Its main virtues are negative ones. The production has nothing new or controversial to say about Rossini in general, or this opera in particular, and it confines itself to the old routines. Most of the singers have most of the notes, but if there was ever any Italian brilliance of spirit in which the characters put them across, which seems unlikely, there is little of it left now. Where any sense of enjoyment surfaces, it is usually connected with the Dr Bartolo of Andrew Shore. This singer is well practised at the Italian buffo roles and his easy assurance in comedy is allied to a welcome feeling for character, in this case making the usually unsympathetic Bartolo a bit of an old woman in an endearing way. The loving look that he gives Rosina at the end, when he knows he has lost her, is really quite touching. Indeed, it is difficult to see any serious reason as to why she should pass him up for Peter Bronder's Count Almaviva, whom this production makes a singularly unattractive, pampered dandy. Eirian James is the pretty Rosina, dressed up in pink silk and red roses, the very bloom of innocence with not much hint of the thorns that should lie below the petals; Michael Lewis has the right brightness of manner for Figaro. But neither quite manages to raise the spirits. Richard Angas's unsubtle foghorn of a Don Basilio certainly does not. Jacek Kaspszyk conducts. There is absolutely no comparison between that lacklustre show and the scintillating Xerxes which is now nearing its final performances this season. I caught the production on Monday, by which point two new singers and a new conductor had joined the cast, and can eagerly recommend the last couple of showings. A carefully balanced team has in no way been upset by the newcomers. Louise Winter makes a fine Xerxes, who sings with a bright, firm mezzo, and treads neatly along the dividing line between haughty seriousness and absurdity with which this production so amuses itself; Yvonne Howard was a stirring Amastris, who rose confidently to her character's outpourings of revenge. Noel Davis was taking over as conductor and only occasionally lost his soloists. Above all, this is an evening when the intelligent approach is fully vindicated, for Nicholas Hytner's staging is still all of a piece, stylish to look at, unfailingly clever in what it has to say and the way it says it. If only Rossini could have been as fortunate.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs to see report on Church finance A REPORT on the finances of the Church of England by the accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand is to be published, MPs heard yesterday. Mr Michael Alison, the Conservative MP for Selby - who represents the Church Commissioners in the Commons - gave the undertaking during oral questions. Publication date had not yet been determined, he told Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead. The report was commissioned following criticism last year of the Church Commissioners' investment performance. Last July, the Financial Times reported that the commissioners had suffered Pounds 500m investment losses.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Personal View: Why Cadbury leaves a bitter taste - Sir Owen Green, chairman of BTR, responds to the report of the committee on corporate governance The Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance begins with the words: 'The country's economy depends on the drive and efficiency of its companies.' Certainly, all constructive proposals aimed at improving that drive and efficiency are to be welcomed. Sadly, the report that follows is long on accountability but short on drive and efficiency. The proposals relate almost exclusively to the well-being of investors, current and potential, who are described as 'owners of the company'. The report makes several references to their responsibilities as owners, but my reading of the report suggests that it is more about their rights. The concept of ownership, as distinct from membership, of a limited liability company is novel, untested and inappropriate. The expression 'owner' does not appear in the Companies Act, and the normal obligations of a true owner are, except in respect of unpaid share capital, non-existent. Perhaps the description has been introduced to stir a perceived apathy illustrated by the voting habits of members of companies. The report begins its section on corporate governance by defining it as 'the system by which companies are run'. It is not: running the company is the function of the executive. If taken literally, the report's recommendations would produce a hydra-headed organisation, alien to the aims of drive and efficiency. For example, paragraph 4.3 of the report urges that 'if the chairman is an executive director, a senior non-executive director should be appointed to take the lead,' presumably against the chairman and his executive colleagues. This unworthy proposal could easily be avoided by requiring instead that the chairman should not also be the chief executive. In any company of size, the roles are distinct and sometimes incompatible. This is not the only example of the report's belief in committee paramountcy. Elsewhere, for example, it suggests that the chairman of the company may no longer be responsible for answering questions at the annual general meeting about audit matters, even though these are important enough to require a page and a half of proposals. Yet another chairman/spokesman may need to answer to the AGM, this time on remuneration. A more divisive aspect of paragraph 4.3 is the way it strikes at the heart of the unitary board. It begins by restating the legal position that all directors are equally responsible for the board's decisions. But the committee immediately reveals its view of the real purpose of non-executive directors. They are there to monitor the performance of the board (including themselves?) and that of the chief executive. As mentioned earlier, the paragraph recommends the appointment of a senior non-executive director 'to take the lead, in order to maintain the balance between executive and non-executive influence'. If the members of the committee believe in a unitary board, as I do, this is nonsense. If they seek this kind of segregation, they should have the courage of their convictions and advocate a two-tier board structure. There is more double-speak by the committee in paragraph 4.7. It says: 'The emphasis in this report on the control function of non-executive directors is a consequence of our remit and should not in any way detract from the primary and positive contribution which they are expected to make, as board members, to the leadership of the company.' This is followed by a series of proposals. None is about leadership; all stress the difference between the non-executive directors' status and contribution and those of directors with executive responsibilities. A house divided, the Bible tells us, cannot stand . . . Of all the report's recommendations, I think the proposals on audit committees are the least meritorious, notwithstanding the practice in the US. This committee, says the report, should be entirely composed of non-executive directors. It should recommend the appointment of the auditors, review the company's financial statements, and discuss the audit with the auditors. At best, this is sheltering the auditors. It offers a crutch, of no legal status, to the non-audit committee directors. At worst, it discourages other members of the board from seeking individual satisfaction in the discharge of one of the board's primary collective duties: to ensure on behalf of the shareholders a proper reflection of their governance of the enterprise expressed in published financial terms. The arrogance of this imported proposal is communicated through the committee's own words. The report describes at length the limitations of auditor's responsibility. Then, in stark contrast, it blandly describes the unlimited responsibilities of the board for the financial statements. The striking difference between these two exposures surely requires the most direct contact between every member of the board and the auditors, rather than restricting this to a committee - no matter how composed. The report refers to the competitive pressures, both on companies and auditors, which make it difficult for auditors to stand up to demanding boards. This seems to imply that the absolute requirement of an auditor  - integrity - is regarded, apparently with understanding, as a victim of competitive pressure. If that is the case, it is surely the auditing profession which is in need of a committee review. One other recommendation seems likely to add nothing but length to financial reports. The committee says that directors 'should state in their report that the business is a going concern, with supporting assumptions or qualifications as necessary'. Such qualifications will surely ensure that all reports contain the going concern statement, rendering its inclusion valueless. The report's subliminal message is of the need for total integrity and a healthy objectivity in company affairs. This is strongly to be supported. But the need for a code in addition to existing rules and regulations is doubtful - as is its likely effectiveness in reducing the relatively few instances of misbehaviour. I believe that existing laws and regulations are adequate for the purpose of corporate governance and that the statistically few failures stem from the quality of the participants rather than the quantity of the regulations. As the report itself points out, 'raising standards of corporate governance cannot be achieved by structures and rules alone . . . what counts is the way they are put to use.' That goes for all laws - but we still have criminals.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Investors to vote on Beverley debt proposals Shareholders in Beverley Group, the engineering concern previously known as Petrocon, will decide on Monday whether to sell a number of businesses and properties to a vehicle controlled by its directors in a series of complex deals which the company said was designed to reduce debt. Investors will also be asked to approve the sale of Gall Thomson Marine, Beverley's most profitable subsidiary, to Villiers, the USM-quoted engineering company, for up to Pounds 4m. In a prospectus sent to shareholders, dated December 31, Beverley proposes to sell two wholly owned subsidiaries, Beverley Group (Almondsbury) Ltd (BGAL) and ESL, for Pounds 1 each to Woodlands Grange Engineering, the executive directors' privately owned company. Beverley's three independent directors, advised by stockbroker Henry Cooke Corporate Finance, recommend the transactions to shareholders as 'vital to the group's future'. However, some shareholders are believed to be unhappy with the property and business disposals to Woodland Grange. For example, the agreement leaves one of the subsidiaries being sold, BGAL, with Pounds 237,000 in cash. The directors say this is equivalent to the amount which Beverley would have paid in redundancies if it closed the business. However, these employees will not be made redundant when ownership is transferred. The transactions also include the sale of ESL, a surveying subsidiary. Beverley is writing off inter-company debt of Pounds 821,000 and repaying a Pounds 359,000 bank overdraft. The circular says fully audited accounts for all the businesses in ESL are not available after 1991. Once they are part of Woodlands Grange, BGAL's employees will still be able to provide management and administrative services to Beverley Group. Mr Colin Robinson, chairman, said this allowed Beverley to retain access to its acquisition team, when the time was ripe for expansion. Under the agreement, fees for such services cannot exceed Pounds 70,000 this year, unless one non-executive director approves an increase. Mr Robinson said Beverley had decided not to close ESL because this would have entailed significant costs for the company. Woodlands Grange is also buying three properties from Beverley for a total of Pounds 997,000, some Pounds 650,000 less than book value. Shareholder concern is focused on the valuations of the properties, including the head office at Woodlands Grange, Bristol, which is being sold to the directors' private company for Pounds 612,000. The property is held in Beverley's books at Pounds 1.1m. Beverley will continue to occupy at least 50 per cent of the property for an annual rent payable to Woodlands Grange Engineering of Pounds 51,000. The circular says the lease contains an option allowing Beverley to occupy further space in the building. Another property, in Great Yarmouth, is being sold to Woodland Grange for Pounds 185,000. This property yields net income of Pounds 48,000 a year. Mr Robinson said that 'in order for the group to have adequate working capital for its present requirements, it is necessary that the disposals are approved by shareholders'. Mr Robinson, who has previously worked for Gerald Ronson's Heron and Robert Maxwell at Hollis Industries, took a stake in Petrocon in 1991 intending to expand the group through acquisition. The first purchase was Beverley, the vehicle for the private interests of Mr Robinson, his wife, Eleanor, Mr Christopher Colbeck and Mr Michael Bridge. Petrocon then changed its name to Beverley. Mr Colbeck, Mrs Robinson and Mr Bridge are now directors of the quoted company. Mr Robinson said recession and the discovery of 'significant problems' in Petrocon had forced the board to abandon its expansion strategy. The group also incurred substantial costs last year in its abortive and highly controversial Pounds 35m bid for James Wilkes, the rival engineering company.</p>

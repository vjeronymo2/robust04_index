			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean Dupont, special correspondent in Plymouth: </F> "British Aerospace Is Betting on Its Equipment"--first paragraph  is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] In its global recentering strategy, BAe (British  Aerospace) has spared its BASE subsidiary, which specializes in  equipment. Quite simply because BASE already occupies a strong  position in each of its special fields of operation.    It is within British Aerospace, an island that seems to have  been spared by the interplay of mergers, conglomerations, and  consolidaitons most of the aviation activities of this  British-style industrial empire are currently plagued with. This  haven of peace is called BASE, an acronym for British Aerospace  Systems and Equipment, and it is a 100 percent subsidiary of the  combine that specializes in aviation equipment. BASE employs  1,100 people divided between its head office in Plymouth and  Stevenage, the BAe's industrial center for missile operations.    At first glance, BASE's activities may seem to be fairly  disparate and not particularly complementary to one another:  motion detection and flight controls, navigation, optronics,  radomes, accident recorders, and, lastly, secured  communications. Actually, while these activities still appear to  be very diversified, a sorting out process was effected as far  back as two years ago. It led to a 30 percent reduction in force  and the disappearance of a good many fields in which BASE did  not possess significant capability.    Following these cuts, Nigel Randall, the general manager of  BASE, retained only those special fields in which his company is  viable and has its own potential for development. Because, at  the British Aerospace level, BASE is a featherweight with its  sales volume of about 50 million pounds sterling (Fr435 million)  as against 4 billion pounds for the combine. And its activities  quite obviously do not figure centrally in the combine's chief  strategies. Therefore, Nigel Randall has to run his company like  an independent business that must find its own markets, clear a  regular profit margin, and be able to finance itself.    With regard to its main specialty, motion detection and  control surface activators, Nigel Randall presents BASE as the  bigges European manufacturer of gyros, an activity fostered over  the years by equipping the missiles produced by the parent  company. The company also inherited the activities of Sperry GB,  taken over in the mid-1980s, and has developed its own  fiber-optic gyrolaser and gyrometer techniques on the basis of  those activities. With 60 of its LINS 300 gyro units produced to  date (see box), BASE, along with Sextant Avionics, is currently  the only European manufacturer to mass produce inertial  gyrolaser units. These gyro units have already been delivered  installed on British Aerospace aircraft, the Hawk 100 and 200s,  but also on the Anglo-Italian EH-101 helicopter and on the  F-5retrofits in the Near East.    In its second special field, navigation, BASE has developed  a  digital cartography system, Terprom (terrain profile matching),  which has been retained by the U.S. Air Force on its F-16s.  Based on a Mil-Std-1750A processor, this equipment makes use of  the digitized terrain that it has in its memory bank and the  soundings of the radio altimeter to re-erect the aircraft's  navigation system with an accuracy range of 40 meters. To date,  Terprom has racked up over 700 sorties, 500 of them on the F-16.    The third special field: optronics, in which BASE has  developed Autotrack, a video gyrocompass ball with truly  universal capabilities since it can be found mounted on surface,  naval, or airborne platforms, as the core of fire-control units  for the Rapier 2000 ground-to-air and Swingfire antitank  missiles, the Sea Archer naval antiaircraft cannon, and, lastly,  GEC-Marconi's new TIALD laser designation pod.    BASE's fourth special field, radomes, was also developed  with  British Aerospace missiles. So, naturally, this activity was  established in Stevenage. BASE produces radomes for the whole  possible range of carrier speeds: from polyester radomes for  transport aircraft to the ceramic radomes of multiple-mach  missile via epoxy for supersonic aircraft and polyimide for  missiles.    With regard to BASE's fifth special field, accident  recorders, Nigel Randall pointed out that there has never been  any reason for complaining that their recorders ever lost any  data during a crash over 30 years of service. Today, 15  different types of aircraft are equipped with BASE recorders,  from the old Vickers VC-10s to the latest Tornados.    The sixth and last field is secured communications.  Classified under this field, we find products as diverse as HF  and VHF antennas, interface modules for the Mil-Std-1553, Stanag  3910, Arinc 429 and 629 buses, and, lastly, the MPS2000 secured  air freight system that the Royal Air Force has just ordered.    BASE has today reached a turning point in its development.  Having for a long time made a living form markets overlooked by  its combine, the subsidiary is now turning resolutely toward the  competitive market. For example, it has been smart enough to  develope ceramic accelerometers and gyrometers that are  cheap--but capable of withstanding acceleration forces of up to  10,000 Gs--for Merlin mortar shells. Toward the end of this year  1,000 m[.sup]2[/] of surface area provided with precision  machines were allocated for the production of these sensors at  the Plymouth plant, which enabled them to step up the production  rate to 100 units a month. Today, plans are ready for increasing  the pace to 100,000 a month by three years from now to tackle  the automobile market through the Japanese Sumitomo combine,  with which BASE is discussing the venture.    The marketing of radomes is competitive. The successes  recently recorded outside the parent company prove it: radomes  for the Eurofighter 2000, the Brazilian AMX, the Catrin d'Agusta  helicopter for battlefield surveillance, and the Pakistani  Mirage III and Singapore F-5 retrofits. This led BASE to open a  shop this year for repairs on radomes for Boeing 737 and 767s in  addition to the work it already had with the BAe 125 and 146s.  To get next year off to a start, BASE is putting a new  generation of static memory recorders on the market which  combine in the same housing the recording of conversations and  of aircraft parameters (A &amp; C No. 1448). The idea being to  install two identical combined recorders per aircraft to ensure  total redundance of recordings and to ward even farther off the  risks of loss of data in the envent of a crash. BASE provides  thehardening of its recorders against crashes and has formed a  partnership with the Japanese firm, Kokusai, which supplies the  memory units and, in return, permits the British company to have  access to the Japanese Air Force market.    As we can see, Nigel Randall is not lacking in projects for  his company. But, declining to divulge overly many figures when  he was questioned, he contented himself with asserting his very  great confidence in the future of his company, whose sales,  according to him, should show a growth rate higher than 50  percent over the next few years.  <H5>  Box: British Aerospace Bridgehead in NH90 </H5>   It is not easy for a British equipment manufacturer to  establish himself in a program in which England is not  participating. Let's not make ourselves out to be angels; the  reverse is probably also true. And yet, this is the challenge  that Andy Parritt, who is in charge of BASE sales, has set  himself for his LINS 300 inertial gyrolaser unit, which he wants  to install in the NH90, a French-Italian-German-Dutch helicopter  program.    Nevertheless, Andy Parritt is not acting rashly and he  carefully evaluated his chances of success before launching on  this venture. For him, the NH90 no longer resembles past joint  programs. In those programs political considerations blocked the  interaction and forced them to divide up the tasks among the  member states, sometimes even at the most elementary levels.  Andy Parritt is familiar with this situation: His company shares  the building of the Eurofighter radome with an Italian partner,  Alenia, a Spanish partner, INTA [National Institute for  Aerospace Research], and a German partner, DASA [German  Aerospace] (ex-TST). And his gyrolaser unit has not been  retained for this same aircraft in order to redistribute the  responsibilities to Italy, to the advantage of a unit to be  supplied by Lital--but whose gyros are to be manufactured by  Litton in the United States! As concerns the NH90, on the other  hand, the distribution of responsibilities among the states was  effected at the higher level to leave more room for the training  of the teams that are candidates for the program. And this was  done in the name of a certain measure of economic efficiency,  necessary under the circumstances because they will have to be  able to offer the helicopter on the more competitive civil  aircraft market.    Thus Andy Parritt draws the conclusion that he has been  offered a chance. His LINS 300 unit is credited with existing in  a version that was developed for the EH-101 helicopter, whose  basic missions (antisubmarine warfare and search and rescue) are  similar to those of the naval NH90. These missions are the most  demanding from the point of view of navigation and they will  determine the dimensions of the future European helicopter's  guidance systems. Thus Andy Parritt explained that his gyro unit  could be adapted to the NH90 specifications at a lower cost.    Specifically, BASE has developed some functions for the  EH-101 that are particularly appreciated for a naval helicopter.  Thus the LINS 300 is capable of aligning itself in flight by  automatically re-erecting itself on the basis of data from the  GPS [global positioning system] or the Doppler radiosonde, over  water as well, which makes it possible to take off from land by  shunting the few minutes normally required to complete an  alignment or at sea without any special device for loading the  ship's reference data into the helicopter's computers. This ease  of operation of the LINS 300 does not, nevertheless, compromise  its accuracy, which reaches the 0.2 mark, thus allowing the  helicopter to in flight designate to its carrier vesselits  objectives on the surface of the water so that it can adjust its  guns.    Andy Parritt confided to us that he is right now finalizing  a  partnership agreement with a French specialist in navigation.  Contacts have also been made with Eurocopter France at a higher  level. Even if the struggle is not an easy one for Andy Parritt,  the combine to which he belongs is already offering the Tiger,  in a joint venture with Eurocopter, in the British call for bids  for an attack helicopter.    In the event this bid is successful, BASE's presence in the  NH90 program would be a ready-made occasion for a round of  compensations which Her Majesty's government would not fail to  demand. So Andy Parritt has decided to try his luck.</p>

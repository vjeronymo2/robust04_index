			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Letter: UK's electricity structure not incompatible with efficiency Sir, Your editorial on the electricity generating duopoly ('Duopoly power', February 15) asserts that 'there is already evidence that the duopoly does not work to customers' advantage'. You also say that, were there to be a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the MMC could recommend a break up into smaller units. I suggest the industry structure is quite compatible with efficiency. Although privatisation was not ideally carried out, the UK will soon have some of the world's most efficient coal power stations, together with environmentally friendly gas power. Economic theory moved away some time ago from a simple association between industry structure and efficiency and any argument based purely on the duopoly claim needs to be justified. There are two theoretical benefits from break up: lower average production costs and more competitive pricing of the output. On the first point, it is scarcely credible that production costs would be lower with five or six companies - on the contrary there are probably some economies of scale. Both generating companies are now heading for a halved workforce with substantial reductions in other operating costs. On the second point, the regulator has accepted that pool prices remain below avoidable costs. The pool will be a highly imperfect spot market for some time to come, but there is no evidence that the generating companies are exploiting their power, for the simple reason that they would gain very little from it, but would immediately fall foul of the regulator. Both are now careful to avoid any behaviour that could be construed as anti-competitive. This largely removes any danger to the public interest. Break up would therefore probably raise the overhead cost of electricity and reduce the generation industry's purchasing economies in fuel and transport, for little or no benefit in the pool. It would also rob the UK of the opportunity to take a large position in the emerging foreign generation market, where the two companies should be able to produce substantial profits and export earnings in future. Over the next five years, the electricity regulator will be able to point to lower prices for most customers, better service and a choice of supply. This is not a bad outcome for an imperfect privatisation. Simon Taylor, fellow in economics, St Catherine's College, Cambridge CB2 1RL</p>

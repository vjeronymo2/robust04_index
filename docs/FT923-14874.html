			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Lloyd's 'irritated' by Hain attack LLOYD'S professionals yesterday reacted with surprise to being named in the Commons in connection with the losses on the reinsurance spiral. Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, used parliamentary privilege to allege in an early day motion that two members of the inquiry into the insurance market, chaired by Securities and Investment Board chairman Sir David Walker, had 'claimed millions of pounds' on the LMX - London market excess - spiral. Lloyd's called Mr Hain's motion 'irritating' and said: 'If nothing else it demonstrates his complete lack of understanding of the London insurance market.' In the motion Mr Hain said that Mr John Lock and Mr Leslie Lucas, both of whom served on the Walker committee, had claimed money on the spiral  - the controversial reinsurance system in which syndicates and companies trading in London reinsure each other's exposures to catastrophe risks. Mr Hain's motion named other senior Lloyd's figures in the context of LMX business. It called for a 'full public and independent' inquiry into the market, 'together with its proper regulation by statute'. Mr Leslie Lucas, chief executive of Norwich Winterthur Reinsurance, said that he was 'astonished' to be named in the motion. He added that his company had claimed - and also paid - millions of pounds in connection with the spiral. The text of Mr Hain's motion said that 'the Walker report into the Lloyd's Insurance market does not reveal the extent to which five members of the Lloyd's Council, who manage syndicates, used the LMX 'dustbin' syndicates for their own reinsurance to the tune of Pounds 623.5m, nor that Stephen Merrett has losses on his syndicate 418 of Pounds 230.8m, which he has unloaded onto the LMX 'dustbin' syndicates to the extent (of) Pounds 229.8m, nor that Alan Jackson had a loss of Pounds 93.5m and claimed Pounds 122.5m from his reinsurers'. The motion added that the report also had not revealed that 'members of the Committee of Lloyd's caused and actively encouraged the enormous growth in LMX business'. Meanwhile, Lloyd's confirmed that the extraordinary general meeting which is to be held on July 27 would lead to a postal ballot if at least 50 members present at the meeting called for one. Its response followed concern from some disaffected Names - the individuals whose assets back the market - that Lloyd's was backing down from permitting a ballot to take place. Lloyd's governing council faces votes of no confidence at the meeting following the disclosure of Pounds 2bn losses in 1989.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Observer: Mommas The world's highest chances of meeting a femme fatale are probably in Switzerland. Not only does almost every able-bodied male citizen have a rifle and ammunition at home against the dreaded day when the country is invaded, but the 2,500-strong Swiss Women's Military Service are now allowed to pack pistols. The service's head Brigadier Eugenie Pollak says the weapons are purely for self-defence. And although she knows of no occasion when one has been used against an attacker, she can quote statistics to show that the pistols are at least not proving a danger to the women soldiers themselves. They have fired 81,000 shots in practice, without a single accident.</p>

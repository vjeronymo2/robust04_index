			<p>BFN     [Text] There is still no progress at the peace talks in  Lusaka, Zambia, because the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] has not yet presented its stand  with regard to the document on the Conclusion of the Electoral  Process. Pedro Manuel reports:    [Manuel] Good evening! The UNITA negotiating team has not  yet presented its final stand to the mediators and observers.  This has further reduced the chances of progress at the peace  talks. According to a source, UNITA promised to present its  stand today but failed to do so, alleging that it has not yet  concluded the examination of the government document.    In turn, the government negotiating team has already  presented to the mediators its final stand on the Conclusion of  the Electoral Process.    This afternoon the parties did not work for all intents and  purposes. The mediators and observers reportedly used the  afternoon to meet alone in search of a solution that will force  both the government and UNITA to resolve the issue of the  country's governance. A source assured us that although they  are working on the Conclusion of the Electoral Process, the  mediators and observers are also carrying out work on another  two points still to be concluded: the UN Angola Verification  Mission mandate and national reconciliation.    According to the source, what is most important for the  mediators at the present moment is to resolve the problem of  national reconciliation. Mediator Alioune Blondin Beye only  decided to move forward in order to give time to the leaderships  of the negotiating teams to reexamine the issue of national  reconciliation.    The source also revealed that the date for the second round  of presidential elections will be set later. The date will be  chosen in a situation of complete peace. Now, what is important  for the mediators is to obtain from the negotiating teams  assurances that the second round of presidential elections will  take place.    Although there are four consecutive holidays because of  Easter, the mediators said the parties will work tomorrow, most  probably in a hotel, because the Mulungushi Conference Center  will only be reopened on 5 April.    According to another source, during this long weekend there  will only be work if UNITA presents its final stand on the  Conclusion of the Electoral Process.</p>

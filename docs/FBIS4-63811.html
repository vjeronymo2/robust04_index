			<p>BFN     [Text] Talks were held today in Moscow on the Black Sea  Fleet. It was expected that a final document would be signed by  the heads of the governments of Russia on the dividing up of the  fleet, however the issue of dividing up the infrastructure  remains unresolved. As reported by ITAR-TASS, it is a question  of coastal fortifications, artillery and depot premises, and  even of servicemen's flats in Sevastopol. Thus, Chernomyrdin  and Zvyahilskyy could not sign any kind of final document.    The Black Sea Fleet is independent and is capable of  rebuffing any provocation relating to it. Any unilateral  actions with regard to the fleet are unlawful. This was stated  today by Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. He stressed  that Russia is not indifferent to the situation in Crimea and,  if that area becomes entangled in a military conflict, it could  lead to civil war.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Yevgeniy Ostapov: "Yak's Will Invade the World </F> Market Through Asia: Hyundai-Yak Company Ltd. Joint Venture Has  Begun Operations"]    [Text] Negotiations were completed yesterday between  top officials of the Experimental Design Bureau Imeni A.S.  Yakovleva AO [joint-stock company] and representatives of the  South Korean corporation Hyundai. At the negotiations, which for  the first time were being conducted within the framework of the  Hyundai-Yak Aerospace Company Ltd. SP [joint venture], a deal  was made to sell to the Korean side three Yak-112 aircraft. For  all practical purposes this deal became the beginning of  operations of the first joint venture in Russia between a  Russian aviation design bureau and a foreign partner.    The Hyundai-Yak Aerospace Company Ltd. was created at  the end of last year (KOMMERSANT reported on the progress of  negotiations in its issue dated 24 November 1993). Hyundai owns  51 percent of the SP stock; however, most seats on the board of  directors belong to the Russian side. In the implementation of  joint projects, Yakovlev Design Bureau gains access to Hyundai  technologies and finances. The South Korean corporation Hyundai  (gross sales in 1993--$56 billion), which has representations in  more than 160 countries, will make its distribution and service  network available to the SP.    After Hyundai specialists complete work on interior  finishing  of aircraft cabins using automotive industry technologies, the  South Korean side will begin marketing Yakovlev products in the  West. The four-seat Yak-112 aircraft, produced in passenger,  training, medical, and multipurpose versions, and also equipped  with float chassis, completely meets international standards of  fitness to fly.    In addition, a decision was made that Hyundai-Yak Aerospace  Company Ltd. will in the near future introduce in the  Asia-Pacific market two new aircraft developed by Yakovlev  Bureau--a two-seat sports Yak-54 and a six-seat Yak-58. The  aircraft are equipped with Western-made engines, which reduces  their operational costs and makes them more attractive to  potential foreign buyers.    The SP intends to expand its sphere of activities, not  limiting itself to bilateral cooperation. According to Aleksandr  Dondukov, chairman of the board of Experimental Design Bureau  Imeni A.S. Yakovleva AO, there are very good prospects in  cooperation between Hyundai-Yak Aerospace Company Ltd. and the  Italian company Aermacchi in the area of so-called dual-use  technology, which may be used for both military and civilian  purposes. The Yak-130 training jet aircraft was selected as the  basis for joint work with Aermacchi. A rather important factor  is that this aircraft does not fall under the program of  reductions of conventional arms in Europe and therefore has  quite good market prospects.    KOMMERSANT experts note that Russian aviation technology's  entry into the world market through the "Asian door" at this  point probably represents the most realistic solution. Currently  Russian military aviation design bureaus either do not plan at  all or are at the stage of only considering the possibility of  setting up an SP. Somewhat of an exception is the cooperation  between the MiG Design Bureau and the French aviation engine  builder SNESMA regarding equipping MiG-AT training aircraft with  the Larzac power system. However, the partners have not yet  considered setting up an SP.</p>

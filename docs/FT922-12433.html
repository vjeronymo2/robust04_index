			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Day of reckoning for power shares PEOPLE who invested in the two privatised Scottish electricity companies, ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric, are facing the day of reckoning. The government is now asking for the 70p second instalment on the shares, which were issued last year at Pounds 1. With many another mass-marketed privatisation issue, this would not be a cause of grief. But the two Scottish companies have been miserable stock exchange performers. ScottishPower went to a premium of 119p when trading began in June, but fell back at once. Hydro-Electric touched 124p and then did likewise. Many intending stags held on, hoping things would improve. They did not. In the pre-election gloom, ScottishPower went down to 72p and Hydro-Electric to 73p. The main reason the shares never sustained a good premium is that the Scottish companies were the last to be privatised and, with its third shot at an electricity flotation, the government's advisers finally got the price right - from the taxpayer's point of view. Both companies were floated with high gearing - ScottishPower's was 51.4 per cent - and a low dividend yield of 5.1 per cent. 'They've not been the success story they might have been,' says John Torrie of Edinburgh stockbroker Torrie &amp; Co. which specialises in private client business. 'I feel particularly sorry for people who had borrowed to buy shares and had to sell before the election when the market was afraid not only of a Labour government but of Scotland becoming independent.' After the election the price went up to around 100p, and Hydro-Electric closed on Wednesday at 105p. The 70p cash call has to be paid by April 29. This week, there has been heavy trading in both companies as people who do not want to pay the call throw in the towel, probably barely making a profit, if that. People who do not pay the 70p (and there is another 70p to be paid in a year's time) are warned that the Secretary of State for Scotland could take back the shares and sell them. In this case, they are told, 'you will be refunded a maximum of Pounds 1 per share less any loss sustained by the Secretary of State.' UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and Smith New Court believe the shares are still undervalued - Smith New Court recommends buying at up to five per cent above the market yield (ie, 120p). The brokers argue that the Scottish companies face the least risk of adverse intervention from the Regulator because, unlike the regional electricity companies, they were given negative 'x' factors - meaning their tariff increases must be below inflation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a decision by the government's Office  for Displaced Persons and Refugees, on 1 April 1994 refugees  from Mostar lost their refugee status in the Republic of Croatia  and will have to leave hotels and holiday facilities in the  areas of Ploce and the Makarska riviera, the Ploce regional  Office for Displaced Persons and Refugees has announced.    The majority of the 2,000 refugees from the Mostar area have  been accommodated in hotels and other holiday facilities.  Because of the Easter vacation, many learned about this  decision too late to leave. Many whose homes have been destroyed  have expressed concern about the decision because they have no  home to return to.</p>

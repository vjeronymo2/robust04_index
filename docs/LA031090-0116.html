			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN VETOES MENTAL HEALTH BILL  </P> <P> Citing budgetary constraints, Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed legislation to  restore $15 million he cut out in funding for community mental health programs.  </P> <P> The governor said it was "inappropriate" to place additional demands on a  budget whose $1 billion reserve has been cut in half by expenses related to the  Northern California earthquake. Deukmejian noted that he allowed a bill to  restore $20 million for family-planning services to become law in late January  without his signature. At that time, he challenged the lawmakers to reduce  expenditures in next year's budget.  </P></p>

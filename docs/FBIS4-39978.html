			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Korolkov report: "MVD Organs Bring Criminal Case </F> Against Accused Who Testified in Court About Human Rights  Violation"]    [Excerpts] IZVESTIYA published the article "Torture Used  in Russian Detention Centers, Claim Defendants in Case before  Moscow City Court" 25 February this year. One of the people  quoted by IZVESTIYA was Aleksandr Morozov. A criminal case has  been brought against him.    In the four and a half years' investigation and judicial  examination Morozov has repeatedly tried to draw the attention  of detention center management, the Prosecutor's Office, and the  courts to the numerous violations of the law governing  investigations and to the inhuman conditions under which people  are detained at these centers. Protesting a violation of the  law in the conduct of the case, Morozov went on hunger strike --  as a result of which, he claims, his arms and legs started to  wither away. Investigator Kharchenko thought that the accused  was faking illness and sent him to the USSR Academy of Medical  Sciences' Neurology Scientific Research Institute. There,  Morozov claims, strong electric shocks were administered to him  against his will.    Investigator Kharchenko called on the Moscow Prosecutor's  Office to bring a criminal case against Morozov. Since Morozov,  the investigator believes, was to all intents and purposes  accusing him of using torture, he termed the accused's testimony  slanderous and "combined with accusations of the commission of a  state or other serious crime" under Article 130 Section III.  The statement was sent to the 108th militia precinct, which was  charged with carrying out the interrogation. [passage omitted]    Morozov has submitted around 600 complaints, statements, and  petitions. Neither the Prosecutor's Office nor the courts have  yet checked out the facts set out by the accused, even though he  has continually pressed for it. But, as soon as the MVD  [Ministry of Internal Affairs] investigator who was mentioned in  the accused's statement submitted his own statement, criminal  proceedings were immediately instituted. That is a more than  eloquent fact!    I would recall that, after the IZVESTIYA article, the State  Duma set up a parliamentary commission to look into the facts  set out in the newspaper about the violation of human rights at  Russian detention centers as a whole. The powerful departments  whose interests were attacked in the article are well aware of  the dangers of such checks. As we have already reported, a  highly placed MVD staffer phoned the commission chairman to  express resolute dissatisfaction with the creation of the  commission. We must assume that this is why efforts are being  made to discredit witnesses.</p>

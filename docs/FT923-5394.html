			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (11): Trumpet it loud - Cultural tradition is vital to attracting investors 'WHEN Saxony's cultural landscape was created, the region was one of the richest in Germany. Today, it is one of the poorest', says Mr Hans Joachim Meyer, the state's minister for science and culture. That, in a nutshell, is the nature of the problem faced by Saxony and the rest of east Germany as officials wonder how all the theatres, opera houses, orchestras, museums and other cultural assets are to be paid for at a time of increasing financial stringency in Bonn. Compared with the rest of east Germany, Saxony has by far the best chance of prosperity once economic reconstruction is completed. But when viewed against the west German states, it is, as Mr Meyer points out, poor indeed. Around 60 per cent of east Germany's cultural institutions (excluding former East Berlin) are in Saxony. They range from the grand and world-renowned, like Dresden's Semper Opera and Leipzig's Gewandhaus Orchestra, to humble and little-known local museums and theatres. Even the survival of the most famous music and theatre houses is not entirely without doubt. Bonn's politicians, alarmed by the cost of unity, are proving tough. Yet the continuation of Saxony's cultural traditions is vital to its economic and financial health. Visits to the opera, to the art and historical museums, and to Saxony's gracious palaces such as Moritzburg and Pillnitz are essential elements in the itinerary of visitors, whether from Germany or abroad. The range of cultural attractions encourages companies, with managers and their families, to move to the state. 'In Germany, a city with no culture attracts no investment,' is the blunt comment of Mr Peter Fittig, the councillor responsible for culture in Chemnitz, a city whose bleak post-war architecture is relieved by its elegant Opera House, whose restoration is nearly complete. While his may be an extreme view, it contains plenty of truth. Yet while it seems inconceivable that Saxony could lose any of its cultural heritage, the need to find more funds to help pay for the 250 museums, 19 big theatres and orchestras, and numerous other facilities is acute. In the unity treaty, the Bonn government agreed to pay DM900m towards the financing of east Germany's cultural assets. This was cut to DM780m this year and the 1993 figure has been slashed to DM350m. Saxony receives the lion's share of this money (which also goes to east Berlin), with 42 per cent. But the latest reduction is proving the last straw. 'This is totally unacceptable,' says Mr Meyer, who has written a sharp letter to the Bonn minister responsible. At DM900m, Bonn's contribution represented half the cultural financing needs of the eastern states; at DM350m, it will be only 10 per cent. The states and local authorities of east Germany are in no financial state to make up the difference themselves. Local authorities of all five states will have to raise their budget spending on theatres and orchestras from DM120m to DM317m at a time when they are heavily in deficit. Inevitably, cuts will be made. Mr Meyer, a professor of English, says these have started. A committee of experts from all over Germany is looking at solutions and prominent cultural figures such as Ludwig Guttler, trumpet virtuoso with the Dresden Philharmonic, are doing their best to lobby the Bonn politicians. The present situation is very unsettling, says Mr Wolfgang Schonfeldt, business head of the Semper Opera. 'We have to keep up the artistic rhythm - uncertainty is damaging.' The opera house's annual budget is around DM60m, only around DM10m of which it can meet itself; the rest comes from state and federal funds. 'Next year, we will need DM80m,' he says. Wages are going up and guest conductors and soloists will not always settle for low fees. Mr Schonfeldt needs to find another DM1.5m just to pay guest performers at this year's three remaining premieres: Richard Strauss's Arabella, Gluck's Orpheus and Eurydice and a mixed ballet evening. Next year, it hopes to mount an ambitious ballet of Herman Hesse's novel, Steppenwolf. In line with the Semper Opera's status, Mr Schonfeldt reckons it will soon require an annual DM100m a year, similar to the yearly budget of the comparable Munich opera. What about sponsorship? Corporate funds are being sought, but cultural sponsorship is less developed than in the US or Britain. Mr Meyer believes sponsors are needed, but as a supplement to state support, not a replacement. It seems inevitable that some of Saxony's theatres and orchestras will be amalgamated, with some disappearing. With modern transport, however, not every town needs its own stage and musicians. 'Sometimes,' jokes Mr Meyer, 'it is said that Saxony's orchestras are so close together that they can hear each other if they play loud enough.'</p>

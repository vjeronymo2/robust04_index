			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party suffered a setback in  special parliamentary elections in Punjab province but gained ground in two  others. About 3 million voters were electing national and provincial lawmakers  in what was seen as the first test of public opinion on the two-month-old  government of Bhutto. The results did not alter the balance of power in the  National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, where the Pakistan People's  Party won 124 seats in an election last November. In Punjab, where the rival  Islamic Democratic Alliance is already in power, Bhutto's party took only two  of nine seats. But overall it gained 11 of the 20 seats being contested.  </P></p>

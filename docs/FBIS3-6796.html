"The defensive weapon, Patriot missiles, will soon arrive in  Korea," President Kim said. "We have notified (the United  States) about the deployment of Patriot missiles across South  Korea."    "They will arrive within the shortest time possible, since  President Clinton has immediately issued an instruction calling  for an immediate order," Kim added.    President Kim disclosed the deployment plan during a  breakfast meeting with 11 ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP)  postholders including Chairman Kim Chong-pil and Vice Speaker of  the National Assembly Hwang Nak-chu.    "The Patriot missiles and Team Spirit (the joint U.S.-South  Korean military exercise) are both defensive in nature," said  Kim.    As for the timing of this year's Team Spirit war games, the  president said he will decide after returning from visits to  Japan and China next week.    South Korea and the United States have already agreed in  principle to resume the exercise, he noted.    "War on the Korean peninsula has to be prevented at any  cost," the president said. "But we can defend our country only  when we are strong."    The government is mapping out detailed measures to deal with  any provocation by North Korea, Kim said.    North Korea could not make any secret military movements,  Kim  said, hinting that a military surveillance system is already in  place and functioning.    Moreover, "the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has  referred the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security  Council," Kim said.    Members of the council are giving serious consideration to  the opinion of the country most directly concerned, South Korea,  he said.    Seoul plans to maintain a joint front with Washington and  close consultations will be held to confront any new  development, Kim said, adding that he will also have frank talks  with the leaders of Japan and China during his upcoming visits.    "Last Saturday, an unimaginable situation developed at the  inter- Korean contact," Kim said, referring to the violent and  aggressive remarks made by the chief North Korean delegate to  the Panmunjom meeting.    The president explained that he convened a meeting of  security- related ministers Monday to allay the people's fears  in the wake of the North Korean provocation.    "My visits (to Japan and China) are coming at a very  sensitive time," Kim said. "The main item of concern is the  North Korean issue."    The government is doing its utmost to handle the problem  domestically as well as internationally by remaining in close  contact with the United States and other concerned countries, he  said.    North Korea must adapt to the rest of the world, but the  problem is that its leaders believe change means the collapse of  their regime, Kim said.</p>

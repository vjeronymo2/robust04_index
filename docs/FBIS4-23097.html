			<p>SUMMARY                                 Accusing Washington of bad faith, Pyongyang has hardened its  stance on the nuclear issue and is heightening the crisis over  its refusal to stop removing spent fuel rods from its 5-megawatt  nuclear reactor.  With the possibility of UN sanctions looming  larger, Pyongyang may be wavering on the issue of convening a  multinational conference to deal with the North Korean nuclear  issue as proposed by Moscow.                           END SUMMARY     Pyongyang is moving to deter renewed demands for special  inspections of two suspected nuclear waste sites as a way of  shedding light on possible diversion of nuclear materials.  To  this end, a 7 June Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement  attempted to refute U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert  Gallucci's recent "allegation" that Pyongyang has destroyed the  possibility of the future measurement of the fuel rods in  defiance of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  (Pyongyang radio, 8 June).  Calling Assistant Secretary  Gallucci's comments an "alarming assertion," the statement  contended that the United States hopes to "invent a pretext" for  a special inspection of the two waste sites--sites that the  statement, as usual, depicted as "military."  It declared  provocatively that Washington should not "even dream" of having  "our military sites" inspected.     Purporting to demonstrate Washington's bad faith, the spokesman's  statement reported that there had been a series of "contacts"  between North Korea and the United States over the question of  the reactor refueling, during which, it said, a document  explaining the North Korean method of preserving the "technical  feasibility" of future measurement of fuel rods had been passed  to the United States.  The U.S. side, the statement claimed,  promised a response after "sincerely studying" the document, and  even allegedly stated that high-level bilateral talks could be  resumed, provided that the technical feasibility of future  measurement is preserved.  However, the statement went on to say  that without giving the promised response, Washington  "unilaterally declared" that the technical feasibility of  measurement had been lost--a declaration, according to the  statement, that was timed to coincide with an IAEA report to the  UN Security Council.     Indicating that Pyongyang has dropped any pretense that it might  take a more accommodating stance, the statement claimed that this  "surprise" move by the United States has destroyed "the last  chance for seeking a compromise."  Again threatening to pull out  of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), it pointedly drew a  parallel between the current crisis and the situation in March  1993, when North Korea announced that it was pulling out of the  NPT.  The statement added a militant tone to the threat, claiming  that while Pyongyang still supports resolution of the issue  through "dialogue and negotiation," the "entire people and the  entire army" will "counter" any attempt to force "special  inspections" or "sanctions" on North Korea.     Letter to IAEA     In a parallel move, Pak Yong-nam, head of  North Korea's General Department of Atomic Energy, has rebuffed  an IAEA call for special inspection of the two suspected waste  sites.  In a 6 June letter to the IAEA, Pak alleged that the  agency is claiming that, with the loss of the technical  feasibility of measuring fuel rods, it is "indispensable" that  "two ordinary military sites" be subjected to IAEA special  inspection to verify nondiversion of nuclear material (KCNA, 7  June).  This, Pak contended, shows that the IAEA "continues to  join the United States" in "hostile" attempts to open "ordinary"  military sites to outside inspection.  Pak went on to reiterate  Pyongyang's earlier, thinly-veiled threat to resume nuclear fuel  reprocessing activities if the IAEA refers the North Korean  nuclear issue to the UN Security Council.     War Talk     These amplifications of the DPRK's uncompromising  position have been accompanied by a heightening of Pyongyang's  war rhetoric.  Clearly seeking to unsettle Seoul, Pyongyang radio  on 6 June carried a belligerent statement by the Committee for  the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, a quasi-official  organ the North often uses to map out its position on inter-  Korean issues.  Warning against South Kdrean support for UN  sanctions, the statement declared, "Sanctions are war, period,  and there is no mercy in a war."  This phrase seemed to raise by  a notch the harshness of Pyongyang's now standard statement  equating sanctions to "a declaration of war," a formulation that  first surfaced in March 1993 as part of Pyongyang's original  declaration of its intention to withdraw from the NPT (Pyongyang  radio, 12 March 1993).     Russian Proposal     With the specter of UN sanctions looming  larger, tentative signs have been emerging that Pyongyang may be  reconsidering its opposition to a Russian proposal for an  international conference on the nuclear issue, possibly as a  fallback position to avoid sanctions.  In a 1 April Foreign  Ministry spokesman's statement (KCNA), Pyongyang had politely,  but firmly, rejected Moscow's proposal for an eight-party  conference (with both Koreas, the United States, Japan, China,  Russia, the United Nations, and the IAEA).  That statement had  reiterated Pyongyang's assertion that the North Korean nuclear  issue should be resolved bilaterally between Pyongyang and  Washington and suggested that Moscow could exert its influence on  Washington to be more forthcoming.  However, following North  Korean Vice Foreign Minister Yi In-kyu's recent visit to Moscow,  a Foreign Ministry spokesman noted, without comment, that during  the visit, the Russians, while "expressing understanding" of  Pyongyang's preference of DPRK-U.S. talks, had again proposed  "multi-party talks" on the nuclear issue (KCNA, 5, 30 May).  The  Russians were more upbeat in describing North Korean reaction to  their plan, claiming that Pyongyang had "expressed a positive  attitude" on the Russian proposal (Moscow Interfax, 19 May).  Indicating that Moscow still considers its proposal alive, the  Russians reportedly pushed their proposal again during ROK  President Kim Yong-sam's recent visit to Moscow (ITAR-Tass, 8  June.)     Implications     Pyongyang is clearly trying to place the blame  for the latest escalation of the crisis on Washington's alleged  decision to go public with its position on the fuel rod issue  before communicating the new position to North Korea through  private channels.  Pyongyang's apparent wavering on the Russian  proposal, despite its consistent preference for bilateral  negotiations with Washington, suggests that the North Korean  leadership may realize that a UN Security Council sanctions  resolution is a real possibility.

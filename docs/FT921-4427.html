			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: SFO to probe European Leisure's Midsummer bid THE SERIOUS Fraud Office confirmed yesterday that it was to investigate the affairs of European Leisure, the entertainments group. The investigation will centre on the circumstances surrounding the group's Pounds 73m takeover of Midsummer Leisure in early 1990. The takeover began as an agreed bid but became hostile after the Midsummer Leisure board decided not to recommend the offer to its share holders. Mr Michael Ward was chairman and chief executive of European Leisure at the time of the contested takeover. However he resigned in July last year after the company's share price collapsed amid criticism from two former directors. Mr Ian Rock, European Leisure's group managing director, said the company would co-operate fully with the SFO in its investigation. 'This has come out of the blue, but does not alter the fundamentals of the company,' he said. European Leisure has total borrowings of more than Pounds 72m. Last week the company announced it would not be paying a dividend on its preference shares. It is expected to announce later this month that operating profits for the six months to December 31 have been wiped out by interest payments on its debts. The investigation follows enquiries into the company by the Department of Trade and Industry which passed information on to the SFO last week.</p>

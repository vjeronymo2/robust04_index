			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ha Chun-u: "Frontline Military Units Assume </F> Emergency Posture"]    [Excerpt] The North Korean delegation said on 19 March  that "Seoul would be submerged in a sea of fire." These remarks  have made the South Korean frontline military units become alert  to North Korea's movements.    Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended  a  meeting of security-related ministries chaired by President Kim  Yong-sam on 21 March. In the meeting President Kim Yong-sam  ordered them to assume a full defensive posture against North  Korea. Although there is no sign of unusual military movements  by North Korea along the Military Demarcation Line, including  its large-scale military mobilization exercise, voices  denouncing South Korea through loudspeakers have been further  intensified.    According to the military operational plans of each Army  unit, our officers and soldiers have intensified their awareness  of North Korea, have continued to conduct battalion-level  military exercises, and have fully maintained a military  defensive posture. When President Kim Yong-sam begins his  foreign trips on 24 March, the South Korean Armed Forces will  assume the emergency defensive posture as was done in the past.  Therefore, the South Korean Armed Forces will be more acutely  strained than ever before.    This atmosphere is more clearly disclosed by the holding of  situational meetings by each Army division on the front line,  which were held for the first time since the North Korean  delegation made such provocative remarks.

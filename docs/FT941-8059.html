			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Azeris want UK help in Karabakh conflict: Aliev talks to John Lloyd on eve of his visit Azerbaijan's president, Mr Heydar Aliev, is to press Britain to take a 'more active part' in finding a solution to the former Soviet republic's conflict with Armenia around the Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno Karabakh. In an interview in Baku, Mr Aliev said: 'Britain has always taken a good, objective position on this conflict, and there has been some sympathy shown with our position from the United Nations, with four resolutions calling on the Armenians to withdraw their forces from our territory. 'Now I would like Britain. . . to more actively concern itself with getting those resolutions fulfilled.' The Azeri president, who recently visited Turkey and France, arrives in Britain today. He wants to use his three-day trip to 'make Britain and Europe more aware of our point of view, and the possibilities of doing business with us'. He and his advisers are convinced the west is strongly influenced on Nagorno Karabakh by Armenian communities in the west. He and Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, have exchanged letters on the desirability of signing a contract on Caspian Sea oil exploration. Mr Aliev is aware this gives him leverage to press Azerbaijan's case for withdrawal of Armenian troops and settlement of the Karabakh issue under international auspices. Mr Aliev said 20 per cent of Azeri territory outside Nagorno Karabakh was occupied by Armenian forces. 'We now have over 1m refugees, living in terrible conditions,' he said. Mr Vafa Gulizade, his adviser on international affairs, said on Sunday a ceasefire had been agreed between Armenian and Azeri defence ministers under the chairmanship of General Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister. Forces were to pull back to defined positions and a meeting at presidential level was to be held next month. However, Mr Aliev was cool on the agreement. 'Russia has announced a ceasefire several times and said it can get the withdrawal of Armenian troops,' he said. But during the ceasefires Armenian troops had taken several regions. Mr Aliev admitted Russian influence had increased since he became president in a bloodless coup last year. 'Russia is our neighbour,' he said. 'It's one of the most powerful countries n the world. It's been connected with the fate of Azerbaijan for 200 years. So what should we do - have a state of hostilities with it?' He said it was possible the Russian oil comopany Lukoil would join the consortium of western companies led by British Petroleum which is likely to sign a contract soon for exploitation of Caspian oil reserves. But 'further negotiations' were needed. Asked about the possibility of Russian bases being established in Azerbaijan, he said: 'The question hasn't come up before me. Maybe there is such a desire on the part of the Russians. And of course there are Russian bases in Armenia and in Georgia.' Mr Aliev, a former Communist party leader, now says: 'We must never go back to the days of communism and socialist economy. My most important task, besides ending the war, is to bring a civilised level of democracy and a market economy to Azerbaijan.'</p>

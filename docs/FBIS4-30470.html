Jose de Venecia, speaker of the  House of Representatives of the Republic of Philippines, who,  together with his wife and delegation, are currently on a  five-day official friendship visit to the LPDR. Attending the  talks on the Lao side were H.E. Chaleun Yiapaoheu, chief of the  Secretariat Commission of the National Assembly, and H.E. Viset  Savengseuksa, deputy chief of the Foreign Affairs Commission of  the National Assembly, along with a number of members of the  National Assembly. Attending on the Philippine side were H.E.

After the talks, H.E. Chaleun Yiapaoheu, chief of the  Secretariat Commission of the National Assembly, granted an  interview to a national radio correspondent on the atmosphere  and outcome of the talks between the delegation of the LPDR  National Assembly and the delegation of the House of  Representatives of the Republic of Philippines. He said: [Begin  Chaleun Yiapaoheu recording]    Beloved listeners, at 0855 today, high-level assembly  delegations of Laos and Philippines held official talks at the  National Assembly Hall in Vientiane. The talks proceeded in an  atmosphere of close friendship and mutual understanding. In the  talks, first and foremost, H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the  LPDR National Assembly, on behalf of the National Assembly and  the multiethnic Lao people, gave his wholehearted greetings to  the high-level delegation of the Philippine House of  Representatives on its official visit led by H.E. Jose de  Venecia, speaker of the House and concurrently chairman of the  ASEAN Parliamentary Federation, which has brought to the Lao  people the affection and friendship of the Philippine people.  He highly valued this visit and noted that it as a new  milestone in the friendly relations and cooperation between Laos  and the Philippines. He also highly assessed the success  achieved by the Philippine people in developing the country, and  hailed the significant contribution made by the Philippines to  the Lao people as well as to this region and the world.    On this occasion, Saman Vi-gnaket briefed the Philippine  delegation on our initial achievements in implementing the  state's restructuring policy. He particularly pointed out to  the Philippine delegation that, following the implementation of  the political and economic restructuring plans, tranquillity has  been maintained, the economy and society have been developed,  the people's living conditions have been improved with each  passing day, the multiethnic people have enjoyed solidarity and  harmony, and the country has maintained peace and stability in  all respects. Saman Vi-gnaket also informed the guests of the  National Assembly's domestic and foreign activities. He  recalled the significant roles and responsibilities of the first  and the second Supreme People's assemblies and then noted the  roles and responsibilities of the third National Assembly.  Regarding this, he informed the Philippine delegation of the  organizational activities of the third National Assembly, in  particular its contribution to establishing laws and the  constitution and its activities in following up and controlling  the implementation of the constitution and the laws.    For the Philippine side, H.E. Jose de Venecia expressed his  profound thanks to H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket and the Lao delegation  for inviting him to pay the official visit to the LPDR and for  the warm, friendly welcome accorded him and his delegation. He  informed our Lao side that this visit to Laos was taking place  following his visits to the PRC and Thailand. He said: This  visit is outstanding and very significant not only for the  assemblies of the two countries, but also for ASEAN as a whole.  This is because Laos, in the eyes of ASEAN and the Philippines,  has maintained a significant role in this region. He further  noted that democracy is now being practiced in the LPDR, and  that in this regard, the National Assembly has played a  significant role in promoting and encouraging the practice of  the democratic system. Understanding this fact, H.E. Jose de  Venecia has agreed to encourage the Philippine side to set up an  embassy in Vientiane at an early date. He said he will present  a report to the Philippine House of Representatives and urge the  House to endorse funds for the building of the Philippine  Embassy in Vientiane.    H.E. Jose de Venecia has also invited a delegation of the  LPDR National Assembly to attend the ASEAN parliamentary  meeting, which is scheduled to be held in Manila, capital of the  Philippines, from 16 to 24 September of this year. In addition  to the members of the ASEAN group, representatives from the  United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and India will also  attend the meeting. In addition, H.E. Jose de Venecia hailed  the Lao leaders for effectively promoting and expanding their  roles and responsibilities. As a result, the political status  of Laos has been raised to an ever higher level both at home and  abroad. Laos' economic foundation has been also increasingly  developed to the extent that it can enter the international  arena. He hailed the courage, talents, and quickness of the Lao  leaders in striving to improve the economy. As a result of the  effort, inflation has dropped from 60 percent in previous years  to 8 percent this year. This is considered as a success in the  economic field. It can be also considered as a significant  success for the political agenda, which has brought about the  maintenance of the roles and influences of the Lao leaders and  the implementation of the popular democratic system in Laos. He  also appraised Laos' success in enforcing the constitution and a  number of laws which have created the conditions for foreign  countries to invest in the LPDR.    H.E. Jose de Venecia also gave his views on increasing the  relations and cooperation between the LPDR and the Philippines  following this visit. On this, he believed particularly that  trade exchanges between the two countries should be promoted and  that investment should be made directly in the LPDR by the  private sector in the form of private businesses or  partnerships. In addition, he noted the promotion and expansion  of the bilateral trade relations, saying this work is seen as a  significant issue for Laos and the Philippines. He recalled  that in the history of Laos and the Philippines, the peoples of  the two countries have maintained good relations with each  other. The Philippines has in the past set up 12 hospitals in  Laos. It brought more than 1,000 (?technicians, nurses), and  physicians to work in aid projects in Laos. Now, the aid can be  increased. In addition, he promised to encourage the Philippine  Government, through the House, to grant technical assistance to  Laos. [words indistinct] He also pointed out that in the  Philippines, there is a project to build some three million  living quarters, and said timber is needed for use in building  the houses. For this reason, it is likely that Laos and the  Philippines will engage in trading timber to serve the said  construction work. In addition, he noted that, regarding the  promotion and expansion of the relations between the assemblies  of the two countries, an association of friendship between the  assemblies of Laos and the Philippines may be established, or  cooperation and exchange of experiences in the legislative and  legal affairs may be carried out.    In conclusion, H.E. Jose de Venecia has invited H.E. Saman  Vi- gnaket, chairman of the National Assembly of the LPDR, to  pay a visit to the Republic of Philippines at an appropriate  time. H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket highly apprised and expressed  satisfaction with the views of H.E. the speaker of the  Philippine House of Representatives, and was pleased to accept  the invitation for a visit. The Philippine side would later be  informed of appropriate time and dates of the visit through  diplomatic channels. H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket welcomed the creative  views of H.E. Jose de Venecia on issues concerning the promotion  and expansion of the Laos- Philippines relations and cooperation  in the next stage.    This is the successful outcome of the talks held between the  two sides in Vientiane this morning. Thank you. [end recording]</p>

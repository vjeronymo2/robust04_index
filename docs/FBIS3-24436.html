			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Aleksandrov, doctor of economic sciences: </F> "It Is No Good To Read a Burial Service for Democracy"]    [Text] The failure of democratically oriented forces  during the December elections clearly marked an event, whose  signs they could have detected earlier if they had not been so  busy fighting their implacable opposition and explaining their  relationships with each other. The increase in the citizens'  social anxieties and dissatisfaction with the state of affairs  in the country and the drop in their political activity were  occurring during all of last year. After the October events  ended the democrats' ideological and political offensive against  Soviet communist totalitarianism, Russian society, which was  released from the hypnotic influence of the conflict between the  branches, called into question the doctrine proposed by the  democratic reformers for building a new Russia.  <H5>  Where Are We Going? </H5>   It is not worthwhile hurrying to read a burial service over  Russian democracy. It is alive; however, it is, without a doubt,  living through difficult times. Judging by everything, a  political recoil began after the spurt forward. The speed of the  communist system's disintegration greatly determined its energy.  What will be its strength and where will it lead all of us? One  must understand whether one ought to attempt only to slow its  backward movement and make its consequences as painless as  possible or whether democracy will preserve sufficient  potential, requiring only adjustments in its adopted course.  What should these adjustments be? The answer to this question  will greatly depend on appraisals of Russian society's condition  and on the choice which the democrats themselves must make. Let  us begin with the first item.    When the Democratic Russia activists, who were painfully  shocked by the results of the December elections, assembled to  urge the people to unite in a popular antifascist front,  disappointment awaited them. It became clear almost immediately  that they would be alone. The liberals, communists and even part  of the democrats came out sharply against this proposal -- as a  confrontational one fraught with a new escalation in the  conflict. They said that such an action would provoke an upsurge  in fascism rather than stopping it. The liberal environment  again said that "communofascism" is a myth but it could become a  reality if the reformers do not change their course and the  "demorussians" do not stop calling people to the barricades.    Nevertheless, the decisive argument against an antifascist  front at the present time was not this but rather the feeling  that one would not succeed in arousing the people to active  political actions. The people were tired from the endless  conflicts and from politics, in general, and have lost their  trust in it. That is why the idea of a front was quickly  transformed -- first, into an antifascist movement and, later,  into the draft of a "New Civic Movement" that would have the  strategic purpose of building a civic society and insuring a  peaceful process for reforming Russia. Opposition to fascism was  only one of the movement's tasks.    Thus, the change in policy was caused by the recognized  necessity to rethink the condition of Russian society and,  correspondingly, its goals and tasks. This is really something  to think about.  <H5>  "The Democrats Have Messed Everything Up" </H5>   This popular curse was born in the pro-communist opposition  under the influence of the USSR's collapse and the price  liberalization. It has now acquired the meaning of an  ideological evaluation of democracy in Russia by the entire  implacable opposition. Much is concealed in this evaluation:  complaints about the sharp dramatic changes in the country,  irritation caused by the burdens of day-to-day existence, doubts  about the correctness of the course adopted by the reformers and  the value of democratic freedoms, and preservation of the strong  influence of the former soviet and party nomenklatura in the  central state apparatus and local bodies of power and economic  structures. A wave of united antidemocratic opposition is rising  on such sentiments. Great-power nationalism, the idea of a  self-contained state elevated above society and maintaining  authoritative order in it, and a policy of blocs and  confrontations in international politics are more and more  becoming its common foundation.    How far can the recoil go in this direction if an effective  counteraction is not found for it? It is understandable that the  best method would be successful implementation of the economic  reforms, into which Russian society has already been drawn  rather deeply and, as they say, the "active construction of a  civic society." Perhaps, however, the latter is not quite what  is needed and it is better to carry out the reforms under  conditions of "enlightened authoritarianism?" This viewpoint is  expressed just as frequently as the liberal romantic idea, which  is contrary to it, of absolute evil coming from the state  executive branch before which both the fascists and the  "communofascists" are indeed only one of those defending the  "sprouts of democracy" and not an alliance of extremist  pro-communist and ultranationalist forces. Who is right?  <H5>  The Fuss About the "Social Pie" </H5>   It is difficult, of course, for the democrats to convince  people not to identify them with a corrupt bureaucratic state  since they, failing to control it effectively, have taken upon  themselves moral responsibility for everything in the country.  However, it is important to state clearly what we are dealing  with today.    First, the state has not remained unchanged since 1991. As  the radicalism of market reforms weakened and the administrative  regulating role of the state was made more active, it settled  more and more on its apparat-bureaucratic base and the role of  branch lobbying in distributing the scarce -- as before but now  not only physical resources but also money resources, grew at  the same time. Accordingly, the danger of returning to the  system of "bureaucratic trading" for a disproportionately large  share of the diminishing "public pie" grew stronger. In the  final analysis, this was the undoing of the centralized Soviet  economy. The fact that the leadership and lobbyists of the  branch monopolies are implementing such an egging-on revenge not  only by penetrating into the leading cabinets but also by  actively supporting the proletarianized masses of workers,  including the strike movement, is now new. This "swing" in  society is fraught with two terrible threats -- the inflationary  collapse of the entire economy and a political explosion capable  of returning the country to "war communism" and reaction.    Second, despite a presence everywhere in society, the state  has nevertheless surrendered its positions to a great extent.  This is having extremely painful consequences since society  itself is weakly structured socially and politically. As a  result of numerous post-revolution shocks (wars, class struggle,  collectivization, massive migrations) to the Russian social  consciousness, the natural social ties -- family, kinsmen,  community, fellow countrymen, etc. -- which firmly bound him for  centuries, were destroyed to a great extent. At the same time,  modern social structures based on a compromise and mutually  beneficial agreement about non-converging class interests were  not strengthened.    During the Soviet epoch, a totalitarian state performed this  cementing role in Russia. Now, however, this system has greatly  eroded, leaving society in an atomized condition. As a result, a  phenomenon of duality arose in the relationship of the modern  Russian to the state: his striving to free himself from the  administrative limitations of labor activity and use, on the one  hand, and the simultaneous wish to preserve for himself a system  of all-round state social paternalism, on the other hand. This  duality and not just the resistance of the former "party, soviet  and economic aktiv" is playing a role in braking the political  reforms of B. Yeltsin and the market reforms in the spirit of  Ye. Gaydar. Nevertheless, the reforms must move forward -- but  how?  <H5>  Who Is Right? </H5>   Many points of view exist regarding the course of economic  reforms: the government's, Ye. Gaydar's, Shatalin-Abalkin's,  Yavlinskiy's, etc. Although the president in his message to the  Federal Assembly confirmed the course of the reforms in its  basic principles and Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin made a  completely moderate and balanced statement about ways to adjust  it, arguments have become even sharper. What is the trouble?    This problem has many aspects. In any event, however, the  main thing that should interest everyone is how to make a  correct choice and understand what specifically divides the  participants in the controversy. Here, something is beginning to  be cleared up.    Ye. Gaydar, having given the economy money in the form of  genuine economic resources instead of the previous account  assets, was not able, according to the unanimous opinion of his  opponents, to demonstrate how he could combine structural  reorganization with an acceptable level of unemployment and the  preservation of high-tech production. He himself, however,  continues to think that his economic experiment would have  brought total success if it had not been interrupted half-way.  It seems that the large amount of negative experience that he  acquired in the government is the source feeding his  persistence. Gaydar understood, in practice, that the main  problem of the reforms was how to force the branch monopolies to  move to structural changes and where to get money and time to  make this process as painless as possible in the economy (a  decline and structural disproportions) and in the social area  (unemployment).    Of course, the figures of the branch lobbyists, by whose  efforts and the efforts of part of the government's bureaucracy  it would be possible to throw the economy suddenly back into the  chaos of the administrative market economy of the past -- but  now with even greater pernicious consequences -- constantly  stood before his thoughtful gaze. That is why he regards -- not  without skepticism -- V. Chernomyrdin's adjustment ideas since  they have not been stated completely clearly (yes, and wisely;  this should have been done immediately) since mutually  contradictory tasks of supporting existing production,  struggling against inflation and carrying out market  institutional reforms are linked together in his program  although the general idea of adjusting economic policy is  completely understandable.    This deficiency in the government's plan is seemingly  overcome in the Shatalin-Abalkin program, which proposed a  definite mechanism for producing a correlation of prices and  wages in the national economy in a rational system and also for  executive support of key branches by the state. Trust in the  program, however, is undermined by the stubborn unwillingness of  its authors to recognize the positive meaning of Ye. Gaydar's  replacement of administrative levers for managing the economy  with market ones. That is why the danger exists that the  measures proposed by them can, in the final analysis, be a  mirror anti-market image of a radical monetarist approach.  Instead of the slogan: "Suppress inflation at any cost," the  slogan: "Support a certain level of social appropriations,  prices and wages at any cost," will be put forward -- with the  threat of rolling back to an economy of shortages.    The reform version proposed by G. Yavlinskiy with its stress  on implementing a harmonious schema for state regulation of the  process of subsequently transforming the former Soviet economy  into a normal market one is seemingly deprived of this defect.  At first glance, it looks effective as a competitor not for the  "Gaydaronomics" of the past two years but for possible other  "post-Gaydaronomic" approaches, using its positive results and  not only its corrected failures. The main problem, however, with  this program (as with all G. Yavlinskiy's previous works at the  macro level) is, in his own words, that it requires preliminary  changes in political conditions -- at a time when the main  problem is the establishment of a program for actually existing  social and political conditions.  <H5>  A New National Idea </H5>   It is clear that the way to transform the former Soviet  totalitarian society into a civic one runs through the failures  of its atomization and archaicization. That is why it is no  accident that the president's message especially stressed the  need to strengthen the state's role in forming civic society's  institutions. The political conditions are not quite favorable  for this despite the strong drop in the popularity of the  democrats and democracy and the collection of opponents.    From this viewpoint, it is worthwhile to look at the case of  the DemoRussians' recent advancement of the concept of a "New  Civic Movement," which is designed to unite public, political,  social, and other non-political movements of a civic persuasion.  An increase in understanding the mutual connection between the  struggle for the democratization of the state apparatus, the  uniting of all pro-reform forces, the establishment of  mechanisms for the citizens' effective influencing of the  authorities and protection of their everyday interests by them,  and, finally, the suppression of reactionary political trends  are important new phenomena in the democratic movement.</p>

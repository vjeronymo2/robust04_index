			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Letter: Case against a referendum Sir, I have returned from holidaying in France, shortly after the referendum. During my stay, I obtained a copy of the Traite sur l'Union Europeenne which was issued to all electors and, being bilingual, I started to read the 62 pages of fine print, which might have made some sense to members of the legal profession, but few others. I soon gave up. I spoke to a number of people in widely differing walks of life, none of whom had read the document, or knew anyone who had. Few really had a considered opinion of the issue, and frequently were just expressing disapproval of one or other of their party leaders (Mitterrand, Le Pen and Marchais being mentioned most). I hope Mr Major will continue to resist any pressure for a referendum in Britain. We have had a general election this year; let us now leave the decisions and negotiations to the representatives we have elected, and hope that they justify our trust. I am sure of one thing, the man or woman in the street is not competent to understand the intricacies and details of the treaty. Claude Rodrigue, Flat 1, 18 Hyde Park Gate, London SW7 5DH</p>

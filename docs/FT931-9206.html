			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Bonn attacked on arms exports THE German government was under attack from left and right yesterday for apparent double standards in its strict arms export controls, after it approved the sale of missile parts for Taiwan and tank engines for the United Arab Emirates. The decision to allow the export of electronic parts for US-manufactured Patriot and Ram anti-aircraft and anti-missile missiles to Taiwan was confirmed by the German government just two weeks after it refused to sell 10 German-built submarines to the Taipei government, for fear of alienating China. At the same time it emerged that the Federal Security Council, the secretive body to which all arms export decisions must be submitted, had approved the sale of diesel engines from the German Leopard tank, to be installed in French vehicles sold to the UAE - although a sale of complete Leopard tanks would not have been approved. The German government is also under attack for agreeing earlier this month to supply Indonesia with 39 former East German naval ships in spite of protests from Portugal because of human rights violations in their former colony of East Timor. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former economics minister, called on the government either to allow the export of the submarines to Taiwan, or to cancel its approval of the missile technology. He said that if it was clear that fear of Chinese anger over the exports was not important, then the export of submarines - securing thousands of German jobs in the hard-hit shipbuilding industry - should be given high priority. Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, defended the decision to export Patriot and Ram missile technology on the grounds that it was a joint project with the US. 'If we do not deliver our part of the project, then nobody will work with us any more,' he said. A second reason for approving the project was that the missiles - one land-based and the other sea-based - were both defensive. He was not able to comment on the sale of MTU engines for the French Leclerc battle tanks being sold to the UAE, although he was unaware of any change in policy on arms sales to the Middle East. Bonn has up to now banned German tank sales in the region and, in the 1980s, halted efforts to sell a German-British tank there. As for the sales to Indonesia, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has promised to raise the question of human rights violations in East Timor - at least in private discussions - on his forthcoming visit to Jakarta.</p>

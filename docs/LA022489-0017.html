			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 3 TEAMS BAY TRYING FOR SEMIFINAL SPOTS IN CIF AND CITY BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Three South Bay basketball teams will attempt to reach the last round of the  playoffs tonight in semifinal games in the Southern Section and L.A. City  Section tournaments.  </P> <P> Carson (16-7) faces top-seeded Manual Arts (23-0), ranked fifth in the nation  by USA Today, in the L.A. City 4-A semifinals at 7:30 at the Sports Arena. The  other semifinal, matching Crenshaw (19-2) and Fairfax (13-11), follows at 9:15.  </P> <P> Carson advanced in the City with a 66-61 win over Dorsey on Wednesday. Guard  Ray Bennett led the Colts with 23 points and center Vince Washington added 18.  Manual Arts advanced with an 80-69 victory over Washington.  </P> <P> In Southern Section semifinals, fourth-seeded Morningside (23-4) meets  surprising Corona del Mar (18-9) in a 3-A game at Inglewood High, while El  Segundo (15-10) faces Whittier Christian (20-6) in a 2-AA game at Sonora High  in La Habra. Both start at 7:30.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar spoiled an all-South Bay matchup by upsetting top-seeded Rolling  Hills, 69-63, Wednesday. The Sea Kings, third-place finishers in the Sea View  League, favor physical, low-scoring games.  </P> <P> "If they want to play physical, that's fine, but they'll have to play with us,"  said Morningside Co-Coach Ron Randle, whose team advanced with a 75-72 win over  Brea-Olinda. "We can mix it up with anybody."  </P> <P> Forwards Eddie Scott and Chris Vance and guard Kenny Jones head a balanced  attack for the Monarchs, who have won 19 consecutive games.  </P> <P> El Segundo, led by senior forward Shawn Foster, goes against fourth-seeded  Whittier Christian after bumping off top-seeded Cabrillo, 73-70, last week.  </P></p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Project to tackle poor literacy A CAMPAIGN against poor literacy among school-leavers was launched yesterday. It came after complaints about school-leavers from the Dixons and John Lewis Partnership retail chains. John Lewis complained in a letter to the Industry in Education group which was copied to Mr John Patten, the education secretary, that some school-leavers were 'poorly prepared and not creating a good impression'. Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, endorsed the contents of the letter, but said his store did not discriminate against 16-year-olds in recruitment. 'But a lot of them do not have the skills for applying for a job, and have not been shown by their careers officers how to fill out a CV,' he added. He said an analysis of staff productivity had encouraged the company to concentrate more on recruiting older people with more of the skills and experience needed in dealing with the public. The aim of the National Literacy Association campaign, which has cross-party and union support, is to adopt the target that by 1999 99 per cent of children should leave school with adequate literacy for living and working. The campaign will concentrate on six points: Adopting the 99 per cent figure as a fixed national target. Providing volunteers in playgroups, libraries and nurseries to help parents who cannot read to their children. Increasing promotion of the use of children's libraries and wider distribution of books to homes and schools. Aiding parents who are illiterate with a national programme of meeting parents outside schools. Introducing a national programme for teachers of initial and in-service training in reading, writing and literacy. Expanding reading recovery programmes, in which young children with difficulties are identified in the classroom and given intensive tutoring.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Pep price war gets hotter - Unit trust companies are competing ever more keenly Label a product 'tax-free' and it is bound to catch the attention of investors. Personal equity plans, which allow investors to save up to Pounds 9,000 a year - Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep - free of income and capital gains tax, have proved especially popular for this reason. The unit trust industry has been riding high on that popularity. Last year, more than 60 per cent of those who invested in a unit trust did so through a Pep. So, it is not surprising that unit trust companies are competing keenly for investors' Pep money, either by reducing charges or by structuring new plans which, they hope, will catch the imagination of the public. Murray Johnstone started the Pep price war in February 1992 when it reduced the initial charge on all its unit trusts to 1 per cent instead of the industry norm of 5-6 per cent, and to 1.5 per cent on its unit trust Peps. Since last October, the initial charge for Peps has dropped to 1 per cent. This week, Murray Johnstone said it would be waiving the 1 per cent charge on its five fully-qualifying unit trust Peps until the end of the tax year on April 5. Since the company does not impose exit charges, investors will have to pay only the 1.5 per cent annual management fee, although they will still be subject to the bid/offer spread - the difference in price between buying and selling the unit trust. The beneficial effects of low charges have their greatest impact when the fund also delivers good performance, and Murray Johnstone still leaves something to be desired in this regard. In the 10, five and three years to January 1, the four Murray funds (the Acumen does not yet have a five-year record) have appeared most often in the third quartile (25 per cent). The table shows those unit trust Peps which have low charges as company policy rather than because of a limited special offer. Scottish Equitable is the only one to impose a flat fee of Pounds 45 plus VAT, instead of an initial charge. The fee is being waived until April 29. Its annual management charge, however, is higher than those imposed by the others listed. In the long run, a high annual charge can be more detrimental to an investor's returns, while a good fund manager can compensate for the initial charge through performance over a number of years. But the company points out that it gives investors a 1 per cent loyalty bonus on the value held in their Pep on its eighth anniversary. With the exception of Murray Johnstone, the companies listed all impose withdrawal fees. A Pep investor into M&amp;G's Managed Income fund - the only one of M&amp;G's unit trusts where the initial charge has been eliminated - would pay 4 per cent on the value of his investment if he sold it in the second year. Gartmore is the only one of those listed to levy an exit charge on the initial investment so that any growth is left unscathed by the fee. Withdrawal charges, common in the US, were introduced on a UK Pep by Fidelity in June 1992. This week, Fidelity launched two new Peps and has packaged them to appeal to specific groups. It is hoping to attract first-time investors into Moneybuilder, the company's existing fund of funds unit trust, by making it Pepable. There seems no particular reason why this fund should be more suitable for the first-time investor than, say, one of Fidelity's UK growth unit trusts. But Mary Blair, director of product development, says the main reason is that, as a fund of funds trust, Moneybuilder is invested in a basket of the company's funds, giving exposure to global as well as UK and European markets. The fund is third of 13 listed in the five years to the beginning of January, with growth of 83 per cent (according to Micropal). As a special offer, the 2 per cent initial charge on the Pep will be halved until March 11. At the other end of the market, Fidelity is hoping to attract those planning to retire within 10-15 years with a new unit trust and Pep. The UK Dividend Growth fund is due to be launched in just over a fortnight and Blair says: 'It will invest in UK companies with the ability to grow dividends in the future or in companies which might have cut the dividend for prudent reasons, but which we believe will have good scope for dividend growth.' About 60 per cent will be invested in FT-SE 100 stocks and Fidelity is looking for dividend growth of between 8-10 per cent a year. Thus, this is not a fund for income-seekers as the initial yield will only be 2 per cent and the aim is to re-invest the income. The idea is that a large lump sum will be produced which can be taken tax-free (within the Pep) when the investor does retire. Initial charge on Retirement Income Builder (the name of the Pep attached to the fund) is 2 per cent and, in line with all Fidelity Peps, the exit charges also apply. Minimum investment in both new Peps is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 50 regular monthly savings.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNIT TRUST PEPS WITH REDUCED CHARGES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company          No of  Initial charge   Annual fee       Exit charge                  Funds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fidelity            12       2%          Between              3% 1 yr                                          1-1.5%               2% 2 yr                                                               1% 3 yr Gartmore             5       2%          1.5%                 3% 1 yr*                                                               2% 2 yr*                                                               1% 3 yr* Guinness             6       2%          1.5% and 1.25%       3% 1 yr  Flight                                                       2% 2 yr                                                               1% 3 yr M&amp;G                  1       0           1.5%               4.5% 1 yr                                                             4.0% 2 yr                                                             3.0% 3 yr                                                             2.0% 4 yr                                                             1.0% 5 yr Murray               5       0**         1.5%                 0  Johnstone Scottish             7       0***        1.875%             4.0% 1 yr  Equitable                                                  4.0% 2 yr                                                             3.5% 3 yr                                                             2.5% 4 yr                                                             1.5% 5 yr  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *based on initial investment and not on value of units on encashment. **initial charge of 1 per cent is waived until April 5 1994, ***Initial flat fee of Pounds 45 waived until April 29 1994.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

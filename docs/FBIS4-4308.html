			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Japan Not Qualified To Be UNSC Permanent Member'--KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- The Democratic  Socialist Party, one of the seven ruling parties of Japan,  Monday in its political platform for 1994 declared it would push  for permanent membership in the UN Security Council (UNSC) as  well as give its wholehearted support to UN operations,  including peacekeeping activities, the KYODO News Service  reported.    The Japanese authorities have revealed their intention to  become a permanent member of the UN Security Council more than  once.    It is an unbiased view of the international community that  Japan has no justification and elementary qualification to seat  itself at a responsible post of the United Nations.    It is ridiculous of Japan, a criminal state which provoked  World War II, to seek UNSC permanent membership while having yet  to atone for the unpardonable crimes and cleanse its dishonor as  "enemy state" specified in the UN Charter.    Moreover, it is a reckless act for Japan to seek permanent  membership while being criticised by unbiased public opinion for  its grave threat to peace and security in Asia and its  obstructions to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula  through the promotion of its nuclear armament on the pretext of  the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK.    In trying to gain a permanent seat in the UNSC, Japan  pursues  the purpose of increasing its political say in the international  arena, act a "leading state" and establish a "world order"  militarily favorable for it.    The Japanese reactionaries must discard the foolish  daydream,  liquidate its past first of all and immediately renounce their  scheme to convert Japan into a military power and arm it with  nuclear weapons.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> FED, BANKS IN 9 OTHER COUNTRIES INTERVENE TO CHECK DOLLAR'S RISE  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve and central banks of nine other nations launched heavy,  concerted intervention today to check the rise of the resurgent dollar.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve and West German Bundesbank moved aggressively to check the  dollar's new year rally after the currency closed Wednesday at 3 1/2-month  highs against the West German mark and Japanese yen.  </P> <P> The Fed intervened three times in an unusually firm response, dealers said, and  the Bundesbank raised its two key interest rates to lure investors from the  U.S. currency.  </P> <P> The dollar dipped to 1.8670 marks from Wednesday's 1.8725 marks after the  sell-off but continued to climb against the Japanese yen. The U.S. currency  rose to 129.70 yen from 128.70 yen.  </P> <P> The Bundesbank said it would raise its discount rate to 4% Friday and increase  its key Lombard rate, which sets a ceiling on bank-to-bank lending, to 6%.  </P> <P> The moves were followed by matching rate hikes by France, Switzerland, the  Netherlands and Austria, the second round of European rate increases in a  month. The central banks of Britain, Canada, Italy and Belgium also sold  dollars.  </P> <P> Dealers said the dollar ignored the rate hikes but fell after the central  banks' action, the third such coordinated round in two weeks.  </P> <P> The dollar responded only to such a concerted attack, dealers said, as high  U.S. interest rates ()continue to underpin the currency. In addition, traders  hope that President-elect Bush will soon tackle the massive U.S. budget  deficit.  </P> <P> "There still seems to be euphoria that in tomorrow's (inaugural) speech, Bush  may say something about a big cut in the budget deficit," said Dan Holland of  Discount Corp.  </P> <P> On the gold market, February gold contracts rose 80 cents, trading at $404.00  an ounce on the New York Commodity Exchange.  </P></p>

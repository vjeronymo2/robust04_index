			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANKER, MAYOR MET BEFORE CITY DEPOSIT  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley met in his City Hall office with Far East National Bank  Chairman Henry Hwang early last year while the mayor was serving as a paid  adviser to the bank and Hwang was actively soliciting deposits from the city,  newly obtained records show.  </P> <P> The March 16, 1988, meeting came five days before the bank received a  $1-million city deposit. The mayor has repeatedly insisted that he did not  know, during the 12-month period he earned $18,000 as a foreign trade adviser  to Far East National Bank, that the bank did business with the city.  </P> <P> No details are known about the meeting, which was revealed in copies of  Bradley's appointments calendar obtained by The Times on Friday. Hwang's office  said he was unavailable for comment. Assistant City Atty. Charles Goldenberg,  who is heading the city attorney's office investigation into Bradley's  financial ties, declined comment late Friday. And a spokesman for the mayor  said Bradley, too, would have no comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Returns $18,000  </P> <P> Saying he had just learned of the city's relationship with Far East, Bradley in  March of this year returned the $18,000, which he had earned as the only paid  member of a bank advisory board from January through December, 1988.  </P> <P> Records obtained earlier this month indicated that Bradley's office, at least,  had been aware of a relationship between the city and Far East. They show that  Bradley's office had received a request in January, 1988, from Hwang for city  deposits, and that one of the mayor's aides then asked City Treasurer Leonard  Rittenberg to prepare a response to Hwang's request.  </P> <P> Bradley faces several investigations into various aspects of his finances,  including the city attorney's probe for a possible conflict of interest  concerning his employment by the bank.  </P> <P> "The mayor has made it clear that any questions regarding the exact contents of  the inquiry will be deferred until after it is completed," William Chandler,  spokesman for the mayor, said Friday. "Then he will answer any and all  questions."  </P> <P> The 1988 calendar shows that the mayor scheduled a half-hour meeting with Hwang  beginning at 8:30 a.m. on March 16. The following Monday, March 21, the bank  received a $1-million, one-year deposit from the city treasurer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Doing Business Since 1979  </P> <P> City records show that Far East has been doing business with the city almost  constantly since 1979.  </P> <P> When a $1-million deposit matured on March 22 of this year, the city removed  the funds. The following day, Hwang called Bradley to ask if the city had  changed its policy of depositing funds in small and minority-owned banks,  according to Bradley.  </P> <P> The mayor then called City Treasurer Rittenberg to inquire about the policy. It  was during this discussion, Bradley has said in earlier interviews, that he  first learned that the city had deposits in Far East.  </P> <P> The following day, Rittenberg personally directed a $1-million deposit to Far  East and, several days later, an additional $1 million.  </P> <P> Rittenberg has maintained that neither Bradley nor the mayor's staff influenced  his decision to deposit funds with the bank.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Rich Connell contributed to this article.  </P></p>

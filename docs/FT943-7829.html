			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Long View: So where's the binge? For those who devote serious bathtime to pondering the means by which Kenneth Clarke will live up to the great inflationary tradition of Maudling, Barber and Lawson, recent economic data make for an exceptionally slow start to the day. The housing market, a familiar source of trouble, remains unusually groggy. Monetary aggregates are peculiarly well behaved. The consumer's idea of living dangerously is to splash out on a pair of shoes and spend more on very competitively-priced food in the supermarket. The big question about British economic policy is not where's the beef, but where's the binge. While the chancellor and Eddie George, his opposite number in Threadneedle Street, are agreed that interest rates will have to rise sooner or later, the economic news conspires to deprive the Governor of the chance to demonstrate his macho monetary credentials. This is no doubt frustrating for an unelected central banker who has unexpectedly been granted a greater say in monetary policy by an elected politician. Yet for the rest of us the message should be to lie back and enjoy an increasingly well-balanced, non-inflationary recovery. But that, of course, is an unwelcome message, however seasonal, for the masochistic British. So for the benefit of domestic readers, and with apologies to the international brigade who lost their appetite for gilts so long ago as February, this column will live up to its title and look beyond the present benign conjuncture. Where is the next inflationary threat going to come from? The first point on which to be clear is that there certainly will be another bout of inflation. In the absence of a gold standard or any other anchor for monetary policy, the question is simply how and when. But without a much bigger commodity price shock than the world has seen this year, or a huge monetary disturbance of the kind that followed the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system in the early 1970s, the threat is local, not global. It hinges on the competence of individual governments. Here, then, is the first clue. The Treasury is now forecasting growth in demand at a comfortably reassuring level of three per cent. Never forget that in 1988, when GDP growth soared to unsustainable heights, the Treasury had been forecasting a slow-down which provided the basis for a give-away budget. What that tells us is that Treasury forecasters have as much difficulty as the rest of us in grasping how the economy works. And one of the perennial questions about the entrails of the economy is just how much spare capacity exists to cope with a surge in demand beyond Treasury expectations. No one really knows the answer. So one plausible inflationary scenario might start with the gap between actual and potential output turning out to be narrower than the Treasury economists think. On the elimination of the gap, inflationary bottlenecks would loom because of a shortage of domestic supply. The problem would then be compounded if the chancellor's tax-cutting instincts were encouraged by over-optimistic assumptions about the shrinkage of the structural component of the budget deficit - the deficit that remains when the economy returns to its sustainable trend level of output. It is at this point that the markets' version of Murphy's law could reliably be expected to intervene. What worries those involved in international capital is default risk: the fear that governments will lose control of their budget deficits and resort to inflationary financing via the banking system while the currency is allowed to collapse. That is partly why the lira was under pressure last week and why the Italian authorities raised interest rates in spite of minimal inflationary pressure in the domestic economy. It also explains why Swedish bond prices have been so weak and why, in part, Sweden raised rates too. The public finances of both countries are in a mess. Markets are understandably worried about the politicians' will to confront their problems. Britain is not in a comparably messy fiscal position. Clarke surprised everyone with his readiness last November to grasp fiscal nettles both this year and next. Yet, with medium-dated gilts yielding more than nine per cent and sterling drifting against the D-Mark, there is clearly a problem of credibility. That was the message in the markets' entirely perverse response to good news on inflation this week. They punished the currency for no better reason than that a test of the chancellor's readiness to raise interest rates was deferred a little longer. Weaker sterling today may not matter because - even on the most pessimistic assumptions - the output gap is some way from closing. In the absence of constraints on supply the impact of higher import prices on the domestic price level is thus unlikely to be great. If anything the effect would be helpful since it would encourage a bias towards export-led rather than consumption-led growth. But later, in the midst of a pre-electoral boomlet, devaluation would be another matter. When markets are in punitive mood, their prophecies tend to be self-fulfilling. Just as today's penal real interest rates in Sweden and Italy will drive these countries into default unless they can find a way of providing fiscal reassurance to investors, a sterling plunge could become self-feeding as the inflationary consequences worsened with each downward lurch. Back, in fact, to Lord Barber and the dog days of 1974. It need not happen; nor should it. The bond markets are over-reacting to Clarke, who shows every sign of being an underrated chancellor, with the potential to break moulds as well as to grasp nettles. On the record so far, his pre-electoral tax cuts will be within the bounds - well, just - of market acceptability. The risk Clarke runs is political, not economic. His reward for good economic behaviour may well be to deliver a supremely healthy economy to Labour's Tony Blair.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / GM to settle suit over pick-up trucks GENERAL MOTORS has agreed to settle dozens of lawsuits by giving the owners of some 4.7m pick-up trucks with side-mounted petrol tanks Dollars 1,000 in coupons towards the purchase of a new GM vehicle, agencies report from Detroit. In two separate agreements, filed in a state court in Texas and in a federal court in Philadelphia, GM said it settled all the outstanding class action lawsuits filed by owners of its 1973-1987 pick-ups. The owners were seeking to be reimbursed for resale value they said they lost because the trucks are allegedly vulnerable to fiery explosions in side-on collisions. In April the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked GM to recall the pick-ups, based on a finding that the trucks were 2.4 times more likely to catch fire in fatal side-on collisions than similar trucks built by Ford. But GM claims the pick-ups are safe and reiterated yesterday that it did not intend to recall the trucks. 'It does not affect the NHTSA case in any way, shape or form,' a GM spokesman said. 'This is not a recall. There is absolutely no modification of the vehicle. This separates the customer satisfaction concerns from the technical concerns.' The Dollars 1,000 certificates are transferable within an immediate family and cannot be sold without the truck.</p>

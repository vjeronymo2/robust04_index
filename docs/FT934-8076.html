			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: European Motor hits Pounds 2.6m EUROPEAN Motor Holdings, the fast-growing motor retail group, yesterday reported sharply higher interim profits partly reflecting earlier acquisitions. For the six months to September 30 they improved from Pounds 861,000 to Pounds 2.64m pre-tax. Earnings per share grew to 4.9p (1.4p) and the interim dividend is lifted from 1.5p to 1.725p. The acquisition of Wilcomatic, a leading UK supplier of automated vehicle washing machines in May last year, and the Mill Garages motor dealership group which was acquired in July 1992, helped boost turnover to Pounds 81.5m (Pounds 50.3m). Mr Richard Palmer, chief executive, said the group had continued to consolidate the acquisitions made last year. 'We expected substantial progress from the businesses and I am pleased that our objectives have been achieved,' he said. The group ended September with net borrowings of Pounds 5.73m, little changed from the Pounds 5.56m in net borrowings at the end of March, representing gearing of 32 per cent.</p>

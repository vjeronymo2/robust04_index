			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunaiskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- The deadlines and schedule  for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia are in the  focus of the regular 18th round of Russo-Estonian talks, which  today began at a Foreign Ministry rest-house in Chkalovskaya,  near Moscow, ITAR- TASS was told by a counsellor of the Estonian  Embassy here. The talks will last two days.    In expert opinion, this regular round of talks will not be  easy, because the sides have still not ironed out their  differences on the problem of social guarantees to military  pensioners (about 11,000), now residing in Estonia, and to  members of their families. This problem has always been a  stumbling block in Russo-Estonian negotiations.    The previous round of talks, which ended in Tallinn on March  2, has not yielded any positive results. The agreement on the  withdrawal of Russian troops remained unsigned. The sides  expressed dissatisfaction with the progress of negotiations.  According to Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin, leader of the Russian  delegation, the Estonian side is ready to approve the draft  agreement on the complete withdrawal of troops, but would do it  only after it gets an exact schedule of the pullout. "The  Russian side has such a document," Svirin said, "but it will be  handed over to the Estonian side only after it promises to grant  all the needed social guarantees to the military pensioners and  members of their families, now residing in Estonia." However,  the Estonian delegation still objects against the linking of the  pullout problem with the question of military pensioners. It  moved to discuss the letter separately, but also on condition  that it should first get the pullout schedule.    It is common knowledge that Russia, without any agreement or  schedule, has already withdrawn from Estonia 90 per cent of all  its troops and now pledges to repatriate 2,500 remaining  officers and men by August 31, 1994.    Commenting on the results of the 17th round of talks, Svirin  said that the Russian delegation was disturbed by Estonia's  deviation from the earlier achieved agreements to renounce  mutual claims: Russia is to turn over to Estonia 4,900 military  establishments on the territory of the republic, while the  latter is not claim any compensation for the caused ecological  damage. Moreover, in accordance with an earlier reached  agreement, Estonia was to allocate 23 million U.S. dollars for  building housing facilities for the Russian troops withdrawn  from the republic. The ambassador said that if Estonia  backpedaled on these agreements, Russia would be compelled to  withdraw the remaining troops according to its own, unilaterally  fixed schedule.    Speaking on the local television a short while ago, Estonian  Foreign Minister Juri Luik said that "Estonia does not want to  make any compromises on social guarantees to Russian military  pensioners now living in the republic". However, he stressed  that he hoped the agreement on the withdrawal of troops, which  Estonia was ready to accept a month ago, would be finally  initialled.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Christiania loss soars to NKr9.17bn CHRISTIANIA Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, yesterday announced huge losses for 1991 and confirmed that it needed NKr2.5bn (Dollars 385m) in fresh core capital to meet capital adequacy requirements. Christiania's accounts for 1991 show net losses of NKr9.17bn, against NKr1.85bn previously. This follows an increase in loan losses to NKr5.99bn from NKr2.68bn. It warned of further net losses this year. Operating losses last year swelled to NKr7.96bn from NKr1.79bn. There was a charge of NKr2.266bn for losses and write-downs on sales of fixed assets, against NKr307m in 1990. Christiania suffered a NKr359m loss on securities trading versus a NKr65m gain in 1990. The bank saw net interest income fall by NKr592m to NKr2.65bn. Non-interest income declined by NKr437m to NKr1.12bn. The bank reduced it staffing levels by 1,000 to 4,511 during the year and operating costs were trimmed by NKr134m to NKr3.48bn. A provision of NKr1.173bn was made to the bank's loan loss reserve fund, increasing it to NKr2.8bn at the end of 1991. 'Although substantial loan loss provisions were made in 1991 for non-performing loans and especially loss exposed loans there is perceived to be, based on experience, considerable risk in other parts of the loan portfolio,' Christiania said. Non-performing loans increased to NKr13.8bn by the end of last year, or 15.8 per cent of total loans, from NKr9.9bn at the end of 1990. At end-1991 Christiania met the domestic capital adequacy requirement of 4 per cent of risk-weighted balance sheet items after receiving NKr7.86bn in state cash. Mr Borger Lenth, Christiania's president, forecast that the bank could achieve a profit, before credit losses, in 1992 but Mr Per Ditlev-Simonsen, chairman, said that Christiania would post a net loss for 1992. Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, the finance minister, said that fresh cash transfers to the state-backed Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) would be discussed by the government in April in connection with the 1992 revised budget. The fund, which acts as a safety net to support the banks and which received a state injection of NKR11bn last year, has been drained to around NKr550m by heavy claims.</p>

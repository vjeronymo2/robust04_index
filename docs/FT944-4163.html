			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Caught in the blast of Big Bang's second barrel - The rivals react Some of Warburg's London-based rivals were putting on a brave face yesterday. But most admitted privately that a merger would pose a powerful new competitive threat to them and could precipitate a fundamental restructuring of investment banking in London. Eight years after London's Big Bang, some of the changes predicted then may be about to happen. 'The second barrel of Big Bang is being pulled. There are many more deals to come,' said one senior merchant banker. Mr Peter Meinertzhagen, chairman of stockbrokers Hoare Govett, said: 'Although it does not change the landscape completely, it points to a period of more consolidation in London.' Analysts said the merger proposal might prompt other banks which have looked at Warburg in the past to improve on Stanley's terms or, more likely, to look elsewhere in London. 'The merger throws down a gauntlet to other international investment banking groups. The likes of HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner are keen to expand in London but there are not many properties to go round,' said one analyst. Deutsche recently announced plans to centralise all its investment banking operation in London and most observers argue that the Warburg merger will if anything strengthen London's position as a financial centre. In competitive terms, the deal would appear to threaten other London banks which have pursued the same integrated strategy as Warburg, offering a full range of trading services, as well as fee-based advice to their clients. 'Firms like Kleinwort Benson will now look even smaller in global terms. The merged company will be a more formidable competitor for the international issue work, where Kleinwort has been so successful,' said one analyst. The head of another investment bank said Warburg's move will force his own board to examine more closely its strategy, which has employed a more cautious approach to overseas expansion and to the development of an international distribution network. Such integrated investment banks were introduced into London with Big Bang. The City still remains dominated by the old structure of independent merchant banks and brokers. But many of the market practices which support the existing structure - notably the traditional rights issue, and pre-emption rights - are coming under attack. 'The old idea that merchant banks can merely give advice, without providing equity distribution as well, has had its day,' said the head of one independent stockbroker. 'Warburg's strategy has been absolutely right. The problem is that it is just not big enough to compete with the Americans internationally.' Yet many of the independent merchant banks, such as Schroders and Lazard Brothers, have continued to thrive and believe change, if it comes, will be slow. Many are sceptical about the reasons for the proposed merger and claim that, if it goes ahead, it will present opportunities for them. One leading merchant banker said: 'This is an elegant way for both companies to address their excessive overheads. There will be blood on the carpet in London and New York, enabling their rivals to pick up good staff cheaply.' Others state confidently that Warburg will lose clients. 'Some of Warburg's more conservative UK clients may think twice about staying with a US-dominated firm,' said a rival investment banker. But most observers believe the merger will accelerate London's move towards the US system of integrated investment banks. 'Ten years from now, distribution will be much more important than it is now,' said the chairman of one merchant bank which has eschewed building a worldwide distribution network. 'What we do remains to be seen.'</p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Consumer credit up 8% in month Consumer and business credit leapt ahead in November in spite of the uncertainty generated by the Budget, figures from two credit monitoring organisations indicate today. Yet the rise may not feed straight through to rising consumer spending because credit is increasingly being used as a substitute for cash, warns one of them, the Finance and Leasing Association. Total consumer credit in November increased by 35 per cent to Pounds 1.17bn compared with the corresponding month a year previously, says the association, the industry's main trade body. The jump is the highest since the recession began and an increase of 8 per cent on October. Total business credit rose by 25 per cent on November 1992 to Pounds 911m. In the three months to November, consumer credit rose by 30 per cent and business credit by 28 per cent compared with the same period a year earlier. Mr Tony Mallin, association chairman, said: 'Our November figures suggest that consumer confidence has returned and we expect to see this trend continue in December.' Within the total consumer figure, the sharpest rise was seen in the motor sector, reflecting a rise in car sales from the depressed levels of 1992. Credit to consumers buying new cars through dealers in November rose 66 per cent to Pounds 233m, compared with the same month in 1992. For used cars the rise was 29 per cent. Both figures were slight-ly lower than for October. Business finance for cars gained 69 per cent to Pounds 458m in November compared with the corresponding month in 1992, although this was a 14 per cent decline on the month before. In consumer goods, the figures suggest a sharp rise in buying of expensive items such as refrigerators and televisions. Store instalment credit rose 80 per cent to Pounds 106m, a much sharper rise than for store cards used for both cheap and expensive goods where the gain was 15 per cent to Pounds 320m. The rising value of the individual items bought is also reflected in figures from Infolink, the credit information organisation which measures the number of credit inquiries rather than the total amount borrowed. Credit inquiries at finance houses, which typically offer larger loans on expensive items, were up 9.1 per cent. Infolink said its growth figures were lower than the FLA's because the inquiries it measures do not coincide with actual credit given and that the amounts being lent were much bigger per inquiry than in 1992. Valuables are being pawned in an effort to pay off Christmas and new-year debts, it was claimed yesterday. Pawnbrokers have loaned 20 per cent more money than at this time last year, said the National Pawnbrokers' Association, which represents more than 200 of the estimated 350 pawnbrokers in Britain. 'Over the Christmas period and subsequently there has been a mini-boom,' the association said.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> PRESBYTERIANS UPDATE CREDO  </P> <P> The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) today approved a statement of faith that mixes  traditional Christian beliefs with environmental concerns and images of God as  both mother and father.  </P> <P> Commissioners stood and cheered after approving the statement -- the church's  first since a 1983 merger of its northern and southern branches following a  122-year split over slavery -- in a 499-25 vote.  </P> <P> The statement upholds centuries-old church teachings that Jesus Christ was both  fully human and fully God, and that God raised Jesus from the dead to offer  eternal life.  </P> <P> Reflecting more recent church developments, the statement also declares that  God calls women and men to all ministries of the church, "and makes everyone  equally in God's image, male and female, of every race and people, to live as  one community."  </P> <P> The statement also says that human beings have exploited nature, "and  threatened death to the planet entrusted to our care."  </P></p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UN body calls for cut in population growth WORLD population growth rates will have to be reduced over the next decade if economic development is to be sustained and the environment protected, according to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Human numbers are growing at record rates, with an annual increase of about 97m projected for the next 10 years, says the organisation's State of the World Population 1992 report. That would mean 6bn people in 1998, and 10bn in 2050, compared with 5.48bn this summer. Without 'immediate and determined action' to reduce future family sizes, world population could reach 12.5bn in 2050, it warns. UNFPA found that, since 1975, population growth rates have been linked to per capita income in developing countries - before then, no such connection had been established. Countries with slower population growth rates saw annual incomes rise by an average 1.23 per cent a year in the 1980s compared with a fall of 1.25 per cent in countries where population grew faster. Lower birth rates also meant higher savings and investment ratios. Eliminating extreme poverty, improving health and education, and raising the status of women are seen as essential steps to encouraging reduced family sizes. Such policies should give special attention to Africa and south Asia, which are responsible for more than half the population increases and which contain most of the world's very poor, says UNFPA. The issue of sustainable development is also tackled in the report, which says record population growth rates are being accompanied by record human consumption of resources.

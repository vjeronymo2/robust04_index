			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Matsushita moves to keep control of MCA Matsushita, the Japanese electronics group, yesterday affirmed its determination to retain control of MCA, its Los Angeles-based entertainment business, in spite of demands from MCA's senior management to take control of the company. Mr Yoichi Morishita, chairman of Matsushita, held five hours of talks in San Francisco on Tuesday with Mr Lew Wasserman, veteran MCA chairman, and Mr Sidney Sheinberg, president. The US duo, the longest established management team in Hollywood, tabled a request for managerial control. Mr Morishita rejected the request by telling them: 'As long as Matsushita holds 100 per cent of the shares we can not cede control.' The San Francisco showdown followed months of strained relations between MCA and its Japanese parent company. Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg have criticised Matsushita for allegedly blocking their plans to expand MCA's entertainment interests at the same aggressive pace as rivals such as Time Warner and Viacom. Tuesday's meeting followed a few days after the news that Mr David Geffen, the billionaire music mogul who founded MCA's Geffen Record subsidiary, and Mr Steven Spielberg, the director of its latest box office hits, Jurassic Park and Schindler's List, were joining forces with Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, former head of Walt Disney's film studios, to form an entertainment company. The potential loss of Mr Geffen and Mr Spielberg has intensified the pressure on MCA and Matsushita to resolve the US company's future. However, some US entertainment industry analysts speculated that Mr Wasserman, 81, and Mr Sheinberg, 59, may have over-played their hand by giving Matsushita the chance to replace them with a younger management team.</p>

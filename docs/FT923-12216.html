			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Construction Contracts: Sports complex in Czechoslovakia Previous experience in Czech oslovakia has paid dividends for JOHNSONS with four joint venture projects involving design and construction for its multi-disciplinary practice. The latest project is a Pounds 25m sports and leisure development with a hotel and retail mall. Visits to Czechoslovakia in 1990 quickly resulted in a joint venture partnership between Johnsons and Hexaplan - a newly privatised firm of architects and engineers. At the start of this year the partnership was appointed as consultants and project managers for the Czech-led project - the Boby Centrum in Brno. The 30,000 sq metre development is the brainchild of former hockey international, Dr Lubomir Hrstka. It consists of a hotel, medical fitness centre, covered tennis courts, discotheque and shopping mall. Dr Hrstka is involved in sports and fitness facilities throughout the country under the name of Boby Sports. The Centrum is adjacent to the Brno Sports Stadia, another of his ventures. Dr Hrstka provided the drive which inspired the City of Brno, the planners and banks to respond to a fast-track programme which is unusual in this country where bureaucracy can still be stifling.</p>

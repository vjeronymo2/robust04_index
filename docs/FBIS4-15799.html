			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address "To the Peoples, Political Parties, Parliaments, </F> Governments, and Heads of States of the Former USSR" from the  Political Council of the Social-Democratic Party of Georgia;  place and date not given: "CIS -- A Eurasian Community?"]    [Text] As has become known to SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA, the  Political Council of the Social-Democratic Party of Georgia has  adopted an address to the states of the former USSR in which it  proves the necessity of transforming the CIS into a "more solid"  association -- the Eurasian Community. As can be seen, Georgia  wants also here to be in the vanguard of political  processes. We present the text of the document to our  readers.    The former USSR represented a communist empire in which the  rights of all peoples, including the Russians, were restricted.  The peoples of the former Soviet Union should have been  liberated not by means of the collapse of the former USSR but by  its evolutionary transformation into a democratic community of  independent states.    Unfortunately, this did not take place. This time as well,  the struggle for power overshadowed general state interests.  Politicians and the bodies of state power bear personal  responsibility for the consequences of the spontaneous  disintegration of the former USSR.    As regards the CIS, it does not properly reflect the level  of  actual integration of the states of the former USSR. Therefore,  the CIS must gradually transform itself into a more solid  association -- the Eurasian Community (EC). The mechanism for  its formation could include the achievement of the following  agreements by the subjects of the former USSR:    1. The CIS member states will change the name of the CIS to  the Eurasian Community (EC) by adopting the corresponding  declaration.    2. In order to coordinate external, economic, and defense  policy, the EC member states will conclude treaties on a  diplomatic, economic, and defense union.    3. The treaty on a diplomatic union will strengthen the  mechanism of coordinating international policy, while preserving  the rights of all the EC member states to participate  independently in international organizations, conclude  international treaties, and establish diplomatic and other  relations with foreign states.    4. The treaty on an economic union will strengthen the  formation of a common market, the diversity and equality of all  forms of ownership, and the implementation of an economic policy  also in the financial, transport, power engineering, and  information spheres. A common currency for all EC member states  will be introduced and a banking union will be created.    5. The defense union will be built according to the  principles of defense sufficiency. Strategic forces and border  troops organized on a professional basis will form the EC's  common armed forces.    6. Taking into account the multiethnic nature of the EC  states, a council for interethnic relations will be formed.    7. The Eurasian Parliament (similar to the European  Parliament) and the Council of the Heads of EC States will form  the supreme governing bodies of the EC.    8. The Eurasian Parliament will approve the EC  president-coordinator, [who will be appointed] in turn from the  members of the Council of the Heads of States for a one-year  term, and also appoint the presidents of the EC Diplomatic  Union, Defense Union, and Union for Interethnic Relations  according to the principle of equal representation from each EC  member state.    A court of arbitration and a consultative socioeconomic and  ecological council and a fund for the elimination of the  consequences of natural disasters and catastrophes will be  created in the community.    These bodies will form boards according to the principle of  equal representation from each EC member state and will have an  apparatus formed on a professional basis.    9. The EC's governing structures will be financed on a  coordinated basis.    10. The Eurasian Community will be open to new members.    The transformation of the CIS into the Eurasian Community  will help all the states of the former USSR to unite, states  which, in the course of their mutual interconnection over many  centuries, have elaborated a common system of valuable  orientations.    We express the hope that the peoples, political parties,  parliaments, and governments and heads of states of the former  USSR will view our address with understanding and will undertake  effective steps to elaborate rules for living together in the  Eurasian Community that will be acceptable to each state.    The Political Council of the Social-Democratic Party of  Georgia</p>

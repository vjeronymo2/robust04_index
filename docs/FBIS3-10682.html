The  purpose of the meeting was to analyze the new types of  preparation for command and control elements under conditions of  the special period. Furthermore, they analyzed the action to be  taken by anti-aircraft defense regiments to repel air strikes  while under a military blockade, and to resist systematic  demoralization [desgaste sistematico] efforts. The [words  indistinct] localization and pursuit of enemy targets, and the  preparation of the reserves and Territorial Troops Militia were  other issues discussed in this important meeting. Lieutenant  Colonel Enrique Garces Montesino highlights the reasons this  unit was selected as the site for the meeting.    [Begin Garces recording] During 1991, 1992, and 1993, this  regiment achieved the distinction of being the best  anti-aircraft defense regiment because of the results obtained  in combat training and political preparation, which was  demonstrated during an inspection carried out by the Ministry of  the Revolutionary Armed Forces in the western territory in 1993.  It was rated good, and superior. It was also selected because of  its achievements in the food program, conservation and  protection of equipment and armaments, and in improvement of its  personnel's living conditions.

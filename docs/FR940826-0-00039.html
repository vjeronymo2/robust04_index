The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Whenever possible, advances will be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal awarding agency to the recipient. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

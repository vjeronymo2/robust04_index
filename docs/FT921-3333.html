			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Travel: Florence: film set or city? ON MY last visit to Florence, writes David Pilling, the magnificence of the Piazza della Signora was partly obscured by scaffolding which smothered the stone buildings on two sides of the square and prevented closer inspection of the statues. That was 12 years ago, and the scaffolding has now gone. Or rather, it has moved - to the other side of the square. Like the Forth bridge, work on the piazza may never be completed. In this and all other respects, Florence had hardly changed since I was last there. Its art galleries are still crammed with paintings, its gelaterias with teenagers and its grandmothers with pasta. At night, looking across the river Arno at the illuminated brown and yellow buildings with their red-tiled towers and domes, Florence still looks more like a film set than a city. Every building - and almost everybody - is decked out to perfection. Florentine women have maintained their fur-wearing obsession, recession and animal rights seeming to have by-passed this part of Italy. I had not seen so many fur coats on display since Doctor Zhivago. I travelled to Tuscany for the weekend with Bladon Lines - a tour operator more usually associated with ski holidays - to sample two hotels offered in its Italian summer brochure. We spent our first night at Relais La Suvera, a 16th-century former papal residence about 20 miles from Siena. One would normally expect to pay an entrance fee simply to look around such a building; to stay there was almost too much, a bit like bedding down in the Brighton Pavilion. My suite, near the top of a rectangular stone tower, had 30-ft-high wooden-beamed ceilings, a chandelier in the bathroom and a four-poster bed of astounding proportions. I half expected the antique furniture to be roped off, and was reluctant to sit on the sofa or straight-backed wooden chair in case an attendant leapt out to admonish me. From my shuttered window there were views of the undulating Tuscan scenery and the vineyards from which La Suvera produces very drinkable organic wine. The hotel was the most lovely I have ever stayed in. Bladon Lines offers seven nights' B &amp; B at La Suvera (flight and car hire included) from Pounds 638. Supplements of up to Pounds 65 a day are payable for the top-end suites. In Florence, the four-star hotel Lungarno is rather unremarkable by comparison, except for its location within serenading distance of the Pontevecchio. The view of the famous bridge from my room would have had EM Forster drooling. Seven nights' fly-drive staying at the Lungarno starts at Pounds 585. Details of Bladon Lines' Italian and other brochures are available from 56/58 Putney High Street, London SW15 1SF. (Tel: 081-785-3131).</p>

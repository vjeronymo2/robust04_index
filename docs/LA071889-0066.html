			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: THE NORTH-POINDEXTER-REAGAN SCENARIO  </P> <P> The reason Ollie North did not get any time in the big house is because the  judge said that he believed Ollie was really a dupe of higher-ups in the U.S.  government. In rounding up the usual suspects, the only superiors that anyone  in Washington can come up with are John Poindexter and President Reagan.  </P> <P> Ollie was not only a dupe, he was also a pawn in the Iran-Contra affair, a U.S.  Marine who didn't know right from wrong or good Iranians from bad ones.  </P> <P> That Ollie was flimflammed by people in the White House goes without saying.  The how is something else again. This is the way I believe it happened.  </P> <P> Sometime back when Congress voted against the United States supporting the  Contras, President Reagan called Ollie into the Oval Office. Poindexter was  also there, sending up large clouds of smoke so it was difficult to see the  President behind his desk.  </P> <P> The President, reading from 3-by-5 cards, said: "Ollie, I consider you a hero."  </P> <P> "Why is that?" Ollie asked.  </P> <P> "Because by the time we finish duping you, your feet will be held to the fire,  but you will not cry uncle."  </P> <P> Ollie said, "I'll do anything you say because you are my commander-in-chief.  Besides, I like this job because you can order around anybody in the country,  and you get to work late with a small but good-looking staff of people who  think the way we do."  </P> <P> The President was pleased with the answer. "All we want you to do is trade guns  for hostages and collect money that will be deposited in Switzerland, where it  will then be placed in a paper bag and delivered to Contras in Florida, who  will see that it gets to Honduras, where it will be taken to Nicaragua. Does  that sound like much of a problem?"  </P> <P> "No, sir. We used to do that at the Naval Academy every morning."  </P> <P> Poindexter puffed even harder on his pipe. "Ollie, all we are asking is that  you be the fall guy."  </P> <P> "Sounds good to me. What do I get out of it?" Ollie asked.  </P> <P> Poindexter looked at a sheaf of papers. "A $150,000 fine, 1,200 hours of  community service and two years probation."  </P> <P> "What about a pardon?"  </P> <P> Reagan said, "I can't do that or it will look as if I knew what you were  doing."  </P> <P> Poindexter added, "As far as the judge will be concerned you are an overzealous  underling who exceeded your authority in your patriotic mission to rid Central  America of Communists. Because you are a sacrificial lamb to those of us in the  Administration, you will always be entitled to a standing ovation by those who  believe you should never have been involved in our dirty little scheme in the  first place."  </P> <P> Ollie said, "You've done so much for me. Is there anything I can do for you?"  </P> <P> Poindexter answered, "I may be tried for being your superior and giving you the  orders to do the things you will do. I would appreciate it if you denied I had  anything to do with it."  </P> <P> Ollie said, "But if I do that, that means the one responsible will be President  Reagan."  </P> <P> "Doesn't bother me," the President said, laughing. "Nothing in this job ever  has."  </P></p>

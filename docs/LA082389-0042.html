			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: DINGO CASE MOTHER: SHE'S BROKE  </P> <P> Lindy Chamberlain, the woman Meryl Streep portrayed in the 1988 movie "A Cry In  The Dark," says she is still owed millions of dollars in compensation nearly a  year after she was pardoned in the death of her infant daughter. Chamberlain,  who says her 6-week-old baby was snatched by a dingo, or wild dog, during a  1980 camping trip, told journalists in Sydney, Australia, that the Northern  Territory government, which prosecuted her and later pardoned her, has not paid  the compensation she was promised for the 3 1/2 years she spent in jail. News  leaks have put the amount of compensation at about $3 million. Chamberlain, 41,  said she has not received much money from eight best-sellers about the case or  from the film. Her husband, Michael, 45, a former Seventh-Day Adventist Church  pastor, said he has eked out a living by chopping and selling firewood. "People  think a couple so famous should be rich," she said.  </P> <P>  -- Cedar Rapids, Iowa, police had a weighty problem when they arrested  7-foot-4, 540-pound professional wrestler Andrae Rene Roussimoff, known as  Andre the Giant, after an altercation with a TV cameraman. "Thank God he was  cooperative in the arrest!" said Jim Barnes, the assistant police chief. "A guy  that big, he could cause some damage." Officers did encounter some difficulty,  however. "At first we didn't know if he could get in the back of the squad  car," police Capt. David Johnson said. "We have trouble getting big guys in our  patrol cars, and he's quite a bit bigger than our normal big guy. We had to fit  him into the car sideways." Roussimoff, 43, was charged with assault and  criminal mischief and released on $1,200 bond. Barnes said Roussimoff became  upset when Ben Hildebrandt, a cameraman for Cedar Rapids station KCRG, who was  filming during a match between Roussimoff and the Ultimate Warrior, who won.  Roussimoff told Hildebrandt that it was illegal to film the match, Barnes said.  He said the two men exchanged words and then Roussimoff put a headlock on the  cameraman. -- A $38.8-million hospital in Orlando, Fla., for critically ill  newborns and women with high-risk pregnancies is preparing to open, thanks  partly to golfer Arnold Palmer. He led the fund-raising for the 255-bed Arnold  Palmer Hospital for Children &amp; Women, billed as one of four of its kind in  the nation. About $4.5 million can be attributed directly to his association  with the project, foundation director George Maynard said. SHIRLEY MARLOW  </P></p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Pelican considering bid for Forte cafe chain Pelican Group, the acquisitive restaurant operator, was yesterday said to be considering a bid for Dome, the cafe chain owned by Forte, the hotels and restaurants group. The London-based company is thought to be arranging finance for an agreed bid, which could involve a rights issue to raise more than Pounds 10m. Such a move would signal the next stage of the expansion strategy pursued by Mr Roger Myers, Pelican chairman. Unveiling a threefold increase in profits earlier this year, he said: 'We are now in a position to continue our strategy of creating multiple restaurant chains. We have many concepts available for expansion throughout the UK.' The acquisition of Dome - comprising 10 restaurant bars in London, one in Cambridge and one in Oxford - would lead to a 36 per cent expansion of Pelican, which already operates 28 outlets. Industry analysts said Forte had already been involved in inconclusive talks over the future of Dome and were ready to sell it. Although the group refused to comment yesterday, it is understood to be considering a disposal in order to focus on its core hotels and roadside catering businesses.</p>

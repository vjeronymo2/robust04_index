			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Losses at Creston grow to Pounds 481,000 Group pre-tax losses grew at Creston from Pounds 53,000 to a 'most disappointing' Pounds 481,000 in the six months to December 31. Again there is no dividend and the board feels it is unlikely one will be paid for the full year. The group said that 'strenuous efforts to contain costs and reduce overheads and interest charges' failed to produce the hoped-for results. Profits of the parent company fell to Pounds 32,000 (Pounds 62,000), but the subsidiary companies - the principal of which is Aluminium and Timber Securities - tumbled to losses of Pounds 263,000 (profits Pounds 35,000). Further restructuring and retrenchment was now in action at ATS. Group turnover declined to Pounds 5.16m (Pounds 7.47m) and losses per share emerged at 2.39p (0.26p).</p>

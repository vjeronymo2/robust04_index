"Opening further to the outside world may help us raise the  quality of our economy as a whole, and is the key to speeding up  our modernization process," Zhao Zhihao, governor of the  province, said.    "Shandong will further improve its investment conditions and  strive to hook up with the international economy," he states.    The governor acknowledged that although Shandong has made  rapid progress in the development of its export-oriented economy  over the past few years it still lags behind some other coastal  provinces.    The province exported 5.9 billion U.S. dollars worth of  goods  last year, only one fourth of that for Guangdong, an  economically-booming province bordering on Hong Kong, and about  the same as Jiangsu and Fujian Provinces.    "The latter might surpass us this year if we remain at the  same pace of economic development," the governor said.    The provincial government pledged to accelerate the  development of markets, raise economic efficiency, adjust the  industrial structure, and improve transport and  telecommunications facilities.    According to Song Fatang, deputy governor of the province,  Shandong will carry out a package of reforms involving the shift  of mechanism in large and medium-sized enterprises, banking,  circulation, share-holding system and macro-control of the  economy.    It will encourage more enterprises to follow the  international patterns in production and sell their products on  the international market, while helping them to import advanced  managerial expertise, technology and equipment, invite talented  people to work in the province and absorb foreign capital.    In addition, Shandong plans to employ the joint-stock system  in its construction of capital projects to attract foreign  investment.    It will soak up more overseas capital for its capital  projects by way of issuing bonds and stocks or borrowing.    While concentrating on the development of agriculture and  industry, Shandong will pay attention to the service trades.    It will streamline its export product mix, with the focus on  the export of finished industrial products -- machinery and  electrical appliances in the main.    Meanwhile, the province is exerting more efforts for the  development of such key industries as motor vehicles, iron and  steel, machinery, electronics and chemicals, and trying to form  enterprise groups, corporations and trans-national companies.    Song called on transportation departments to construct more  local railways, highways and ports to pave the way for rapid  economic development.    He encouraged the departments to use more foreign investment  in the construction of infrastructure facilities by issuing  stocks and taking out loans.</p>

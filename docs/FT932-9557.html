			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Observer: Safe bet When it comes to companies in distress, 57-year-old Gerald Greenwald is getting a name as the right man to call. However, he seems to have learned that it is best to stick to what he knows. Greenwald first made his mark helping to spearhead the revival of Chrysler in the early 1980s. Then he tried his hand heading Olympia &amp; York's debt-restructuring effort. But he is given higher marks for his performance at Chrysler than his 10-month stint as president of O&amp;Y, the property developer which emerged from bankruptcy protection earlier this year. He has been mentioned as a possible replacement for Tony Ryan, chairman of the troubled GPA aircraft leasing group. But his latest chairmanship  - at the suffering Czech truck-maker Tatra - looks a safer bet. As his fellow GPA director Sir John Harvey-Jones knows to his cost, trouble-shooters have to be particularly choosy about the companies they sign up with if they're not to risk shooting themselves in the foot.</p>

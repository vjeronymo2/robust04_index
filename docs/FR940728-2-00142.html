Accuride has also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice of receipt of a petition is published under 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120 (formerly Section 157 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417)) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgement concerning the merits of the petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FMVSS No. 120, Paragraph S5.2(b) requires that each wheel be marked with the rim size designation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 11, 1994, Accuride produced an estimated 103 Accu-Forge 22.5 &times; 9.00 inch, 15 degree drop center, one-piece tubeless dual wheels with incorrect size designations for the rim width. The wheels were incorrectly stamped ``22.5 &times; 8.25.'' The wheels should have been stamped ``22.5 &times; 9.00.'' All other stampings and markings required by FMVSS No. 120 are correctly identified on each of the subject wheels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accuride supports its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Accuride has fully analyzed the issues surrounding the incorrect width designation on these wheels and has sought the input of the others with particular expertise on this subject. Based upon all of this analysis and the information obtained, it appears clear that there is no safety-related issue potentially arising from the incorrect width designations indicated on the wheels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the 1994 Tire and Rim Association Yearbook, the permissible tires on a 22.5 &times; 9.00 inch rim are the 295/75*22.5 and the 12*22.5. The permissible tires for use on a 22.5 x 8.25 inch rim are the 265/75*22.5, 295/75*22.5, 11*22.5, and the 12*22.5 size. Because the 12*22.5 and the 295/75*22.5 tires are acceptable on both the 8.25 inch and 9.00 inch rims, these tire combinations are not of concern. The remaining 11*22.5 and 265/75*22.5 tires that are specified only for the 8.25 inch rim have been given particular attention. Acccuride has carefully evaluated all of the issues surrounding the possible effect of use of such tires on a wider 9.00 inch rim. We have also solicited the input of two major tire manufacturers and specifically inquired as to potential negative effects of such usage. Our analysis, as well as that of the tire manufacturers, is that there is no safety-related issue. Load carrying capacities, air retention, handling characteristics, and other aspects of performance will not be affected to any degree significant to motor vehicle safety. The only potential effect of such usage results from the fact that the tires in question are slightly more spread on the wider 9.00 inch rim resulting in some chance of reduction in tread wear to a minor degree. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should also be pointed out that the 22.5 &times; 9.00 inch size is generally a special application tire and wheel combination typically used in North America only on fleets requiring a particular larger tire for the needs of their operation. The wheel in question is heavier and more expensive than a standard 8.25 inch wheel, and these fleets use the product because of specific higher load requirements and would also use the larger tire to meet those same requirements. It is, therefore, Accuride's conclusion that the possibility that narrower tires would be used on these wheels is extremely remote. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the petition of Accuride, described above.

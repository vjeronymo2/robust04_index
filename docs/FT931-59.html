			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Lira breaks the L1000 level piercing the L1000 level to the D-Mark in early morning trading in Milan - following speculation that Mr Giuliano Amato, the country's prime minister, was planning to resign, writes James Blitz. After closing in London at L987.6 to the D-Mark on Monday night, the lira touched L1004 against the German currency in Milan yesterday morning. In London, the pressure on the currency was only slightly more restrained, with the lira being offered at L1000, but failing to trade at that level. London dealers said that much of the selling of lire was speculative, although Italy's bond prices suffered a sharp fall as institutional investors hurried to get out of Italian-denominated assets. The currency later rebounded following reports that Mr Amato would continue to stay in office. The lira closed at L990.1 to the D-Mark, a net L2.4 weaker on the day. Recent runs on the lira have involved sharp selling of the currency by private Italian citizens, but there were no reports of this yesterday. Mr Mark Austin, a Treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, warned that there might be more pressure on the currency if the Italian media pays much attention to the breaking of the psychologically important L1000 figure. In sharp contrast, the French franc was firm against the D-Mark yesterday morning following Mr Edouard Balladur's nomination as France's new prime minister. The franc rose to FFr3.392 in the morning, but later fell back to close in London at FFr3.396 to the D-Mark. There is a growing belief that the new French government will cut official interest rates soon, especially if the Bundesbank eases the repo rate in its weekly money market operations today. However, Ms Wendy Niffikeer, an economist at IBJ International, said the franc had not strengthened sufficiently to allow the Bank of France to ease policy. 'Unless the franc strengthens to FFr3.37 to the D-Mark and stays there for a few days, I am not sure France will be able to cut rates,' she added. Sterling lost  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.4225, amid continuing speculation that the UK authorities might cut base rates to counter a threatened rise in the mortgage rate by building societies. However, the currency performed strongly against a generally weak dollar, ending nearly  1/2 cent up at Dollars 1.4950. The dollar fell as low as DM1.6165 yesterday following a 6 percentage-point drop in the February US consumer confidence index. The US unit closed nearly a net pfennig down at DM1.6200. In New York it ended at DM1.6170. Mr Jim O'Neill of Swiss Banking Corporation, a long-time dollar bear, believes the currency could slip below DM1.60 on Friday afternoon if the payroll data are on the soft side. He believes the dollar could yet see DM1.52.</p>

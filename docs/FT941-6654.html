			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: A growing taste for shopping around - Retailing Single market enthusiasts have long maintained that retailing has a special role to play in cementing the unity of the new Europe - and not just because of the sector's role as distributor of manufactured goods. It employs about 17 per cent of the EU's workforce, and retail sales account for between 16.6 per cent of gross domestic product (in Belgium) and 35 per cent of GDP (in Greece). Yet retailing remains one of the least international industries, with many leading retailers operating largely within their home markets. There are fears that Europe's failure to develop powerful, truly international chains means it will soon be overrun by new entrants from the US. The fragmented nature of the European market results partly from cultural, language and taste differences. But restrictive legislation has also hindered domestic and cross-border expansion. Laws such as France's Loi Royer, Belgium's Loi Cadenas, and Germany's Baunutzungsverordnung limit retail developments above certain sizes. In the Netherlands, the number of stores in any area is limited according to population size. Those restrictions have not been removed by the single market and, in some cases, differences are widening. But it would be wrong to suggest that cross-border expansion in Europe is not taking place. Between early 1991 and early 1993, the Oxford Institute of Retail Management found European retailers had made 530 international moves, nearly three-quarters of them expansions into other European countries. But restrictive legislation and market saturation at home have also spurred retailers to look at north America. France's Promodes, Germany's Aldi and Tengelmann, Belgium's Delhaize, and Ahold of the Netherlands all make at least 20 per cent of their turnover outside their home markets. But chains from across the Atlantic are also eyeing opportunities provided by a market of 320m west European consumers - and are well-equipped to exploit them. Unimpeded by national boundaries, planning restrictions, high land costs, and wars at home, some US retailers have been building for a century or more. The result is the world's largest, most vibrant retail market. At Dollars 2,000bn in 1992, it was larger than the GDP of united Germany. Their size gives US retailers enormous buying power, while the competitiveness of the market, plus the fact that experimental stores can be launched easily and cheaply, has made the US the crucible of retailing innovation. The US invented mail order, the self-service supermarket and TV shopping. US retailing also has a highly-developed discount sector, and has pioneered discount formats such as warehouse clubs, 'category killers' such as Toys R Us and factory shop malls, which could pose a significant threat to higher-margin European, and especially UK, retailers. A recent report by retail research group Corporate Intelligence suggested more than 50 US retail groups were queueing up to enter Europe, including the world's largest, Wal-Mart. There is, moreover, an important difference between US and European retail expansion overseas. US retailers tend to export their own format and grow organically. Groups such as Toys R Us and restaurant chain McDonald's have brought innovative formulas to Europe and transformed every market they have entered. One reason may be that family ownership of retailers makes it difficult to buy into the French, German and Dutch markets. But US retailers may in any case be more adept at exploiting gaps in the market. While some European retailers - such as Ikea, the Swedish furniture superstore chain, Carrefour, the French food retailer, and smaller formats, such as Benetton, Body Shop and Laura Ashley - have extensive overseas networks of their own stores, most European retailers have preferred to expand abroad through acquisitions. But they have not always proved adept at transferring management skills to acquisitions, as shown by the roll call of European companies, such as Marks and Spencer, Delhaize and Dixons, that have had trouble in the US in recent years.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy volume in Racal RECENT bid target Racal Electronics saw its heaviest turnover since Williams Holdings launched its offer for the company in September. The shares jumped by 8.5 per cent as two securities houses took an enthusiastic stance on the stock and rumours of stake changes filtered through the market. The shares rose 4 to 51p with nearly 30m traded. First, County NatWest's electronics team published an internal note advising their sales pitch to recommend a switch out of GEC (slightly off at 207 1/2 p) into Racal. County analyst, Mr Patrick Wellington, said: 'Racal is cheap on fundamentals, its demerger from Chubb in the summer will extricate value and there is still every possibility that a bidder will emerge for the whole or part of the group.' County was said to be responsible for almost a third of the turnover. Second, agency broker James Capel, was said to have shifted its stance on the stock to a buy and purchased 6m shares in the market during early trading. Although no one from Capel was available for comment, the firm's alleged move prompted widespread belief that a large stakeholder was changing tack. Williams still holds almost 10 per cent - 139m shares - and on January 31 it was announced that Guardian Royal Exchange had increased its stake from 4.5 per cent to 5.06 per cent. Vodafone firm Busy turnover was seen in Vodafone as a number of brokers decided that the group's recent downgrades and underperformance was overdone. The spur to the move was the release yesterday of the latest mobile phone industry subscriber figures, which gave Vodafone a healthy 5,500 new users. The shares added 8 to 342p in busy volume of 5.2m. Re-affirming its positive stance, Mr Paul Ruddle at Charterhouse Tilney said: 'The price has been off by about 10 per cent since the start of the year, mainly because of the worries over Orbitel, and we feel it has been a little overdone.' UBS Phillips &amp; Drew also reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. Selected property stocks outperformed as one broker - believed to be S G Warburg - turned buyer. MEPC gained 3 to 380p, while Land Securities gained 7 to 473p. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said it was likely to revise its NAV levels after the latest gloomy statistics from the Investment Property Databank, which show the acuteness of the downturn in the City office sector. According to UBS, the figures indicate City office capital values falling 32.5 per cent in 1991, far more than the house had been expecting. Positive stances on Rosehaugh were adopted by a couple of brokers as optimism was shown over the group's medium-term financing being put in place. The shares rose 1 3/4 to 7p. Good two-way business in Mountleigh saw 6.7m shares traded, the shares edging  1/4 to 6 1/2 p. Buyers returned for British Aerospace, lifting the shares 17 to 296p. In addition to bargain-hunting, sentiment was helped by news that the European Court of Justice had overturned a European Commission ruling that would have forced BAe to repay Pounds 44.4m of subsidies to the UK government. Analysts had, however, expected the court ruling and said there would be no change in profit forecasts. Buyers were also encouraged by an announcement that Templeton, Galbraith and Hansberger, the Bahamas-based fund management group, had taken a 3.01 per cent stake in British Aerospace. Turnover had reached 3.5m by the close. Water stocks were active and moved ahead as the market continued to assess the political outlook in the UK. Among the major moves were Souuthwest Water up 12 to 350p and Yorkshire Water ahead 9 at 388p. Fuel distributor Calor Group rose 11 to 212p on a buy recommendation from securities house Smith New Court. Mr Steve Turner of Smiths said: 'We see it as a buy on valuation grounds. The yield of 8 per cent for 1991 is very attractive and confidence in future prospects are enhanced by the sharp falls in feed stocks.' British Gas fell 4 1/2 to 244 1/2 p with 5.1m traded as the company's broker Hoare Govett struck a note of caution on the stock as it published research on the impact of the Office of Fair Tradings proposals. Oil majors were flat with BP easing 2 to 284p and Shell drifting a penny to 476p. News that Iraq had pulled out of oil talks with the UN came after the market closed. However, the news is expected to lift prices. London &amp; Manchester recovered 8 to 258p following the recent shock of its provisions for commercial mortgages. SmithKline Beecham stood out in a firm pharmaceuticals sector with a rise of 10 to 955p in the 'A's as it bounced back after being oversold in the US. One analyst pointed to a US Aids publication as boosting sentiment. The journal apparently argued that SmithKline's Tagamet drug, the world's second best-selling ulcer drug, could be useful as an Aids drug. London International Group bounced back 6 to 305p as a stock shortage was mopped up. Life Science was squeezed up 8 to 167p as dealers realised that one investment bank was short of stock and squeezed it during early business. Brewers remained weak, with Allied Lyons falling another 9 to 630p on confusion about the status of 734 pubs that the company intends to lease to Brent Walker. The Office of Fair Trading has warned it hopes to persuade the courts that these pubs are still part of Allied's tied estate after the November deadline when the company must free 2,380 pubs from exclusive agreements. Warburg Securities has downgraded its profits forecast for Allied, partly as a result of mediocre wine and spirit sales in the US and UK over Christmas. Grand Metropolitan lost 11 to 926p, in sympathy with the sector in general, despite a buy recommendation from Panmure Gordon. Nervousness about Wall Street depressed the shares, with Grand Met seen as vulnerable through its subsidiary IDV, the largest drinks group in North America. Guinness fell 1 to 571p, but was stronger than several companies in the sector following news that its subsidiary United Distillers intends to streamline operations in the US, by cutting the number of its distributors, re-organising scotch whisky sales and reducing staff levels. Hotel talk continued to dominate the leisure sector yesterday, with occupancy rates again the focus of attention. Vaux, the brewery and hotels group, held a presentation and revealed a 7 per cent fall in occupancy levels and a 4 per cent drop in room rates. It added that it was not expecting an improvement until 1993. Today, analysts visit Forte where a more bullish account is expected. Vaux dipped 9 to 201p, Forte lost 2 to 225p among a weak hotel sector. Gambling machine group Kunick rose 3 to 11 1/2 p as the market took stock of the 570,000 shares purchased by directors at 9p late on Monday. The dust settled on Granada Group following the resignation of Mr David Plowright on Monday, the shares slipping 4 to 219p, although the mood in the market was still sombre. Shares in TI Group which recently fell as the market focused on the company's accounting practices bounced 19 to 599p after a recommendation from County NatWest. The securities house said: 'TI's accounting policies stand comparison with its peers' and the market should 'focus upon the prospect of strong earnings growth in 1993 and beyond'. A stock overhang left Siebe 8 lighter at 555p. GKN shed 3 to 317p after UBS Phillips &amp; Drew took the stock off its buy list. Tiphook was believed to have been the victim of a bear raid. The shares shed 15 to 400p. Eurotunnel fell 15 to 445p on speculation that shares in the company may be offered to the consortium of Anglo-French companies building the tunnel as part settlement of their claim for excess costs.

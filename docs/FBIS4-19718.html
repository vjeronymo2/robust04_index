			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Morten Fyhn report: "Applicants Apply Pressure, EU </F> Parliament Hesitates"]    [Text] Strasbourg -- The EU [European Union] applicants  warn the European Parliament: Membership delay will have  catastrophic repercussions.    Despite the fact that the four EU applicant nations  yesterday  exerted massive political pressure to get the European  Parliament to say "yes" to the results of the membership  negotiations, there are still some doubts about whether it is  possible to scrape together the necessary majority of 260 of the  total of 518 popularly elected members of parliament to reach  the necessary decision on 4 May. Signals from the various party  groupings indicate that a further 30 to 40 votes are still  needed.    Well aware of the growing skepticism in Strasbourg; a  skepticism which is not due to any reluctance to enlarge the EU,  but because the Parliament wants to take the opportunity to  demand more power for itself, the European Parliament's deputies  yesterday received a visit from what is undoubtedly the most  heavyweight lobbying group which has ever tried to influence  them [sentence as published].    In turn Prime Ministers Gro Harlem Brundtland and Carl  Bildt,  Austrian Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek, and Finnish Trade  Minister Pertti Salolainen made it crystal clear what negative  consequences any delay by the Palriament will have for public  opinion in the four applicant countries, the EU countries, and  for European policy in general. Former Conservative Party  leader Kaci Kullmann Five was also in Strasbourg to influence  the conservative party group.    Salolainen took the toughest approach. He claimed that a  postponement of enlargement would have a catastrophic effect on  the Finnish people. "If you do not deal with the matter now, a  completely impossible situation will arise. You would be  assuming an enormous political responsibility if you said `no,'"  the Finnish minister said. The Austrian vice chancellor was in  complete agreement, and warned against doing anything which  could threaten the current positive attitude to the EU in his  home country.    "What sort of message do you think will be sent to the  Swedish people if you say `no' now?" Carl Bildt asked. Gro  Harlem Brundtland, who is battling against a body of public  opinion at home which takes the most negative view of the EU,  wisely refrained from indicating what view will be taken of a  delay. But she made it clear that a "no" in Strasbourg will  have a very negative effect in the applicant countries and in  Europe.    The European Parliament's skepticism about admitting new  members without concomitant institutional reforms has been  reinforced since the EU countries adopted a compromise on voting  rules in the Council of Ministers just before Easter. Many  people in Strasbourg take the view that the compromise makes it  even more difficult than it was to reach majority decisions in  the EU. There is also tangible irritation that the Parliament  is only being given a couple of weeks in which to discuss the  final results of the membership negotiations.    "What is so wrong with a postponement of six months?"  British  socialist Gary Titley asked. His French fellow party member,  Gerhard Fuchs, hoped that the Parliament will go on saying "no"  to the applicants until the Council withdraws the Ioannina  compromise on voting rules. Holland's Jean Penders, a  conservative, said that the Parliament's credibility is at  stake. This is why the question of new members must be  deferred, he said. "Why do you want to join a Union which is so  powerless?" an indignant Belgian socialist, Fernand Herman,  asked.    The majority of those who spoke were negative. Danish  conservative politician Marie Jepsen was one of the few  exceptions. "We should say not only `yes,' but `yes, please,'  to the applicant countries," she said.    Harlem Brundtland, Bildt, and the other two lobbyists made  efforts to convince the Parliament that they -- as soon as their  countries have joined the EU -- will work actively to strengthen  the role of the Parliament and the EU's ability to reach  decisions. But they clearly distanced themselves from the fact  that their applications are now being used as a way of applying  pressure to try to force through more power for the Parliament.  Nor did they have any time for the view voiced that a delay  would only be for six months.</p>

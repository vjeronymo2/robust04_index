			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Uni restructure gains support THIRTY-FIVE domestic companies have confirmed willingness to participate in a plan to restructure financially Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurance group, which collapsed last August under the weight of NKr3.8bn (Dollars 559m) in short-term debt. Uni's administration board yesterday unveiled details of the recapitalisation plan presented to it by Sunndal Collier and Fondsfinans, two domestic brokerage firms, although part of the proposal was leaked last Friday. The proposal calls for a share issue to raise NKr2.8bn, of which NKr1bn would be redeemable preferential shares, and a bond issue to raise an estimated NKr1.5bn - both of which would be listed on the Oslo bourse. The administration board is considering two alternatives and aims to decide at the end of this week. The group's Skandia stake, comprising 19m shares, would be spun off into a separate, wholly-owned Uni subsidiary, and would involve selling the shares to the new unit at a price fixed at a rebate and based on the prevailing trading price of Skandia's shares on the day of the transfer. The sale would be financed by two other bond issues, one ordinary and the other subordinate, also to be listed on the Oslo bourse.</p>

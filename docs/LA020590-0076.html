			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALARTS STUDENT FILMS AT LACE  </P> <P> "CalArts Motion Graphics Gala," a program of short student works Filmforum is  presenting at the LACE gallery tonight, amply demonstrates a personal vision.  </P> <P> The most striking aspect of the show is its diversity: The films cover a wide  variety of styles and techniques that range from conventional storytelling to  pure abstraction, and from traditional cel animation to computer graphics. The  best offer viewers a uniquely beautiful blend of color, motion and design; the  weaker ones make five minutes seem like an eternity.  </P> <P> Robert Jahnke adapts the intricate look of Maori carvings to recount a New  Zealand legend of a battle between the Sky God and his siblings in the boldly  original "Te Utu" (1980). "Phases" (1978), Henry Selick's powerful study of a  panther attacking a horse, is a tour de force of both animation and  draftsmanship: Every frame demonstrates the artist's exceptional understanding  of animal anatomy and motion.  </P> <P> This contrasts sharply with the serenity of Dennis Pies' "Aura Corona" (1976).  Semi-abstract creatures resembling trilobites float through a sea of shimmering  veils in this lovely, meditative film. Amy Kravitz's highly textural  black-and-white drawings are pure abstractions that contain no recognizable  images, yet they move with a natural, sensual grace in "The Trap" (1987).  </P> <P> Not all the works in "Motion Graphics Gala" achieve this level of excellence.  The crude, metamorphic figures in Kathy Rose's "The Mysterians" (1975) are less  the product of a childlike naivete than a lack of drawing ability. John  Adamczyk uses a computer to generate staggeringly complex fractal patterns in  "Recurrents" (1987), but there's very little movement in the film, and anyone  who picks up a copy of "Chaos" can see the same images. "Pink Triangle" (1989)  showcases Bob Doucette's talent as a painter, but its story about the Nazi  persecution of homosexuals doesn't begin until the film is nearly over.  </P> <P>  "CalArts Motion Graphics Gala" screens at 8 p.m. at LACE, 1804 Industrial St.  Information: (213) 276-7452 or (714) 923-2441.  </P> <P> CHARLES SOLOMON  </P></p>

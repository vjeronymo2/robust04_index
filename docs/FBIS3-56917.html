Lithuania, which is worried about its security, is also  looking into other directions. It is aiming to have a union  with central European countries, and it wants to have closer  cooperation with Baltic and Nordic countries. Lithuanian  President Algirdas Brazauskas will visit Finland this week. He  was interviewed in Vilnius by Ulla-Maija Maeaettaenen.    [Maeaettaenen] Lithuania announced at the beginning of this  month that it is seeking full membership in NATO. Lithuanian  President Algirdas Brazauskas, who would have been happy with  the Partnership for Peace agreement NATO has offered to several  countries, had to give in for internal reasons and partly also  because of pressure. Now he justified Lithuania's willingness  to Yleisradio [Finnish Broadcasting Company] by taking as an  example the Visegrad countries: Poland, Hungary, the Czechs and  Slovaks. According to Brazauskas, Lithuania has the same motives  with these countries to seek full membership, even though full  membership would be very expensive for Lithuania, which is  currently suffering economic difficulties.    Lithuania would like security guarantees from NATO because  of  Kaliningrad, which is part of Russia, but Brazauskas is calm.  According to him, one should not frighten people with  Kaliningrad, which can be also used in an economic way.    Of the Baltic countries, Estonia views Lithuania's NATO  aspirations with extreme reserve. According to the Estonians,  Lithuania thus wants to leave the Baltic security policy  cooperation. According to the Lithuanians, as long as there are  Russian soldiers in Latvia and Estonia, the step to NATO is the  Partnership for Peace agreement, and it looks like Lithuania  will also have to be satisfied with that.    President Brazauskas will meet NATO representatives in  Brussels at the end of this month. Before that he does not  agree to say what NATO has offered to Lithuania.    Lithuania's current plans include increasing cooperation  with  the Visegrad countries, possibly joining these countries. And  one way towards a more comprehensive NATO cooperation is the  joint peacekeeping forces of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.  The training of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion of about 650  men will start in Lithuania in the next few months.  Preparations have already started.    Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas will arrive for an  official visit in Finland 20 January. Like other Baltic  countries, Lithuania also wants to have closer contacts with the  Nordic countries. Brazauskas sees as one possibility a joint  union between the Baltic and the Nordic countries, with the  principle three plus five. The idea is a few months old, and it  is possible to develop it further, Brazauskas says. He hopes  the Finns will take part in energy projects, and he put his  hopes on the Via Baltica project. This is a challenge indeed;  the problematic customs and passport checks can currently take  hours at the borders of the Baltic countries alone.</p>

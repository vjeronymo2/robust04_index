			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: AIG income lifted by growth in all sectors American International Group, the US-based insurance group, notched up a further 14 per cent advance in net income in the second quarter, in spite of little change in US property/casualty insurance rates during the period. The improvement came on the back of a 9.3 per cent growth in premiums compared with a year before, and the absence of catastrophes in the US, which led to a fall in the group's combined loss ratio to 98.66 from 99.6 a year before. AIG reported net income of Dollars 550m on revenues of Dollars 5.6bn, against Dollars 482m on revenues of Dollars 5bn the year before. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.74, up from Dollars 1.52. Mr Maurice Greenberg, chairman, attributed the advance to strong results in all of the group's businesses. He said the property/casualty business in the US was helped by the absence of catastrophes, while premium rates were little changed. On the general insurance side, pre-tax income rose 14 per cent to Dollars 379m on a 9 per cent rise in premiums, to Dollars 2.9bn. Life insurance premiums, meanwhile, grew by 16 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn, fuelling a 19 per cent advance in pre-tax income to Dollars 213m. First-half net income rose 8 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn.</p>

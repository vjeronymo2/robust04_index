The variability of HIV genes,  combined with the latency phenomenon that is inherent in  lentiviruses, enables the virus to elude the defense systems of  the human body rather successfully 4, 6].    In western countries with the largest number of HIV-positive  individuals and AIDS victims (USA, France, England, Germany),  numerous HIV isolates were obtained differing in antigenic and  molecular-biological properties [1, 3, 5]. The existence of two  HIV serotypes was established: HIV-1 and HIV-2 [4, 6].  Immunodeficiency viruses were isolated from primates and cats  that were very similar to HIV. With the appearance of  HIV-positive individuals and AIDS cases in the former USSR, it  became necessary to isolate and study the HIV strains  circulating in this territory. For this reason, our objective  here was to isolate and analyze the features of domestic HIV  strains.  <H5>  Material and Methods </H5>   Isolation of viruses. We obtained HIV isolates  from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) using a modification of  the method in [1]. After PBL isolation with use of a  ficoll-isopaque (Sweden) gradient, they were stimulated by  phytohemagglutinin in a concentration of 5 g/ml (Sigma, USA)  for 48 h, eluted and cultivated in the presence of human  interleukin-2 for 4-6 weeks or up to the time of cocultivation  with lymphocytic and monocytic cell lines, as well as with PBL  from healthy donors stimulated as described above.    Viruses. In addition to our isolates, we used HIV  strains kindly furnished by Professor L. Montagnier: HIV-1/BRU,  Professor Gallo: HIV-1/IIIB, and Professor J. Levy: HIV-1/SF4.    Cells. We used transferable human cell lines H9,  Hut-78, CEM, MT-4, MOLT-4, CEM-SS, U-937, Jurkat tat and others,  obtained from the collection of the Institute of Virology imeni  D. I. Ivanovskiy, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. The cells  were cultivated in a concentration of 0.3-0.5 million per  milliliter medium RPMI-1640 with 10 percent fetal calf serum,  300 g/ml L-glutamine, and 100 g/ml gentamycin, and  incubated in suspension form. Viability of cells was determined  by staining with 0.4 percent trypan blue.    Immunofluorescence. Cells that expressed HIV  antigen on the surface were counted by the standard method using  serum containing antibodies to HIV-1 from an AIDS patient.    Electron microscopy. After centrifuging at 2000  rpm for 5 min, cell sediments were collected and fixed  successively in 2.5 percent glutaraldehyde solution and 1  percent OsO[.sup]4[/] in phosphate buffer, dehydrated and  embedded in araldite. Sections were contrasted with uranyl  acetate and silver nitrate using conventional techniques, then  examined under an SEM-100B microscope.    Enzyme immunoassay. For direct enzyme  immunoassay (EIA), we used a test system that we prepared for  demonstration of HIV-1 antigens in culture fluid of cells  infected with HIV-1 where antibodies to HIV-1 obtained from  blood serum of AIDS patients were adsorbed in the solid phase.  Peroxidase-tagged antibodies were obtained by binding  immunoglobulins from the serum of HIV positive individuals  (titer greater than 1:40,000 in the Organon test system) with  armoracia peroxidase using the periodate method. EIA sensitivity  constituted more than 2 ng/ml viral antigen. We added up to 0.1  percent tween-20 to the specimens of material and applied them  to wells in a tray. They were incubated for 18 h at 4C,  washed, conjugate in a 1:1000 dilution was added, then they were  incubated for 1 h at 37C. We eluted them, added substrate  and measured absorption.    Reverse transcriptase reaction. The reaction was  run in a lysate of precipitated virus (25,000 rpm, 1.5 h, lysis  in buffer of: 50 percent glycerin, 7.5 mM HCl pH 7.5, 75 mM KCl,  1 mM DTT [dithiothreitol], 0.2 percent triton X-100). The  reaction was carried out in a buffer of: 10 mM HCl (pH 7.5), 20  mM KCl, 2 mM magnesium chloride solution, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.02  percent triton X-100, 0.2 mg/ml poly(rA)-digo(dT)[.sup]10[/]  and [.sup]3[/]H TTP, 2 Ci per specimen. Incubation for 1 h  at 37C [1].    Polymerase chain reaction., isolation of DNA from  cells. 1.5 ml cell suspension was precipitated, the sediment  eluted 3 times in buffer at 4000 rpm for 30 min. We added 100  l phosphate solution and saline buffer (pH 7.2) containing  proteinase K in a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Incubation was  carried out for 1 h at 55C, for 16 h at 37C, then  heated for 2 min at 94C.    The reaction was run using the following concentrations of  reagents: dNTP mixture -- 200 M each; primers -- 1 M  each;  template -- 50 pg per sample; Tag enzyme - polymerase -- 4 U per  sample, tris-HCl pH 9.3 -- 10 mM; KCl -- 50 mM; magnesium  chloride -- 2 mM; gelatin -- 0.1 mg/ml.    We used 25 cycles at the following temperatures: 2 min at  37C -- fusion, 5 min at 72C -- elongation, and 2 min  at 94C -- denaturation.  <H5>  4. Results and Discussion </H5>   Experiments for isolation of HIV isolates from material  taken  from HIV positive subjects and AIDS patients in 22 cities of the  former USSR: Moscow, Elista, Leningrad, Rostov, Stavropol,  Penza, Volgograd, Smolensk, Riga, Armavir, Donetsk and others.  We obtained a total of 81 HIV isolates.    Effectiveness of HIV isolation constituted 29.1 percent in  the case of asymptomatic carriers, 71.4 percent in HIV positive  cases with generalized lymphadenopathy, and 90.5 percent in AIDS  patients with severe manifestations of the disease.    Immunological analysis of the HIV isolates enabled us to  determine that 79 out of the 81 HIV isolates are type I, 2 are  type II and are HIV-2 strains.    We identified HIV isolates using several independent  methods.  At the early stages after HIV isolation, the virus was tested  using enzyme immunoassay and immunofluorescence analysis, and we  also measured reverse transcriptase activity in the culture  medium.    Then we studied the HIV isolates using electron microscopy,  the immune blot method and polymerase chain reaction. The test  results are listed in the table.

The data indicate that the first signs of HIV are  demonstrable on the 7th-10th day of observation by determination  of reverse transcriptase activity. Peak RT occurred on the  16th-19th day for many strains. The level of reverse  transcriptase activity differed appreciably, depending on the  isolated strain. It was possible to distinguish a second group  of strains which demonstrated an RT peak on the 30th-35th day.  The patterns of rise and decline in RT activity in peripheral  blood lymphocytes coincided on the whole with detection of HIV  antigen by EIA. After infecting transferable lymphoblastoid cell  lines with HIV strains, maximum production of HIV antigen in  culture fluid occurred on the 3d-5th to 12th-15th day, depending  on the type of cell culture and HIV strain. Reproduction of  isolates in sensitive cell lines was accompanied by a typical  cytopathic effect. Most frequently, infected cells showed  virus-induced fusions of cell membranes of giant ``balloons''  and syncytia. In other instances, there were no such structures;  however, a strong cytodestructive effect was noted. The time of  syncytia formation in infected cells depended on infectivity of  the strains, and with highly infective strains they appeared on  the 4th-5th day.    The cytopathic effect of viruses was demonstrable in the  2d-3d week after infecting the cell cultures in the case of 3  strains differing in infective activity. Formation of syncytia  was correlated with expression of HIV antigens on the surface of  infected cells, as demonstrable by indirect immunofluorescence.  The number of cells with HIV antigens in the cell population  ranged from 2-7 to 24-53 percent for HIV-1/IV3, HIV-1/IV17,  HIV-1/IV21, HIV-1/IV39, and HIV-1/IV54.    Electron microscopy most often revealed HIV virions near the  cell membrane or showed budding on it. Mature virions consisted  of spherical particles 100-120 nm in size, with a pear-shaped,  acentric core. Virions of a new HIV generation were demonstrable  on the 3d day after infecting cells, while the maximum number of  extracellular and budding viral particles was found on the 5th  postinfection day. The spectrum of isolated HIV differed from  that of cell cultures. A large group of strains was capable of  reproduction only in a limited number of cell lines.    In some cases, HIV-1/IV5, HIV-1/IV7, HIV-1/IV11 and others  were isolated from asymptomatic HIV carriers.    However, this pattern was not always observed and, in the  case of HIV-1/IV13, HIV-1/IV24 and others from asymptomatic  carriers, strains were obtained for which there was a wide  spectrum of sensitive cell lines.    Some of the HIV strains had the capacity to grow on both  lymphocytic and monocytic cell lines. In many cases, these were  strains isolated from patients at the 3d-4th stage of disease,  with marked symptoms.    It must be noted that, in addition to the capacity to  multiply in different types of cells, the HIV strains  demonstrated differing kinetics of viral production in cells of  the same type.    Thus, the obtained HIV-1 isolates can be divided into two  groups, having low and high productivity. The former group has a  limited replicative capacity, low or negative RT and EIA. The  second group is characterized by high infectivity (4.5-6.0  TCID[.sup]50[/]), high RT, EIA, and capacity to multiply in  various transferable cell lines.    Separation of strains into those with low and high  infectivity is also typical of HIV isolated in Europe and the  United States, which is indicative of the similarity of  biological properties of our HIV strains and foreign ones [2, 5].    Comparison of characteristics and level of viral antigen  production by cells infected with Russian, highly infective  strains to reference strains HIV-1/IIIB, HIV-1/BRU, and  HIV-1/SF4 revealed that they have the necessary properties to  recover HIV antigen for diagnostic purposes.    Using a set of primers complementary to the sites of the gag  and pol genes and the polymerase chain reaction, we obtained  viral DNA fragments 2438 base pairs in size. The fragment was  then spliced into the Blue script SK+ plasmid, TG1 cells were  transfected, and clones were isolated with this fragment of the  HIV genome. As a result of sequencing the DNA of HIV-1/IV54, it  became possible to compare amino acid sequences of the gag  protein fragment of this virus to the prototype foreign HIV-1  specimens [7].    The findings indicate that the homology of strain HIV-1/IV54  with HIV-1/MAL, which is typical for the African content,  constitutes 65 percent. Similarity to the North American strain  HIV-1/MN constitutes 81 percent, which is indicative of somewhat  greater resemblance of HIV-1/IV54 to the American HIV-1 subtype.    Studies of HIV strains isolated from HIV positive  individuals  from different regions of our country revealed that the HIV  isolates were heterogenous.    Mainly the type 1 virus, HIV-1, is circulating among the  population of Russia (98.1 percent); however, in the last 2  years HIV-2 infection has been noted among our citizens.    Thus, it can be noted that there is circulation in our  country of HIV-1 and HIV-2, which differ in molecular-biological  properties, but are similar in the main parameters to the  prototype HIV-1 strains that are widespread in America, Africa  and Europe.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Semenov report: "Loans Not Yet Panacea. </F> Necessary To Be Able To Adapt"]    [Text] Yaroslavl -- Yaroslavl Oblast has managed to find a  way to support defense plants and help them in the conversion  process. But this is not charity by the administration. The  aid has been and continues to be available on market terms.    In 1993 the oblast made the first attempt in Russia to  finance conversion mainly through soft loans. In accordance  with the ratified program, more than 1.2 billion rubles [R] were  to have been allocated from the oblast budget last year. But  only 60 percent of these funds were allocated owing to limited  financial resources, and the last R189 million was paid out to  enterprises at the very end of the year. Consequently,  investment has been delayed. The other problem reflected in the  results was inflation and price growth.    Nonetheless, the work on the conversion program has enabled  a  number of defense enterprises to survive at a time of a general  production slump, to retain qualified staff, and to organize  production of new types of output -- namely, 47 buses, 3,500  microwave ovens, 3,150 liquid-fuel stoves, 100 milk coolers, and  so forth. In all, output worth R2 billion has been produced  under the program, and goods worth R500 million have already  been sold -- which shows that there is a good level of demand.    Of course, there have been some unforeseen situations. For  instance, the "Kholodmash" enterprise has stopped producing  microwave ovens, since the oblast requirement for these products  is met by the Rybinsk Instrument-Making Plant. "Kholodmash"  then quickly switched to domestic refrigerators instead. The  "Start" Design Bureau gave up the manufacture of portable  digital nitrate measuring devices, since demand for them had in  practice fallen. Although you would have expected the reverse.  After all, the entire world monitors food quality. But,  clearly, we have not reached that point yet. And returns on  investment have not always justified the expenditure. Thus,  despite using a R238-million loan from the oblast budget and  R235 million from its own resources, the "Mashpribor" Plant  produced output worth just R197.4 million.    The oblast conversion program has been under way for 6  months, and a number of items are at the experimental mockup  stage, undergoing testing, or being made ready for series  production. These include electric choppers and electric meat  grinders produced by the "Mashpribor" Plant, portable color  camcorders [televideoustroystva] from the Rybinsk  Instrument-Making Plant, domestic air conditioners and  refrigerator compressors, a series of medical instruments, and  so forth.    This year, the administration's collaboration with  enterprises from the defense industry complex is undergoing  certain modifications. Whereas previously enterprises' programs  were taken at face value, the reluctance to "throw money down  the drain" has now forced the administration to somewhat tighten  up the requirements it places on the plans that are submitted.    Specialists have elaborated a standard type of investment  project which answers the three main questions of: "What is  being produced, how will it be produced, and who is it for?"  Unless a product has a known sales market, projects will not  even be accepted for consideration.    At the start of the year the administration drew up  proposals  on the industrial side of the budget for the oblast's  development in 1994. The budget includes 37 investment projects  and programs -- 29 of which relate to conversion. Many of them  have received expert scrutiny from a working group at the  Institute of the Economic Problems of the Transitional Period.    The very names of these projects show the great  opportunities  that exist for expanding defense enterprises' economic activity  and for them to successfully find their place in the Russian  consumer market and boost their export potential. The Rybinsk  Instrument-Making Plant has submitted a project for the  production of electronic engine management systems, along with a  plan to organize production of wind-power installations. The  "Kholodmash" Plant will continue to produce compressor motors  for refrigerators and transportation air conditioners.  "Mashpribor" has elaborated a whole program for the manufacture  of production and technical output. "Yaroslavlrezinotekhnika"  has also joined the conversion program, with a plan to produce  carbon strips and building structures made out of cellular  concrete.    The oblast administration has started to set up an  investment  projects bank. After all, if they survive, it will be necessary  to move forward.</p>

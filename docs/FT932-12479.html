			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Hoechst down 28% in quarter THE accelerating slump in western Europe, especially in Germany, cut profits at Hoechst by 28 per cent in the first three months of this year, the company reported yesterday. Germany's biggest chemicals concern said in an interim report that pre-tax earnings had fallen to DM436m (Pounds 177m), compared with DM605m, on sales 5 per cent lower at DM11bn. Profits at the parent company tumbled 35 per cent to DM219m, and turnover fell 13 per cent to DM3.7bn during the quarter under review. Group pre-tax earnings for the whole of 1992 fell 18 per cent. There was still no sign of an upturn in Europe, which accounts for more than half group turnover, although business had picked up slightly in north America despite pronounced weakness in pharmaceuticals sales caused by retailers stocking up at the end of last year before the imposition of price increases, the interim report said. The group's drugs and healthcare business, which yields almost a quarter of total turnover, had also suffered from the effects of healthcare reforms in Germany, Mr Wolfgang Hilger, chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday. According to the interim report, domestic drugs sales were 10 per cent lower in the period under review, although total turnover from healthcare was down less than 2 per cent at DM2.6bn. The biggest single drop in sales - 12 per cent - was recorded in the polymers business, within which bulk plastics suffered a fall of 20 per cent. Mr Hilger attributed the 5 per cent fall in group sales to a 3 per cent drop in volume and a 1 per cent reduction in prices, while the effects of exchange rate changes had cost the group a further 1 per cent. Mr Hilger told the annual meeting that shortages of personnel, systems or technical facilities were not to blame for the recent series of 15 accidents in which one man was killed. He blamed 'fate' for the 'statistical frequency', and pointed out that the last accidental death in the German parent's plant occurred 15 years ago. 'On a statistical basis, a job in our factories is considerably safer than one in retailing,' he said.</p>

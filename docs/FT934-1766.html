			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Airport's ownership plans approved The government has approved a development plan for Birmingham International Airport which will give the private sector majority control, and involve the raising of up to Pounds 400m for investment over the next 10 years. The seven district councils which own the airport yesterday said that Lord Caithness, aviation minister, had been informed of their scheme 'and looks forward to seeing these plans carried through'. 'We will be proceeding as quickly as possible with our plans,' added the owner councils, which are Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton. By mid-1994, airport shareholders expect to be negotiating with potential private-sector investors. They would like two or three partners. 'The preference would be organisations which are committed to the region and understand the Midlands and see the long-term view of the Midlands we must take,' said Mr Brian Summers, the airport's deputy managing director. Companies meeting those criteria would include West Midlands Travel,the region's largest bus operator. Once private-sector shareholders have a majority of the equity, the airport company would be freed of public borrowing restrictions. Singer &amp; Friedlander, merchant banker, has been retained to advise the shareholders on the options for a new capital structure. The corporate and financing plans are being drawn up in the expectation that passenger numbers handled will more than double to 11m by the year 2005. This would require substantial investment in new technical facilities.</p>

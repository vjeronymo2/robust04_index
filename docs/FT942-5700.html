			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / The Bar relents on student places More than 250 students who had been denied places at the barristers' training school by a controversial new selection procedure have been accepted after a climbdown by the Bar. The selection system, which ignored degree results, was based on a mixture of academic qualifications at A-level and psychometric tests. It was designed to pick the best 800 from a record 2,400 applicants for the one-year vocational course - the only route to practise at the Bar. But the scheme provoked outrage among students and university law teachers after hundreds of students with first-class and 2.1 degrees, including more than 60 who had been awarded scholarships by the four Inns of Court, were rejected because of their A-level results. Last month Ms Jane Nightingale, 25, a student with a 2.1 degree who was rejected by the Bar on the basis of her A-levels, was granted leave by the High Court to bring judicial review proceedings against the Council of Legal Education, the body which runs the Bar School. Ms Nightingale has now been offered a place and her judicial review application has been withdrawn. The Public Law Project, a charity which supported her application, said that it was delighted for the students that the Bar had been forced into a climbdown by the action. But it said there were still more than 100 students who felt they had been wrongfully rejected. Yesterday the charity was given leave by Mr Justice Morrison to bring a further judicial review of the selection system on behalf of Ms Penny Davies, 21, a third-year student at the University of Westminster. She is expected to gain a 2.1 but has been told only a first-class degree will secure her a place as she failed the supplementary application form test. Her case is expected to be heard at the end of June. In a joint statement issued yesterday Mr Robert Seabrook QC, chairman of the Bar, and Mr Justice Phillips, chairman of the CLE, admitted the Bar had been wrong to ignore good degrees. Following detailed assessment of the selection system they said the Bar had decided to offer additional places to students with first-class degrees who had failed in any one of the four elements of the selection system and to students with 2.1 degrees who failed either the A-level or application form elements. As a result all but 17 of the 250 students awarded scholarships by the Inns and 98 of the 106 applicants with first-class degrees had now been offered places on the 1994-95 course. The selection system had also been criticised for discriminating against ethnic minorities and women.</p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVE markets were volatile yesterday as they reacted to the Skipton building society's decision to raise its mortgage rates and, later, to a firm set of producer price figures, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,330, but the talk, later confirmed, that the Skipton was about to raise rates quickly sent the contract into retreat, pulling the underlying cash market lower. By 10.45am September was just hovering above the 2,300 level. The release of producer price figures for July, in line with market expectations, helped steady nerves and in the afternoon bargain hunters moved in to lift the contract off the bottom. By 3pm the contract had clawed back earlier falls to trade at 2,335, the high point of the session before a weak Wall Street once again led to nervous selling. September closed at 2,317, down 12 on the previous session and around 3 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover of 13,168 was greatly improved on recent levels. Traded options were also busy, with the FT-SE index option particularly active. Total turnover reached 32,118 and the FT-SE option accounted for 19,709 of that total.</p>

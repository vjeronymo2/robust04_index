Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that speaking at a  meeting of the Labor Knesset faction, Peres again emphasized  that leaving the settlement of Netzarim in place is, in his  words, unreasonable. He maintained that the two companies the  Army will have to deploy to ensure the security of Netzarim  could be better deployed on the Trans-Samaria highway, where  they will safeguard traffic.</p>

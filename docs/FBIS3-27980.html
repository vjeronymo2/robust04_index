			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] During a meeting with the Canadian envoy in Phnom  Penh on 29 January, the puppet Chea Sim declared his vehement  opposition to national reconciliation. He demanded that  Democratic Kampuchea implement his three conditions before any  other issue is discussed. This declaration clearly proves that  the Vietnamese communist puppets -- on orders from their bosses  -- do not accept His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's five-point  political plan to secure national reconciliation and genuine  peace in Cambodia.

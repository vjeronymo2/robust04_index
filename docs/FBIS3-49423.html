			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After Krsko nuclear power station is reconnected to  the Slovene energy system -- this is expected within 24 hours --  Croatia will not longer receive electricity from Krsko. In  Zagreb, they assessed this measure of the Slovene Economic  Ministry as an unprecedented ultimatum and called for  negotiations. Irena Majce reports:    [Begin Majce recording] Minister Dr. Maks Tajnikar,  therefore, kept his promise. His pronouncement that after this  synchronization Croatia will no longer receive electricity from  Krsko is about to materialize in the next few hours. At least,  this is what the minister asserted this morning.    The station is expected to receive the final permission for  operation today. Following the second request of the power  station regarding the modification of chlorine detection, the  Republican Directorate for Nuclear Safety concluded that the  problem could be temporarily resolved by two hand-operated  portable monitors. The ordered and already paid for automatic  sensors are expected to arrive in Krsko within six to eight  weeks. By extending another two decrees until the halt this  summer, the power station now meets the conditions to resume  operation. It is expected that it will operate normally, that  is to say, it will gradually, with interim tests, reach its 100  percent capacity.    Half of the electricity, that is, over 7 million kwh per  day,  that Krsko has so far produced for Croatia will now be partially  used at home while the rest will be exported abroad, that is, to  those who will pay for it.    Minister Tajnikar communicated this in a special letter to  his Croatian colleague last week and added that the neighboring  country will be able to get electricity again after 26 January,  but only on the condition that it settles its debts by 19  January.    Zagreb, in its letter to Ljubljana today, replied that such  a  measure, which they call an ultimatum, could have grave  political and material consequences. They, therefore, reject  it, with the proposal that all open questions connected to the  nuclear power station be negotiated between the states in a  package, and not merely the finances.    Minister Tajnikar reiterated today that Slovenia will insist  on payment for electricity and that it is initially willing to  negotiate on finances only, and on other questions once the  financial issues are settled. Most of other issues are  supposedly already regulated by Slovene legislation, with the  exception of property transformation, regarding which the  government has not taken a stance yet.    Croatian Energy Secretary Vladimir Kramberger believes that  the problem lies precisely in property transformation because he  believes that Slovenia is avoiding the preparation of new  interstate documents about the power station because it would  like to take it over entirely.    Croatia still owes 38 million German Marks to Krsko, after  it  has paid altogether 2 million German Marks on Friday and Monday.  Slovenia has settled all of its obligations prior to this change  of fuel. [end recording]</p>

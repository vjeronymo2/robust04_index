			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: PWS shows decline to Pounds 2.1m A SHARP contraction in the aviation excess of loss market and a fall in US interest rates were blamed by PWS Holdings, the Lloyd's insurance and reinsurance broker, for a 33 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.1m over the six months to March 31. The decline, from last time's Pounds 3.11m, was struck on the back of net retained brokerage income of Pounds 8m (Pounds 8.77m) and other operating income of Pounds 1.19m (Pounds 1.87m). The contraction on the aviation side led to problems at Fryer Cheasley Light and it was decided that these operations should cease trading. An extraordinary item of Pounds 683,000 was carried in association with incurred and anticipated costs connected to this decision. Mr Malcolm Pearson, chairman, said that PWS International, which accounts for more than half group income, had so far experienced a good year in a volatile market. It was expected that this would continue in the second half. He added that the group's reduced reliance on aviation would change its trading pattern so that it made a small profit rather than a small loss in the second half. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p on earnings per share of 6.8p (10.1p).</p>

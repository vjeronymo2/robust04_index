			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Risk and Reward: Joy on hold until December contract expires As Christmas looms, a fund manager's thoughts often turn to locking in profits. End-of-year bonuses always set pulses racing - especially this year, when dividends and share price rises in the London market have provided a combined return of around 20 per cent. If anything untoward happens between now and the end of the year, it will be too late to repair the damage, and investors and traders are beginning to feel the need to squirrel away their gains. Consequently, there will be a sigh of relief after this week's all-important expiry of the FT-SE 100 futures contract for December. By 10.30am on Friday, the quarterly miracle will have occurred: the price of the contract will match the price of the underlying stock market and the contract will expire. However, four full trading days before expiry, some dealers feel a real miracle will be needed. The December contract has experienced sharp rises, a surge of overseas buying, and big movements in technical factors such as premiums and open interest. The futures market operates either as an easy way into the stock market or as a hedge against potential losses. Institutions such as pension funds or insurance groups buy a basket of shares representing the FT-SE 100 index, and marketmakers who sell those shares will buy futures to cover themselves. In a perfect world, the futures contract has a nominal value slightly above the FT-SE 100 index. This 'fair value premium' represents the interest that would have been earned from having funds in the bank, minus the cash that would have been lost in terms of dividends. If the premium moves away from fair value, arbitrageurs will capitalise on the spread. For example, if fair value is 10 and the futures contract moves to a premium of 20 the 'arbs' will sell the futures contract and buy the cash market. Large UK institutions have discovered the appeal of buying futures first and picking up the shares later. Also, US investors have poured money into European markets this year and have often used the futures markets as their point of entry. Dealers estimate that US institutions, which are much more aware of the potential of derivatives markets than their UK counterparts, represent half the business in the London contract. The appeal of the futures market was underlined after the Budget. Investors funnelled cash into the London stock market. Such was the demand that buyers were unable to obtain equities and bought futures contracts instead. When there should have been no premium, according to most dealers' calculations, the futures contract was some 30 points higher than the stockmarket. Mr Nigel Croft, derivatives analyst with Kleinwort Benson, says: 'We haven't seen the futures at such a high level for the whole of this year and most of last. Once it starts to go we could see it fall very quickly.' The demand is highlighted by the exceptionally high level of open interest, a figure that represents both the number of long positions and the number of short positions in the market. By the close of dealing on Friday there were still around 45,500 open positions. That figure must be closed out by Friday morning. Long-term investors will let the contracts expire and collect stocks. With the stock market near its record high, it could take astute salesmanship to persuade some funds to add to their weightings, and the pressure to settle is expected to result in a volatile market. There is still a lot of shuffling to be done.</p>

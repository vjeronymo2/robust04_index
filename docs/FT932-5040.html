			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Sport: Mary Joe finally has it taped - Tennis AT 3 PM on Thursday in Paris Steffi Graf regained the No. 1 world ranking from Monica Seles. Regrettable as it may seem, by beating Anke Huber 6-1 6-1 in the semi-finals of the 1993 French Open, Graf fulfilled the objective of her demented fan Gunther Parche who stabbed Seles in Hamburg on April 30. Graf is as upset by the ramifications of this as everyone else and did not want to discuss the matter. 'I really don't care about the number one ranking. I'm in the final in France and that is what counts to me,' she said. This afternoon 23-year-old Graf will face a new challenger for the title she has held twice before. In the second of Thursday's semi-finals the 21-year-old American, Mary Joe Fernandez, seeded five, upset the form book for the second time this week by inflicting a 6-2 6-2 beating on Spain's No 2 seed, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario. Coming on top of her courageous comeback from 1-6 1-5 against the No 3 seed Gabriela Sabatini in the quarter-finals - a marvellous match in which Fernandez saved five match points and eventually won on her fifth after three hours and 36 minutes of energy-sapping effort - this was a commendable victory for the 21-year-old Floridian. The Spaniard held a 6-1 lifetime lead against her, but you would never have guessed it. Sanchez was the one who was nervous - perhaps because she has been putting pressure on herself by telling everyone what a great player she is. After failing to cope with the clever changes of pace from a thoughtful opponent, Arantxa's uppance had come with a vengeance. On the face of it today's final, worth Pounds 337,500 to the winner, will result in another easy win for Graf who has won 11 Grand Slam singles titles, including a Grand Slam in 1988. In the 10 previous meetings between them Fernandez won only one set. But that was in the most recent of those matches just three weeks ago in Berlin. That afternoon at the Rot-Weiss Club Fernandez won a 10-game opening set and then led 4-2 in the second before losing it 6-4. She broke serve twice to build a 3-0 lead in the decider, too, before losing the last six games. Graf remembers that occasion. 'Yes, it was a really long, tough match. And against Sabatini here she was going a lot for the lines and doing it very well . . . she really stepped into the ball. At the moment she shows a lot of confidence . . . she's definitely improved in the last half year. The key this time will probably be my patience and to come in at the right moments.' Patience is an elusive quality on the slow, red clay. The temptation to go for winners too soon has destroyed many fine players. But after two years of uncertainty Graf has looked admirably composed again here and, except for the odd patch of waywardness on her match-winning forehand, seems to be back to her best. After all, she has yet to lose a set and has dropped only 33 games in six matches, an average of 2.75 per set. And yet . . . and yet . . . Even the hottest favourites sometimes lose - and I apologise to those of you who backed Tenby on Wednesday for reopening so recent a wound. Harold Solomon is one who thinks that it may happen this afternoon. But, then, you would expect him to because Harold has been coaching Mary Joe for the past year and a half. He has done a fine job too, helping her to build her physique with regular gym sessions and track work when she has not been competing. Moreover - and this amuses me no end - Harold, has been teaching Mary Joe to volley. Harold was one of life's great baseline workhorses who could never have found the net even with a qualified guide and an armed guard. But he has improved that aspect of Mary Joe's game. Her unexpected volleying coups were partly responsible for her crushing victory over Sanchez. She smashed well, too, and even appeared to enjoy being in the forecourt. You could never have accused her of that during the Australian Open in January. 'I've seen a tremendous change in her these two weeks,' claims Harold. 'When we started working together I told her I thought it would take three years for her to overtake the top three and win a Grand Slam. I have just revised that view. I believe she's ready now. 'Clay has never been her favourite surface but suddenly she is attacking on it. The match against Sabatini was responsible for that. She was so far out of it that the only thing left was to have a swing. She's been banging that forehand ever since. 'We've watched that match several times on tape and it has transformed her belief. She has suddenly realised that she can beat any of the girls and that is what no-one can teach you. It has to come from within.' How true. I hope that yesterday Harold had the sense to sit Fernandez down beside the TV set to watch the replay of her win against Sanchez-Vicario. That would have reinforced belief marvellously. I hope Steffi was also wise enough to watch that tape to see just what she will be up against this afternoon. If she did she will know that only her best will be good enough. For the world No. 1 that should be no problem. And yet . . .</p>

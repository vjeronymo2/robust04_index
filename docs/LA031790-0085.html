			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SHUTTLE CANCELS BAY AREA FLIGHTS FOR A MONTH  </P> <P> More than 800 would-be air passengers were surprised to learn Friday that their  reservations on a shuttle flight from Oxnard to the Bay Area had been canceled.  </P> <P> California Air Shuttle had to cancel flights for the next 30 days because the  engine on one of the company's two 19-seat aircraft cannot be overhauled, said  Steve Lay, shuttle airline president.  </P> <P> "We're in the process of canceling 800 reservations" out of 1,300 for the next  month, Lay said. "It's not been a good day."  </P> <P> Lay said his company is expecting delivery of four new $3.4-million planes  within the next month and will resume service to the Bay Area after that.  </P> <P> Some passengers were reaccommodated on other airlines Friday, while others were  told that they would be refunded the amount of their tickets, Lay said.  </P> <P> Chris Bowen, a 43-year-old Oxnard resident, said he had been planning a visit  at the end of the month to San Francisco to see his new grandson. He said that,  although he will be reimbursed, he will probably have to pay $60 to $80 more  for a ticket on another airline.  </P> <P> The plane cannot be serviced because Fairchild Aircraft Co., a San  Antonio-based firm, recently went bankrupt, making it impossible for the small  Oxnard airline to obtain parts to service the engine, Lay said.  </P> <P> So, beginning Monday, the airline will not be able to operate four daily  flights to San Jose, Lay said.  </P> <P> Passengers on three weekend flights to San Jose are unaffected, Lay said, and  the shuttle service will still operate two daily and three weekend flights to  Las Vegas.  </P></p>

Will cost reduction be merely an illusion?    [Cavallo] Productive sectors must be patient. We managed to  get the Fiscal Pact signed and every province will now begin to  provide benefits to a growing number of industries. Within a  few months -- in all provinces -- the effect of reduced taxes  and contributions will fully reach agricultural, manufacturing,  mining, fishing, and construction industries. We hope tourism  will also be included, as will passenger and cargo  transportation.    [LA NACION] The official estimate foresees an annual  reduction in costs of 4 billion pesos. But when?    [Cavallo] We hope that by the middle of this year all  sectors  throughout the nation will fully enjoy tax and social security  benefits.    [LA NACION] Why do the provinces object to transferring  their  pension fund to the nation?    [Cavallo] Because there are strong interests around each  fund. Some want the privileged provincial retirement system to  continue. Some funds allow retirement at 45 on very high  pensions.    [LA NACION] Which provinces are they?    [Cavallo] Almost all. The provinces also have a very large  social security deficit. This averages at about 150 million  pesos per month.    [LA NACION] What will you do to stop unemployment from  growing?    [Cavallo] We have the intensive work program. The Ministries  of Labor, Education, and Economy are carrying out training  programs for our youth. This program will be intensified.    [LA NACION] Is unemployment the weak part of the plan?    [Cavallo] No, this plan is creating more jobs than what the  Argentine economy has created. During the six years of Raul  Alfonsin's administration 700,000 jobs were created while during  the four years of President Menem's government 1 million jobs  were created. What happened is like that which occurred in  Mexico and in Chile: A greater participation of women in the  labor demand.    [LA NACION] Will the social works system be deregulated?    [Cavallo] We will work with the ANSSAL [National Health  Insurance Administration], the Labor Ministry, the CGT [General  Confederation of Labor], and the unions on various fronts.  First we must reorganize social works to improve services.  Some union social works are very good but they can still be  improved. Others, however, are lost causes and should be  absorbed in an orderly process by the well managed social works.    The government is willing to pay off what it owes the social  works as a result of its intervention if the unions accept the  reorganization we propose.    Around the middle of this year we will also have a good  computer system installed at the pension fund administration  boards which will also help to put the social works in order.  Only then we can talk about a deregulation program.    [LA NACION] Will measures be implemented to encourage merges  and takeovers?    [Cavallo] Something like this is being done by the ANSSAL  but  I believe -- and this view is shared by the other ministers --  that we must intensify this task. This must be done through  dialogue with the union leaders; we are waiting for the  appropriate time to begin.    [LA NACION] What is the estimated trade deficit for this  year?    [Cavallo] I do not know if it is wise to estimate. It makes  sense to project a GDP growth of 6 to 7 percent or an inflation  of under 5 percent, but not to estimate the deficit of the trade  balance because this depends on the volume of capital. I do not  have a target for this. I believe it depends on the will to  invest.    [LA NACION] Does it not worry you that in the last few  months  the deficit is above all projections, including the projections  of the economic team?    [Cavallo] No, because there was no target. Figures were  prepared at the request of the IMF. The important thing is to  have growing exports. Last year's growth was 7 percent and this  year it will probably grow to between 10 and 12 percent. A  repeat of what happened under the Austral plan must be  prevented, when exports fell because there was greater  consumption and also in some way what happened to investments  within the context of relative prices and the organization of  the economy which completely discouraged investment.    What is happening with exports is very interesting: The  exports that are increasing most are those with greater added  value. This shows that an industrial reorganization is taking  place in Argentina. Products are being produced directly to be  sold abroad.    [LA NACION] Is this not happening because there is no room  on the domestic market: Some say consumption has reached  saturation point or is even declining?    [Cavallo] No. Consumption continued to grow last year at 4  to 5 percent, which is quite high. Of course, it is very good  that consumption grew less than the GDP because this means  domestic savings increased. Very few countries in the world  increase their consumption at 3 percent or more per year.    [LA NACION] Nevertheless, it seems that consumption has been  concentrated in a small segment of society while the great  majority are unable to fulfill their basic requirements.    [Cavallo] Consumption level and growth rate are very  different concepts. Some families still have a very low  consumption because we inherited a country in which for decades  there has been both stagnation and a constant worsening in the  distribution of income.    I admit that there still are segments of the population that  have low levels of consumption but, overall, everyone is  consuming more.    [LA NACION] Does the Menem-[Cordoba Governor] Angeloz pact  and the single voting ticket in Cordoba affect you?    [Cavallo] On the contrary, I am an economist; a single  ticket  enables us to save resources and efforts.    [LA NACION] Will you be a candidate for the Constituent  Assembly?    [Cavallo] If there had not been a single list I would have  considered it. In that case the Justicialist Party [PJ] should  join a common front with the UCeDe [Democratic Center Union].  But with a single ticket, it would be senseless.    [LA NACION] With a single ticket, how can you criticize  Angeloz during the campaign?    [Cavallo] I do not generally criticize Angeloz. I appreciate  him but I think Cordoba should speed up its economic  transformation, especially since it has a governor who, as a  candidate, has said he will continue everything Menem is doing  now.    As a Cordoba citizen I regret many things. I wonder why  those in Cordoba pay much more for electricity than those in  Buenos Aires; why do judges establish much higher fees for  lawyers and experts than in the Federal Capital; and why are  there still regulations on industry and commerce?    [LA NACION] Would you accompany Menem on the 1995 ticket?    [Cavallo] I have never considered it. I think the natural  ticket would be Menem-Duhalde but, if Duhalde wants to remain as  the governor of Buenos Aires Province, there are other top  leaders who could occupy that post; Ruben Marin, Ramon Ortega,  or Carlos Reutemann.    [LA NACION] If you ever become president, who would be your  economy minister?    [Cavallo] I do not like hypothetical cases, but any of my  secretaries or even under secretaries could be minister. There  are also very good economists in the UCR. When the most  important reforms had to be implemented, courage was as  necessary as technical capacity and a good team. Some people  say I am a fighter and that I sometimes shout, but I understand  that someone with my personality was necessary.    [LA NACION] Following the case of Aluar [Argentine Aluminum  Industrial and Commercial Corporation], are you not afraid of  more cases of salary cuts in companies with problems?    [Cavallo] Salary cuts will probably be applied where  salaries  have been increased beyond productivity. I hope higher salaries  will be cut first. I imagine Aluar first reduced the salaries  of its high ranking executives. Companies must realistically  face cuts in their costs. If salaries are higher than  productivity in some sectors it is better to cut salaries than  to stop production.    [LA NACION] Do you not think the salaries of many workers  are  low?    [Cavallo] Those salaries that are below the productivity  level will continue to increase. Our statistics year after year  reflect a sustained increase in real salaries.    [LA NACION] Many people would not agree.    [Cavallo] I think that the popular consumption level will  increase because very few people earn less than 400 or 500 pesos  per month. A few years ago many people did not even earn 200  pesos. In the Federal Capital even domestic employees earn 600  or 700 pesos.</p>

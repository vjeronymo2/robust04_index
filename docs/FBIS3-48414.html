They are to replace a fleet  of 20-year old Skyvans which have been gradually phased out.  MinDef [Ministry of Defense] said the Fokker-50s are capable of  carrying a heavy load and flying longer non-stop distances.  They will also be modified to extend flying time and fuel  endurance by an additional four hours. The new aircraft were  unveiled at Changi airbase today during a visit of the Acting  Prime Minister and Defense Minister Dr Yeo Ning Hong to the  Changi airbase. It is a part of his regular visit to the SAF  units.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Garofano agrees to extradition to Italy MR Giuseppe Garofano, the former senior executive of Italy's troubled Ferruzzi group arrested in Geneva this week, yesterday agreed to his extradition to Italy, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. 72 hours. Mr Garofano, in hiding for the past five months, has been sought in connection with a L250m (Pounds 107,000) political contribution to the Christian Democrat party. Mr Garofano claims the money was a personal gift, but magistrates investigating political corruption issued an international arrest warrant on suspicion it came from Ferruzzi. Italy's Consob stock market and companies watchdog this week took legal action over alleged irregularities in the accounts of Ferruzzi and Montedison, its main operating subsidiary. Mr Garofano was Montedison's managing director for a number of years and also held senior positions in Ferruzzi. A Naples judge has authorised sequestration of expensive paintings, silver and jewellery given by a leading drugs company executive to Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, the former health minister. According to leaked testimony, Mr Giampaolo Zambeletti, the executive, regularly gave gifts, totalling about L300m, to Mr De Lorenzo, and Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino, a senior Christian Democrat ex-minister, and their families. Electoral reform crusader Mario Segni launched a new Italian centrist party yesterday to take on the powerful Northern League at national elections expected early next year, Reuter reports from Rome. Alleanza Democratica (Democratic Alliance) groups breakaway elements of the beleaguered Italian Socialist party (PSI) plus the small Republican and Green parties.</p>

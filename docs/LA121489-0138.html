			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL TOWN SENDING 1,000 PORK PIES TO LONDON'S HUNGRY  </P> <P> Butchers in a small English town are baking 1,000 pork pies as a Christmas  present for the homeless who sleep on the streets of London.  </P> <P> The butchers of Malton will also be commemorating the northern town's gift  almost 150 years ago of a huge pie to novelist Charles Dickens.  </P> <P> Dickens was author of "A Christmas Carol," which has come to symbolize the  charitable spirit of the season. He shared his pie with the capital's poor,  whose plight he documented in many of his other classics.  </P> <P> This year's pies will be given to the Salvation Army for distribution.  </P></p>

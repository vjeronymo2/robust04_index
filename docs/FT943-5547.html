			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / US discloses air safety bans The US has barred aircraft from nine countries in Africa and Latin America from landing at US airports because it found their governments' supervision of air safety inadequate. Mr Federico Pena, the transportation secretary, said aircraft from Belize, the Dominican Republic, Gambia, Ghana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay and Zaire were banned, while aircraft from Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala and the Dutch Antilles had only conditional approval. Some of the banned countries have dropped air links with the US, while others have had to lease aircraft from other countries. The ban has been in place for some time but Mr Pena released the list only yesterday, after pressure from consumer groups to make the information available to travellers. Some countries, including Russia and Nigeria, have yet to be assessed.</p>

Doing things one way today and  another way tomorrow, and all with equal ease. No, things do not  work that way. And somewhere in my subconscious mind I knew in  advance the kind of answer I would get to the question about  changes in the economics of sovkhozes and kolkhozes since  privatization that I posed to the Akmolinsk Oblast Agricultural  Administration.    "You ask what has changed?" said V. K. Ilyashchenko, head of  the oblast agricultural administration's Economics and Planning  Department, a slight trace of irony in his voice. "Actually  nothing, or at least not so far. There are many reasons for  that. Of course, on the one hand only a short time has passed  since the beginning of privatization; a majority of farms came  under new types of ownership at the end of last year. But that  is probably not the most important factor at all, but rather the  fact that becoming an owner on paper is one thing, and actually  becoming one, having the sense of being an owner, is something  else altogether. It is the latter that we still lack. So trends  in the development of privatized and non-privatized farms by and  large do not differ at all."    Owner... That sounds good, but... What point is there in  being an owner without freedom and independence, freedom to  produce, freedom to set prices, freedom to sell one's produce,  and independence from the dictates of bureaucrats? Our prices  are still set by the state, and the state continues to issue  state procurement quotas to farms for three years. Nor does our  private owner have the right in most cases to sell what he  produces without instructions from higher up.    Judging by what Vladimir Kuzmich said, the idea of  privatization meets with various kinds of reception from the  oblast's agricultural enterprises. Relatively large and smoothly  functioning farms have generally greeted the idea of ownership  with enthusiasm, while it proved necessary to force most  unprofitable farms in the direction of happiness, in compliance  with the president's edict. Later, when amendments were made to  the edict, privatization proceeded at a more restrained pace.  And still no one knows when 123 out of 152 farms in the oblast  will decide whether to become property owners or not. Rural  residents are not prepared to make that decision, because for  many people privatization is terra incognita. "The  state just wants to divide us." "Why privatize, when everything  is fine the way it is?" "Who needs dividends, which we don't  know when we'll ever see -- wages are more dependable!" These  are some of the opinions heard from members of labor collectives  whenever the topic of conversation turns to changes in the form  of ownership. And there has been so much trouble stemming from  incompetence even after privatization: it seems that just as  soon as the final documents are filed with the state property  committee someone is already wanting to split off, someone else  is being thrown out, and claims are being filed against someone  else -- just look at the kind of owners we have become!  Naturally this approach to understanding a sense of ownership  troubles the staff of the oblast agricultural administration,  just as they are troubled by the possible view that will be  taken of certain types of agricultural production by the future  owners.    "Naturally any farmer is interested only in growing crops  that yield a profit," muses V. K. Ilyashchenko. "But what about  livestock farming, which is currently unprofitable? It is not  likely that all property owners will behave in a civic-minded  way, and some might, chasing after profits, stop raising  livestock altogether, and then we might find ourselves with no  meat."    The state should start deciding now what it should do in  this  situation: either order farmers to keep on raising livestock  (but then what kind of sense of ownership could they have?), or  provide meat producers with very large subsidies. Incidentally,  those who think that only the socialist world has subsidized  farmers are wrong. Even such major industrial powers as the  United States and Canada provide very substantial support to  their farmers.    All right then, we should help those who operate at a loss  through no fault of their own and no matter what they do, but  what about owners who simply do not want to work the way they  should? During a recent visit to the virgin lands President  Nazarbayev stated quite firmly that there should be no  unprofitable farms in our state, and that they should be  completely dissolved and sold on the auction block to thriftier  farms or to industrial enterprises.    The oblast agricultural administration supports this idea,  but at this point does not really have a clear perception of how  the process would actually work.    "Well, people are going to say 'we have already had  something  like that' -- for example, we did dissolve one unprofitable  farm. It was combined with another farm, a larger one. As a  result the first farm's operations did not improve, and a  once-strong farm got weaker. As for the sale of unprofitable  farms to enterprises, we do not know whether there will be many  industrialists interested in acquiring a burden like that: the  capital investment required is huge, and no one knows when the  profits will come, or whether they will come at all."    Many property owners presently bear a grudge against the  state, and their reasoning goes somewhat like this: When tenant  farms were established, they got all kinds of breaks, like  lending on favorable terms, and funding. But we run into  obstacles everywhere we go, and we cannot even get loans very  easily -- we have to put up collateral that is worth some  dollars!    Incidentally, not everything about privatization is bad, nor  is it bad everywhere. Recently the oblast has seen the process  of stock issuance by producers with processing enterprises  occurring at quite a rapid rate. On many privatized farms people  have realized that now they really must tighten their belts for  a time and put their profits back into production. Various  processing facilities and enterprises for the manufacture of  consumer goods have sprung up on farms like mushrooms after a  rain.    Generally speaking, the market economy is beginning to come  into its own in rural areas as well. But when will it finally  take off? The answer to that question depends on many factors.  Perhaps the most important of these is that when we accept  privatization in our heads and not just on paper, then we can  hope for success.</p>

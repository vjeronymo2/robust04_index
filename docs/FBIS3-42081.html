Nuclear  Industries of Brazil [INB], which in 1988 replaced Nuclebras and  lost some of its original functions, is dismantling three  subsidiaries: the Brazilian Uranium Co., Nuclemon Mining and  Chemicals Ltd., and Nuclei [Nuclebras Isotope Enrichment, Inc.].    INB President Roberto da Franca on 26 January said: "We are  readjusting the industry to its real needs." He added that by  transforming the three subsidiaries into departments, the  company will save $1.27 million per year. The number of INB  board members (directors and advisers) will decrease from 43 to  14, while the the number of management employees will decrease  from 83 to 56.    The Nuclebras system was created in 1975, one year after the  Brazilian-German Agreement was signed to support the activities  of eight nuclear plants. So far, Brazil has only one plant,  Angra-1, which was not a result of the agreement signed with the  Germans and normally operates at half its capacity. In addition  to that, the completion of Angra-2's construction is not  entirely ensured. Angra-2 will be the first plant to use German  technology (Angra-1 was negotiated with U.S. Westinghouse). As a  result, the overall system has no clients for its products:  uranium, enriched uranium, and fuel elements.    Activities linked to the nuclear program have been  decreasing  slowly although the idea to build eight nuclear plants was  discarded a long time ago. In 1986, two years before being  transformed into the INB, Nuclebras and its subsidiaries had  almost 6,000 employees. Currently there are 1,200. This number  probably will decrease as a result of the changes being  implemented by the INB. So far, Franca has not mentioned  dismissals. He prefers to talk about reappointment, particularly  in the experts' area, through accords being signed with Furnas  [Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc.] and the National Nuclear  Energy Commission (CNEN), to which the INB is linked.    Originally, Nuclebras worked with the following  subsidiaries:  Nuclemon [Nuclebras Monazite and Associated Elements, Ltd.]  (monazite sand exploitation), Nuclam [Nuclebras Mining  Assistance, Inc.] (uranium prospecting), Nuclen [Nuclebras  Engineering, Inc.] (nuclear plant engineering), Nucom [Nuclebras  Nuclear Plant Construction, Inc.] (nuclear plants construction),  Nuclep [Nuclebras Heavy Equipment, Inc.] (nuclear plants heavy  equipment), and Nuclei (uranium enrichment). Nuclebras also was  linked to the Fuel Elements Plant (FEC).    Currently, Nuclen belongs to Eletrobras [Brazilian Electric  Power Company, Inc.] and Nuclep has been included in the  privatization program. Nuclam and Nucom already have been  dismantled and will be followed by Nuclemon, Uranium of Brazil  (which was established together with the INB), and Nuclei.  According to Franca, the overall complex will now operate with a  president and four directors.    Nuclei, which was built in Resende to enrich uranium through  the jet nozzle process, was not successful. Franca added that  the Brazilian Government has chosen to adopt the  ultracentrifugation process developed by the Navy Special  Projects Coordinating Board (Copesp). This is why the company is  being dismantled and the personnel being absorbed by the INB.    Uranium of Brazil, which was established to produce uranium  and its concentrate, was out of operation for four years due to  lack of demand on the domestic and international markets. The  product could not be exported in view of its very low price.  Nearly $8 million would have to be invested in Nuclemon to make  the installation of a chemical plant to extract chloride [not  further identified] from rare types of sands feasible.  <H5>  Waiting for Angra-2 </H5>   The INB has a $40 million yearly budget resulting from the  sale to Furnas, which operates Angra-1, of fuel produced in its  Resende plant. With these resources, the company covers 50  percent of its expenses. The rest is supplied by the central  government.    Franca believes that when Angra-2 goes into operation the  company will have the required conditions to become  self-sufficient because then it will have one more customer for  its fuel element. "Angra-2 is vital to the INB complex because  it will ensure that uranium exploitation will continue, the FEC  remains in operation, and we will achieve more technological  knowledge," Franca said.    INB investments for 1994 are not very significant: Franca  plans to have from $2 million to $3 million to invest in new  machinery for the FEC and to adapt Nuclei (where the process of  enriching uranium through a jet nozzle was developed) for the  production of pills [pastilhas], which are a component of the  fuel element. Currently, these pills are only produced abroad.    There are more ambitious plans: to sell FEC components to  Siemens (German) reactors, which must be qualified abroad; to  rent Uranium of Brazil facilities to the private sector; and  several other initiatives.</p>

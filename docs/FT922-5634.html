			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Banks abandon Canary Wharf: O&amp;Y project may face liquidation  -Creditors advance only Pounds 10m until year-end GOVERNMENT hopes to re-generate London's docklands received a potentially lethal blow yesterday when Canary Wharf, the area's flagship development, went into administration under UK insolvency procedures. Mr Steve Miller, financial adviser to Olympia &amp; York, said the administration order was a 'serious setback' in the attempt to organise a financial reconstruction of Canary Wharf's owner, Olympia &amp; York Developments, the world's biggest property developer. The administrators, three partners from the accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young, hope Canary Wharf can re-emerge after several months in administration as a going concern. But they have received only Pounds 10m from banks to cover all the project's costs until the end of the year. Some bankers warned that liquidation was a strong possibility. It also emerged that the Bank of England has been acting as a messenger between Canary Wharf's 11 leading bank creditors and the government, which is interested in taking space at Canary Wharf but has been refusing to make a firm commitment to do so. The Bank did all it could to keep the project out of administration, short of putting overt pressure on the banks. But at 4pm on Wednesday the 11 banks told O&amp;Y that an insolvency filing was the only option. The banks had rejected three 'scenarios' - code-named Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty - to maintain the project as a going concern. The government yesterday reiterated that civil servants would only move to Canary Wharf on commercial terms and that there would be no official bail-out. However, it is understood that Lord Wakeham, the Lord Privy Seal, who has been appointed by the prime minister to co-ordinate all government negotiations with Canary Wharf, has called an emergency meeting for early next week of several cabinet ministers whose departments may move to Canary Wharf. With only Pounds 10m of new money, the administrators, who have taken control of the project, will have to raise capital from new investors to complete vital work on the project. Canary Wharf executives disclosed yesterday that they had been in talks with potential investors for three months. One possible investor is the government of Singapore's Investment Office. However, the likelihood that the Jubilee underground line will be extended into east London is now small. Bankers stressed there was no possibility that they would pay the government the Pounds 400m which Canary Wharf had promised as its contribution to the cost of the extension. Mr Stephen Adamson, one of three joint administrators, said he would look at the option of finding finance for the Jubilee extension, but he could 'not be more positive than that'. He said Canary Wharf 'could survive without the Jubilee Line'. All creditors' claims on the project have been frozen under the administration order. The group of creditors owed the most are banks, which have lent Canary Wharf around Pounds 1.2bn. Mr Miller, a partner of investment bank James D. Wolfensohn, said builders of the project were owed comparatively little. Another significant group of creditors comprises current Canary Wharf tenants who were persuaded to take space in the dockland development by O&amp;Y taking over their leases elsewhere. The cost to Canary Wharf of paying the rent on these leases - including some for tenants supposed to move in later this year - is Pounds 25m a year. These costs are now likely to revert to the tenants. Some prospective tenants, including American Express, the big US financial company, and Texaco, the US oil company, are now expected to review their plans to move to Canary Wharf. The American Express building at Canary Wharf is only 85 per cent finished. Bankers admitted there was a doubt about whether the administrators would have the funds to finish the building. If it remains unfinished, there is little chance of American Express ever occupying the building. Any sharp drop in the forecast occupancy rate at Canary Wharf would seriously reduce the likelihood that the project can emerge from administration as a going concern. If administration becomes liquidation - and Mr Adamson admitted there was a risk of that - the effect on the property market in the adjacent area would be devastating. It would also mean that losses faced by banks, which include Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, National Bank of Canada; Commerzbank from Germany, Credit Lyonnais of France, Credit Suisse of Switzerland, Citibank from the US and Barclays and its UK rival Lloyds, would probably exceed the Pounds 600m they currently project. Yesterday a war of words erupted between the banks. Four banks, Credit Suisse of Switzerland, Citibank, Credit Lyonnais and Kansallis-Osake Pankki of Finland, had been in favour of providing Canary Wharf with Pounds 500m of new money to keep it going. One of these accused other banks, which voted in favour of administration, of being 'unsophisticated' and 'short-sighted'. Banks' exposure comprises a core loan of Pounds 566m to Canary Wharf, a finance lease of Pounds 58m which is guaranteed by Barclays, a separate Pounds 450m loan from four Canadian banks and Pounds 100m from the European Investment Bank.

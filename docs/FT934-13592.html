			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Acas to charge for some services ACAS, the independent advisory conciliation and arbitration service, announced yesterday it would charge clients from April next year for conferences, seminars, self-help 'clinics' for small businesses and some of its advisory publications. However it said there were 'no plans to charge for any other Acas activity as to do so would compromise Acas's impartial and independent approach'. It added that the charges were to cover costs, not to make a profit. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, has powers under the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act that became law in the summer to instruct Acas to charge for any of its collective conciliation, arbitration and advisory activities although Acas has expressed strong opposition to this. Yesterday Acas was also anxious to reassure unions and employers that the alteration to its statutory terms of reference in the act, which dropped any commitment to the encouragement of collective bargaining, did not mean the organisation was abandoning one of its primary purposes. In a leaflet promoting improvement in industrial relations, Acas says: 'Recent legislative changes to its terms of reference do not affect the availability of Acas advice and conciliation on employment and workplace issues, including collective bargaining and trade union recognition.' Established in 1974, Acas is one of Britain's few remaining tripartite bodies, which as well as government appointments has representatives from the TUC and employer organisations.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PETE ROSE WON'T FIGHT RELEASE OF BETTING SLIPS;  </P> <P> LAWYER SAYS REDS MANAGER DIDN'T WRITE WAGER SHEETS; TEAM ASKS TO BE DISMISSED  FROM SUIT  </P> <P> An attorney for Pete Rose said today he will not object if a federal judge  orders the FBI to release betting sheets allegedly written by Rose as well as  the Cincinnati Reds manager's fingerprint records.  </P> <P> Lawyers for baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti asked U.S. District Judge John  Holschuh to release the records Thursday. Federal privacy laws require Holschuh  to order their release, the motion said.  </P> <P> The FBI in Cincinnati has the documents, and the bureau has no objection to  their release, the motion said.  </P> <P> Rose has said he did not bet on the Reds or write the betting slips.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wants Originals Released  </P> <P> Robert Stachler, Rose's attorney, said he wants the originals released.  </P> <P> "We won't object. We've been trying to get them all along," Stachler said in a  telephone interview from his Cincinnati office.  </P> <P> Paul Janszen, a former friend of Rose who says he ran bets for the Reds  manager, has said he took the sheets from Rose's home. A handwriting expert  hired by baseball concluded they that are in Rose's handwriting.  </P> <P> The commissioner wants the sheets to see if Rose's fingerprints are on the  originals.  </P> <P> Also on Thursday, the Reds asked the judge to dismiss the club as co-defendant  in Rose's suit against Giamatti. It was the club's first formal response to  Rose's two-month search for an injunction against Giamatti, who wants to hold a  disciplinary hearing concerning Rose's gambling.  </P> <P> Rose's suit contends that Giamatti is biased and cannot guarantee him a fair  hearing.  </P> <P> The motion by the Reds relied in part on a paragraph in Rose's complaint that  said he "alleges no wrongful conduct" by the club.  </P> <P> Reds attorney Robert C. Martin said given that and the tradition of allowing  baseball to handle its own affairs, no court has jurisdiction.  </P> <P> "It's just our feeling that . . . major league baseball has done a good job  policing itself for the last 70 years, and I believe it should still be allowed  to do so," Martin said today.  </P> <P> Giamatti wants to start disciplinary proceedings Thursday. Rose wants a second  postponement of the hearing because Stachler is trying to get a federal appeals  court to take the case away from Holschuh and return it to a state court in  Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Holschuh has set a hearing Monday to determine whether protection against  disciplinary action should be extended. A restraining order that prohibits Rose  from being fired or from being disciplined by baseball expires Monday.  </P> <P> If Holschuh insists on Monday's hearing, Rose would have until 5 p.m. today to  seek an emergency stay from the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in  Cincinnati.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Position Reiterated  </P> <P> Stachler today filed a motion reiterating his position that Giamatti should not  conduct the disciplinary hearing. The filing was in response to a motion filed  Wednesday by baseball's attorneys, who asked Holschuh to permit Giamatti to  proceed with the hearing.  </P> <P> "Logic and fairness dictate that Pete Rose should be protected from the harm  which will inexorably follow a hearing by this commissioner, and further that  (Rose) be afforded a meaningful opportunity for review of the issue of federal  jurisdiction," Stachler said in the motion.  </P></p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Germans to vote on strikes as pay talks break down THE PROSPECT of industrial strife in west Germany loomed yesterday as pay talks in the steel and banking industries broke down and unions prepared for strike ballots. Mr Peter Ulrich Schmithals, the steel employers' chief negotiator, said yesterday after 14 hours of fruitless pay talks with union leaders: 'That was definitely our last negotiating attempt.' Both sides, deadlocked over a 1 percentage point difference, refused to call in independent arbitrators. Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed again for moderate settlements. Forecasts had shown some weakening in economic growth, but, he added: 'I see no recessionary tendencies - provided wage settlements are reasonable.' Steel unions have offered to reduce their claim of 10.5 per cent to around 6.5 per cent. However, Mr Ekkehard Schulz, chairman of Thyssen Stahl, which employs a third of all the country's steelworkers, said recently that he would rather face a strike than pay more than 6 per cent. The 100,000 members of the steel section of the IG Metall union will start a strike ballot on Sunday evening. The result will be known by Friday. A 75 per cent majority is needed for the industry's 135,000 workers to be called out on strike. Union leaders said they had the resources to hold out for a long time. However, the outcome of the vote is uncertain because job security has become a real issue. The steel industry is in the throes of hefty rationalisation. Thyssen Stahl, for example, last week reported a 42 per cent profits slump for 1991, and warned of heavy job losses. Observers said that market conditions and heavy stocks meant companies could weather a short stoppage. There were early warnings of more stress to come as union leaders representing 360,000 engineering workers in the state of Hesse agreed to put in a claim for 9.5 per cent. This is likely to set the pattern for other regional branches of the IG Metall engineering section, which claims to have almost 4m members in the country's manufacturing sector. This, too, is suffering from the effects of the economic slowdown. The 3m-strong OTV public service union, demanding a 10 per cent pay increase, has indicated its willingness to strike. The white-collar HBV and DAG unions, representing most of west Germany's 430,000 bank and insurance workers, broke off negotiations yesterday and said members would be balloted 'soon' on strike action. They have sought a 10.5 per cent rise, and been offered less than 5 per cent. The roots of the tension in the labour market lie mainly in the stresses caused by the costs of unification of Germany in October 1990.</p>

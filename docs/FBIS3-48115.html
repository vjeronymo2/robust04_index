Bentsen "seemed to be placing heavy weight on  the framework talks," said Takatoshi Kato, director of the  ministry's international finance bureau, briefing reporters  after a one-hour meeting between Fujii and Bentsen.    But, Kato stressed that "no specific requests" were made by  Bentsen, including any reference to "numerical targets," and the  two sides just "confirmed commitments for further progress" to  make the February 11 Japan-U.S. summit in Washington  "successful."    Fujii, speaking to reporters as he left the meeting, said he  and Bentsen agreed to try to conclude bilateral talks in time.    On Japan's economy, Fujii said he told Bentsen that Japan is  trying to take steps to boost the economy, despite the turmoil  in the wake of the upper house's rejection Friday of the  government-proposed political reform bills. "Please trust us,"  he said to Bentsen.    The two leaders did not discuss specifics of planned  Japanese  economic-stimulus measures, such as a much-discussed income tax  cut, Fujii noted of the meeting, also attended by Ambassador  Walter Mondale and Lawrence Summers, Treasury undersecretary for  international affairs.    Bentsen and Summers declined comment as they left. Bentsen  said he will comment at a news conference after he meets Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at 4 P.M.    Fujii vowed "serious and vigorous efforts" to launch a  new stimulus package including tax cuts, and explained that a  joint economic forum of the government and coalition parties  will continue discussing tax issues to come up with an  "acceptable decision," Kato said.    Bentsen expressed "hopes on contributions to spur domestic  demand," Kato said.    On the upper house's failure to pass the political reform  bills, Fujii sought support for Japan placing priority on the  measures by explaining the latest surveys showed public support  for reform and that Japan intends to focus on reviving the bills  for passage over the next week before the current Diet session  closes on Saturday, Kato said.    Referring to reported possible postponement of the  Hosokawa-Clinton talks, Kato stressed that the financial leaders  based their talks on the February 11 summit as scheduled.    Fujii and Bentsen also reconfirmed their cooperation for a  "successful" meeting of finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum slated for March 18 and 19 in  Hawaii, Kato said, noting they did not discuss specifics.    The two leaders also agreed on further support toward Russia  and its reform, he said. No new support measures were  discussed, but Bentsen voiced concern over the recent cabinet  reshuffle there, Kato said.    Bentsen stopped over in Tokyo on his way back home from  Russian and Asian tours and had requested the meetings with  Fujii and Hosokawa.    The meetings came during a crucial time for the Japanese  Government which failed to pass the political reform bills  through the upper house and attention is fixed on what Japan  will offer to the U.S.</p>

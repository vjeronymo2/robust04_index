			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Recs strong by far the biggest rise in the recs' interim reporting season to date - took the market by surprise and saw the group's shares hoisted to a record 655p at the outset of trading. Even the most optimistic analysts had been expecting an increase of nearer 20 per cent. However, the accompanying statement with the figures said that the company is rebalancing its interim and final dividends, shifting from 30 per cent and 70 per cent to a one-third/two-thirds ratio. This took the early shine off the shares and they slipped back to close unchanged on the session at 644p. London is the latest among a number of the electricity companies seeking to rebalance their dividend payments. Last week Eastern, Midlands and East Midlands all announced dividend rises in the region of 20 per cent. Other electricity shares mostly moved similarly to London, making rapid progress at the outset before slipping back. Midlands was an exception, touching a peak 695p, before closing 5 ahead at 694p. Northern Ireland Electricity, the best performing stock among the utilities last week when the shares jumped 18.5 per cent, added 7 at 257p. Southern Electricity, due to report this morning, is expected to boost its interim by at least 20 per cent. The stock finished 4 cheaper at 672p. Southern Water, also reporting this morning and expected to increase its interim by a much more sedate 8.4 per cent to 7.7p, appreciated 11 to 648p. This mirrored general switching operations by the institutions, out of the recs and into the recently underperforming water issues. The latter were also boosted by news that the European Commission is diluting its directives on moves on water quality and waste water treatment. Glaxo bucked the market trend as confirmation of a joint marketing agreement was seen as paving the way for a batch of good news over Christmas. The shares rose 4 to 686p. The pharmaceuticals group released anticipated news that it had formed a joint venture with Warner-Lambert, of the US, to develop and sell over-the-counter versions of Glaxo drugs, particularly Zantac, its ulcer treatment and biggest seller. The company is also expected to be the main beneficiary of the traditional end-of year approvals for drugs by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Analysts expect the FDA to approve a tablet form of Glaxo's migraine drug Imigran (known as Imitrex in the US) as well as Serevent, its asthma drug. Goldman Sachs forecasts Imigran sales will hit Pounds 750m by 1997 from Pounds 116m in the year to June 1993. Bank shares, among the market's best performers last week, suffered from general lack of interest and sporadic bouts of profit-taking for much of the session, but picked up well in the last half-hour. TSB was outstanding, the shares approaching their all-time high and eventually standing a net 5 up at 248p on 5.1m traded. Insurance issues featured in the day's big programme trade. Royal moved up 5 to 323p, although there were hints of possible end-of-year window dressing in the shares. Housebuilder Berkeley Group raced up 20 to a year's high of 480p as the market registered its approval of a sparkling set of interim figures. SmithKline Beecham clawed back from earlier weakness on news that the Department of Health had granted it a licence to market Famvir, a new anti-viral compound for treating herpes. The shares ended unchanged at 375p. Meanwhile, Wellcome rebounded from a big fall on Friday, The stock gained 12 at 639p, with some investors squaring positions ahead of the company's annual meeting on Thursday. BZW was said to have recommended the stock. Chemicals company Croda International receded 5 to 338p as Hoare Govett downgraded from a buy and recommended taking profits. NatWest Securities was largely responsible for driving the recently depressed oil sector sharply better. The broker said oil share prices already discount unsustainably low oil prices, especially BP, which it said 'now discounts an unrealistically pessimistic long term oil price of around Dollars 14'. BP shares moved up 9 to 324p. Dull results from Greene King saw the shares retreat 15 to 553p and prompted a series of downgrades from drinks analysts. Most pulled their full-year forecasts back to the Pounds 21m level, a decrease of around 8 per cent. They also said that the group's struggle to defend its market share was likely to put a renewed bid for Morland - in which it still retains a 29 per cent holding - off the agenda. Morland shares reflected this, slipping back 5 to 538p. There was strong buying of Eurotunnel shares ahead of its egm tomorrow to approve its Pounds 500m one-for-three rights issue. The Channel tunnel operator has been enjoying a boost to sentiment since its official opening last week. The shares jumped 33 to 509p in heavy London trade of nearly 500,000. The stock was the best performer on the Paris bourse. MARKET REPORTERS: Christopher Price, Peter John, Steve Thompson. Other statistics, Page 28</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Fokker wins order from China FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft maker, announced a sales breakthrough in China yesterday hours before the Netherlands government bowed to pressure from Beijing and blocked the export of Dutch-built submarines to Taiwan, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. Fokker said it had won an order to supply seven 100-seater Fokker 100s to the regional airline, China Eastern, and that it expected to win further Chinese orders. Fokker, which has never before sold aircraft to China, said negotiations had been taking place on and off for five years. However, it is clear the deal would not have gone ahead if the Dutch government had not blocked shipbuilder Rotterdam Droogdok Maatschappij from accepting a Fl 2.5bn Taiwanese order for four submarines.</p>

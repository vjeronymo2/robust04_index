			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Limits on gifts IS IT possible for a parent to gift each child Pounds 3,000 pa without future inheritance tax liability, or is a parent restricted to gifting a total of Pounds 3,000 pa. The Pounds 3,000 annual exemption is restricted to Pounds 3,000 for each donor (plus any unused element of the previous year's exemption - but not more than one year is available). If you make gifts to several people the total of all gifts should not exceed Pounds 3,000: see section 19 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

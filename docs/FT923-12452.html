			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Valuing shares for CGT MY WIFE died on November 25 1991 and left me her portfolio. For CGT purposes, are the shares valued at cost or are they valued on the day I received them (November 28)? They are valued at November 28 1991, on the quarter-up basis. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR 45 (What happens when someone dies). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Letter: Banking - selective advertising and setting traps (2) Sir, Re your article 'Barclays sets a trap for fraudsters' (March 27/28), the Royal Bank of Scotland is currently reporting zero fraud rates after testing the use of photographs on cheque cards for 18 months. Barclays states that its preferred method of fraud prevention is technological developments at the point of sale, to enable higher proportions of transactions to be authorised. The problem for retailers is that they have to bear the cost of on-line units - up to Pounds 300 a year each. The photo-card solution is effective and could be implemented faster than authorisation of 50 per cent of transactions by 1996.

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Observer: End of the line at Bibby? Sir Derek Bibby, chairman of Britain's oldest independent deep sea shipping company, has not made the same mistake as his ancestors. Whereas the first five chairmen died in harness, and his father was 80 before he could be persuaded to let go, Sir Derek has handed over the helm at a youthful 70. Admittedly, fellow baronet Sir Richard Baker Wilbraham - the new chairman - may only be keeping the seat warm until Sir Derek's son, young Mr Michael, can take over. However, the introduction of a non-family member as chairman marks a significant break for one of Britain's more buccaneering ship-owners. Having nearly gone bust in the mid-1970s, Bibby Line has reduced its exposure to deep sea shipping by investing in such off-beat areas as floating prisons and refugee ships in Manhattan and Hamburg. But at least it is still afloat which is more than can be said for most of Liverpool's once famous shipping companies . . . Meanwhile, Sir Derek will remain honorary president, and a fountain of useful advice. Among his many tips (published in a recent booklet for the Birkenhead Boys' Club), the one Observer liked best was: 'If you move into a parish where you are expected to take on the role of the local squire, it is more important to have the church's roof surveyed than that of your own house as the former may cost you much more.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe by NTV </F> Chief Editor Peter Staisch; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Staisch] Mr. Ruehe, it has never been easy to  be defense minister for anyone who has held this office before,  but for you it is particularly difficult because undeniably  there is a kind of identity crisis in the Armed Forces.    [Ruehe] It is not easy, but it is a good task. In  particular, concerning our identity, we have made great  progress. Two years ago there was not a single Bundeswehr  soldier in Cambodia, in Somalia, in the Adriatic, or on the  aircraft that fly to Sarajevo. This means that today the  Bundeswehr is fulfilling new tasks, it is psychologically  strengthened. Its identity is also strengthened in national  defense, defense of the alliance as well as new international  tasks. What is lacking again and again is money. Things have  been very unpredictable regarding our funds. They have become  less and less, and this has upset our plans again and again.  [passage omitted]    [Staisch] If in the future we approach similar peacekeeping  and peacemaking projects, what else is the United Nations to do  if it cannot provide the framework, if the supraglobal  structures are actually the decisive factor?    [Ruehe] Yes, the United Nations can do a great deal. For  example, Cambodia was a greater success, but the United Nations  did not go there until after there was a peace treaty.  Moreover, it has to be said that if the groups concerned do not  want peace, then the United Nations will be unable to help  either. That is, the will of those involved to achieve peace is  decisive. If two countries or groups come and say we want  peace, but we need someone to help us because we haven't the  confidence, then the United Nations can help. But in Yugoslavia,  for example, it can also be seen that when hatred prevails, when  peace is not really wanted, the UN scope comes to an end. Then  one can give humanitarian aid, but not really solve a conflict.    [Staisch] Could it be the case that the United Nations has  simply been overestimated as a result of the events during the  Gulf War in 1990-91, because it worked there somehow, as a  result of the American mediation.    [Ruehe] That was a very different situation. In  organizational terms, that was completely in the hands of the  Americans, on behalf of the United Nations, so to speak, whereas  in Somalia we had what is at present an international army,  which has been put together without a really unified command and  without knowing who would really come and at what time. It is  therefore not comparable. In Yugoslavia, there is of course the  combination of civil war and conflict between states. That is a  very different situation from that in the context of Kuwait and  Iraq. But it may indeed be that there were illusions about what  the United Nations could achieve because of what was experienced  at that time. The United Nations has a very important task in  the future, but, as I said, there must be a close examination of  where it is being overstretched and what path should be taken --  I have hinted at one, the way things are done in Europe -- so as  to solve conflicts with the United Nations. [passage omitted]    [Staisch] Minister, taking action in Bosnia-Herzegovina if  the United Nations wants it: If the roof of the world, so to  speak, gives its blessing, NATO can intervene. What is the  German role in particular? What can we, the Germans, do in that  region, bearing in mind our historical legacy?    [Ruehe] I have always said that German soldiers out there  would be a part of the problem and not part of a solution. We  want to solve problems. The international community understands  this. The past is still with us. However, we do fly to  Sarajevo every day. The soldiers risk their lives. Our planes  have been hit, have been shot at several times. We fly three  aircraft to Bosnia every night to supply the population with  medicine and food. This German contribution is generally  recognized. We take the same risks as others -- this is new.  There have been specific threats against German aircraft from  the Serb side and we have always gone when the others have,  despite the dangers. I am very proud of what the Air Force has  achieved there. [passage omitted]    [Staisch] We have looked in different ways at the  Bundeswehr's new international role. At home, the money is  becoming tighter and tighter. SPD [Social Democratic Party]  Secretary General Werner Hoyer has accused you and all those  responsible of having no concept for the future. You must save  another 1.25 billion German marks [DM]. The Mauser company is  complaining about a drop in orders. [passage omitted] If you  take all this together, what is justified criticism, and when do  you say it is exaggerated?    [Ruehe] Well, one cannot see things as simply as Mr. Hoyer  does. One needs financial plans, only then can one make plans  for the Bundeswehr. We have had to throw the plans for the  Bundeswehr into the trash can twice because there were changes  on the financial side. My most important concern has been to  secure firm pledges for the Bundeswehr for several years in  order to be able to plan things. This has now been disrupted  again and that is why this hit us very hard. The pain barrier  has been surpassed.    The Bundeswehr is underfunded and that means, in its current  size, its structure cannot be maintained with the funds  available. Therefore, I have said I will now propose strategic  plans for development over the next few years, independent of  the fact that this year we will have to make tough savings in  all areas. In doing this I cannot orient myself by the needs of  enterprises, I must ask myself what is absolutely necessary from  a military point of view, I must safeguard the core abilities of  the Bundeswehr.    I would like to add something else. The most important task  of the last few years, besides taking on new international  tasks, was to develop the Armed Forces of the unified state.  This may have been the Bundeswehr's greatest achievement of  all. Nowhere else is Germany growing together faster than in  the Armed Forces.    Directly and indirectly, we spend about DM5 billion in the  eastern states. If you want, these are not expenses for  military reasons. I could say, for instance, we will leave our  aircraft in places that have the most modern airports in  Germany. Then they would all remain in western Germany. An  aircraft takes only three minutes to get to Eastern Germany to  maintain security, but we would not have a uniform air force.  It would not be the armed forces of a unified state.

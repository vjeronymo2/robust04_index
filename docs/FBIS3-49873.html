A spokesman in the  Serb-controlled town told AFP that the vehicle had been blown up  early Tuesday outside an apartment of two ICRC employees but the  blast caused no casualties. "This attack raises serious  problems of security," said Pierre Gauthier, an ICRC spokesman  in Geneva. Loyal authorities have opened an enquiry into the  attack, the spokesman said. The ICRC has about 25 workers in  the northwestern town, which is a base for supplying both Moslem  and Serb populations in the area.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Malaysia aims to cut liquidity Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, has announced new measures designed to prevent a build-up of liquidity in the country's financial system and to combat further inflationary pressures. writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. From today residents will no longer be able to sell short- term monetary instruments to non-residents, including treasury bills and government securities. From the beginning of next month commercial banks will also have to lodge with Bank Negara all funds in ringgit, the Malaysian dollar, held by foreign institutions in non-interest-bearing accounts. Large amounts of funds have been attracted into Malaysia in recent months, drawn by the country's strong economic performance and soaring stockmarket. Bank Negara says it is determined to ensure that short-term speculative funds do not destabilise the economy.</p>

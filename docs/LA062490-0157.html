			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RIGHT THING  </P> <P> YAF is an organization that routinely attacks and intimidates young Republicans  who will not join their organization or support their positions or candidates  in statewide elections. They attempt to harass Republicans who do not agree  100% with YAF positions and will resort to criminal actions in their campaign  to "purify" the California Republican Party.  </P> <P> When a hawkish, capitalist, pro-life conservative like myself is labeled a  "liberal" or a "Commie" by YAFfers because I will not support their strong-arm  tactics, YAF has gone too far.  </P> <P> SHAWN DUDLEY  </P> <P> Fallbrook  </P></p>

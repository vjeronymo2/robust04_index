			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE MORE GO-AROUND ON BLACK-WHITE ISSUE  </P> <P> Jim Murray gets an F in genetics for his column, "One Man's Sun-Baked Theory on  Athletic Supremacy," in which he criticizes NBC for broadcasting the results of  scientific research indicating that athletes with African ancestors have  superior athletic skills over those without such ancestry.  </P> <P> Murray argues that the results are incorrect because many black athletes also  have white ancestors. Anyone who passed Biology I or Anthropology I knows that  genetically it is irrelevant whether those athletes have white ancestors. If an  athlete has any African ancestry and Africans have superior athletic skills  that are not possessed by other races, then there is a strong probability that  that person will inherit those skills.  </P> <P> DON ALLEN  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

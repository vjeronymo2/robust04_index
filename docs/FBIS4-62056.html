			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok May 11 TASS -- A large-scale operation,  code-named "Foreigner", was launched on the entire maritime  territory of the Russian Far East, beginning from 00 hours  today. It is being carried out by Interior Ministry forces with  the help of procurators, customs officials, and other services.    The main purpose of the operation is to check the observance  of Russian residence laws and regulations by foreigners.    It is an open secret that the territory is now overrun by  guests from CIS countries and other foreign states. What is  more, their numbers can hardly be properly recorded. Many of  them come to Russia legally, but then settle here arbitrarily,  engaging in poaching, shady businesses, and other not very  seemly occupations. Many come to the territory illegally, with  forged documents, while some even have no documents at all.    Particularly many foreigners have settled in the Ussuri  Taiga, which they are devastating most ruthlessly and  impudently. Officials of the territorial interior department  hope the operation "Foreigner", expected to last until May 20,  will help the foreign guests to "learn the particulars" of the  regulations in force and to respect Russia's laws.</p>

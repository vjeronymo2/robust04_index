			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / White-collar work to be contracted out LOCAL authorities in England will have to start contracting out construction and legal services from October 1995, Mr Robin Squire, environment minister, announced yesterday. Compulsory competitive tendering will be extended to other white-collar services, including information technology services, housing management, finance, personnel, and corporate services. For each new service in the tendering programme, the government will prescribe the proportion of work which must be market-tested. For legal services, the government is proposing that 33 per cent be put out to tender from October 1995. For construction services - engineering, architectural and property management services - the proposal is 30 per cent in October 1995. This means councils will start seeking tenders for the first services next summer.</p>

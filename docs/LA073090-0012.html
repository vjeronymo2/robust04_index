			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOODLAND HILLS WEST SWEEPS INTO STATE PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEGION: DEFENDING WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONS TAKE A PAIR FROM CLAREMONT TO  WIN 6TH AREA TITLE FROM THE LOSER'S BRACKET.  </P> <P> Woodland Hills West confirmed Sunday that it can win American Legion baseball  tournaments two ways -- through the winners' bracket and through the losers'  bracket.  </P> <P> A week after claiming the District 20 championship with four consecutive  victories, West beat Claremont in a doubleheader, 5-2 and 16-7, to cap a  five-game march through the losers' bracket of the 6th Area playoffs at UCLA's  Jackie Robinson Stadium and capture its second title in a row.  </P> <P> West, which was forced to play five games in three days after a first-round  loss to Claremont, advances to the state playoffs Aug. 4-7 in Yountville,  Calif.  </P> <P> "This is a great win. Two doubleheaders in a row," said West Coach Don  Hornback, whose team won twice on Saturday as well. "I think the impressive  thing is that we won with five different pitchers."  </P> <P> Paul Geller, normally West's starting second baseman, and Pat Treend, a  tenacious right-hander, notched complete-game wins Sunday. Geller (5-0)  scattered eight hits -- seven of them singles -- in the first game and did not  allow an earned run.  </P> <P> "We played great defense today; some of those guys hit some shots," said  Geller, who started for the first time in a month. "I was relying on my defense  because that's the kind if pitcher I am. I don't really strike people out."  </P> <P> Geller was being modest. He struck out seven and walked one.  </P> <P> In the nightcap, Treend (5-3) allowed 16 hits -- 13 of them singles -- in  avenging his loss in the first round.  </P> <P> That loss snapped West's 20-game winning strike and left the defending World  Series champions one loss away from elimination.  </P> <P> Corey Bromberg and Terry Morrow each recorded victories Saturday while Sean  Boldt picked up a win Friday. Only Morrow failed to record a complete game,  pitching 8 1/3 innings before yielding to Geller.  </P> <P> Claremont Coach Jack Helber, on the other hand, couldn't find an ace in his  pitching staff and did more shuffling than a Las Vegas blackjack dealer.  </P> <P> The District 18 champion used three pitchers in allowing West just six hits in  the first game. But in the nightcap Helber utilized seven hurlers -- three of  them in the fourth inning when West sent 12 batters to the plate before an out  was recorded.  </P> <P> West's nine-run onslaught gave it a 10-5 advantage, wiping out a 5-1 Claremont  lead.  </P> <P> "I thought we had the momentum," Helber said. "But we could not find an out and  we could not find the plate."  </P> <P> Claremont pitchers frequently found the dirt in front of home plate, the air  above batters' heads and both batters' boxes, but seldom the catcher's glove.  West received 14 walks -- four each in the fourth and sixth innings.  </P> <P> In the first game, starter Jaime Rodriguez (5-3) issued eight walks in 4 1/3  innings and was charged with all five West runs.  </P> <P> "We walked too many guys. You can't win games that way," Helber said.  </P> <P> Despite being down, 11-5, after 5 1/2 innings in the second game, Helber said  he felt his team was still in contention. West's Bobby Kim quickly gave Helber  a new outlook.  </P> <P> With two out, reliever Bob Skapik, Claremont's fourth pitcher, walked Del  Marine and Jason Cohen, then fed Kim a low 1-2 breaking ball. Kim drove the  ball about 430 feet, well beyond the left-center-field fence, for a 14-5 lead.  </P> <P> "We were getting down but at the same time it was only the (sixth) inning,"  Helber said. "But Kim's blast put it out of sight. That was the killer."  </P></p>

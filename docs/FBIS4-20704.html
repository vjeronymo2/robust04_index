A wide variety of information must be collected and analyzed  and a broad range of expertise is required when working up  decommissioning plans and undertaking decommissioning projects.  For this reason, there has been a need to establish a  decommissioning database system that gathers together, analyzes  and systematically sorts decommissioning-related information  obtained from domestic and overseas open-source documents,  international cooperative efforts and overseas studies.    In response to this need, the Research Association for  Nuclear Facilities Decommissioning (RANDEC), in addition to  having been commissioned by the Science and Technology Agency  (STA) to construct a personal computer-based ``General-purpose  Obsolescence Information Database System,'' is also developing a  personal computer-based ``Materials Management Database System  for the Decommissioning of the Nuclear-powered Vessel `Mutsu',''  for JAERI, and a ``Nuclear Fuel Facilities Dismantling Database  System'' for the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development  Corporation (PNC). RANDEC is also pushing forward with the  development of its own ``Multimedia Database System (RAIDA)''  that will be capable of being applied to numerous other fields  as well.    This article is designed to provide an overview of the  ``General-purpose Obsolescence Information Database System''  that RANDEC is developing at the behest of STA, as well as  RANDEC's own ``RAIDA System'' currently under development.  <H5>  1. General-purpose Obsolescence Information Database System </H5>   As shown in Figure 1, the General-purpose Obsolescence  Information Database System is actually comprised of three  sub-databases: a bibliographic information database, a general  information database and a technical information database.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-32A>      Figure 1. Configuration of the General-purpose </FIG>   <H5>  1.1 Special Characteristics of Each Database </H5> <H5>  (1) Bibliographic Information Database </H5>   Comprehensive science and technology-related databases are  already being operated by INIS, JICST and others, but these  users have to retrieve needed information from voluminous data  registered in mainframe computers, and these retrieval  operations require a good deal of experience and knowhow.    To provide users with an attractive option, one capable of  being much more user friendly, this bibliographic database has  been equipped with the following special features:    [1] It stores bibliographic data dealing exclusively with  the  field of nuclear facilities obsolescence;    [2] It contains a broad range of information, including  information presented verbally at meetings of scientific  societies, associations, etc. and made public at international  conferences;    [3] It makes use of a list of codes that classify obsolete  equipment as to technology field, facilities, theme and target  country to make it possible to draw associations between the  bibliographic data collected in the database and to more rapidly  retrieve that data.    The major classifications used to define obsolete equipment  technology fields are general decommissioning technology,  systems engineering, decontamination, dismantlement, remote  operations, reutilization, measures to deal with dismantled  waste, safety management and inventory evaluation. A specific  example of these classifications, to include a few intermediate  classifications, is provided in Table 1.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

This database stores both textual and  image data.  <H5>  (3) Technical Information Database </H5>   The Technical Information Database is made up of a  ``Qualitative Technical Information Database'' and a  ``Quantitative Technical Information Database.''  <H5>  [1] Qualitative Technical Information Database </H5>   The Qualitative Technical Information Database is designed  to  enable the collection of general technical information related  to obsolete equipment. Data stored in this database consists of  qualitatively sorted technical information related to obsolete  equipment (systems engineering, decontamination, dismantlement,  remote operation, reutilization, dismantled waste measures,  safety management and inventory evaluation data), and provides  users with summaries, special features, performance, scope and  achievement data related to obsolescence technologies.  <H5>  [2] Quantitative Technical Information Database </H5>   The Quantitative Technical Information Database is designed  to sort and store quantitative information required for  evaluating appropriate technologies for application to obsolete  equipment, and can be used as a dismantlement systems  engineering database. This database provides users with  quantitative information on dismantling time schedules, numbers  of workers and processes, radiation dosage, generated waste  volume and costs.  <H5>  1.2 Database Size </H5>   At present, there are roughly 10,000 data elements of  bibliographic information related to obsolete equipment stored  in the Atomic Energy Database operated by the International  Atomic Energy Association (IAEA), another roughly 12,000 such  data elements available via the INIS database and an additional  2,000 such data elements stored in the Japan Information Center  for Science and Technology (JICST) database. The General-purpose  Obsolescence Information Database System is expected to contain  roughly 20,000 bibliographic data elements, comprising the most  useful information from existing databases plus similar such  information expected to be generated in future, as well as  approximately 3,000 general information data elements and about  1,000 technical information data elements.  <H5>  1.3 System Configuration </H5>   After conducting comprehensive evaluations of database size,  ease of system development, ease of maintenance and operation,  information provision methods (online services, etc.) and  development costs, it was decided that this database system  would be built around a personal computer.    Each of the databases comprising this system feature roughly  the same overall system configurations and functions, and share  the same classification codes. And database operations have been  simplified thanks to interactive input systems that employ  pull-down menus. Figure 2 shows the overall system configuration  for the Bibliographic Information Database, and Figure 3 shows  its functional configuration.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-34A>      Figure 2. Overall Configuration of the Bibliographic </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-34B>      Figure 3. Functional Configuration of the Bibliographic </FIG>      Arago dBXL, an off-the-shelf database software was selected  as the software for the General-purpose Obsolescence Information  Database System, and application programs are being prepared.  Arago dBXL is compatible with dBASE IV, possesses image  data-handling functions and it has a compiled run module that is  license free. It also features multi-system support functions,  which enable it to run on PC-98, IBM, J3100 and FMR personal  computers.    Figure 4 shows the system's principal retrieval functions  and  the retrieval flow. When conducting item search operations, the  user can focus his search by specifying multiple items, such as  the above-described classification items (specifying the  classification code from pop-up menus using a mouse) and data  numbers, titles (character search) and authors (character  search) as search conditions. Free term searches are also  possible.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-34C>      Figure 4. Principal Retrieval Items and the Retrieval </FIG>      Tables 2 and 3 provide sample outputs of search results  obtained from the Qualitative Technical Information Database.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

Studies are therefore currently  aimed at initially providing data in the form of photomagnetic  (magneto-optical (MO)) disks or floppy disks.  <H5>  1.5 Development Schedule </H5>   Development of the Bibliographic Information Database got  under way in fiscal 1990, followed by work on the General  Information Database and Qualitative Technical Information  Database, all of which are still under development. Detailed  design work on the Quantitative Technical Information Database  is about to commence. These various database systems will be  made available to the public one at a time in the future.  <H5>  2. RAIDA System Development </H5>   At the office, bibliographic data and black-and-white image  data are managed using electronic file servers. But since color  image data, such as photographs, albums, videotapes and the  color drawings and diagrams attached to reports of research  results cannot currently be handled by these file servers,  personal computer-based data management systems are coming into  demand.    At RANDEC, therefore, as part of our work aimed at  developing  a ``Dismantlement Material Control System,'' which is a  constituent part of dismantlement systems engineering, we are in  the process of developing the RANDEC Image Database (RAIDA)  system, which will feature a library function for rapid  retrieval of these types of color image data, and a presentation  function for storing images, including video images, complete  with narrations.  <H5>  2.1 Past Problems and Solutions to Constructing Image </H5> Databases    The personal computers and applications software used in  conventional databases have been limited to processing textual  information, and this has created numerous problems in  constructing image databases. These problems are outlined in  Table 4. However, the recent appearance of multimedia personal  computers and related software has dispelled these problems and  made it possible to easily and inexpensively construct database  systems capable of handling both still and moving images,  complete with narrations.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4.

Table 5 shows the main functions, principal configuration  equipment, database software and special features of the two  component systems of the RAIDA system. Figure 5 provides a  configuration diagram of the RAIDA-MAC system.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 5.

Block Diagram of Entire RAIDA-MAC System </FIG>     These systems take data in directly from the video cameras  and video tape recorders, create moving picture data (RAIDA-MAC)  or still picture data (RAIDA-98), and register this data in  their respective databases. Users can use the database retrieval  functions to have the data they want to see displayed rapidly on  the PC monitor screen. With moving picture data, the narration  starts automatically as soon as the video/movie is displayed on  the screen.    The narration-supported image displayed on the CRT can be  simultaneously displayed on large-sized home TV sets with either  system, a capability that makes for convincing presentations  that have a strong impact on the viewer.    Ordinary video libraries take time to search out and display  the desired video presentation, and from the standpoint of  costs, cannot be updated all that frequently. However, with the  RAIDA system, not only can desired data be retrieved quickly,  but replacing old information with the latest image data can be  carried out easily, inexpensively, and therefore frequently. And  when moving picture data is created, new video titles can be  made in-house without ordering them from outside parties.  <H5>  2.3 Uses </H5>   Since the RAIDA system is a multimedia database that fuses  together moving picture and voice data, it is capable of  presentations that overflow with realism.    For example, this system can display the atmosphere of work  sites inside access-restricted cells, thereby allowing people  normally denied access to that site to get a real feel for the  atmosphere of that site. And parts replacement operations that  are difficult to understand from verbal or textual explanations  alone can be quickly understood and carried out without a hitch  by referring to full-color image data retrieved from this system  and displayed on the CRT screen.    Some other specific areas where the RAIDA system is expected  to find application are:    [1] For presentations of the results of research and  development work and records of construction projects;    [2] For PA presentations;    [3] For training manuals for plant operations and  maintenance  (collections of moving picture data focusing on those aspects  requiring specific knowhow);    [4] For safety manuals; and    [5] For government orientation presentations (related to  approvals and licenses).  <H5>  2.4 Future Tasks </H5>   RANDEC will strive to enhance the operability of the  RAIDA-98  system in future, and enable it to handle Arago-Windows database  software. As for the RAIDA-MAC system, however, there is not  that much development work left to do since the off-the-shelf  software capable of running on this system is already so  complete that RANDEC can enhance system functions simply by  selecting the appropriate software from among the numerous  packages available. When it comes to displaying moving pictures  on a big screen, as it stands now, these systems require the  addition of dynamic image compression/extension boards that  display more than 30 frames per second in order to produce a  smooth moving picture display. RANDEC is looking forward to the  commercialization of an inexpensive compression/extension board.    In future, we can expect to see the integration of these  RAIDA systems with materials and worker management database  systems for structures slated for dismantling.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   RANDEC would like to complete development and testing of the  General-purpose Obsolescence Information Database System, open  it to the public and commence formal operations as soon as  possible. And in future, in addition to collecting new data and  perfecting the data registered in this system even further, it  hopes to expand its functions to include full-color data  capabilities, and will strive to fine tune its database  management system and integrate it with other, related databases.    The RAIDA systems are the latest in multimedia database  systems, and feature technologies that can be put to use in a  wide range of applications in addition to the field of nuclear  power PA. RANDEC would like to further develop these systems in  future by equipping them with new multimedia technologies and  expanding their functions.  <H5>  Reference Materials </H5>   Takashi Shimada, et al.: ``Development of a General-purpose  Obsolescence Information Database System (1) -- System  Overview,'' Atomic Energy Society of Japan, March 1993, B36.

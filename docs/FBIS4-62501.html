			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe, 14 May -- In the view of Col. Gen. Valeriy  Patrikeyev, commander of the collective peace-keeping forces in  Tajikistan, the sociopolitical situation in the Republic is  gradually returning to normal. Making this statement at a news  conference today, he linked this positive development with the  constructive policy pursued by Tajikistan's leadership and with  the efforts of the collective peace-keeping forces stationed  here. This was the first public appearance before the press of  the new commander, who replaced his predecessor on the post,  Col. Gen. Boris Pyankov.    Valeriy Patrikeyev went on to emphasize that he had reached  these optimistic conclusions following two weeks of officially  studying the situation in Tajikistan and holding numerous  meetings and discussions with the Republic's residents from  virtually all regions, as well as with Tajikistan's top  leadership.    At the same time the Russian general described as expedient  the decision of the council of CIS heads of state held in Moscow  on 15 April to extend the mandate of the collective  peace-keeping forces until 31 December 1994, in view of  continuing tensions on the Tajik-Afghan border. In the  general's view, the intransigent Tajik opposition has not  renounced its plans to destabilize the situation on individual  stretches of the border; armed provocations against Russian  border guards are continuing, as are attempts by armed fighters  to break into Tajik territory.    The situation is particularly alarming in the Pamir sector,  where enemy personnel and hardware concentration is continuing  in the Afghan provinces bordering on Tajikistan. In the words  of the commander, the obvious purpose of this provocation is to  attempt to break through the border on a mass scale with  subsequent deep penetration into the Republic's territory in  order to conduct combat operations against the present  government. However, all these attempts are doomed, the  commander said. The collective peace-keeping forces and the  national armed forces have sufficient resources to deal  decisively with all these ventures.    At the same time Gen. Patrikeyev expressed himself in favor  of political settlement of the Tajik conflict, noting that the  military option was a dead end. "My dream is of the collective  peace-keeping forces becoming redundant in the Republic with  regard to their participation in hostilities. And I will do all  I can in my capacity to settle the conflict by peaceful means,"  concluded the commander of the collective peace-keeping forces.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES markets responded strongly to the good news on US inflation but appeared to be meeting resistance at the close, writes Terry Byland. Trading volumes remained high and determined selling by one UK house at midsession proved enough to bring out the stop-loss orders once again. The official closing reading showed the December contract on the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,097 for a four-point premium to cash, a sorry outcome against an estimated fair value of 10. Earlier, the contract had moved erratically, touching 3,105 several times and clearly seeing resistance at that level. The midsession sell-off took the contract down to 3,072, where it was virtually in line with the cash market. Volume in the contract rose sharply to a final total of just over 14,000 contracts. Independent traders were busy again but so were some of the big UK investment houses, which were still covering themselves ahead of US consumer statistics due today. Volume dropped in traded options from 43,626 lots to 30,800, and attention turned towards individual stock options. At 14,887 contracts, interest in the FT-SE option fell smartly from 23,750. The Euro FT-SE option saw 2,973 lots dealt, but Hanson headed the list of active stocks options with 2,138. Elsewhere, interest was scattered, with Thames Water (1,507) and Rolls-Royce (1,076) busy.</p>

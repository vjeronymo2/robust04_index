			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CLASSICAL MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PIANIST ROMERO SOARS AS STAR OF CHAMBER ORCHESTRA PROGRAM  </P> <P> Seldom absent from the local scene for more than a few months, pianist Gustavo  Romero returned triumphantly Monday night to Sherwood Auditorium as soloist  with the San Diego Chamber Orchestra. The ever-smiling Romero, winner of last  year's Clara Haskil piano competition, subdued the mighty challenges of  Saint-Saens' Second Piano Concerto with confidence and technique to spare.  </P> <P> From his bold, fluid opening solo, he demonstrated the enviable ease with which  he shifted from brilliant, explosive attacks to elegant sighs, without batting  an eyelash.  </P> <P> The 24-year-old pianist took in stride the sophisticated antics in the Allegro  scherzando, cleanly delineating the rippling phrases of Saint-Saens'  tongue-in-chic. Like Romero's Mozart playing, which to date has been his  calling card, his performance of this large-scale concerto bristled with  urgency and a keen sense of drama surging beneath the shimmering surface.  </P> <P> Music director Donald Barra and his orchestra played in Romero's shadow and at  one grand climax were actually drowned out by a fury of crashing octaves from  the Steinway.  </P> <P> Barra cannily placed the Saint-Saens Concerto at the end of the concert, since  his Sherwood Auditorium audiences are notorious for decamping at intermission  once the guest artist has dispensed with the obligatory solo vehicle. Although  this meant the sold-out house had to remain for the full program, the wait for  Romero was relatively painless and -- at least in the case of the orchestra's  stylish, alert reading of Beethoven's First Symphony -- rewarding.  </P> <P> For this program, Barra had all the wind players in place and added some extra  strings for good measure. In the Beethoven, this made the orchestra's balance  close to ideal, and, under Barra's sympathetic direction, the First Symphony  sparkled with a jaunty, optimistic bounce. It was one of the chamber  orchestra's most cohesive, convincing performances this season.  </P> <P> The program-opening Mozart Overture from "The Abduction from the Seraglio" was  peppy but significantly less polished, and Darius Milhaud's urbane, Brazilian  picture post card, "Le Boeuf sur le Toit," lacked its wonted joyous  spontaneity. Barra drove it relentlessly and without humor, allowing the  orchestra's fortes to bray uncomfortably in the modest 500-seat hall. Principal  trumpet John Wilds relished his carnival-like solos and executed them with  stentorian authority.  </P></p>

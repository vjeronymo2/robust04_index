			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed response to reader's query: "Turkmenbashi's </F> Health Is OK"]    [Text] "I have heard that Saparmurat Niyazov does not feel  too well after the operation performed on him in the States. Is  this so?" (N. Akhmedov, Alma-Ata [Almaty])    President Saparmurat Niyazov of Turkmenistan is healthy and  "does not require additional treatment," the head of state's  press service has reported. Rumors of the president's  supposedly unsatisfactory state of health and that he is  preparing to depart for treatment in the United States are  "groundless."    At the beginning of February 1994, S. Niyazov underwent an  operation on the blood vessels of his legs in Houston (United  States). According to physicians, his condition at the present  time is satisfactory: The blood circulation has been fully  restored, and arterial pressure has normalized.</p>

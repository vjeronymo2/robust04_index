			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Orient-style carpet sells for pounds 33,000: Saleroom A CARPET created by William Morris in about 1890 for Old Swan House on London's Chelsea Embankment sold for Pounds 33,000 at Christie's yesterday, slightly above estimate. The carpet, measuring 396 cm by 380 cm, was inspired by Persian and Turkish designs of the 16th century. It was the top price in an auction of British decorative arts from 1880 to the present day. A design by Morris for a stained glass window, depicting a minstrel holding cymbals, sold for Pounds 9,350, while a Burne-Jones design, of the Virgin Mary, for another stained glass window, made by Morris &amp; Co, went for Pounds 10,450. Other important names with work in the auction were Charles Rennie Mackin-tosh and Sir Edward Lutyens. An ebonised and painted corner cabinet, catalogued as designed by Mackintosh and painted by his wife Margaret, sold for Pounds 13,200, slightly below forecast. There had been some doubts about its provenance. Much of the furniture designed by Lutyens was withdrawn before the auction, but a pair of side cabinets, in the Renaissance style, part of the interior decoration of Heathcote, Ilkley, West Yorkshire, the first commission in which Lutyens designed the house as well as the contents, sold for Pounds 5,500. The biggest surprise of the day was the Pounds 28,600 paid for the Yatman bed, designed by William Burges in 1858 in the Jacobean style as a wedding present for his patron, the Rev J. A. Yatman. The half-tester bed doubled its estimate.</p>

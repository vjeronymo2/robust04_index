			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / People: Jorsling in the hot seat The London Fire and Civil Defence Authority has a new chair, Judith Jorsling, 44. A Labour councillor for the London borough of Newham, Jorsling was previously the LFCDA's deputy leader; she is both the first woman and the first black person to become the authority's leader. The LFCDA is responsible for the work of London's 8,000 firefighters and administrative staff - there are some 6,500 uniformed firefighters  - and in the fiscal year 1994-95 has a central government-funded budget of some Pounds 255m. Jorsling came into politics via a familiar route, through community-based projects in Brixton and later Newham - assisting the self-development of disadvantaged groups, setting up a tenants' association, and eventually becoming a Newham councillor in 1986. The LFCDA comprises representatives from each of London's 32 boroughs, plus one from the City. Jorsling says she feels 'extremely honoured' to have been chosen for the position. 'So often in politics you find yourself wanting a certain position or function - it's very nice to be chosen by your colleagues for something as important as this.'</p>

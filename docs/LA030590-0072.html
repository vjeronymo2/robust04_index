			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIRECTOR WANTS A WIDER REACH FOR GETTY GRANTS;  </P> <P> ART: DEBORAH MARROW AIMS TO BROADEN THE PROGRAM'S INTERNATIONAL CONSTITUENCY.  IT HAS AWARDED $20 MILLION IN ITS FIRST FIVE YEARS.  </P> <P> It isn't easy to give away the J. Paul Getty Trust's money, but the Getty Grant  Program has managed to disburse $20 million during its first five years of  operation. Five hundred and thirty grants have been awarded to art historians,  conservators and art museums in 18 countries.  </P> <P> Ministering to a wide range of needs, Getty grants have helped to repair  earthquake-damaged murals in Mexico City, to develop a user-friendly display of  Native American art at the Denver Art Museum and to publish books on French  daguerreotypes and Italian painter Artemisia Gentileschi. Scholars have used  Getty money to study Japanese hand scrolls, Tuscan stained glass and the social  history of German modern art. Museums around the world have catalogued their  collections and hired interns, courtesy of the Getty.  </P> <P> Twenty million dollars has covered a lot of ground, but the road to scholarly  philanthropy is tortuous, according to Deborah Marrow, director of the grant  program. An art historian whose specialty is 17th-Century French and Italian  art, Marrow joined the Getty seven years ago as a publications coordinator. She  took over the Getty Grant Program at its inception, in 1984, and now heads a  staff of eight, which is housed in a Santa Monica high-rise but eventually will  move to the J. Paul Getty Center under construction in Brentwood.  </P> <P> "No one is trained to be a grant maker. Everyone falls into the field from  somewhere else. I fell into it from art history," Marrow said. While she has  had to put a practical edge on her academic skills, the program she administers  also has faced challenges.  </P> <P> First came the task of introducing the program through brochures (printed in  five languages), public appearances and published announcements to inform  qualified applicants about grant opportunities. Now the program is so well  known in the United States and Western Europe that 250 scholars have applied  for 21 fellowships to be awarded in 1990, but Marrow and her staff are still  working to give the program a broader international reach. That means traveling  and directing information toward scholars and institutions in countries that  are out of the loop of Western art history.  </P> <P> Once potential applicants make themselves known, they are given grant  guidelines and counseled to help them qualify. In general, the program supports  projects that "promote research in the history of art and the humanities, the  understanding of art, and conservation," according to the guidelines. Grants  are not given for operating expenses, endowment funds, building construction or  maintenance, or acquisition of works of art.  </P> <P> "Much of our time is spent explaining the program and helping people who have  eligible projects to prepare applications," Marrow said. When applications are  ready, they are subject to peer review by independent scholars and specialists.  Most proposals are judged by two field specialists and an advisory committee of  four to eight people who serve three-year terms. Reviewers are paid an  honorarium -- say $150 for reading a proposal and submitting a written  assessment. The payment is essentially a token of appreciation for work done in  the spirit of "service to the field," Marrow said.  </P> <P> The program aims to give grants to the most deserving and feasible projects. No  quotas apply to subject matter or applicants, and the Getty doesn't advocate  particular projects. "We just respond to the applications that we receive,"  Marrow said. Applications tend to reflect current developments, however.  Conservators are increasingly attuned to technical processes, while the study  of art history has become more theoretical and interdisciplinary, she said.  </P> <P> The J. Paul Getty Trust's wealth has been so widely publicized that people  often expect Getty grants to be much larger than they are, Marrow said. The  trust's first priority by law is to create and administer its own nonprofit  programs, such as the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Getty Conservation  Institute.  </P> <P> As an operating trust, the Getty can spend up to 0.75% of the $3.2-billion  market value of its endowment on gifts and grants, however. The Getty Grant  Program was established under this provision.  </P> <P> Grants so far have run from $640 for the publication of a book on two  14th-Century Dominican altar paintings to $1 million for a five-year research  project on the effects of new information technologies on research, scholarship  and teaching, administered by the Council on Library Resources in Washington.  </P> <P> "We usually don't pay for an entire project. We try to leverage our support,"  Marrow said. Conservation grants generally require recipients to raise matching  funds, for example. Instead of picking up the entire tab for publications,  grants may provide for additional illustrations or allow a book's purchase  price to be lowered. Postdoctoral fellowships of $23,000, on the other hand,  are intended to replace the recipients' salaries for a year so that they can  concentrate on research and writing.  </P> <P> One unusually large grant of $250,000 was recently awarded to the International  Center for the Study of the Preservation and the Restoration of Cultural  Property in Rome. The Italian organization will use the funds in Africa to  train local museum staffs to care for their national treasures. This program  follows a Getty-funded pilot project for Africans who spent a year in Rome  learning conservation techniques. In the pilot project, the African  conservators learned practical methods, "not just how to use a lot of fancy  equipment that they don't have at home," Marrow said. The next phase of the  project is intended to ensure that entire museum staffs understand concepts of  conservation and work together to care for their collections.  </P> <P> Such projects are exciting to Marrow because they provide models that are  likely to be emulated by other organizations and they are graphic illustrations  of what Getty grants can accomplish. Verbal explanations of the grant program  are never as effective as models that can be seen and experienced, she said.  </P> <P> Marrow plans to go on talking about the Getty Grant Program, however, and five  years haven't dampened her enthusiasm. "It's a great job. Having an  international overview of what's going on in all these fields and seeing the  shape of art history is a real privilege. It's frustrating not to be able to  help everyone who applies, but that's an inevitable part of the process," she  said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editor-in-Chief Viktor Loshak commentary under the "In the </F> Country" rubric: "Please, Do Not Hang Up"]    [Text] The Russian press received numerous presents on the  old and new Press Days -- 3 and 5 May. From the presidential  staff -- journalists were thrown out of the Press House for the  second time in six months. From the parliament -- the State  Duma enacted and passed to the Federation Council for approval  the Law on the Procedure for Coverage of Government Authorities  by State-Owned Mass Media. This is a document unheard of in the  democratic world, which, for instance, specifies to the second  how much time news programs must devote to the titanic work of  our deputies.    The prime minister alone tried to listen to the journalists  on the eve of the holidays. Viktor Chernomyrdin received  representatives of the regional press and promised them that a  new law would be passed. It seems that tax pressure on the  press may be eased somewhat, if not removed altogether.    Evidently, the top authorities develop various relations  with  the press. Sometimes it seems that all of us -- newspapers,  magazines, radio, and television -- are connected with the  authority by two tubes from a schoolbook of mathematical  problems. The first one sucks in all our rhetorical or  non-rhetorical questions, "constructive proposals" and "separate  observations," journalistic investigations and readers'  letters... All this is digested somewhere up there, high in  the clouds, and the second tube gives us -- on extremely rare  occasions -- the feedback of answers and summaries. The farther  we explore the path of pursuing a new happiness, the more the  answers have nothing to do with the questions. The newspapers  have been given a chance to feel themselves promising singers at  a concert for deaf mutes.    "Sirs," NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA cries, "what have you  done to customs duties? In this country, owing to benefits  granted by top officials, billions of dollars flow past the  treasury."    Silence.    SEGODNYA writes about a first deputy prime minister who has  on the sly become a shareholder in Russia's greatest tin  combine. Isn't this why tin export rules have recently been  eased? Who has pushed this privilege through?    Silence.    How could the publication of a magazine romanticizing  mercenaries and advertising the tools of murder -- brass  knuckles, knives, guns, and automatic rifles -- be allowed in a  criminal country girdled with wars? -- MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI asked  the Press Committee.    Silence.    Why talk about others, if the most influential newspaper,  IZVESTIYA, has been fighting for many months now a bus turned  into a canteen, which was placed by someone and at God knows  whose authorization in front of its building. It seems that it  was easier for IZVESTIYA to gain the upper hand over Khasbulatov.    Of course, what is written in a newspaper or pronounced from  the television screen will shape the public opinion even without  answers. When they embark on a journey to authority, however,  they all pledge to be in a dialogue with society. But a  traditional dialogue between a consumer and a monopolist has  always been the same in this country regardless of whether it is  a political or economic monopoly. "Why is it that our telephone  communications are so bad?" the consumer asks. "Why is it  impossible to phone to foreign countries?" "We will double  telephone tariffs on the first day of the month," the  Communications Ministry responds.    The simple truth that relations with the mass media largely  shape the public view on authority sometimes seems to be beyond  the grasp of our state's top officials. Yet another herd of  bureaucrats replaces journalists at the House of the Russian  Press. Children were the first to give up -- GLAGOL, a  newspaper independent of adults, has closed. With an openness  typical of their age, the teenagers wrote at parting: "After  the authority touched the Russian Press House for the first  time, we splashed the front-page heading `The USSR -- a Country  of Assholes.' After it did it a second time, the authority  appeared to me as a self-satisfied pig that has reached a trough  and imagined itself to be the most clever and powerful."    The newspaper that has been thrown out has already received  an offer of assistance. From the president? No, from a  candidate for president, Zhirinovskiy, and his party. This is  how allies can be lost and how they can be found.    As a matter of fact, Yeltsin has once again lost to  Chernomyrdin in a monthly popularity rating, an event that, by a  strange happenstance, took place exactly when the former threw  journalists out of their house and the latter met with newsmen.    There is no denying that any authority tries to domesticate  the press. As a rule, it is those who communicate with the  voters and taxpayers constantly and as openly as possible that  manage to achieve this objective. Here, too, our situation is  unique: the country sees newspaper publications going  unanswered whereas at the same time at the political backyard  the authorities are feeding the press from hand with bits of the  budget pie, large and small. Even now they prefer not to make  public the amounts of subsidies. Indeed, there is something to  hide. The circle is going to be closed: the authority will  hide from the newspapers its stance on their publications, and  the newspapers will keep silent about who has taken how much  from the authority.    In a word, please, do not hang up.</p>

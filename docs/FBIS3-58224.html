			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] We return to the center of attention  in the world today: the NATO summit. [passage omitted]    The Atlantic alliance's summit has already accepted the  Partnership for Peace proposed by the U.S. -- a half-way formula  to satisfy desires for security, although the East European  countries consider it still not enough. The Balkans war is the  other pressing question at this NATO summit and, in this regard,  a toughening of the sanctions against the Serbs has already been  agreed on, with the repeated threat of air strikes if the  attacks do not cease. Meanwhile, Spain has succeeded in getting  security in the Mediterranean on the agenda of the summit.  Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez is in Brussels. Our  correspondent Nacho Hernandez also reports from there. Good  afternoon.    [Hernandez] Good afternoon. In his speech Prime Minister  Felipe Gonzalez emphasized the points contained in this  declaration: The importance of strengthening the transatlantic  link and support for the initiative on Partnership for Peace.  Spain thinks that this formula for the former members of the  Warsaw Pact does not mean automatic application of Article V of  NATO, which establishes immediate response by the Allies in the  case of an attack. Foreign Minister Javier Solana:    [Begin Solana recording] We are all fighting for greater  stability in Europe and logically in face of potential focuses  of instability we must act. [end recording]    [Hernandez] In the [draft] final communique of this summit  there is a reaffirmation of the decision adopted by NATO in  August according to which allied aircraft would bomb military  positions to end the siege of Sarajevo under the command of the  UN Security Council. The sanctions will also be strengthened  and there is talk of determination to put an end to the  obstacles facing the UN Forces in Bosnia. It is not acceptable,  the foreign minister said, for the blue helmets to have  difficulties in carrying out their humanitarian aid missions.    Of great interest to Spain is the declaration included on  stability in the Mediterranean. We reiterate, it says, that  security in Europe is affected by security in the Mediterranean.  Dialogue with the countries of the region will be promoted.  Efforts directed to strengthening security in this region must  be increased, the final declaration adds.</p>

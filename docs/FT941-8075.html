			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Honda to pull out of cross-share link with Rover: Industrial collaboration will be wound down Honda, the Japanese carmaker, is to end its minority shareholding link with Rover in the wake of the controversial takeover by BMW of Germany of a controlling stake in the UK carmaker. Industrial collaboration will also be wound down, but co-operative projects already under way may be continued. Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda, and Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of the management board of BMW, met in Tokyo yesterday for the first time since the German executive and luxury carmaker stunned Honda three weeks ago with its Pounds 800m deal to buy British Aerospace's 80 per cent stake in Rover. Honda said after the 90-minute meeting that it intended to end its 'mutual equity holding relationship' with the Rover group, which was taken in 1990. Honda currently holds a 20 per cent stake in Rover's vehicle operations (including Land Rover), while Rover holds a 20 per cent stake in Honda of the UK Manufacturing, the Japanese carmaker's Pounds 370m car and engine assembly plant at Swindon, Wiltshire. Honda made clear yesterday that in the long term it intended to wind down its collaboration with Rover, which dates from 1979, although it left the way open for existing co-operative projects such as the production of the Rover 600/Honda Accord and the Rover 200/400/Honda Concerto to be continued. In a statement, Mr Kawamoto said: 'The series of contracts now existing between Honda and Rover will be reviewed in future business discussions. 'In the future we intend to create a more independent operation in Europe, using our own resources,' he added. In London, Mr John Russell, managing director of Rover International, emphasised that Rover believed there would be no changes in existing collaboration agreements or component supply arrangements. He expected that project HH/Theta, Honda's and Rover's respective replacements for the current Honda Concerto/Rover 200-400, would also go ahead as planned. Production has been scheduled to start in the autumn. Yesterday's meeting in Tokyo, which included Mr John Towers, Rover managing director, had taken place in a 'friendly' atmosphere, said Mr Pischetsrieder. While Honda would not reveal details of the talks, it emphasised that its decision to sever the equity links had been based on what BMW had brought to the negotiating table at the meeting. 'This time we listened to what BMW had to say and then told them what our intention was,' Honda said. Terminating its equity relationship with Rover was one of several options Honda had been considering until yesterday's meeting, it added. BMW said that the 20 per cent cross shareholdings between Rover and Honda's UK manufacturing subsidiary would be swapped, leaving it in 100 per cent control of Rover. In addition, it would make a cash payment of around Pounds 30m to Honda under the terms of the original 1990 share exchange agreement. Mr Tony Woodley, of the TGWU union, said the relationship between Honda and Rover appeared to be 'dead'. Meanwhile, Sir Teddy Taylor, the Conservative MP for Southend East, called on the government to apologise to Honda for the 'scandalous' way it had been treated. Sir Teddy commented: 'It seems to me it was scandalous to sell off the company to this ailing German giant for a small fortune without even consulting Honda.' Mr Robin Cook, Labour shadow trade and industry secretary, said the deal could 'throw up serious problems for the existing Rover model range and will undoubtedly create problems for the future development of Rover'. Ministers must ensure 'that Rover and its workforce will not suffer from the takeover'.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE ROVER-HONDA LINKS - HOW MANY WILL SURVIVE?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

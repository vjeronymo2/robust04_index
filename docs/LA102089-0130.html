			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA'S BID FOR INJUNCTION REJECTED  </P> <P> A federal judge Thursday dismissed the city of La Habra's request for a  temporary injunction to stop the county from taking over a federal job-training  program.  </P> <P> Ruling that the federal courts have no jurisdiction in such matters, U.S.  District Court Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler refused to issue an order  restraining the county from seeking or accepting designation as a Service  Delivery Agency (SDA) for the program, which serves 10 North County  communities.  </P> <P> At issue is control over a federally funded Job Training Partnership Act  program that spends nearly $1 million annually in 10 North Orange County  communities.  </P> <P> The county is scheduled to take over the program on July 1.  </P> <P> City officials expressed concern that the county would abandon the existing  "fair share" philosophy that provides services to the 10 communities based on  population.  </P> <P> "The county may well determine a 'critical need' for youth services in the city  of Buena Park and allocate most, if not all, of such available funds to Buena  Park to the exclusion of the other cities within the SDA," said La Habra City  Manager Lee Risner in written comments to the court.  </P> <P> Funds are currently being allocated to La Habra, Buena Park, Brea, Cypress,  Fullerton, La Palma, Los Alamitos, Placentia, Stanton and Yorba Linda.

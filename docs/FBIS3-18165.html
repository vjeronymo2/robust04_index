Andoniadhou] </F>   [Text] The red dollars that were illegally exported from  the former Soviet Union have found shelter in European Union  [EU] and Swiss banks. These funds, estimated at around billions  of dollars, leave Russia on a daily basis with Cyprus as the  intermediate destination.    Much of the funds remain in banks set up in Cyprus with  Russian capital or in offshore companies' accounts. But most of  the funds find shelter in European banks.    There is an organized system in the movement of funds that  are now in the hands of the former nomenclature of the Soviet  Union. There is a ring of former communists and bank and  enterprise directors in which government officials are also  involved. Following the downfall of communism, this ring took  possession of huge funds belonging to the state and is now using  various methods to take them to the West.    It is estimated, but without Central Bank of Cyprus  confirmation, that funds worth millions of dollars remain in  Cyprus. Cyprus has been chosen by this ring due to the  incentives offered in the form of reduced taxation. According  to official estimates, there are 2,000 offshore companies in  Cyprus today belonging to Russians. Among them are eight Russian  banks. The registration of Russian companies is increasing  rapidly every day following efforts by the Cypriot and Russian  Governments to expand their economic and trade relations and  develop commerce and tourism.    Cyprus and Russia signed an agreement for the mutual  promotion and protection of investments in Moscow last Thursday.  Based on this agreement, the two countries will be obliged to  protect each other's investments.</p>

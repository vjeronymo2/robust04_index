			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'FOREST OF LITTLE BEAR' A POIGNANT SOCIAL DRAMA  </P> <P> "Forest of Little Bear" (opening Friday at the Little Tokyo Cinema 1) may focus  on a little boy and an adorable cub, but thankfully it is not another of those  saccharine animal pictures so beloved by the Japanese. It's a heart-tugger for  sure, but it is notably tough-minded and gains immeasurably with its well-drawn  social context. Director Tohio Goto and writer Ryunosuke Ono have, in fact,  made a gentle picture about life's harshness.  </P> <P> The time is 1928 and the place is the rugged, mountainous region of  northeastern Japan. The most skilled hunter in the area, Ginzo Iwata (Takahiro  Tamura), returns home after a decade in the Sakhalin Islands to find most of  his fellow peasants have abandoned hunting and become coal miners. Despite the  dwindling of game, Ginzo sticks to the old ways until he kills a bear, not  realizing that she has a tiny cub. For this offense to the mountain god, Ginzo  gives up hunting, concentrates on tenant farming and on helping his adoring  grandson (Hirofumi Miyata) raise that little cub. Both bear cubs and boys,  however, grow up, and this is the crux of the matter and of the rigid Ginzo's  dawning enlightenment.  </P> <P> This is the rare film that reveres the life that is lived in harmony with  nature yet quietly laments, rather than shrilly protests, the inevitability of  change in a society that is becoming rapidly industrialized. Played with such  passion yet control by Tamura, Ginzo comes to realize that he is obsolete and  that under no circumstances must his grandson try to follow in his footsteps.  For all of the mischievous irresistibility of that cub, "Forest of Little Bear"  is Times-rated Mature because of its painfully realistic, deeply symbolic  ending. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

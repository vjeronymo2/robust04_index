			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Property: Too many irons in the fire? - John Brennan looks at the heated debate over mounting applications to build golf courses WHEN the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club at St Andrews, Scotland, warned some time ago of a progressively acute shortage of courses in Britain, farmers and their land agents started to see bunkers by every cowshed. At a time of deeply-depressed agricultural land values, turning surplus fields into fairways became a pleasant and potentially profitable prospect. The majority of Britain's courses were established before the Second World War and golfers had become concerned about the shortage of new facilities at a time when television coverage of international tournaments had boosted the sport. But farmers' enthusiasm to find alternative use for their unproductive land, and the conversion of more and more armchair golfers to active play, has led to a heated debate on whether there are now too many planning applications for new courses. Local planners have, by and large, been favourable to such schemes, since they tend to involve little extra building while adding to the leisure facilities of an area. In practice, as Mark McAndrew of estate agent Strutt &amp; Parker says: 'There have been a lot of sites where the owners have consent for golf use, but a lot will never be developed as golf courses.' Planning consent offers no guarantee of being able to attract member/subscribers to a self-financed club, or of attracting play-and-pay customers on a more open course. And, as McAndrew notes: 'Finance for any leisure scheme is terribly difficult to get hold-of now.' But he dismisses suggestions of any widespread withdrawal of support by backers and doubts if he could identify as many as 10 financially-doubtful projects among the many dozens under way nationally. Strutt &amp; Parker, with more than 1m acres of farm and estate land under management, is keen to be seen as a firm with particular expertise in golf projects. And anyone offering a site for a prospective course at an asking price of Pounds 3.25m can be expected to be optimistic about the scope for fresh golf projects. McAndrew is no exception. He argues that there still is substantial interest assuming the property fits the bill with a prime, well-located site. In this instance, it is the 180-acre Leggatts Park in Hertfordshire, north of London, that has been added to S&amp;P's open-market sale list. Having won planning consent for an 18-hole course, and permission to convert an existing building into a clubhouse, the family that has farmed the land since the late 1960s had tried to sell the property privately. But despite being just two miles (3.2 km) from the M25 London orbital motorway, and close to the dormitory town of Potters Bar, there was no interest from offshore investors or leisure development groups. The fact that the property is mature, undulating parkland with a good crop of trees still failed to draw the offers. Now that Leggatts Park is on the open market, S&amp;P claims the asking price represents 'only a limited premium value over residential/agricultural levels.' As a working farm alone, it is unlikely the property would be worth even half its price tag. But Leggatts is unusual in having such a substantial main house (nine bedrooms plus two additional staff flats) as well as four other houses, two of which have five and six bedrooms, with additional out-buildings. Roger Pryor, head of S&amp;P's leisure department, thinks it is 'the best commercial golf development site available at present.' How long it remains available could depend on how avidly prospective buyers have read the European-wide survey of golf facilities produced by Greene, Belfield-Smith, the leisure industries arm of Touche Ross, the accountancy-to-management consultancy group. This 20-country survey, based on figures for golf facilities at the beginning of 1991, re-affirms and extends the projections of the forecasters at the Royal &amp; Ancient. It expects that the pace of development of European golf schemes will overtake that of the United States in the near future and that Europe overall will become 'the most rapidly-growing golf market.' The consultants' forecasts, while interesting, pale beside the core of the survey which is a course-by-course, hole-by-hole exposition of the state of golf in Europe. The most striking fact is that England on its own has more than a third of all the golf courses in the area between Norway and Greece. The survey records 1,377 courses in England, with a total of 23,081 holes. Add Scotland's 471 courses and 7,247 holes, plus 126 with 1,958 in Wales, and the UK has more than half of Europe's grand total of 3,687 courses with 59,465 playable holes. Self-evidently, golf facilities in the less-wealthy areas of southern Italy and Greece, rural Portugal, and the more northern regions of Norway and Sweden are few and far between. These golfing fringe areas do bring the Euro-averages down. Nevertheless, the survey does help to discount any concern that the TV-inspired upsurge of interest in playing the sport would result in a mass exodus of golfers to the heavily publicised Mediterranean courses. The level of marketing and promotion for villas and apartments by Spanish and Portuguese golf courses belies the comparatively-limited golf facilities available in those countries. Spain, as the survey shows, has only 108 courses with 1,777 golf holes (fewer than Wales and only twice the score-card of Finland). Portugal has just 20 courses with 252 holes. The consultants worked out that there are 112,000 people for every 18-hole golf course in Europe. That compares with 23,000 a course in the US. On the same line of argument, if every region of Europe became golf-conscious and sought to match present US golf facilities, an additional 15,000 golf courses would need to be completed. Even the Royal &amp; Ancient might balk at that.</p>

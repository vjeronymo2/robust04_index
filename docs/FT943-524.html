			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Strike hits GM plants Production in three of General Motors' North American plants stopped yesterday as a parts shortage began to be felt following a walk-out on Tuesday by 11,500 workers at a parts plant in Flint, Michigan. The dispute threatens to stall most of GM's North American plants. It has focused attention on the company's hiring practices in the wake of soaring production volumes this year. The United Auto Workers union says the company is forcing its members to work increasing overtime to raise production, rather than hiring new workers. As part of its effort to plug growing labour shortages in some plants, GM has also offered incentives to encourage workers to move to plants which are understaffed. The company has cut its hourly workforce in North America by around 50,000, to 250,000, in the past three years in an effort to bring these operations back into profit.</p>

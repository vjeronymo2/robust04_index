			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Letter: Where the UK should get its teeth into delegation Sir, I have recently returned from a wonderful, two-week visit to the UK, the original 'Magic Kingdom'. A large part of my two weeks was spent visiting British dentists and dental tradesmen and women. I was quite surprised to find, in a country with a well developed National Health Service, that the average dentist rarely employs a dental hygienist and that a law exists forbidding dental assistants fully to assist. I can't imagine who would make a rule which would discourage the delegation of tasks in a system that otherwise purports to reduce health care costs and provide services to all its nation's people. Remove that little glitch and it looks to me like a workable arrangement. Robert Guzauskas, 11203 Royal Palm Way, Boca Raton, Florida 33432 USA</p>

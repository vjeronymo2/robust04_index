			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Asset value of Japanese trust funds slips 9.8% THE NET asset value of investment trust funds in Japan fell 9.8 per cent last year, as the continuing weakness of the Tokyo stock market drove down the asset value of equity investment trusts and slowed the flow of fresh funds. The Investment Trusts' Association reported net assets were down Y4,520.1bn (Dollars 35.4bn) to Y41,473.8bn, with the net assets of stock funds down to Y28,562.4bn from Y35,077.2bn at the end of 1990, and the value of new stock funds launched down 45.3 per cent to Y8,640bn, which is the lowest level in six years. A sign of investor concern about the health of the stock market was a 2.4 times increase in stock fund redemptions. Japanese fund managers, worried by the trend, have recently won approval from the Ministry of Finance to extend the life of trust funds due for redemption. At the end of November, about 49 per cent of the asset value of what are officially called stock investment trusts in Japan was accounted for by stocks, with around 32 per cent in call loans, and about 17 per cent in bonds. While the net asset value of these funds fell over the past year, the share accounted for by stocks had risen from 44 per cent at the start of 1991. The Investment Trusts' Association said yesterday that the enduring weakness of the stock market had taught investors that they cannot take healthy returns for granted.</p>

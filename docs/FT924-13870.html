			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Frank Gates interim downturn FRANK G GATES, the east London-based Ford motor dealer, continued to suffer from the fall in new vehicle sales, especially in fleet sales, and saw pre-tax profits decline from Pounds 692,000 to Pounds 216,000 in the six months to June 30. Turnover at the company, which has five Ford franchises, was down at Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 29.3m). However, Mr Edward Gates, chairman, said that sales in August, traditionally the highest selling month, were up 85 per cent on the previous August. Price-cutting had led to lower margins in new vehicle sales, he said, but the company was aiming to hold profits rather than just shift units. Service was 'in line with last time'. The contract hire side (about 80 per cent of the fleet was sold to Ford Motor Credit Company for Pounds 7m in November 1990) continued to grow - to about 60 per cent of its size before that sale, said Mr Brady. Borrowings totalled about Pounds 4m, split between the contract hire side and the newly refurbished Bishop's Stortford dealership. Interest charges rose to Pounds 255,000 (Pounds 49,000) as a result. Earnings declined to 0.68p (2.19p) per share.</p>

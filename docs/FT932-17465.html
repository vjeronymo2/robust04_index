			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Balladur gives his team pro-EC stamp THE make-up of his cabinet and his first directions to it yesterday suggest Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is falling in with President Mitterrand's wishes for a government which shows itself pro-European abroad and concerned with social issues at home. The new government's programme will not become clear until Mr Balladur outlines it to parliament next Thursday. But already, after an informal meeting with his new team yesterday, Mr Balladur made it known that his first foreign trip would be to see Chancellor Helmut Kohl after Easter, and that his new ministers should get cracking on pruning this year's yawning budget deficit, reducing the level of unemployment that now stands at 3m, and saving the state pension and welfare systems from bankruptcy. The key pointer to Mr Balladur's desire for pro-EC government, with its centre of gravity lying in the moderate centre-right part of the political spectrum, was his determination to bring Mrs Simone Veil back to domestic politics. He had no 'party political' reason to do so. Mrs Veil last held office in France in 1979, when she resigned to become the first president of the directly-elected European Parliament where she has been since. She played no real part in the recent election campaign, is a centrist, but no longer has any close ties to Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing's Union for French Democracy (UDF) party. Yet, she has been made the senior of four 'ministers of state' who rank above ordinary ministers. In protocol terms, this makes her Mr Balladur's deputy, with a weight beyond her actual responsibility for social, health and urban affairs. Mr Balladur wanted Mrs Veil, to whom he first offered the justice ministry, in his team because this 65-year-old Jewish survivor of a German concentration camp symbolises a rare kind of tough morality in French politics. As the author of France's 1974 abortion law, and a dedicated European, she gives the government both a progressive and a pro-EC flavour for the price of just one post in a cabinet which Mr Balladur wanted to restrict in number. If the government were to be pushed off its pro-EC rails, Mrs Veil would be the first to pull the alarm cord. Mr Balladur, himself the first of Europe's finance ministers to propose in 1987 setting up a European central bank, may think that no bad thing. There are other reasons why the composition of France's new government will give no comfort to anti-Maastricht Conservatives in Britain, or discomfort to governments of the 10 countries that have ratified the European union treaty. The Balladur team contains only two anti-Maastricht ministers - Mr Charles Pasqua and Mr Francois Fillon - but they are safely parked at the interior and research ministries, respectively. The maverick Mr Alain Madelin has free market doubts about fixed exchange rates, but he will have his hands full setting up the new ministry for small business. Mainstream responsibility for European policy will fall on other shoulders. Mr Edmond Alphandery is effectively the country's new finance minister, but nominally only responsible for the 'economy', with the word 'finance' excised from his title. This reflects the determination of Mr Balladur, himself a former finance minister, to exercise a strong role on monetary policy. A clash is possible. Quite quickly, Mr Alphandery can be expected to assert himself, particularly on the urgent matter of making the Bank of France autonomous, an issue on which Mr Alphandery has strong views. For the moment all the government has on paper about the change in the central bank's status is a draft statute. Mr Alain Juppe's appointment as foreign minister gives him a chance to come out from the long shadow of Mr Jacques Chirac, the neo-Gaullist Republican Rally (RPR) leader., The odds are that Mr Juppe will take it, and prove himself more pro-European than his patron. However, less able to resist the influence of Mr Chirac, who has stayed out of the government to run for the presidency on a populist, not to say, protectionist platform, may be the new farm minister, Mr Jean Puech. He is ostensibly pro-Maastricht, but may well be unable to resist pressure from the farmers, probably egged on by Mr Chirac, for a confrontation with Brussels. Mr Puech was not Mr Balladur's first choice. Another UDF centrist, Mr Charles Millon, refused it three times, saying it would be incompatible with his pro-EC convictions. Clearly Mr Millon smelt coming trouble. GOVERNMENT TEAM: Prime Minister Edouard Balladur presenting his new cabinet in Paris yesterday.

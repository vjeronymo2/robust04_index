			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bata to reopen shops in Poland BATA, one of the world's largest shoe producers and retailers, is returning to Poland with the intention of establishing a nationwide network of retail sales outlets. The move follows the company's return last year to Czechoslovakia, where it was founded in 1894. Bata was nationalised by the Communist Czechoslovak government after the second world war, but has opened 40 shops there this year and bought one medium-sized shoe producer. Bata is the first western 'high street' retailer to come to Poland, where trade remains largely in the hands of small private companies catering for the country's nearly 40m consumers. The Bata Shoe Organisation, the holding company for the group, has its headquarters in Toronto. Bata will be operating in Poland through Compar Bata, its Italian subsidiary, in a joint venture with Intercam, which is a privately-owned Polish company. Intercam, founded in 1988, is also involved in joint ventures with DHL, the international freight forwarding group and Ogilvy Mather, the advertising company. Bata is planning to open some 30 shops in Poland over the next few years and intends to purchase some stock from the country's depressed shoe industry. The company had 300 shops in Poland before the second world war and owned two factories on what is now Polish territory. However, Mr Thomas G Bata, the company's managing director, says it will not be applying for their restitution nor does he have any immediate plans for the purchase of existing plants.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Earnings to remain the focus - New York The 'nirvana scenario' embraced by Wall Street last week may quickly fall out of fashion if the impressive new year rally comes to an abrupt halt this week or next, as some analysts expect. Be that as it may, simple faith in the staying power of the current fundamentals - strong growth, low inflation and stable interest rates - resulted in a nearly perfect string of sessions last week. Indeed, for a few days at least, it has seemed like the best of all worlds for stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average powered past the 3,900 mark for the first time on Friday, just two weeks after topping 3,800. The bellwether blue-chip index finished at 3,914.48, for a weekly advance of 47 points and its fourth record close in five days. (On Tuesday, the Dow was unchanged, matching the peak achieved the previous session.) With the US results season in full swing, earnings - rather than fresh economic news and trends in the US Treasury bond markets - will remain the focus, as investors look to see how individual companies performed. Some leading pharmaceutical concerns, including Merck and Warner-Lambert, will post their results today. The market, which has already reacted badly to a slowdown at Pfizer, is anxious to see if price discounting has affected the profitability of the rest of the underperforming sector. The failure of the market last week to respond with enthusiasm to earnings that matched or exceeded analysts' forecasts was a warning flag for Mr James Solloway, head of equity research at Argus Research in New York. There were some exceptions, notably Caterpillar and Apple Computer. But the market, by and large, seems to have factored strong earnings into many share prices. Mr Solloway believes this is a just one indication of 'the wear and tear that develops near the end of a market rally', when stock values have begun to run ahead of the fundamentals. While he believes the longer-term outlook for equities remains bullish, he anticipates 'a couple of weeks of consolidation' in the near term. Mr Gregory Nie, technical analyst at Kemper Securities in Chicago, agrees that the market is ripe for a setback, but believes it will put in a good performance over the next few days. However, he warns that stocks are approaching an 'overbought' position and expects the market to retrace its December and January gains with a correction of about 10 per cent soon. Just what will trigger the downward move is anyone's guess. Potential catalysts include a further deterioration of the Russian reform process and another uptick in industrial commodity prices. Mr Joseph McAlinden, of Dillon Read in New York, points out that the preliminary estimate of fourth-quarter gross domestic product, to be released on Friday, may scare investors if it exceeds 5 per cent. Such a level may bring forward a move by the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy.</p>

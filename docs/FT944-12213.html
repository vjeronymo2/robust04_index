			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Talisman ahead at CDollars 44.1m Strong North American demand for natural gas and gas liquids and the addition of oil production from the North Sea and Indonesia lifted Talisman Energy's net profit at nine months to CDollars 44.1m (USDollars 32.7m), or 61 cents a share, from CDollars 19.2m, or 33 cents, a year ago, on revenues of CDollars 387m against CDollars 219m, writes Robert Gibbens. Third-quarter net profit was CDollars 15.2m, or 18 cents, up from CDollars 4.3m, or 7 cents, on revenues of CDollars 166m against CDollars 94m. Talisman, formerly BP Canada, said the acquisition earlier this year of Bow Valley Industries - previously controlled by British Gas - would provide 'an attractive rate of growth for the next five years or more'.</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The National Football League has refused reinstatement this season for Mossy  Cade, the former Green Bay Packers' defensive back who served 15 months in  prison for second-degree sexual assault.  </P> <P> The NFL's decision was made several months ago but not announced, the Milwaukee  Journal reported.  </P> <P> Cade was paroled from prison Oct. 21, 1988. He tried unsuccessfully to play  last year after his release.  </P> <P> Cade's attorney, Randy Rueckert, said he and Cade had hoped a new commissioner  would be in place by training camp this year.  </P> <P> "It's my impression that as long as Pete Rozelle is commissioner he (Cade) is  not going to be able to play in the NFL," Rueckert said.  </P></p>

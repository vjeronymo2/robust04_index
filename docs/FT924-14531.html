			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (5): A slow rebuilding of contacts - More than 1m Taiwanese will visit China this year TAIWAN'S relations with China have improved markedly following a series of so called pragmatic initiatives by President Lee Teng-hui starting in the late 1980s. But the widely differing views held by the two sides, and 40 years of open hostility, suggest further progress will be slow. Taiwan last year recognised Beijing as the mainland's legitimate government. It has also established government and quasi-government agencies to handle cross-straits relations. Restrictions on visiting China and investing there have slowly been lifted, although all contact must still be indirect. More than a million Taiwanese are expected to visit China via Hong Kong this year, compared with less than 7,000 in 1987. Trade through Hong Kong in the first seven months of this year increased 34 per cent to more than Dollars 4bn. The cautious opening to China is as important as other initiatives to increase democracy and to lift Taiwan's international status. 'If we cannot deal with the cross strait relationship, constitutional reform and diplomatic improvements mean nothing,' said Mr Wu An-chia, convenor for mainland affairs research at Chengchi University. In return for its policy changes, Taiwan wants Beijing to recognise it as an equal political entity, allow Taiwan more international ties, and renounce the threat to re-unify Taiwan using force. But China, which still sees Taiwan as a renegade province, is not prepared to confer any legitimacy on its government. China's position is that Taiwan should accept a solution based on 'one country, two systems', as negotiated with Hong Kong. Taiwan is being offered more autonomy than Hong Kong, however. For example it could keep control of its defence forces. The impasse has stalled progress on relaxation of Taiwan's ban on direct air, shipping and postal links with the mainland. Taiwan's national unification guideline, setting out the limits to mainland policy, makes clear lifting the ban is not a near-term objective. But pressure from Taiwan's businessmen, who say the ban increases costs of investing in China, has led to hopes the ban could be eased. Taiwan's government seems more concerned to maintain the ban as an important negotiating position with which to squeeze concessions from China at a later stage. Meanwhile, China is also refusing to soften its stance on the use of force. This again is partly a negotiating position, and China also sees the threat as a way to limit the ambitions of Taiwan's independence movement. Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party campaigned for independence during last year's national Assembly elections. After the party polled only 24 per cent of the votes, the issue has been sidelined, thus averting a serious rift with Beijing. Most people in Taiwan are happy to maintain the island's present de facto independence, but do not support open calls for a split with Beijing. Assuming political and economic reform accelerates in China, reunification is regarded as a long-term inevitability. In the short term, civilian and unofficial contacts will be built up and work will continue on problems stemming from both sides' refusal to recognise the other's legal system. Taiwan's government-funded Straits Exchange Foundation, which handles direct negotiations with China's equally non-governmental Association for relations Across the Taiwan Straits, has been negotiating endorsement of documents and indirect mail services with the Chinese. Discussions were aborted in March after the Chinese suddenly raised issues of sovereignty. 'I urged them not to mix politics with technical matters,' said Mr Chen Rong-jye, SEF secretary general. Slow progress on China relations is also frustrating Taiwan's ambitions to boost its international status. South Korea's August decision to switch recognition from Taiwan to China was a severe blow to the island, removing its last Asian diplomatic ally. Taiwan now has full diplomatic relations with 29 countries, although many - like Tonga and Guinea-Bissau - are only of symbolic importance. Worryingly, China seems keen to improve relations with South Africa, the only large country which still recognises Taiwan. Taiwan has made progress improving unofficial links with France, especially, and with the Commonwealth of Independent States. Taiwan has also stepped up efforts to gain admission to international bodies, and was last year admitted along with China to the Asian Pacific Economic Conference grouping under the compromise title Chinese Taipei. China probably assented to simultaneous entry as a precursor to dual entry to the Gatt. At the moment, the US is in favour of simultaneous entry, perhaps next year. Although entry would harm Taiwan by abolishing some import restrictions, membership is seen as a diplomatic imperative in Taipei. One recent development, the slightly distasteful 'bidding wars' between Taiwan and China for recognition by third world governments, may not last. Growing democracy in Taiwan makes episodes such as last year's stealing of Niger from China harder to justify. 'People don't want their taxes spent on black Africa,' one analyst said.</p>

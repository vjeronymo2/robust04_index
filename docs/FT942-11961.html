			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T and Novell form alliance in networking AT&amp;T, the US telecommuni-cations company, and Novell, the leader in computer networking software, have formed an alliance to create worldwide inter- and intra-company communications services for businesses. The new service, called AT&amp;T NetWare Connect Services, will combine Novell's widely-used local area network software with AT&amp;T's telephone network to form a global network of business networks, in effect a 'business internet', the companies said. Business use of the Internet, a global network of computer networks with an estimated 25m users, is rapidly expanding. However, concerns about security and the complexity of using the Internet have limited most business use to electronic mail. AT&amp;T said its new service will address these problems. Applications will include workgroup collaboration, information retrieval and manipulation, electronic commerce, distributed computing, messaging and fax services. 'Our alliance with Novell is a significant step in expanding the electronic highway on which commerce, business collaboration, and knowledge sharing will ride,' said Mr John Petrillo, president of AT&amp;T's Business Communications Services unit. The advent of public data services will enable business customers to avoid the expense of building and operating their own private inter networks said Mr David Taylor, industry analyst at the Gartner Group, a market research firm.</p>

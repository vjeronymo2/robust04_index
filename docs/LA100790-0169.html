			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHRISHON PROVIDES THE SPARKS FOR MISSION VIEJO  </P> <P> Derek Sparks of Mater Dei has been the most talked about high school running  back in Orange County this season. However, Saturday night against Mission  Viejo, his name was hardly mentioned.  </P> <P> Most of the 4,000 attending the Southern Section nonleague showdown at Mission  Viejo turned their attention to Marcellus Chrishon, a relative unknown who  rushed for 200 yards in 21 carries and scored four touchdowns to lead Mission  Viejo to a 42-23 victory.  </P> <P> Chrishon, a 5-foot-9, 150-pound senior, scored on runs of 67, 38, 15 and one  yards. He had 145 yards rushing by halftime.  </P> <P> Sparks, the much publicized player who transferred from Montclair Prep last  month, finished with 138 yards in 23 carries. His only touchdown was on a  three-yard pass with seven seconds remaining. In his two previous games with  Mater Dei, Sparks had 465 yards and six touchdowns.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo, which begins South Coast League play this week, improved its  record to 4-1. Mater Dei, which was 2-0 with Sparks in the backfield, dropped  to 2-3.  </P> <P> "We have our own Derek Sparks and his name is Marcellus Chrishon," Mission  Viejo Coach Mike Rush said. "We told our kids before the game to let the sparks  fly. Give our line a lot of credit, too,"  </P> <P> Mater Dei scored first on a Cliff Roberts 32-yard field goal in the second  quarter, but Mission Viejo and Chrishon took over from that point.  </P> <P> Chrishon broke loose for a 67-yard touchdown run on the next possession. His  15-yard touchdown run five minutes later put the Diablos ahead, 21-3.  </P> <P> In the third quarter, when it appeared Chrishon had been dropped for a loss, he  broke through five tacklers on his way to a 38-yard touchdown run to put his  Mission Viejo ahead, 35-9.  </P> <P> "All we talked about before the game was Derek Sparks," said Chrishon, who  hadn't rushed for more than 100 yards in a game this season. "I think Derek  Sparks just stayed home tonight. We knew we had to stop him and we sure did.  Our offensive line just played better. I'm very happy." ERIC SHEPARD  </P></p>

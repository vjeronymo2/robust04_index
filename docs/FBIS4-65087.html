			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Terence Shaw report: "Britain Aids Human Rights Court </F> Reform"]    [Text] Britain was among 31 countries that signed an  agreement in Strasbourg yesterday for reform of the Council of  Europe's machinery for protecting human rights.    The aim is to provide a streamlined procedure for dealing  with alleged violations under the European Human Rights  Convention whose enforcement machinery is in crisis because of a  burgeoning workload.    Cases are taking an average of five years, and sometimes  nine  years, to resolve. Without the reforms the delays are expected  to worsen as more central and eastern European countries sign  the Convention.    Under the agreement, known as the 11th Protocol to the  European Human Rights Convention, the two-tier system of  commission and court for investigating and adjudicating alleged  violations will be replaced by a single court in permanent  session.    It will absorb the role of the commission, deciding if cases  are admissible, and if so to investigate their merits, then seek  a settlement. If this fails, it delivers an opinion on whether  there has been a breach of the Convention.    Under the present system, cases can then be referred to the  Strasbourg court, which, after a hearing gives a binding  judgment on Governments found to be in breach.    In the new system, people in the states of the Council of  Europe will have direct access to Strasbourg after exhausting  domestic remedies. The court will have one judge for each  country, elected for six years by the council's Parliamentary  Assembly.    Most cases will be decided by seven judges. A committee of  three will take over the role of the commission in deciding  whether complaints are initially admissible.    Cases raising important issues of interpretation of the  Convention can be referred by the normal seven-judge court for  adjudication by a larger "Grand Chamber'' of 17 judges, unless  one party objects.</p>

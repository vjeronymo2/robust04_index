			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDFLY MANIA: FACTS MIGHT HELP  </P> <P> Could it be that finally Southern Californians are going to get some solid  information about the public-health effects of repeated malathion spraying?  It's almost too much to hope for, but this week scientific experts will get two  important opportunities to clarify the health implications of the state's  extensive anti-Medfly pesticide program.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the Assembly will hold an unusual meeting of the full house to take  testimony from researchers and public-health specialists who have studied  pesticides. The meeting will no doubt attract much newspaper, television and  radio coverage; here is a chance for state legislators to put the media  spotlight to more than just self-serving use. They must use the hearing to  ensure that it answers all of the obvious questions: How complete and credible  are the many previous studies that indicated malathion posed no significant  risk to human health? What factors exist in Southern California's current  environment that might alter the conclusions of such studies? What about future  preparedness? Is it realistic to suggest, as agricultural officials have, that  by June the state and federal facilities can produce 400 million sterile flies  per week so that long-term repeat spraying will never again be necessary? And  beyond scientific questions, there is the obvious political one: Even if all  studies show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that spraying has minimal risk, what  can be done to restore the credibility of the state and county agricultural  officials who have mismanaged the Medfly public-information campaign in almost  textbook form?  </P> <P> Their public information blundering was the reason the state formed what is now  called the Public Health Effects Advisory Committee, a group of more than 20  physicians, scientists and public-health advocates. The committee held its  first organizational session recently in Orange County and will meet again  Thursday in Los Angeles. Its meetings, which are scheduled to occur regularly  for the next few months, need to be more highly publicized so that those  interested can attend. The state has rightly included on the panel some experts  who have raised serious questions about the malathion spraying campaign,  including representatives of the Sierra Club and the city of Pasadena. If given  the needed staff support and full authority to pursue all health issues it  considers relevant, the committee can help inform an impatient and anxious  community -- one that is not only weary of being bombarded with malathion, but  with conflicting versions of precisely what the controversial pesticide does.  </P></p>

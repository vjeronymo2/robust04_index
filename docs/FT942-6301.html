			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Indian groups post strong gains Four leading Indian companies have reported big gains in annual net profits for the year ending March. They were helped by increased demand as the economy recovered from prolonged stagnation. The figures were lifted by cost-cutting and improved performance in response to the economic liberalisation launched by the government three years ago. ITC, the Indian affiliate of BAT Industries of the UK, saw net profit rise 33 per cent to Rs2.06bn (Dollars 65.6m) on increased revenues of Rs42.8bn. The company announced a one-for-one bonus share issue. While the large tobacco business saw a sales increase of 1 per cent, the non-tobacco operations posted large gains. These activities include hotels, financial services, paper, packaging and edible oils. BAT, which holds a 31 per cent stake, earlier this year provoked protests from ITC when it indicated it wished to increase its stake to 51 per cent, following the government's economic reforms. However, BAT shelved its plans but ITC promised to find ways for BAT to become more closely involved in tobacco and financial services. Tata Iron and Steel, the biggest company in the Tata industrial grouping, saw net profits rise 42 per cent to Rs1.8bn on a 13 per cent increase in revenues to Rs37bn. Exports advanced 11 per cent to Rs7.1bn. The company expects further gains in 1994-95 as most of the modernisation programme in its steelworks was completed last year. Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (Telco), the Tata grouping's vehicle manufacturer, posted a 239 per cent rise in net profits to Rs1.02bn on a 21 per cent increase in turnover to Rs37.5bn. Telco, which has a 69 per cent share in medium and heavy lorries and 55 per cent in light commercial vehicles, said it benefited from a sharp increase in demand in the second half of the year. Larsen and Toubro, the diversified engineering and cement group, reported a 65 per cent rise in net profits to Rs1.96bn on a sales increase of 27 per cent to Rs22.0bn.</p>

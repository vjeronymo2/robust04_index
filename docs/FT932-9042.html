			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK INDEX futures ended an active week by trading in a narrow 10-point range for most of the day in a session lacking strong features, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 started trading at 2,849 and selling in the first hour of business saw it driven down to 2,841. June crept ahead better after that initial selling and traded around the 2,845 level for the rest of the morning. Stronger buying in the second half of the session saw the contract reach the day's high of 2,865 but buyers ran out of steam ahead of the close. The June contract closed at 2,859, around the level of its previous close but some 6 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 5, with turnover reaching around 8,300 contracts. In traded options volume was 27,986 contracts against a previous total of 34,727 lots. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 7,747 lots and the Euro FT-SE 100 2,807. BT was the busiest stock option at 2572 followed by Asda at 1,691 lots.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RULING UPHOLDS TENANTS' CLAIM  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday that a Van Nuys firm that  sells information on prospective tenants to landlords must stop reporting on  eviction cases that were dismissed or withdrawn before going to trial. Judge  Jerry K. Fields issued a summary judgment that prevents U. D. Registry from  listing eviction cases that were dismissed. Fields' ruling came in a case filed  in 1987 on behalf of nine tenants who claim they have been denied housing based  on the information contained in U. D. Registry reports. A trial for damages in  the case is to begin in July.  </P> <P> David S. Pallack, an attorney with San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal  Services of Pacoima, said the ruling was a "significant advance" for tenant  rights. He said state and federal laws prohibit reporting eviction cases won by  the tenant. Dismissal of a case, which allows the tenant to stay on at the  rented residence, should be considered the same as a tenant victory, Pallack  said.  </P> <P> Harvey Saltz, owner of U. D. Registry, said he plans to appeal the ruling.  </P></p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Indonesia 'tortured East Timor leader' PORTUGAL has accused Indonesia of using torture to force Mr Xanana Gusmao, the captured East Timor resistance leader, to renounce his cause on television. In his statement Mr Gusmao called on fellow Fretilin guerrillas to surrender and abandon the struggle for independence in the former Portuguese colony. Portuguese President Mario Soares said Mr Gusmao had been tortured and threatened. He had had no lawyer and no opportunity to defend himself. Mr Gusmao was shown on Indonesian and Portuguese television in a film shot by the Indonesian military being interviewed by Mr Abilio Osorio Soares, the pro-Indonesian governor of East Timor. Reversing all his previous beliefs, Mr Gusmao, who has led the struggle against Indonesian rule from mountain strongholds for the past 16 years, said he acknowledged East Timor's integration into Indonesia as 'progress'. Mr Gusmao appeared tired in the film. The Indonesian government has accused Mr Gusmao of organising a pro-independence march in November last year in which more than 50 demonstrators were shot dead by troops. Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, said it appeared Mr Gusmao's statement was forced from him. Indonesian officials have said Mr Gusmao will be treated according to the law and have assured foreign diplomats that he would not be maltreated. Poor relations between Jakarta and Lisbon have led to Portugal blocking a trade agreement between the European Community and the six-nation Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) in protest at alleged human rights abuses in East Timor. Diplomats say the sharp exchanges over Mr Gusmao's treatment may jeopardise discussions between Indonesia and Portugal under the auspices of the UN scheduled for later this month. Indonesian troops occupied East Timor in 1975 when the Portuguese colonial rulers withdrew.</p>

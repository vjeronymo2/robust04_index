			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Fereydun Bakhtiari Authorized To </F> Enter Switzerland"]    [Text] Bern, 7 Apr (ATS) -- Fereydun Ilkhan Bakhtiar [name  as received] has been granted approval to enter Switzerland. He  thus will be able to register as an asylum seeker, Federal  Refugee Office (ODR) spokesman Heinz Schoeni said Thursday [7  April]. A cousin of the former shah's prime minister, Shapur  Bakhtiar, arrived at Geneva Airport without a passport on 22  March. Claiming to be in danger if he was sent back to Tehran,  he spent the intervening period in Cointrin's [Geneva airport]  transit area, under threat of expulsion back to Iran.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): Nordic devaluations are balanced by strong stock market gains TURMOIL IN the currency markets was the greatest influence on European equity markets in the final quarter of 1992, but the countries forced to devalue their currencies were consoled with the best-performing stock markets. According to the FT-A World Indices, Finland, which decided to let the markka float in September, made the greatest gain in the quarter: 37.1 per cent in local currency terms. Sweden, which followed Finland's lead in November, came second with a rise of 33.4 per cent, and Italy came third with a rise of 26.9 per cent. The gains in Finland and Sweden helped to propel the Nordic index 21.9 per cent higher, compared with a gain of only 10.1 per cent for the whole of Europe. Stock market analysts were not surprised by the extent of the gains, triggered by the various currency devaluations, which in general led to an improvement in the international competitiveness of countries whose currencies have been devalued. In particular, Sweden is seen as a major beneficiary of devaluation, because of its many international companies, which have undergone extensive restructuring over the past two years. However, Hoare Govett has advised clients to avoid Swedish companies with the highest exposure to Germany, where the economy is expected to slow this year, and concentrate instead on US-sensitive and cyclical stocks. Towards the end of the year, continental markets were lifted by traditional year-end rallies, fuelled by hopes of a recovery in the US economy and of a cut in interest rates in Germany early in 1993. However, analysts warned at the time that these hopes must be countered by signs of deteriorating earnings growth on the continent and danger signals from Germany about its economy. Fear of economic recession, and profit warnings from the corporate sector, contributed to the lacklustre performance of the German market in the final quarter. It rose only 4.2 per cent in local currency terms. During the whole year it lost 5.3 per cent but, in sterling terms, it rose 9.6 per cent, due to the strength of the Deutsche Mark and the pound's weakness. Kleinwort Benson underweighted Germany in its recommended asset allocation for 1993, given what it called the appalling outlook for earnings. In its view, both macro forecasts for the economy and micro forecasts for individual companies were still far too high. Furthermore, the longer the Bundesbank kept interest rates high, the harder the inevitable revaluation of the D-Mark would hit the earnings outlook. France, on the other hand, should be the main beneficiary if the Bundesbank cuts interest rates, because this would take pressure off the franc and pave the way for lower interest rates in France. Hoare Govett recommended an overweight position in French equities for 1993, given its above-average GDP growth (1.5 per cent in 1993, compared with 1.2 per cent for the Netherlands, 1.0 per cent for Spain, 0.8 per cent for Switzerland and a fall of 0.8 per cent in Germany) and low inflation. Switzerland, the best performer in Europe in 1992 with a rise of 21.8 per cent in local currency terms, is also expected to do well in 1993. In December, Goldman Sachs believed there was scope for an earnings growth-driven rise in the Swiss index of between 12 and 13 per cent over the coming 10-to-14 months, and that equities should outperform both bonds and cash. Strategists at SG Warburg offered some words of caution regarding continental European equities in 1993, which they believed would be largely held back by deteriorating earnings growth prospects. 'We believe that earnings momentum, rather than interest rates, holds the key to performance in Europe (historically this has certainly been the case),' the broker said in its 1993 asset allocation outlook.</p>

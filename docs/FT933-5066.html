			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Clarke to bolster finance initiative MR KENNETH Clarke, the chancellor, will this week use his first big speech after the August holidays to attempt to inject fresh momentum into the government's flagging private finance initiative. Addressing the Scottish Confederation of British Industry in Glasgow, Mr Clarke is expected to announce that a government guide to the initiative - which is intended to encourage the use of private investment for public projects - will be published this month. The guide will be aimed primarily at industry and financial institutions. He is also expected to foreshadow a possible solution to one of the problems hampering the sort of private and public-sector partnerships that the government is trying to nurture - the Treasury requirement for competition for public-sector contracts. Such competition can act as a disincentive to companies coming up with innovative proposals because, once adopted, the proposals must be put out to competitive tender for implementation. A company devising a project could find a competitor winning the contract to build it. One way forward would be to examine the intellectual property rights of project proposals so companies that develop them could be paid for their efforts. The chancellor's comments in the speech, which will also focus on the Scottish economy, will be eagerly awaited by industrialists and financiers who are keen to see progress on the private finance initiative. The initiative was launched with much publicity in last year's Autumn Statement. But since then the government has announced no significant new public-sector project involving private finance and the hiatus has caused concern. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said recently that the initiative would be discredited unless 'real holes can be dug in the ground pretty soon'.</p>

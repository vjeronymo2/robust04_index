			<p>BFN     [Text] Saraburi: More than ten thousand Hmong hilltribes  will remain in the Tham Kabok Buddhist sanctuary until they are  cured of their drug addiction and the Thai government decides to  resettle them, said Phra Chamrun Phanchandra, the abbot of Tham  Kabok.    The abbot said his duty is to cure those addicts and provide  them with vocational training. Many members of the Hmong  hilltribes, who lived in the highland areas of Laos before being  driven out by political turbulence, are addicted to smoking  opium.    "If the government is concerned about any negative impact to  its security, it can let me know and I will stop treating them  and do whatever the government wishes me to," said Phra Chamrun.    The abbot is known for his dedication to the treatment of  drug addicts at his Buddhist center. So far, a large number of  Hmong people have come to him for treatment, bringing along  their family members and dependents.    These people came from the northern Thai-Lao border area  which was used as a springboard by Hmong rebels for fighting  against the communist Laotian government. The anti-Lao Hmong  were trained by the CIA during the Indochina War to fight for  the right-wing Lao faction against the communist Pathet Lao.    After the fall of Laos in 1975 to the communist Pathet Lao,  the Hmong were driven to the border area near northern Thailand  where they staged their resistance. The Vientiane government  has tried to wipe out the Hmong resistance, but these people  sought refuge in Thailand, thus creating a sore point in  Thai-Lao relations.    The Laotian government wants Thailand to stop providing  refuge to the rebels. However Thailand feels that they are  providing the refugees with humanitarian aid.    Some Laotian officials have accused Thailand of helping the  Hmong resistance but these charges were countered by the Thai  military's challenge that Laos provide evidence to back up its  claims. Abbot Chamrun said: "We have some contacts with the  Laotian (government) side ... but we have yet to arrange a  formal meeting."    The dedicated Thai monk, who won a Magsaysay award for his  contribution to the treatment of drug addicts, now wants to  resettle the Hmong: "They need to be cured first. After they  are cured, I would like to see them resettled in a lowland area  so that they won't go back to drugs again.    Right now, another batch of about 2,000 Hmongs want to come  and receive treatment here, but there's no place for them.</p>

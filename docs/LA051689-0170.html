			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THREAT TO 'TELL ALL' ANGERS TEAM;  </P> <P> BENGALS' PLAYERS, COACHES BACK BANNING OF WILSON  </P> <P> Cincinnati Bengals players and coaches say the National Football League acted  appropriately in permanently barring former Bengals running back Stanley Wilson  from the league because of his chronic drug use problems.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying I'm glad about it, but I do feel the man is getting what he  deserved," Cincinnati fullback Ickey Woods said.  </P> <P> "The league and the Bengals gave him a lot of chances to straighten up, but  he's obviously very sick. Maybe this will help him get back on track to a  complete life."  </P> <P> Bengals linebacker Reggie Williams said: "This is just another indication of  the need to protect the image and integrity of professional sports, as it  relates to drugs. It's unfortunate for Stanley, but it hopefully sends a  message, not only to active professional players but to college and high school  athletes as well."  </P> <P> Wilson, 27, suspended on the eve of the Jan. 22 Super Bowl, is back in drug  rehabilitation at a Phoenix clinic. His Los Angeles agent, Reggie Turner, has  said Wilson will implicate five other Bengals players in his drug episode in a  story that Wilson is selling to a nationally circulated magazine. Those  comments have angered Bengals players.  </P> <P> Turner has declined to identify the players who were supposedly involved.  Published reports have suggested that Penthouse will be publishing Wilson's  story, but a magazine spokesman has declined to confirm that.  </P> <P> Bengals coach Sam Wyche said he believes Wilson's ban is appropriate.  </P> <P> In a letter from NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle dated last Thursday, Wilson was  told he faces "a permanent ban from further participation in the NFL."  </P> <P> Woods has said he knows Wilson plans to name him as one of the players involved  in the Jan. 21 incident.  </P> <P> Asked if he believes that Wilson's permanent disqualification might lessen the  effect of a tell-all story, Woods said: "I don't know if it will lessen  anything. The only thing that matters is that any story about me being involved  is not true, and Stanley knows it's not true. I think the NFL has found out the  true story, and that's why I'm not worried."  </P></p>

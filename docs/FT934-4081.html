			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / People: Tabuchi emerges from hiding Is Setsuya Tabuchi, former chairman of Nomura Securities, finally coming out of hiding, asks Emiko Terazono. Otherwise known as 'Big Tabuchi', the man who was once king of Japan's securities industry, has been lying low since he was forced to resign in mid-1991 following the spate of securities scandals. However, many in the financial community see his meeting with prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa last Tuesday, when the stock market plunged to a year's low, as a prelude to his return to power. This return visit has encouraged investors, and the Nikkei average has since perked up slightly, helped by reports that Big Tabuchi was advising Hosokawa. Tabuchi, currently an adviser to Nomura, has been waiting to prove he has not lost his touch. He has been entertaining prominent politicians and officials of various countries, including Lady Thatcher. He says he only advised Hosokawa that public funds should be used to help the country's ailing banks with their non-performing loans. It was probably valid advice for leading politicians, many of whom have extensive shareholdings.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Remy Cointreau sales rise 12% to FFr2.6bn REMY Cointreau, the French wines and spirits group, yesterday said its sales had risen by 12.2 per cent to FFr2.6bn (Dollars 441m) in the six months ended September. The group said it had increased sales in all of its four principal divisions and forecast that pre-tax profits for the April-September period would be about 20 per cent higher than the FFr104m achieved in the same period in 1992. The strongest growth during the first half was recorded in champagne sales, which rose by 26.3 per cent to FFr252.2m. The group said its principal brands, Krug, Charles Heidsieck and Piper Heidsieck, had achieved the increase in sales without lowering prices. Cognac sales, which include Remy Martin, also enjoyed strong growth. Turnover in the division increased by 22.4 per cent to FFr1.1bn during the period. However, the group's liqueurs, wines and spirits sales saw much slower growth and increased by just 2.5 per cent to FFr727m. Last year Remy's net profits fell sharply - by 25 per cent to FFr202m - on the back of difficulties in the champagne market where producers were severely squeezed by weak demand and high grape prices.</p>

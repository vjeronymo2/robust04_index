			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMWAY TO SELL 2 AVON UNITS IF BID SUCCEEDS;  </P> <P> GIORGIO, PARFUMS STERN PROCEEDS TO PAY OFF DEBT  </P> <P> If Amway Corp. buys Avon Products, it will trade scents for dollars.  </P> <P> Amway, that is, will sell Avon's upscale fragrance subsidiaries -- Giorgio  Beverly Hills and Parfums Stern -- if it succeeds in its $2.1-billion takeover  bid for Avon. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Amway  disclosed Thursday that it would unload its retail units mainly to pay off some  of the debt from the proposed deal.  </P> <P> For Giorgio and Parfums Stern, a sale would mark the second time they have  changed hands in roughly two years. Long known for its "Avon Lady" direct sales  force, Avon entered the department store market in 1987 when it bought Giorgio  for $165 million and Parfums Stern for $160 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Based in Santa Monica  </P> <P> Giorgio's main fragrance, also known as Giorgio Beverly Hills, garnered sales  of more than $100 million in 1988. It was the nation's top-selling fragrance  offered exclusively in department stores. Avon in January introduced Red from  Giorgio Beverly Hills and has predicted that the new product will produce $100  million in new sales. The Giorgio business, now based in Santa Monica, employs  about 200 people.  </P> <P> The entire Avon retail division, including Giorgio and Parfums Stern but not  the company's vast door-to-door sales operation, generated pretax earnings of  $13.9 million on sales of $227 million in 1988.  </P> <P> The Giorgio fragrance was introduced in 1981 and has been associated with its  namesake, a boutique on Beverly Hill's Rodeo Drive. That boutique -- along with  its original name, "Giorgio Beverly Hills" -- initially was retained by former  Giorgio owner Fred Hayman when he and co-owner Gale Hayman sold the product to  Avon.  </P> <P> Under an agreement with Avon, however, Hayman relinquished the name this year.  Avon, which owns a boutique called Giorgio Beverly Hills New York in New York  City, plans to open a Beverly Hills store under the Giorgio name later this  year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rejects Claims of Suit  </P> <P> New York-based Parfums Stern also employs 200. Parfums Stern's brands include  Oscar de la Renta, Perry Ellis, Valentino and Uninhibited by Cher, which was  introduced in November.  </P> <P> Avon had no immediate comment on the proposal to sell its retail group.  </P> <P> Amway's SEC filing also rejected claims raised in a lawsuit Avon filed last  week that was intended to stop Amway from acquiring more Avon stock. The  federal suit alleges that the Amway-Jacobs partnership violated securities laws  by failing to inform government agencies of its interest in Avon. Amway's  filing said the complaint was "without merit."  </P> <P> Ada, Mich.,-based Amway, which sells personal and household products  door-to-door, proposed the $39-per-share buyout of Avon Wednesday, just one  week after Amway and Minneapolis investor Irwin L. Jacobs disclosed that they  had formed a partnership that acquired 10.3% of the New York-based cosmetics  giant. Amway, however, is now making the buyout offer without Jacobs.  </P> <P> Avon Chairman James E. Preston last week rebuffed the initial overture, saying  that the company was not for sale. He reaffirmed that stance in a letter to  Amway Wednesday, but said Avon's board would meet its legal obligations to its  shareholders by reviewing the buyout proposal.  </P> <P> Along with cutting its debt, Amway said it envisions divesting Giorgio and  Parfums Stern because their products do not fit the strategic plans of Amway,  which sells its products through an independent sales force and by catalogue.  </P> <P> "Amway wants to concentrate on the distribution business," said Roanne  Kulakoff, an Amway spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Amway would retain Avon's national and international direct sales operations,  according to the SEC document. Amway also said Jacobs may explore buying  Giorgio and Parfums Stern if its takeover goes through.  </P> <P> Some industry analysts said there likely would be others interested in buying  the businesses. Unilever PLC of Britain, Revlon Group and New Jersey-based  Cosmair are among those that might be interested, said Bonita Austin, an  analyst at Wertheim Schroder.  </P> <P> "Giorgio and Parfums Stern are both valuable properties, but Amway would be  crazy to keep them because they have no expertise in this area," Austin said.  </P> <P> Andrew Shore, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said the two subsidiaries  together are worth about $250 million.  </P> <P> "Uninhibited by Cher is expected to do well," he said, "and Giorgio and Oscar  de la Renta are great values."  </P> <P> The two subsidiaries have been key to Avon's business strategy, according to  John Cox, an Avon spokesman.  </P> <P> "Part of our strategy is to become the world's leading provider of beauty and  beauty-related products," he said. "To do that, you need to be in the retail  market."  </P> <P> Avon's 1.4-million-member independent sales force sells cosmetics, fragrances  and small gift items for the home. A number of writedowns for discontinued and  divested operations in retirement homes and health services contributed to  Avon's 1988 loss of $404.5 million on sales of $3.06 billion.  </P> <P> Amway's products include toiletries, cosmetics, soaps and home-care, health and  fitness goods. A privately held company with 1 million independent  distributors, it had sales of $1.8 billion in the fiscal year ended Aug. 31,  1988.  </P></p>

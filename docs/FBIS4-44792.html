			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Grants Go-Ahead to Aid Schemes"] </F>   [Text] The European Commission has given the go-ahead to a  number of state aid schemes throughout the Community. They have  authorised local authorities in Denmark to offer grants of up to  20 percent for the setting-up and expansion of Research Parks.    The purpose of Research Parks is to promote a closer  cooperation between firms and universities. The grants will  slightly ease the burden of paying for the park's facilities and  will partly finance the consultancy services offered to resident  firms.    Such benefits will be below the aid intensity of 50 percent  allowed under the SME [small and medium-sized enterprises]  guidelines for soft aid. The research Park is, in principle,  open to all firms, but in practise it is almost entirely small  companies (5-50 employees) which have been established in the  existing Parks (150-200 firms). The maximum grant local  authorities will be allowed to offer a Research Park will be  around ECU1.3 million.    On 16 February, the Commission gave the green light to a  Spanish R&amp;D State aid scheme for the aeronautical sector,  which  provides advances which are repaid in the event of a profitable  return.    It is pointed out that, in order to upgrade Spanish  aerospace  technology and meet the challenges of the next decade, specific  efforts need to be focused on important strategic objectives.  Depending on the availability of funds, the total maximum budget  appropriations for the implementation of the Plan will be  approximately ECU105 million from 1993 to 1998.    The firms likely to participate in the Plan are  geographically dispersed and often in Less Favoured Areas  (LFAs), as defined by the Commission. The firms benefitting  will repay the State contributions in the light of the  application of the results of the applied research/development  to products which they market, either individually or within  national or international cooperation programmes.    Where basic industrial research is all that is carried out,  the relationship with marketable products will come from the  application of the knowledge acquired as aerospace equipment is  developed and then marketed. Interest will be charged at 9  percent or at the cost of borrowing on the international market.  If the recipient does not implement the project in respect of  which aid is granted, the advance is repayable in full with  interest.    The Spanish authorities have confirmed that the final aid  intensity for applied research/development will conform to the  Community framework for State aids for R&amp;D (OJ C83/2 of  11-4-86)  and previous Commission decisions. The Commission therefore  raised no objections to the scheme under the application of  Articles 92(3)(C) of the EC Treaty and 61(3)(c) of the EEA  [European Economic Area] Treaty.    Regarding the implementation of the German R&amp;D State aid  scheme, "Basistechnologien der Informationstechnik" [Basic  Technologies in Information Technology], the Commission has also  raised no objections. The aim of this programme is to  strengthen basic research in the field of micro- and  optoelectronics on materials other than silicon. The scheme  aims to support fundamental and basic industrial research  relating to the Community framework for State aids for R&amp;D.  The  notified scheme is intended to follow a programme already  approved by the Commission which lasted until the end of 1993.  Those benefitting from the programmes include research  institutes, enterprises and universities. The budget amounts to  ECU194 million from 1994 to 1998.    According to the Community framework for State aids for  R&amp;D,  aid to scientific institutions, is not considered to be State  aid as far as the EC-Treaty and the EEA-Treaty are concerned,  unless the R&amp;D activities are undertaken on a contractual  basis  or in collaboration with the private sector. In so far as  universities and research institutes are conducting fundamental  research, its financing is not regarded as State aid.    The financing of collaborative projects between such  institutes and the private sector, however, is considered as  State aid. It follows from the criteria laid down in the  Community framework for State aids for R&amp;D that the aid  intensity in relation to the distance to the market place has to  be considered as the most important element when assessing the  impact of the aid scheme on trade and competition.    The notified intensity of 50-percent gross for basic  industrial research projects, 60-percent gross for this type of  research in the New Lander, 60 percent for SMEs and 65 percent  for SMEs conducting such research in the New Lander is in  accordance with the Community framework for State aids for  R&amp;D  and previous decisions by the Commission.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Sport: King William and Mary - Olympic equestrianism LITHE, loose-limbed and brave. 'Forward-going,' the horsey crowd would say. One could apply the words equally to Mary Thompson or King William, the chestnut gelding who carried her to victory in this year's Badminton three-day event. Thompson's place in the British equestrian team for Barcelona will be announced on Tuesday, and she is itching to get to Spain. 'I am just so looking forward to it. Can't wait. It's been my ambition to ride in the Olympics as long as I can remember,' she said, sitting tanned and T-shirted in the garden of her parents' home on the Devon-Dorset borders. 'Badminton is the top of the tree for an eventer but the Olympics has other magic.' Thompson is still refreshingly besotted with her sport. 'When you're riding cross-country, totally at one with your horse, who's going boldly and quickly around a big track, the thrill is amazing,' she says. 'Powering on towards the next fence with his ears right back. Nothing touches it.' Eventing can be as dangerous as motor racing. Does she get frightened? 'Only of spiders. I'm not too bad for nerves. My mother is a very calm, relaxed woman and I think I've inherited an inner calmness from her,' says Thompson. She lives in the family home, a modest cottage, rent-free with her father's part-time work as church verger. The village is as sleepy and pretty as any in England, a world away from the equine intensity of Newmarket or Lambourn. The Thompson yard, complete with hanging baskets, is a five-minute walk away. Half-a-dozen eventers, including King William, are trained there by Mary and two women grooms. 'I love these hills,' she says. 'I've lived here since I was three. I don't think I'd know how to get a horse fit on level ground. Whichever way you go from the stables you go up or down 600 ft.' If a horse is balking at water-jumps he spends time splashing around in the River Sid. Thompson's family are neither horsey nor affluent, two usual precursors of success in eventing. Her first riding was on a pony borrowed from the vicar and it was only after Mary started to shine in local pony club events that they scraped up the money to buy a horse. 'Mum and Dad haven't got any money and I so much wanted to event after I left school but it just didn't seem possible. I rented the stable we now have and did all kinds of jobs just to pay for it. I took in livery horses, did a butcher's round, Hoovered old people's houses and cleaned the local campsite loos. I even taught riding, although I now avoid it like the plague. I can't seem to get people to understand me although I'll happily school horses all day long.' One thread in her success is an eye for a horse. She spotted King William, a raw five-year-old with no known breeding line, and said: 'That's the one for me.' She was offered Pounds 120,000 for 'Willie' before Badminton. That was more than any event horse has sold for. He must now be worth much more. Beyond price is the relationship between horse and rider. Equestrianism is unique in the Olympics because the athlete depends on another sentient being. There is no comparison with the role of a professional jockey who may jet in from another continent to ride a horse he has never seen before. 'The link between horse and rider in eventing takes years to build up. It is simply total trust. He knows what you're thinking and vice versa,' says Thompson. 'He has to believe that the rider will only put him in a situation that it's possible to get through. At that stage they will do anything for you.' She is 31, though she professes to feeling older after the stress of Badminton. She led through the initial dressage section and had the two fastest times around the slippery cross-country course, but had a nerve-racking finale in the show-jumping. King William took exception to the waterfall in the arena and Thomson had trouble directing him. His hooves tapped many of the poles and it was a shaky finish. 'So often with bold and strong cross-country horses their show-jumping isn't careful enough,' says Thomson, who admits to disliking the discipline. 'Willie does seem to be improving a bit, thank goodness. He is also becoming very good indeed at dressage, which I like.' The X-factor for equestrians at the Olympics is that this is primarily a team event. The four riders in each team must put rivalries behind them and go for team points. 'You'll be riding to orders,' says Thomson, 'The first person out is usually asked to ride conservatively and that means you probably forfeit your chance of an individual medal. 'But this is one of the few sports where competitors all share information anyway. When you've come back from doing the track at Badminton, you'd instinctively tell the other riders where the problems are, or if there is a pothole at the waterjump. Perhaps it's trying to minimise the danger.' In Seoul, the British team took silver. This time they are favourites for gold. Thomson's strong voice trails away. She is so excited just going to Barcelona that she doesn't want to think about winning.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Leading Article: All change for Italian banks AFTER MORE THAN a year of delay, the strategy behind Italy's banking privatisations is now clear. Disposals of state shares in the country's banks are starting with the sale of the state holding company's 67 per cent stake in Credito Italiano. Once liberated from state control, Italian banks will be able to play a much more effective role as traders and shareholders in stocks of other companies to be privatised later. If the exercise goes according to plan, it should provide an important force for change in a banking industry which has been long shielded from competition. It will produce a welcome increase in overall Italian equity capitalisation. And it will bring in much-needed receipts for the administration of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who is struggling to maintain ambitious deficit-cutting policies in the face of a recession-induced fall in tax revenue. With every week that passes, government regrets must be increasing that privatisation did not start sooner. After a sharp fall in the Milan stock market since August, the sales are starting at an unpropitious moment. Both Credito and Banca Commerciale Italiana, scheduled for sell-off next spring, claim their profitability has increased this year. But after trebling in the four months after Italy's ERM exit in September 1992, Credito's share price has fallen by one-third this year. Financial market uncertainties are likely to increase as the countdown gets under way to new elections, probably next spring, which are intended to find replacements for a political class discredited by scandals. In view of the Italian authorities' overwhelming determination to make the Credito launch a success, and the bank's heavy exposure to the troubled Ferruzzi group, the shares are certain to be sold at a heavy discount. After the failure of initial efforts to sell Credito to a domestic or foreign institution, the government is trying to encourage interest from retail investors through a vigorously-marketed public offering. Although individual shareholders' stakes are being limited to 3 per cent, some institutions may form alliances to build a collective controlling stake. This would increase the likelihood of secure placement. But it would also run counter to Mr Ciampi's sensible objective of wider share owner-ship. Even after the Credito sale, longer-term prospects for the banking industry will remain cloudy. New, non-political leaders will be needed. Relatively high profitability will fall as competition increases. Consolidation of Italy's large number of regional banks, coupled with the relaxation of traditionally tight controls on branch opening, will lead to a smaller number of institutions with a wider spread of activities. During the next decade, the banks will play a crucial role in dismantling the apparatus of public sector corporatism of which they hitherto formed a part. The sell-offs under preparation are the first stage in a long journey.</p>

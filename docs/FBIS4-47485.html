Filippov, doctor of physical and </F> mathematical sciences; UDC 551.591:[681.78:629.7.05]    [Abstract] Work done at the Institute of Optophysical  Research on the development of databases and mathematical models  essential for reliable use of optoelectronic instruments carried  by spacecraft or aircraft and for the reliable interpretation of  the registered data is described. The information (measurement  conditions, meteorological and actinometric data) incorporated  in these databases is listed. The various programs written for  use with these databases are given: for readout and conversion  of the registered data from instruments having different forms  of output signals; for referencing output signals to  meteorological data; for data storage, correction and  accumulation; for issuance of data summaries upon interrogation;  for output of summarized tables or summaries of stored  information for given spectral ranges or geographic regions.  Such databases have been used in systems for simulating real  conditions with allowance for the regional peculiarities of  optical weather by applying synthesis principles. Work has been  done on mathematical simulation of complex three-dimensional  spatially extended scenes; the different stages in such image  modeling are outlined. Mathematical models of this type make it  possible to generate three-dimensional brightness images of  different size; to determine shadows from solar coordinates and  thereby to make adequate allowance for the distribution of  terrain illumination; to transform the synthesized images to any  observation conditions. In essence, this article represents a  summarization of the materials covered in the listed  bibliography and serves as an introduction to certain articles  in this issue of the journal.

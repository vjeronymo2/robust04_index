			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Nordic bank advances 26% Correction (published 10th October 1992) appended to this article. NORDIC Investment Bank has posted profits at eight months up 26 per cent to SKr32m (Dollars 5.87m) from SKr25.4m in the same period in 1991. The performance of the Helsinki-based bank, owned by the five Nordic countries, stands in sharp contrast to the results of most other major banks in the region, which have been ravaged by high credit losses. The bank made a charge of only SKr1m in the latest eight months in respect of anticipated loan losses. Mr Jannik Lindbaek, president, said: 'We don't see any immediate risk of credit losses in our portfolio, mainly because of our conservative lending policies.' CORRECTION PROFITS at the Nordic Investment Bank rose 26 per cent to SDR32.0m (Dollars 48m) in the first eight months of the year. This was incorrectly reported in yesterday's Financial Times. The latest figure compares with an SDR25.4m profit in the comparable 1991 period. The Helsinki-based bank, which is owned by all five Nordic countries, charged SDR1m in the latest eight months in respect of anticipated loan losses.</p>

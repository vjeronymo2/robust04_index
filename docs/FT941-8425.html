			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Markets: Latin American markets draw the investors - At a glance International investors moving money out of Asia and looking for new, more profitable destinations have been pushing up Latin American stock markets. There has been a 20 per cent rise in dollar terms since the start of the year, following strong performance in 1993. The region still has economic problems, but the North American Free Trade Agreement is expected to have a beneficial effect. Three new UK investment trusts specialising in Latin America will shortly be adding to the flow of funds to the region. The launches of Edinburgh Fund Manager's Inca trust, Templeton's Latin American trust, and Morgan Grenfell's Latin American trust have all been announced within the past two weeks. Public offers for the funds open in March or April.</p>

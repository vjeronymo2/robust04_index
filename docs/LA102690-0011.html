			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BOWE BEATS COOPER TO STAY UNBEATEN  </P> <P> Olympic silver medalist Riddick Bowe remained undefeated Thursday night by  stopping Bert Cooper at the end of the second round of their scheduled 10-round  heavyweight fight.  </P> <P> Bowe knocked Cooper down late in the second round, then again as the bell  sounded, prompting referee Richard Steele to move in and stop the fight at 3:09  of the second round.  </P> <P> The fight was the featured bout on the undercard of the undisputed heavyweight  championship fight between James "Buster" Douglas and Evander Holyfield at the  Mirage Hotel and Casino.  </P> <P> Bowe, winning his 20th straight fight as a pro and 18th by knockout, started  slowly but began finding the range with right hands in the second round.  </P> <P> With about 20 seconds left in the round, Bowe landed a big overhand right that  buckled Cooper's legs, then followed with another right that put him down.  </P> <P> Cooper was up at the count of five, but Bowe, 230 of Brooklyn, N.Y., was on top  of him quickly and landed a series of blows that put him down for the second  time as the bell sounded to end the second round.  </P> <P> Steele counted to five before waving the fight to a close.  </P> <P> Cooper, 208 of Philadelphia, fell to 22-7.  </P> <P> It was Cooper's second straight loss to a member of the 1988 Olympic team. In  August, he dropped a 12-round decision to heavyweight gold medalist Ray Mercer.  Bowe fought in Seoul as a super-heavyweight.  </P> <P> Another Olympic teammate, light-heavyweight Andrew Maynard, also won Thursday  night, scoring a unanimous eight-round decision over Keith McMurray of Las  Vegas.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIETY: BEST OF CHEER FLOWED AT DAY OF WINE, ROSES  </P> <P> The best place in town to buy fine vintage wines Saturday was the University of  San Diego, which was so overstocked with the stuff that, had an earthquake  shattered all the bottles, the campus might have come floating down off its  hilltop.  </P> <P> About 300 California wineries, which together garnered 500 bronze, silver and  gold medals in the San Diego National Wine Competition held in May, donated a  case of each winner to be sold at the seventh annual Wine &amp; Roses Charity  Tasting, co-hosted at USD by the Juniors of Social Service and the local  chapter of the California Assn. of Nurserymen. More than 60 of the wineries  also poured at the afternoon "debut" tasting of competition winners and the  follow-up evening event; between them, the two tastings attracted more than 800  accomplished or budding oenophiles.  </P> <P> The proceeds from the event, which co-chairwoman Vera Campbell estimated will  exceed $40,000, will be shared by the two host organizations and will benefit  Camp Oliver in Descanso and the nurserymen's scholarship program.  </P> <P> "Putting 'Wine &amp; Roses' together was like having a baby, since I've been  working on it for nine months," said Campbell. "But we all believe strongly in  our charity, which makes the work enjoyable for us all."  </P> <P> The work certainly looked enjoyable for the hundreds who strolled through the  university's Camino Patio during the debut tasting, nibbling on cheese and  pates between nips of wines from such vintners as Rabbit Ridge, Hart, Trefethen  and Culbertson. Few braved the insistent sun to dance in the open to a band  called Passions, but most did stop to smell the flowers -- 25 nurseries donated  more than 2,000 potted flowering plants and shrubs.  </P> <P> The university also will come up smelling like roses from the event because the  nurseries planted dozens of these around the courtyard, where they will remain  until Wine &amp; Roses '91, at which time they will be replaced with new  plantings.  </P> <P> The committee included Donna Vance, Roseanne Lindsay, Lorie White, Jan  Kincannon, Carolyn Robbins, Pam Palisoul, Erminia Taranto, Suzanne Koch, Pat  MacLaggan, Toni Welk, Julee Ault, Wendy David, Marion Jacobs, Camille Nielsen,  Sherry Lichty and Jane Pentelei-Molnar.  </P> <P> At the close of the opening-night performance of the Mainly Mozart Festival,  the several hundred patrons were, in the main, enthusiastic but also mostly  hungry.  </P> <P> The festival directors had anticipated just such an occurrence at Thursday's  benefit performance and arranged for several leading restaurateurs to donate  sufficient elegant snacks and pastries to load down a circle of buffets  arranged around the lawn of the Sculpture Garden at the San Diego Museum of  Art.  </P> <P> Guests picked up glasses of champagne en route to tables featuring such things  as the chocolate pate brought by chef Doug Organ of the Brasserie, and the  rather unusual pastry-wrapped mix of braised skate wings and black beans  whipped up by Ernest Wally of Chef Wally's Bistro.  </P> <P> If the guests feasted on tidbits and cakes, conductor David Atherton and the  musicians feasted on compliments as well as more solid rations. One of the more  lionized musicians was concertmaster William Preucil, whose violin solo in  Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 3 had quieted even the birds that earlier had  chattered out of time to Atherton's baton.  </P> <P> Veryl Mortenson organized the open-air reception and declared herself delighted  with the turnout, although she added that she was amazed there had been any  empty seats in the Old Globe Theatre's Lowell Davies Festival Stage.  </P> <P> "I thought there would be people standing in the streets. Even the local  restaurateurs showed their faith in us by donating all this food," she said.  </P> <P> Donald Worley and Blaine Quick, president and chairman of the Mainly Mozart  board, both expressed the belief that the festival will become a San Diego  cultural fixture.  </P> <P> "After all the anticipation and waiting, tonight's performance seemed to be  over so quickly," said Worley. "But it was wonderful and so gratifying to see  so big a crowd -- the crowd is what we've all worked for -- and I think we're  an established part of the performing arts scene now that we're in our second  year."  </P> <P> "This festival absolutely adds to the cultural dimensions of San Diego, and it  will more and more in years to come," said Quick.  </P> <P> Most major festival patrons attended the opening-night performance and  reception, including Lee Julien and Robert McDaniel of the festival's title  sponsor, the Kingston Hotel; the pair made a brief appearance at the reception  before returning to their hotel, which declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy the  following day.  </P> <P> Among others in attendance were Hermann and Trude Zillgens, Damon and Carolyn  Siskin, Joyce Dennis with Joe Abrahamson, Joe Merante, Don Capener, D'Neane  Wilkinson, Robert and Bea Epsten, Donald McVay, Gary and Nancy Laturno, Chuck  Weghorst, Erich Steinbock, Connie Smith, Eleanor Roth, Jeffry and Sandra  Schafer, and Marsha Sewell and Mike Shea.  </P> <P> Harry Connick Jr., the 23 year-old pianist and crooner who has been discussed  as the next Frank Sinatra (Sinatra's opinion is unknown), was announced Friday  as the star of the second annual "Monday Night Live" gala benefit for the La  Jolla Playhouse, to be given July 16 at the playhouse's quarters on the UC San  Diego campus.  </P> <P> Charmaine and Maurice Kaplan hosted an underwriters dinner Friday at the new  Canes bistro in Hillcrest at which "Monday Night" chair Judith Harris announced  that Connick and his 21-piece orchestra will entertain after a backstage  dinner. According to Harris, Connick has promised to engage in post-performance  mingling with guests at the $250- and $350-per-person fund-raiser, a major  league soiree that last year managed to handily muscle its way onto the already  jammed summer calendar.  </P> <P> Among those downing baked salmon and berry tartlettes at Friday's dinner were  Peter and Peggy Preuss (Peggy shared chairwomanship duties with Charmaine  Kaplan at the inaugural "Monday Night" last year); playhouse artistic director  Des McAnuff and his wife, Susan Berman; theater angel Mandell Weiss; Robert  Singer; Willard and Eileen VanderLaan; Ivor and Colette Royston; Audrey Geisel;  Sandra Pay; Kate Adams with David Copley; Neil and Barbara Kjos; Rita  Bronowski; Larry and Junko Cushman; George and Martha Gafford and Rita Gittes  with Bill Woods.  </P></p>

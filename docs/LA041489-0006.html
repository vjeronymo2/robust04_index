			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Everyone's a bit nervous about gunfire in Los Angeles these days. Hence, the  bulletin from a Los Angeles Police Department dispatcher informing all units  that the Police Academy's outdoor pistol range in Elysian Park would be closed  Thursday.  </P> <P> The fusillades might have proven distracting to fans at the afternoon season  opener in nearby Dodger Stadium -- especially during the long, quiet periods of  inaction in the low-scoring game.  </P> <P> Some drivers conduct business via a car phone or car fax machine. Others are  more old-fashioned. A motorist in a small pickup, stalled in Dodger traffic on  Sunset Boulevard, spotted a ticket scalper on foot. Wishing to peruse the goods  for a few moments, the driver beckoned for the scalper to jump into the bed of  the truck. After they had inched forward about half a block, the driver  signaled that he would take the tickets. He handed the money out the window to  the salesman, who happily bounded back onto the street.  </P> <P> It's a different kind of lottery.  </P> <P> When fourteen abused pets are put up for adoption at noon today, potential  owners will pick numbers -- from the proverbial hat -- to determine when  they'll be allowed inside to view the animals. The lowest numbers get in first  to bid on the creatures, including 12 dogs (six of them rare fawn-and-blue  Doberman puppies), one kitten and one cockateel. (The bird's owner was jailed  for making animal sacrifices.)  </P> <P> The recovered pets will be on display at the Society for the Prevention of  Cruelty to Animals at 5026 W. Jefferson Blvd.  </P> <P> The unusual procedure of viewing them was adopted because 400 people showed up  last year to claim 42 animals that had been taken from owners prosecuted for  abuse or neglect.  </P> <P> "It's like a personal statement," said Sgt. Cori Whetstone, an SPCA field  supervisor, "like someone saying, 'I can't stop (animal abuse), but if I can  take one into my home I have done something about it.' "  </P> <P> The winning entry in the West Coast Gateway Competition -- the controversial  proposed monument across the Hollywood Freeway -- is going on public display  in. . . .  </P> <P> San Francisco.  </P> <P> Drawings and a scale model of the futuristic structure, called "Clouds of  Steel" by its creators (and compared to the recently collapsed overpass on  Firestone Boulevard by others), will star in an 8-week exhibition at a gallery  there.  </P> <P> It's a bold move. No doubt the very idea of a freeway artwork will elicit  special attention from such Los Angeles-baiters as columnist Herb Caen, the  Bard of Baghdad-by-the-Bay.  </P> <P> Caen, you may recall, paid tribute to Los Angeles' smoggy car culture by  dubbing the city "Lozangeles" and once described its average inhabitant as "a  well-preserved, middle-aged, middle-class, two-door Chevrolet." (That was  before foreign cars became dominant.)  </P> <P> You know you're in the Soap Opera capital when the ad for a local television  news show features a wife telling her husband, "I woke up with someone new this  morning" -- meaning the station's 6 a.m. broadcast.  </P> <P> The modest number of votes drawn by Tom Bradley in Los Angeles' municipal  election didn't escape the notice of neighboring Burbank's Johnny Carson. In  his monologue the night after the election, Carson responded to the audience's  applause with the quip: "I just got a bigger mandate than the mayor of Los  Angeles." Noting that just 23% of the electorate voted, Carson added, "Chicago  gets a bigger turnout from the dead."  </P> <P> Another reason to obey the law: Due to a reported absence of water pressure,  the plumbing broke down on at least five floors of the Los Angeles County  Criminal Courts Building on Thursday.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- Speaking to a UNIAN correspondent, a  representative of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense press centre  denied Russian media reports (particularly those by ITAR-TASS  and Ostankino) about Ukrainian-Russian military consultations in  Kiev on the future fate of the nuclear arms deployed on the  territory of Ukraine, allegedly due to start on 5 January with  the participation of Defense Ministers Vitaliy Radetskyy and  Pavel Grachev. "The Ministry of Defense did not plan for such a  meeting on 5-6 January," the press centre representative said.  He added that work is in progress on preparations for a  bilateral agreement on military cooperation, and  Ukrainian-Russian military consultations on the issue were  already held on 28-29 December in Moscow. According to an  earlier UNIAN report, the Ukrainian delegation was led by Deputy  Minister of Defense Ivan Oliynyk.    In the view of a high-ranking Ministry of Defense  representative who would not give his name, a meeting of  Ukrainian and Russian defense ministry delegations on the  nuclear arms issue will be possible only after the problem is  discussed by the presidents of both countries, or at least by  government delegations.</p>

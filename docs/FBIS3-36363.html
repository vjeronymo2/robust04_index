			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vadim Ogurtsov: "`Don's Choice' Protests"] </F>   [Text] The inner soviet and administration of the Don have  adopted a decision on elections to representative bodies of  state power in Rostov Oblast and organs of local  self-government. But the "Russia's Choice" territorial bloc,  which calls itself "Don's Choice" here, has very strongly  protested the Statutes on Elections to the Legislative Assembly,  approved by an oblast inner soviet decision. In the first  place, State Duma deputy B. Titenko and other members of the  bloc's regional political council stressed at a press  conference, the inner soviet "adopted" this document after the  new Russian Constitition depriving the old structure of its last  juridical rights and powers had come into effect. According to  the political council, the situation is not remedied by the  "invitation to representatives of parties and movements," which  was essentially a variation on "nationwide discussion." The  Soviet's decision and confirmation followed as before.    The blatant breach of the principle of separation of powers,  since the "statutes," even at local level, do not allow a  deputy's duties to be combined with work in the executive organs  of power, is described as the second flaw.</p>

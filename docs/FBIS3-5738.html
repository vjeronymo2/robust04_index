"Our doors are still open," Ranariddh told reporters after  he  and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen held talks with U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher. "No negotiations, but we are ready  to talk," Ranariddh said, adding that the Khmer Rouge "have to  be more reasonable."    Ranariddh and Hun Sen arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday to  attend  a two-day international conference on aid to Cambodia which  began Thursday. In his address to the conference, Ranariddh  urged the international community "to help...solve the question  of the Khmer Rouge as best it can" by seeing to it that the  provisions of the October 1991 Paris peace agreements on  Cambodia are strictly implemented.    In a barb clearly aimed at neighboring Thailand, which has  been repeatedly accused by the Cambodian Government of allowing  the Khmer Rouge sanctuary across the border, Ranariddh urged all  signatories of the Paris agreements to fully respect them.    Ranariddh's father King Norodom Sihanouk, in a message read  out at the conference, held out an olive branch to the Khmer  Rouge, saying that "the door remains open to the most moderate  elements and I do not despair of their future integration, there  being an irresistible spirit towards total national  reconciliation."    Christopher warned in his address that considering that the  Khmer Rouge has not yet disarmed, "the future of democracy in  Cambodia can hardly be taken for granted."</p>

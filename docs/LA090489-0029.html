			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> A VERSION OF SARAH VAUGHAN  </P> <P> Friday was a big day for Sarah Vaughan. Mayor Tom Bradley presented her with a  proclamation citing the date as "Sarah Vaughan Day" in Los Angeles, and she  opened a two-day stint with Marty Paich and the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the  Hollywood Bowl.  </P> <P> The honor was well-deserved. Vaughan has been a major jazz performer for most  of her 45 years in the business. But her reputation was not made in summer pops  performances with symphony orchestras, and the 11,878 listeners at Friday's  program heard only a mild, pastel version of Vaughan's once bold and colorful  style.  </P> <P> Repeatedly confessing to nervousness, she brought little sense of focus or  continuity to her set -- a problem compounded by programming that inevitably  followed a slow number with a fast one.  </P> <P> There were times, however, when the Vaughan artistry flashed with its old  glory: on "Sweet Georgia Brown" she conjured up a hard-rocking groove; "From  This Moment On" swung even harder; "In a Mellow Tone" was just mellow enough;  "So Many Stars," with its wide-ranging melody, was a perfect vehicle for her  still-gorgeous sound.  </P> <P> The finest moments came, for the most part, during the up-tempo songs, in part  because Vaughan's rhythmic energy was in fine fettle, perhaps even better than  in her earliest recordings. But the soaring, lyric soprano tones of her youth  -- among the most emblematic aspects of her style -- rarely rose above  contralto range, at best.  </P> <P> Occasional diamond-bright sparks of brilliance, usually occurring when she was  accompanied only by her trio of pianist George Gaffney, bassist Andy Simpkins  and drummer Cal Jones, led one to wish for a Vaughan performance uncluttered by  the busy distractions of such a grand setting.  </P> <P> Pianist Ramsey Lewis opened the evening with a surprisingly lethargic  collection of material. The crisp rhythms usually associated with his playing  made only fleeting appearances. His best moments, in fact, came during several  dreamily romantic pieces in which arranger/conductor James Mack took full  advantage of the Philharmonic's lush-sounding strings. Guitarist Henry Johnson  provided some much-needed vigor, especially during a brisk solo on "Since I  Fell for You."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUSBAND ACCUSED IN PROSTITUTE SLAYINGS;  </P> <P> DEPUTY'S WIFE CLAIMS HARASSMENT BY POLICE  </P> <P> The wife of Rickey Ross, the L.A. County sheriff's deputy accused of murdering  three South-Central prostitutes, complained Monday that investigators have been  conducting a campaign of harassment against the family.  </P> <P> Sylvia Ross also said she believes that her husband is innocent.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview with The Times, she said that officers repeatedly have  staked out the Ross home, shining flashlights in her face when she returned at  night from visiting her husband at the Los Angeles County Jail. Other officers,  she said, have followed a pattern of telephone harassment, calling the house on  numerous occasions to try to speak to her son -- even after being told he did  not want to talk to them.  </P> <P> On Friday, she said, LAPD officers threatened to beat her 21-year-old son,  Tony, unless he posed for a photograph while officers searched their Rialto  home. Tony Ross could be a witness, but is not considered a suspect in the  case, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Hodgman, who is prosecuting Ross.  </P> <P> "They've been watching us and harassing us ever since this case has been going  on," Sylvia Ross said. "We don't know why. We haven't done anything. . . . Why  are they still harassing my family? Give us a break here, this is America."  </P> <P> The LAPD's chief spokesman, Cmdr. William Booth, denied the accusations and  said officers had served a search warrant on the Ross' San Bernardino County  home Friday without incident.  </P> <P> He said the search turned up eight firearms that Ross had confiscated in the  line of duty, but failed to properly turn in to the department.  </P> <P> Ross was arrested on Feb. 23 when his county car was stopped by officers on a  South-Central street. The 40-year-old deputy, a narcotics investigator who had  18 years with the department, allegedly had been smoking cocaine in the company  of a prostitute when detained.  </P> <P> Two guns were found in the trunk of Ross' car. Police ballistics experts said  they tied one of the weapons to the murders of three prostitutes. The second  gun was not connected to any crimes, officials said. A preliminary hearing is  scheduled April 28 for Ross.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leave of Absence  </P> <P> Since the arrest, Sylvia Ross said, she has taken a leave of absence from her  job as an airline flight attendant and spends most of her time working in the  yard of the couple's home and visiting Ross in jail.  </P> <P> "My husband is not guilty," she said. "He will be proven not guilty. I stand  behind him 100%, and I love him dearly. My husband is a good person. My husband  didn't do these things."  </P> <P> Of the allegation of additional guns found at the house Friday, she said: "It's  not true. The truth will come out later."  </P> <P> Sylvia Ross said officers have been trying to interview her son and her  brother, whom she declined to name. Family lawyers have advised both men that  they do not need to answer investigators' questions.  </P> <P> About 9 a.m. Friday, LAPD officers, Los Angeles sheriff's deputies and a deputy  from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department arrived at the Ross home  with a search warrant for guns, Sylvia Ross said.  </P> <P> While most of the officers were upstairs, she said she was ordered to remain  downstairs with a deputy. A short time later, her son came down and was  confronted by two LAPD officers, according to both Sylvia and Tony Ross.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Request Refused, He Says  </P> <P> Tony Ross said one of the officers wanted to question him. Because family  lawyers had said he did not have to answer police questions, Ross said he  refused.  </P> <P> The officer, whose full name is unknown, replied ' "Fine, we're going to take a  picture of you,' " Ross said. Another officer then "grabbed me by my wrist (and  said) 'We can either make this easy or make this hard. I could beat your ass or  (you can) be still and I'll take the picture.' "  </P> <P> Ross said he allowed the picture to be taken because he feared the officer  would beat him.  </P> <P> According to police spokesman Booth, "While we were there, we did photograph a  young man who was there, but (there were) no beatings, no threats of beatings,  no confrontation."  </P> <P> However, Booth refused to say why investigators wanted to take the picture.  </P> <P> Asked about Sylvia Ross' accusations about harassment, Booth said: "Step by  step, I can't re-create every word, every conversation. If Mrs. Ross has made a  complaint to anyone, I'm not aware of it. I think a lot of us have some feeling  for the amount of stress that Mrs. Ross must be feeling right now. I don't want  to hammer on her at all."  </P></p>

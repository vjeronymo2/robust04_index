			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edward Amaya from the "Cripton" newscast] </F>   [Text] Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate for the  Conservative Party, spent some time with the foreign press this  morning. He spoke of the need to reinforce commercial relations  between our country and the United States. According to the  candidate, relations between the two nations should not revolve  around drug trafficking alone.    [Begin Pastrana recording] We cannot continue to maintain  relations based solely on the issue of drug trafficking. Trade  between the two countries is on the rise, and I believe it is  important for us and for the United States to reinforce that  commercial trade, increase our participation, and not continue  to base our relationship on drug trafficking alone. [end  recording]    Foreign correspondents from the United States, Mexico,  Argentina, and Spain met this morning with Andres Pastrana and  Luis Fernando Ramirez. During the encounter, Pastrana affirmed  that a peace process must begin with the insurgent groups during  the next administration.    [Begin Pastrana recording] When there is a will for peace,  peace can be attained. We have already seen this in Medellin  with the People's Militias, who demonstrated their desire for  peace, and the peace was signed. [end recording]</p>

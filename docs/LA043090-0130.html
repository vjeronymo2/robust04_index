			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> LUCY PREFERRED GAMES SHOW  </P> <P> Lucie Arnaz says her mother, Lucille Ball, kept her television on almost all  the time but preferred game shows to situation comedies.  </P> <P> "I don't think she liked sitcoms very much in general after a while," Arnaz  said in the May 7 issue of People magazine.  </P> <P> "But she did like to watch 'Wheel of Fortune.' Every night. Whenever we were  eating dinner, it was always on. I guess that's a sitcom in itself."  </P> <P> Miss Ball died in April, 1989.  </P> <P> Arnaz is the host for tonight's airing on CBS of the 34-minute pilot of "I Love  Lucy," taped in March, 1951, and never before seen on television.  </P> <P> "I thought maybe the pilot would make me cry or something, but I just laughed,"  she said.  </P></p>

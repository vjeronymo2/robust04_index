			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 DIE AS CAR IN CRASH PLUNGES OFF FREEWAY;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC: VEHICLE BURSTS INTO FLAME. FIVE WOULD-BE RESCUERS ARE INJURED.  </P> <P> Three people were killed and six others -- including three police officers and  two motorists who tried to rescue the victims -- were injured when a  two-vehicle crash on the Hollywood Freeway flung one car through a guardrail  and 25 feet down onto a parking area Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> The accident, which forced closure of three northbound lanes of the freeway  near Vermont Avenue, tied up morning rush-hour traffic throughout downtown.  </P> <P> The three who died were all occupants of a Toyota sedan that smashed through  the guardrail and slammed onto the pavement of a storage facility under the  freeway. Investigators said one of the victims apparently started to crawl free  from the wreckage before the car, which teetered for a moment, rolled over on  him and burst into flame.  </P> <P> None of the dead were immediately identified.  </P> <P> The three Los Angeles police officers and two motorists who helped them in  their frustrated attempts to save the occupants of the burning sedan were all  treated for smoke inhalation and released.  </P> <P> A woman in a pickup truck that collided with the sedan was treated for her  injuries at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital and released. She was not  identified.  </P> <P> California Highway Patrol Sgt. Mike Brey said the crash apparently was caused  by the driver of a third vehicle that left the scene after the accident.  </P> <P> "That vehicle made a sharp left to get on the freeway upon leaving the Vermont  on-ramp," Brey said. "It forced the woman's (truck) to collide with the Toyota.  A witness chased the unsafe-lane-change driver and was able to obtain a license  number. We are attempting to find the registered owner of that car."  </P> <P> Police said Sgt. Skip McOmber of the Police Department's Rampart Division had  been headed north on the freeway about 6:20 a.m. when he happened onto the  accident, which had just occurred. McOmber radioed for help.  </P> <P> Motorists Brett Heisinger, 23, of Fullerton, and Aaron Jackson, 24, of South  Pasadena, driving to work in separate vehicles, drove up about the same time.  </P> <P> "I saw the car go over the side and I stopped my truck," Heisinger said. "The  policeman (McOmber) was right behind me.  </P> <P> "I told him the car had just gone over the side," Heisinger said. "I could see  it was just starting to burn. I thought maybe we could save whoever was inside,  so I got a fire extinguisher from my truck and we ran 50 yards down the freeway  to an embankment, went down that, climbed over a fence and started shooting  that stuff on the car.  </P> <P> "But the fire wouldn't go out," Heisinger continued. "So the police officer and  I took a steel bar from the broken guardrail, wedged the bar under the burning  car and lifted it. The other guy (Jackson) pulled a guy out from under the car  as we lifted it."  </P> <P> Heisinger said that at the time, "I never even thought about the fire, or that  the car might explode. But after we got that guy out, the fire started going  pretty good, and we had to back away."  </P> <P> Officer Cornia Smith said she and her partner, Officer Josh Adler, were in  their patrol car about two blocks away when they heard McOmber's radio call.  </P> <P> "We got on an on-ramp and got up there as fast as we could, but the freeway  traffic was all stopped," Smith said. "We couldn't drive through it, so we got  out and ran through the traffic, jumped over the guardrail and ran down the  embankment and across the street (Heliotrope Drive) to where the car had  landed. It was still burning."  </P> <P> Smith said she and Adler tried to reach the car to rescue the two victims still  trapped inside, "but there was so much smoke and flame we couldn't even see in  it.  </P> <P> "We knew it was going to blow up, and then it did."  </P> <P> Realizing there was nothing more that could be done for those in the car, Smith  said, she and her partner clambered back up onto the freeway, to see what could  be done for the driver of the overturned pickup.  </P> <P> "Somehow, the woman had gotten out of it by herself," Smith said. "She was  dazed, confused. But she was out of the truck."  </P> <P> Traffic on downtown freeways and local surface streets was jammed for more than  three hours as a result of the crash.  </P></p>

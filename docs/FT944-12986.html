			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexican fatigue takes the shine off equities - Telmex results add to woes The past month has been an unrewarding time for investors in Mexico's stock market. Battered by poor third quarter results, the rise in US bond yields and an uncertain political environment, the IPC index has lost about 6 per cent of its value since the beginning of October, falling below the level reached at the end of last year. The drop has been most dramatic over the past week, following worse than expected third quarter results from Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the country's largest private company, which reported a rise of 1.5 per cent in net profit to 7.14bn pesos. US brokerages reduced year-end estimates for the company's earnings, and the value of Telmex's equity plummeted by 5 per cent on Tuesday, the day after its results were released. The steepness of the drop in Telmex's stock price took many analysts by surprise, since the profits were only modestly below analysts' forecasts. However, with investors already nervous about Mexico's economic and political situation, and with US bond yields moving upwards, 'many were looking for an excuse to sell the market', concludes Mr Borja Ussia of Grupo Moneda in Mexico. The stock market has proved especially vulnerable to movements in US bond yields and Wall Street because of its dependence on foreign capital to finance a current account deficit expected to reach Dollars 28bn this year, or 8 per cent of GDP. The rise in US yields has forced Mexico to let its domestic interest rates climb to attract the necessary foreign investment, damaging economic growth and raising the financing costs of Mexican companies. 'What is driving the market is the global liquidity shortage,' says Mr Jorge Mariscal of Goldman Sachs. If US bond yields continue to rise then he expects the market to suffer further - although in his view US bond yields have probably peaked, meaning that the market is well-placed for a strong recovery. Compounding the rise in US bond yields have been adverse political developments, following the presidential election in August and the assassination of the number two official in the ruling PRI party at the end of September. As a result, domestic interest rates have risen for four weeks running, and now stand at over 14 per cent, or over 7 per cent in real terms adjusted for inflation. The exchange rate has depreciated to 3.43 pesos against the dollar, near the top of its permitted band. 'The political situation is tense, the economy is still not strong and companies are not reporting good results,' says Mr Ussia. 'We have to resolve these problems before investors return to the market.' The Central Bank announced last week that reserves had fallen to Dollars 17.2bn, about Dollars 10bn less than the peak in February. The Central Bank is thought unlikely to want reserves to fall below Dollars 10bn, giving it little option but to permit further rate rises if the peso comes under further pressure. The political situation has deteriorated despite the convincing victory of Mr Ernesto Zedillo in August's presidential election, largely because of the assassination of Mr Ruiz Massieu, the number two official in the PRI, and the man in charge of negotiating political reform with the opposition. Mr Ruiz Massieu's assassination was allegedly ordered by a PRI federal deputy from the state of Tamaulipas. The assassination raised fears of a deep division in the ruling party, between reformers and hard-liners, which could make the country difficult to govern. Such concerns were fuelled by the deputy attorney-general investigating the case - Mr Ruiz Massieu's brother - who appeared to blame the murder on a group of old-style politicians, possibly acting out of personal or ideological motivation, an accusation vigorously denied by the PRI leadership, and not yet substantiated. The fall-out from Mr Ruiz Massieu's murder has come at an awkward time, with government ministers scrambling to position themselves for jobs in the next administration. The unity that normally characterises Mexico's ruling party in government has been noticeably absent in recent weeks. Nevertheless, many analysts predict that the political climate will improve when Mr Zedillo formally takes office on December 1. Mr Zedillo is expected to appoint many of the cabinet ministers closest to Mr Carlos Salinas, the outgoing president, to senior positions and deepen many of the economic reforms that have characterised his presidency. The economy is expected to pick up further next year, with a consensus forecast of 4 per cent growth, compared to 2.5 per cent for this year. Third-quarter results from banks and infrastructure companies indicated that credit growth and investment was picking up. Meanwhile, exports have increased rapidly, helped by a depreciation of nearly 10 per cent in the currency. The stock market is cheap by regional standards, trading at about 16.5 times 1994 earnings, according to Morgan Stanley, compared to a multiple of about 18 times in Brazil and 20 in Chile. Arguing that much of the bad news is already discounted, Salomon Brothers confidently asserted in a report this week that investors will shake off 'Mexican fatigue' over the next couple of months.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Ministers poised to agree Post Office sell-off The government is poised to press ahead with the sale of 51 per cent of Royal Mail and Parcelforce, ending months of speculation about the Post Office's future. The plan - under which Post Office Counters, which runs 19,000 sub-post offices, would remain in public hands - has emerged as the front runner among a series of options to be discussed by senior cabinet ministers tomorrow. A decision to proceed with the sale, which has been billed as the last big privatisation, could raise up to Pounds 2bn, probably via a share issue, but would be certain to unleash a political storm. Last night opposition politicians, union leaders and some Tory backbenchers opposed such a move. Even Lady Thatcher baulked at privatising the Royal Mail in 1987 when she was prime minister. By devising a compromise short of outright privatisation the government hopes to win over the large number of Tory MPs who have expressed concern about the impact of a sale on Britain's rural post office network. The plan is understood to take account of extensive consultations between Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Conservative backbenchers, during the government's 22-month Post Office review. There is a possibility ministers may delay a final decision until later in the year on the grounds that more public consultation is needed. Some ministers would prefer to limit the sale to 49 per cent of the Post Office's letters and parcels arms. The Conservative party's manifesto for the 1992 general election commits it to maintaining a nationwide network of post offices and a universal delivery service within a uniform price structure. Senior Post Office executives have been keen for some time to proceed with a partial privatisation, partly to facilitate the organisation's access to private finance. Earlier this month, Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive, revealed that the organisation had made a record operating profit last year. Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the Union of Communication Workers said last night the proposal meant Britain could 'wave goodbye' to the best Post Office in the world. He predicted it would mean 'electoral suicide' for the government. Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Conservative MP for Macclesfield, said he would not support the measure unless given a '100-per cent guarantee' that the government would hold on to its remaining 49 per cent stake.</p>

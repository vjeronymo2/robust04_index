			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Contact lens industry probed THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate the cost of contact lens solutions following complaints, Jane Fuller writes. The Office of Fair Trading referred the matter to the MMC yesterday on price and competition issues after a preliminary investigation of the Pounds 40m UK market for contact lens solutions was triggered by complaints from the public. The OFT said suppliers of contact lens solutions 'may be enjoying high rates of return, suggesting that price competition in this market is not as effective as it might be'. It said the leading suppliers - Allergan UK, part of a US group, and Ciba Vision UK, a subsidiary of Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland - might each have 25 per cent of the market. A report published last September in Which?, the Consumers' Association magazine, suggested that while a pair of contact lenses might cost about Pounds 110, the annual bill for lens-care products could be Pounds 123 to Pounds 197 for soft lenses and Pounds 89 to Pounds 147 for the gas-permeable type. According to the Association of Contact Lens Manufacturers, more than 1.5m people in the UK wear contact lenses, representing about 5 per cent of those who need some form of correction to their eyesight.</p>

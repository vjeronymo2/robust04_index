			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Howard's jail term plan rejected Mr Michael Howard's proposal that murderers of police and prison officers should stay in jail until they die was rejected by a specially convened meeting of cabinet ministers and officials yesterday. The home secretary had written to Mr John Major, the prime minister, last week seeking cabinet backing for an amendment to the criminal justice bill now before parliament which would ensure a life sentence for that category of murder would mean life. Mr Major was understood to be concerned that the move could be counter-productive in creating a violent category of prisoner who felt they had nothing to lose.</p>

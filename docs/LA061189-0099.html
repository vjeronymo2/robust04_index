			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BORDERLINE BUSINESSES;  </P> <P> TIJUANA VENDORS THRIVE SERVING ILLEGALS ON JOURNEY TO EL NORTE  </P> <P> "Con todo?" Francisca Gutierrez de Garnica asked the hefty man standing on the  other side of the fence. "With everything?"  </P> <P> It was yet another taco transaction in Tijuana. But this slice of business was  different, a singular snip of international commerce that embodies the  entrepreneurial spirit and binational character of the U.S.-Mexican border.  </P> <P> The fence through which Gutierrez, the taco vendor, handed her tasty rolled  delicacy was none other than the 10-foot-high barrier separating the United  States from Mexico. Her client was an undocumented migrant waiting just inside  U.S. territory in anticipation of nightfall and his trek farther north, into  the U.S. interior, where, he hoped, a job awaited him.  </P> <P> "Muy sabroso" he said of his quick repast, after having passed his payment of  1,500 pesos -- about 60 cents -- through the chain-link barrier that separates  north from south. "Very tasty."  </P> <P> It is international trade at its most basic and fundamental, a microcosm of the  booming commerce that characterizes the border zone.  </P> <P> As the international boundary line winds for almost 2,000 miles, through harsh  desert, jagged mountains, semitropical flatlands and fast-growing cities,  vendors and  </P> <P> other free-lance entrepreneurs are everywhere, trying to make a buck. Operating  from elaborate stands or with only simple coolers and boxes, the merchants  peddle items from beer to clothing, from burritos to doughnuts, cigarettes to  sodas. Other entrepreneurs act as guides and smugglers, while still others lift  customers across the shallow waters of the Rio Grande or erect home-made  bridges on the Tijuana River, charging minimal tolls. There is money to be  made.  </P> <P> Following their clients -- the hundreds of thousands of people who travel to  the international frontier each year trying to enter the United States without  papers -- the merchants set up shop on each side of the border, often  crisscrossing the line, and, in the case of several taco vendors in Tijuana,  often selling through the border fence to those waiting on the other side.  </P> <P> Their business rises and falls with the undocumented traffic: Many speak of the  booming days of 1985-86, before the revision in U.S. immigration laws, when  there were so many more customers, all potential taco consumers. Alas, many of  the long-time undocumented border crossers have become legal via the amnesty  program, and now go back and forth through the legitimate ports of entry,  bypassing the informal crossing points -- and diverting business from sundry  border sales persons.  </P> <P> "A few years ago, I used to sell 6 kilos of meat a day," said Rosario  Valenzuela de Ortiz, who, with her husband, sells tacos from Mexican territory,  alongside De Garnica's stand and the hole in the border fence. "Now," said De  Ortiz, known as la guera, or blondie, because of her hair color, "Now, maybe I  sell 4 or 5 kilos on a good day."  </P> <P> The drop-off in business, she said, prompted her to switch her principal sales  item last August from burritos to tacos, as the latter are cheaper and seem to  sell better.  </P> <P> "For some reason, they stopped buying the burritos," De Ortiz explained with a  shrug as she tended an array of tortillas being heated on her charcoal grill,  where a kettle of boiling water was also perched, ready for hot chocolate and  instant coffee mixes. Nearby bowls held beans, homemade red chili, chopped  onions and fresh cilantro, all transported daily by van from the family home a  few miles away.  </P> <P> De Garnica, who works alongside De Ortiz, has it somewhat easier. Her home is  just 20 yards from the fence, so she and her children transport everything on  foot. She began selling food directly from her home, she said, then moved up to  be closer to the action.  </P> <P> On a recent evening, near the two international taco stands, Julio, a shy  10-year-old, was pacing just inside U.S. territory, selling packages of chewing  gum, individual cigarettes and shots of tequila, the latter dispensed from a  bottle hidden inside his tattered sweater. Just on the other side of the fence,  his father sold beer from a cooler, another generational link in the border  business chain.  </P> <P> "The vendors serve a very specific market," noted Rosio Barajas Escamilla, an  economist at El Colegio de la Frontera Norte, a research institution in  Tijuana. "With the economic situation in Mexico, a lot of the vendors at the  border probably do a little better economically than the people in regular  jobs."  </P> <P> Indeed, surveys by El Colegio indicate that full-time vendors at street food  stands -- even more prevalent in Tijuana than strip shows and bars catering to  blue-eyed teenie-boppers -- typically earn two to three times the official  minimum wage of $4 to $5 a day. Mexico's economic crisis has forced many  wage-earners to seek alternate ways of making a living, and, along the border,  that sometimes means setting up food stands at popular international crossings,  be they legal or illegal entry points.  </P> <P> This peculiar borderlands service industry, of course, is dwarfed by the  multibillion-dollar commerce -- including assembly plants, tourism, the  import-export of foodstuffs, raw materials and manufactured goods -- that  dominates the region. But, for the undocumented immigrants, the vendors provide  amenities and a final touch of home, helping to ease this critical juncture in  the stressful and sometimes hazardous passage from Latin America into a nation  many still find bewildering.  </P> <P> "We have to wait here so long, of course we get hungry," said Jose Martinez, a  30-year-old native of the Mexican state of Guerrero who was standing just  inside U.S. territory, not far from several taco stands. "If they weren't  selling here, we'd have to walk back into Mexico to find food, or not eat  anything."  </P> <P> And, Martinez noted, there is another concern: Returning to Mexico means the  risk of being shaken down by Tijuana and Baja California policemen, who are  notorious for extorting money from migrants. "They take everything you have,"  noted Martinez, who was surrounded by a group of migrants as he spoke. Perched  on a hill above, uniformed U.S. border guards eyed the group warily.  </P> <P> The taco sales site favored by Francisca de Garnica and Rosario de Ortiz is a  well-traveled spot perhaps half a mile east of the giant port of entry at San  Ysidro. The spot is on a windy bluff -- Rosario Ortiz refers to it as Cuatro  Vientos, or Four Winds -- that affords expansive views of Tijuana, the border  and, stretching to the west, the Pacific Ocean. Dust in food is a constant  problem, especially when U.S. Border Patrol vehicles make their frequent  rounds, kicking up the earth, and, in particular, when the patrol's helicopters  pay low-flying visits.  </P> <P> While the border can be a dangerous place, the two women said they had  witnessed little violence in the four years each had spent there vending food.  A few hundred yards to the south, a cross on the Mexican side marks the spot  where a man was killed several months ago, residents said, although no one  seemed to know exactly how that happened.  </P> <P> Being in Mexico provides the vendors with a clear advantage, affording them  protection from U.S. immigration authorities. Agents frequently patch the holes  in the border barriers, but their handiwork is quickly undone by resourceful  border-crossers and their guides and smugglers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Afraid of Police  </P> <P> As for undocumented vendors just inside U.S. territory, Marshall L. Mehlos,  assistant chief Border Patrol agent, said that authorities usually warn them to  return to Mexico before taking them into custody. In some popular crossing  areas, notably the region known in San Diego as the soccer field, or, in  Tijuana, as Canon Zapata, the vendors have erected quasi-permanent stands and  exhibit little fear of la migra.  </P> <P> While merchants selling tacos from Mexican territory aren't violating U.S.  immigration laws, those vending them through the fence are clearly in violation  of some federal statutes, notably those requiring documentation for merchandise  sold in international trade. "Nothing should be just passed across the border,"  said Bobbie Cassidy, a senior inspector with the U.S. Customs Service in San  Diego.  </P> <P> Then, noted Cassidy, there are also assorted Department of Agriculture and U.S.  Food and Drug Administration laws. Not to mention county and city of San Diego  ordinances regarding sales of foodstuffs. But no one recalls any enforcement of  such regulations.  </P> <P> The fact is, U.S. law enforcement is barely a worry for the border taco  vendors. They've watched on hundreds of occasions as the vehicles of la migra  have arrived in clouds of dust, sending their clients scurrying back across the  fence. Francisca de Garnica, for one, says she has no desire to join the  legions headed north.  </P> <P> "I'm content here," said Gutierrez, a 42-year-old mother of 8, many of whose  children work alongside her at the stand and whose husband sells ceramic items  to tourists at the official crossing point. "We earn enough to live, and we're  never lacking something to eat."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP ACCUSED OF HIDING DATA ON PLAN'S ALLEGED ABORTION RIGHTS THREAT  </P> <P> Backers of a proposed anti-crime initiative charged Friday that Atty. Gen. John  K. Van de Kamp is hiding documents that relate to his conclusion that the  measure could be used to abolish abortion rights.  </P> <P> Four legislators said at a Capitol news conference that they suspect that the  documents Van de Kamp refuses to disclose show he is really playing politics  and that his assertion that the initiative could be used to repeal California's  legal protection for women seeking an abortion is not legally sound.  </P> <P> Richard Martland, one of Van de Kamp's top aides, said afterward that the  attorney general will continue to keep the documents confidential, even though  the four lawmakers said they will file a lawsuit next week to force their  disclosure.  </P> <P> The news conference was the latest salvo in a political skirmish over the  proposed crime victims justice reform act, for which signatures are being  gathered to place it on the June, 1990, ballot.  </P> <P> The battle is laden with implications for next year's campaign for governor.  </P> <P> It is backed by U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, the only Republican candidate, who hopes  it will boost his campaign. It is endorsed by former San Francisco Mayor Dianne  Feinstein, who is running against Van de Kamp for the Democratic gubernatorial  nomination.  </P> <P> Days after Feinstein announced her support for the initiative, Van de Kamp said  he feared a provision in it restricting the right of privacy could cause the  state Supreme Court to repeal abortion rights, which in California are  protected largely by a 1972 constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to  privacy.  </P> <P> He asked Wilson, who like Feinstein and Van de Kamp is pro-choice, to pull the  initiative from circulation and redraft it.  </P> <P> Wilson and other backers of the measure refused. They contend that its language  is clear that it applies only to criminal defendants.  </P> <P> The four lawmakers who held the news conference are Republican Sens. John  Seymour and Ed Royce, both of Anaheim; Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), and  Sen. Daniel Boatwright (D-Concord).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Documents Demanded  </P> <P> Seymour and Royce back Wilson, Boatwright has endorsed Feinstein and Kopp said  he expects to sit out the governor's race next year.  </P> <P> They said they have demanded that Van de Kamp release documents drafted in his  office relating to the initiative and showing the process he used to reach his  conclusion. They contend that the document should be public under the  California Public Records Act.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp has given them a list of 70 documents, several relating to the  abortion issue, but refuses to release them.  </P> <P> Martland said the documents are confidential because lawyers working for Van de  Kamp are allowed to advise him confidentially.  </P> <P> The lawmakers said they believe that the documents will show that Van de Kamp  was advised by his aides that the initiative would not affect abortion rights.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia) tried to get a procedural  waiver in the Senate to allow consideration of a second anti-crime amendment.  Keene's proposal is similar to the one supported by Wilson and Feinstein, but  it did not have the controversial language objected to by Van de Kamp.  </P> <P> The Senate, however, refused to give the amendment the green light, with  Republicans arguing that the measure was only an attempt to embarrass Wilson  and subvert the measure.  </P></p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Irish telecoms tariffs cut by competition Fierce competition has broken out in the international sector of the Irish telecommunications market, worth IPounds 200m (Pounds 192m) a year, since the state-run telecommunications company Telecom Eireann opened up the market last autumn. The latest entrant is International Telecommunications Ltd (ITL), a private Irish company, which began operations yesterday. It is offering business customers reductions of 30 per cent on Telecom Eireann's tariffs for most international calls. The company said it would not charge sign-up fees or service charges, nor impose minimum traffic levels. Nor would customers be obliged to use ITL's service exclusively. Telecom Eireann says it will 'compete aggressively' for market share. Last month it introduced a 30 per cent volume discount for customers with international traffic of more than IPounds 2,000 a month. It also introduced a new tariff structure last September, cutting the cost of international calls by up to 40 per cent. Mr Fergus McGovern, chief executive of Telecom Eireann, said yesterday the new tariffs had resulted in 28 per cent a year growth in the company's international traffic. Around 30 per cent of the company's total call revenues of IPounds 600m come from international traffic. Under European Union competition directives, Telecom must relinquish its monopoly of the Irish market by 2003, and since last autumn has had to allow competitors access to its international business. Around half of international calls made are to the UK. British Telecom, which launched a service out of Ireland for business customers last November, says Ireland is the second largest international direct dialling route out of the UK. Allied Irish Bank, one of the biggest customers of Telecom Eireann, is shortly to put out a tender for its international call traffic. Earlier this month, it was confirmed that Telecom Eireann is seeking 'a strategic alliance' and that a proposal has been received from Cable and Wireless, thought to be worth up to IPounds 500m, to set up a joint venture to handle Telecom Eireann's international calls business.</p>

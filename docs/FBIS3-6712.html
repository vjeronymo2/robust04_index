			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- A government panel  Thursday [17 March] started studying the government guaranteed  prices for milk as material of dairy products and minimum  producers' prices of beef and pork for fiscal 1994, starting  April 1, Farm Ministry officials said.    The Livestock Industry Promotion Council, an advisory panel  for the farm minister, is also expected to feed supply plans for  the year.    The panel will study the problems at sections specializing  in  each field, and is expected to compile recommendations by the  end of the month, the officials added.    As for the government-guaranteed price of milk for  processing, now at 76.75 yen per kilogram, the Agricultural,  Forestry and Fisheries Ministry says it can be cut, noting  production costs have been falling in real terms.    But producers' organizations demand an increase, asserting  that a further reduction will force farmers to change jobs.    In fiscal 1993, strong opposition from the Liberal  Democratic  Party, then ruling party, helped the price remain unchanged from  the preceding year, despite the ministry's intention to lower it.    Japan decides minimum prices of milk for processing and such  meat as beef and pork every year. When those prices fall on the  market, the government buys up those products to prevent further  declines.</p>

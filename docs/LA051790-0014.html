			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> OFFICIAL PROPOSES TREE PROTECTION LAW  </P> <P> A Ventura city councilman has proposed an ordinance that would protect trees on  private property after learning that a developer uprooted 15 eucalyptus trees  on the east side of the city.  </P> <P> But City Arborist Jerry Revard isn't sure that such a law is necessary.  </P> <P> "I can unequivocally say I support our policies in preserving significant trees  . . ." Revard said Wednesday, "but the laws that are already in place may be  sufficient if they're properly enforced."  </P> <P> Trees on public property are protected from destruction, since they are the  property of the city or county in which they are located, officials said.  </P> <P> Councilman Gary Tuttle, supported by other council members, asked City Atty.  Pete Bulens to draft the tree-protection ordinance after learning that a  housing developer, Cherrie Construction Co., had uprooted 15 eucalyptus trees  near the Harmon Barranca.  </P> <P> The state Department of Fish and Game, which has jurisdiction over trees and  foliage in the barranca, is investigating the case. Krishan Lal, a projects  review coordinator with the department, said criminal charges could be filed  against the company for destroying the trees without a permit, though  restitution agreements are often reached.  </P> <P> Executives of the construction firm did not return phone calls.  </P> <P> Tuttle, considered a leading environmentalist on the council, said, "I'm not  looking to make it impossible to ever remove a tree, but I feel City Hall  should be alerted when somebody is planning to do so. A tree is a thing of  beauty; it even helps our health by providing oxygen."  </P> <P> The destroyed trees, Tuttle said, provided shelter to red fox, owls and "even a  buck deer." He added that monarch butterflies were also known to visit the  area, west of Kimball Road between Foothill and Telegraph roads.  </P> <P> Bulens said he probably will draft a law similar to one that is in force in  Mountain View, where he formerly served as city attorney.  </P> <P> The council will consider the ordinance sometime this summer, Bulens said.  </P> <P> In Thousand Oaks, which has a tree-preservation law that is often cited as a  model, the city's forester, Bill Elmendorf, said an ordinance protecting oak  trees has been in effect since 1972.

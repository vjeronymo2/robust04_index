			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Equal terms for Tyne employees MORE THAN two thirds of companies in Tyne and Wear offer harmonised terms and conditions to all staff and three quarters of employers use a performance-based reward system, a survey has found, Chris Tighe writes. The study by the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation notes that more than 60 per cent of the 155 companies surveyed fix employee salaries at a local level, compared with 38 per cent in similar research in 1991. The new report records that nearly two thirds of the companies had rising levels of productivity over the last two years. Nearly three quarters of the sample are involved in quality training, and nearly half in team building and information technology training. The independent research was commissioned from Durham University by the corporation in partnership with the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress. The 155 companies employ 54,337 people, a fifth of Tyne and Wear's workforce, excluding retailing and the public sector. The Human Resource of the New North East.

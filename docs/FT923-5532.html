			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Please leave me alone, Fergie: Dominic Lawson wishes the royals would stop interfering with him 'THIS 'royal tapes' business is the last straw,' said my taxi driver, and I had to agree. The ever-encroaching invasion of privacy must cease. It is time that the royal family stopped intruding on our private lives. We may be only subjects but even under a monarchy we have some rights, above all the right to be left alone to lead our private lives in peace and quiet, away from the glare of royal publicity. The monarch herself, of course, we cannot avoid. Every time we attach a stamp to an envelope we are obliged to lick the back of the Queen's head, as if we were a corgi seeking an approving royal pat. Falling asleep at the end of the day's television on BBC1, one is obliged to wake up and stand to attention as the national anthem is played at full blast by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, whose members, I gather, call the tune 'royalties'. Then there are the intrusive royal garden parties. We live near Buckingham Palace, so perhaps I am unduly sensitive. But none of our other neighbours, not even the inhabitants of Victoria's numerous bail hostels, cause as much local disturbance and disruption. Of course one can leave London to avoid the din around the Palace. We favour the south of France, around St Tropez. But this year the Duchess of York and her financial adviser got there first, and the place now resembles Bedlam-by-the-sea. I cannot understand why, when members of the royal family can stay in countless castles, all with walls high enough to hide behind and thick enough to soundproof the most amorous affairs, some of their number should still choose to cavort in a way which we cannot help but see, in gruesome colour, all over our servants' newspapers. Worse still was the return of the errant duchess. Again, perhaps I have been unlucky, but did she and her exuberant friends have to make such a din at Foxtrot Oscar while we were trying to enjoy a quiet dinner next door at Tante Claire? I suppose the rot started in the 1960s, when the Queen - doubtless following bad advice, rather than acting on her own sound instincts - agreed to make the royal household into media stars with the BBC film The Family. Suddenly these remote and austere figures intruded for the first time into our homes, like uninvited house guests. In recent years this publicity-seeking has developed in a distinctly down-market direction. We had the Duchess of York's characteristically bizarre television promotion, It's a Royal Knock-Out, not to mention the interminably over-promoted Budgie the Helicopter books. While the Prince of Wales's publications have been less intrusive, indeed tastefully obscure, it came as a shock to turn on one's television to see the heir to the throne cavorting about in the highlands and islands with the popular TV personality Selina Scott. I would not question the prince's choice of companion - I, too, consider Scott to be a woman of rare beauty and intelligence - but could not the future king have left us in peace, rather than forced us to watch the two of them at peak-time and grind our teeth in envy at his good fortune? To encourage such resentment is to foment revolution and the overthrow of the monarchy. But, as the taxi driver said, the saga of the royal tapes is the final straw. I have no idea whether the tape purporting to be of the Princess of Wales talking to a male admirer is in fact a recording of the princess's voice or not, and the official line from the palace is that they have no idea either. But let us suppose that the tape is genuine, as The Sun claims. Surely the royal family with its enormous and untaxed wealth, can afford a private telephone exchange. Surely they realise how easy it is to get a crossed line on British Telecom's outmoded system. How many innocent members of the general public must over the years have suffered the irritation of suddenly hearing snatches of conversation between members of the royal family who ought to know better. No wonder a retired bank manager, exasperated at having his calls interrupted, finally lost his temper, recorded his latest crossed royal line, and handed it to The Sun. Perhaps this incident will finally teach the royal family their lesson. If they will only go back to their castles, fill their moats, pull up their drawbridges and leave us alone, then we will once again love, cherish and admire them. God Save The Queen.

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: BURGER KING BOWS TO TV WATCHDOGS;  </P> <P> ADVERTISING: THE HAMBURGER CHAIN ATTEMPTS TO PULL ITSELF OUT OF THE FRYING PAN  WITH AN AD TRUMPETING THE CORPORATION'S DEVOTION TO 'TRADITIONAL AMERICAN  VALUES.'  </P> <P> What did it mean?  </P> <P> The half-page ad -- echoing the tone of loyalty oaths that cowardly television  networks made their employees sign during the "Red-scare" frenzy in the decade  following World War II -- appeared in several hundred newspapers Nov. 4-5. Out  of the blue. No explanation.  </P> <P> This was the title: "An Open Letter to the American People."  </P> <P> This was the text:  </P> <P> "Burger King wishes to go on record as supporting traditional American values  on television, especially the importance of the family.  </P> <P> "We believe the American people desire television programs that reflect the  values they are trying to instill in their children.  </P> <P> "We pledge to support such programs with our advertising dollars."  </P> <P> The ad was signed: Burger King Corp.  </P> <P> Although it was heartening to learn of Burger King's devotion to "traditional  American values" -- it just chokes you up -- why would the giant hamburger  chain feel the need to proclaim its "pledge" to the nation?  </P> <P> The case has all the earmarks of a corporation choosing profits over principle  by gutlessly caving in to a pressure group, the way much of the entertainment  industry in the postwar years cowered before extremist, Red-hunting sleuths out  of fear of political and economic reprisal.  </P> <P> The Burger King ad that ran in The Times and elsewhere surfaced following an  eyeballing confrontation between Burger King and Wheaton, Ill.-based Christian  Leaders for Responsible Television (CLeaR-TV).  </P> <P> The ad spoke for itself: Burger King had blinked.  </P> <P> CLeaR-TV, a self-described coalition of about 1,600 Christian leaders,  announced on Sept. 1 that it would boycott Burger King, charging the company  with being a "leading sponsor of network TV sex, violence, profanity and  anti-Christian bigotry" during the May ratings sweeps. No specifics were given.  </P> <P> Feeling the sizzle from a conservative religious group with apparent economic  clout, Burger King didn't take long to react.  </P> <P> "As soon as we learned about the boycott, we started having meetings with CLeaR  representatives," Burger King spokesman Michael Evans said from the firm's  Miami headquarters.  </P> <P> "They were at the table because of the boycott," boasted CLeaR-TV's chairman,  the Rev. Billy Melvin.  </P> <P> There were two meetings, the first Sept. 27 in a Chicago hotel, the second on  Oct. 17 at CLeaR-TV's Washington, D.C., office. Two weeks after the second  meeting, CLeaR-TV called off its boycott, and five days after that, Burger  King's "open letter to the American people" began appearing in newspapers.  </P> <P> Both sides are fuzzy about what happened in the two meetings and why the  boycott was dropped. But draw your own conclusion about Burger King: If it  crawls like a groveler and whines like a groveler, it usually is a groveler.  </P> <P> What promises did Burger King make to CLeaR-TV? "I'm not aware of any promises  about anything," Evans said.  </P> <P> "We asked the company to prescreen programs (on which they advertise), and we  believe sincerely they will follow through in avoiding programs that have  excessive sex, violence and profanity," Melvin said.  </P> <P> "We've always prescreened shows," Evans said.  </P> <P> Although it would seem that CLeaR-TV's two-month boycott was too skimpy to  profoundly affect Burger King revenues, Melvin insists that it was "very  clearly effective." Burger King "had franchise people who were screaming," he  said.  </P> <P> Burger King denies that.  </P> <P> Moreover, placing the ad was "an internal business decision" made only  "indirectly" in response to the boycott, Evans said. "The decision to run that  ad was ours. It wasn't part of any deal. We were concerned that there were a  lot of misconceptions in the minds of our consumers and that there were  hundreds of thousands of them out there who didn't see the news release (from  CleaR-TV) calling the boycott off."  </P> <P> Asked to define the "traditional American values" that the ad says Burger King  supports, Evans seemed at a loss.  </P> <P> "It's an evolutionary thing," he said. "Values have changed. We're for  programming that reflects the mainstream of our consumers. We do not wish to  offend any population group."  </P> <P> Melvin had no trouble supplying a definition: "I think of a man and a woman not  engaging in premarital sex until they are married, of a man and woman  committing themselves to this relationship the rest of their lives, of children  respectful of their parents, parents spending time with their child to build a  good home. I think of such virtues as honesty, decency, fair play, justice."  </P> <P> He acknowledged the gap often separating some of these ideals and reality.  "That doesn't mean you don't hold up the ideal," he said.  </P> <P> The values reflected in numerous May sweeps programs on which Burger King  advertised are "destructive," Melvin said. "They are bad for the country. They  are destroying the quality of life here. When someone tells me to turn off TV  or flip the channel, what they really are asking me to do is walk away from  something that is destructive and evil."  </P> <P> Yet asked to list the "destructive and evil" Burger King-sponsored programs  that offended CLeaR-TV, Melvin could provide no specifics. However, he said the  CLeaR-TV's list was "in sync" with the 18 Burger King-sponsored programs  attacked by the American Family Assn., based on its own monitoring of the May  sweeps.  </P> <P> The American Family Assn. is a Christian watchdog organization headed by the  Rev. Donald E. Wildmon of Tupelo, Miss., a veteran campaigner against what he  considers to be smut and anti-Christian prejudice in TV and the arts. Wildmon  is also a co-founder and executive director of CLeaR-TV.  </P> <P> Although Melvin denied that Wildmon controls CLeaR-TV, he said that Wildmon  attended both meetings with Burger King, and Evans maintained that "Wildmon is  CLeaR."  </P> <P> Wildmon's charge of an anti-Christian bias on TV is not without foundation, and  now more than ever, the industry is begging for a backlash by gratuitously  increasing sexual content even in early evening sitcoms in hopes of competing  with the generally raunchier cable.  </P> <P> Yet the Wildmon group's list and accompanying capsule reviews of offending May  sweeps programs that Burger King helped sponsor often borders on the  ridiculous.  </P> <P> It includes ABC's showing of Oliver Stone's anti-Vietnam War film, "Platoon,"  for example, faulting it not only for its "hopelessness," but also for its  violence and "profanity." It also attacks an episode of the former CBS Vietnam  series "Tour of Duty" for its "profane language and graphic violence,"  including "explosions and tortured, writhing bodies." As if profanity and  violence were not the essence of war.  </P> <P> Wildmon's group also hits ABC's "thirtysomething" for showing the estranged  couple Nancy and Elliott in bed together after they have separated. ("At the  end of the show, they are getting back together," the association reports, as  if there was something anti-family about married couple's resolving their  differences.)  </P> <P> Then, too, the NBC drama "People Like Us" is criticized for its positive  portrayals of two gay characters and its negative portrayal of an anti-gay  character. Wildmon's group also notes: "A major part of the plot included a  movie star committed to raising funds for AIDS research." Tsk tsk tsk.  </P> <P> Burger King is only one of 10 corporate sponsors that CLeaR-TV contacted  concerning their advertising support of programs the group found objectionable.  Melvin would not identify the others, but said seven had convinced CLeaR-TV of  their good intentions and that "we're in contact with the other two."  </P> <P> CLeaR-TV is now monitoring the November sweeps. Would Melvin suggest that other  corporate sponsors buy newspaper ads endorsing "traditional American values" on  TV as Burger King has done? "That's for them to decide," he said.  </P></p>

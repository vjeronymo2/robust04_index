			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA TERESITA HOSPITAL TO QUIT MEDI-CAL  PROGRAM  </P> <P> Officials at Santa Teresita Hospital in Duarte, saying they have lost millions  of dollars treating Medi-Cal patients, have announced that they will drop out  of the program effective Aug. 1.  </P> <P> The 283-bed hospital is reimbursed by the state for less than half of what it  costs to care for its Medi-Cal patients, hospital Administrator Michael  Costello said.  </P> <P> The hospital lost about $1.1 million caring for Medi-Cal patients last year  alone, he said.  </P> <P> Santa Teresita notified the state Department of Health Services last week that  it will leave the program. A 120-day notification is required.  </P> <P> Santa Teresita was the fourth San Gabriel Valley hospital to terminate its  contract since 1988. The action leaves that area with 11 acute-care hospitals  under contract to treat the San Gabriel Valley's estimated 60,000 Medi-Cal  patients, state officials said.  </P> <P> "We have no alternative," Costello said. "It is impossible to provide care and  be paid less than the cost to deliver that care."  </P></p>

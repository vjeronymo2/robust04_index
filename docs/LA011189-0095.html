			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOP TO HELP QUAYLE PAY SOME STAFF COSTS  </P> <P> The Republican National Committee has made $25,000 available to Vice  President-elect Dan Quayle to help pay staff costs not met by the government,  including the expenses of two aides who accompanied Quayle on a family skiing  trip in Colorado over the Christmas holidays.  </P> <P> Republican Chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. and aides to Quayle said Tuesday  that the national committee funds would be used because Quayle's legal adviser  had decided that the government should not be billed but that the Indiana  senator would not have incurred the expenses if he had not been elected vice  president.  </P> <P> According to Quayle's aides and Fred F. Fielding, a former White House counsel  who is overseeing legal and ethics matters for Quayle during the transition,  the vice president-elect paid all of his own costs and those of his wife and  three children.  </P> <P> Fielding said he had decided that the cost of the trip for the aides should not  be paid by transition funds provided by the government, "if we could find other  sources."  </P> <P> The use of Republican Party funds for a vice president-elect would apparently  violate no ethics rules or laws. And several Democrats who had served in past  transitions said that they saw nothing improper in the arrangement.  </P> <P> Quayle will not be sworn in as vice president until Jan. 20.  </P> <P> Fahrenkopf said that the fund is similar to assistance the party provides "on a  regular basis to the President and the vice president."  </P> <P> He noted that the national committee routinely sets aside $1 million a year "so  the public doesn't end up paying for" such things as White House polls, postage  on President Reagan's Christmas cards and the presidential cuff links that he  often gives to supporters -- items which might be construed as having a  political rather than an official purpose.  </P> <P> That fund would not cover the additional expenses that Quayle is incurring as  vice president-elect, Fahrenkopf said. Thus, he said, the Quayle staff sought  the additional money in mid-December from the party, to cover Quayle's costs --  other than those met by government transition funds -- up to the inauguration,  to be held a week from Friday.  </P> <P> According to Quayle's staff, the money will be used to pay for the air fare, a  hotel room shared by the two aides and a $30-a-day meal allowance for each, as  well as the cost of renting a copying machine and a facsimile machine,  installing a direct telephone line in Quayle's quarters and the $1,600 rental  of a four-wheel-drive vehicle for the staff members.  </P> <P> Quayle, his wife and three children were chauffeured by Secret Service agents  during the holiday. The family spent Dec. 22 through Jan. 1 at a condominium  they rented in Vail, Colo.  </P> <P> Fielding said that, in seeking the funding from the Republican National  Committee, "I didn't ask for any specific amount. I asked if they could help  out."  </P> <P> The request, he said, was made to Fahrenkopf, who is about to step down as  chairman of the committee. Fahrenkopf, at a previously scheduled budget meeting  the next morning, gained approval for a contribution of up to $25,000, Fielding  said.  </P> <P> So far, "no bills have been submitted" and the party hasn't made any payments,  Fahrenkopf said. But he said he expects the party to be billed for the staff  cost of the Colorado trip -- an amount that he said would be "considerably less  than $25,000."  </P> <P> A Quayle staff member said that the vice president-elect and his family  traveled on a commercial airliner.  </P></p>

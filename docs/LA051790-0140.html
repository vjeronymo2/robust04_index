			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINFIELD REACHES SETTLEMENT, READY TO JOIN THE ANGELS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: HE GETS CONTRACT EXTENSION FOR ONE YEAR, PLUS TWO OPTION YEARS.  PACKAGE IS WORTH AS MUCH AS $9.1 MILLION.  </P> <P> Ending an often stormy residence in the New York Yankees' "Bronx Zoo," Dave  Winfield on Wednesday agreed to terms with the Angels on a one-year extension  to his current contract plus two option years, at the Angels' option.  </P> <P> The agreement, which could be worth as much as $9.1 million to the 38-year-old  outfielder, was reached five days after Winfield vetoed the Yankees' attempt to  trade him to the Angels in exchange for Mike Witt.  </P> <P> It was also nearly 12 hours after Winfield and representatives of the Yankees  and Angels began negotiating the terms that would mollify Winfield and persuade  him to drop his challenge to the Yankees' right to trade him.  </P> <P> Winfield's contract extension will take effect in the 1991 season, after the  expiration of the 10-year, $20-million contract he signed with the Yankees in  December, 1980. The first year of the extension is worth $2.55 million and is  the only year that is guaranteed.  </P> <P> Winfield is scheduled to join the Angels today in Milwaukee for the finale of  their three-game series against the Brewers. Angel General Manager Mike Port  had given Winfield until Friday to report, and was pleased at Winfield's  eagerness to join his new club. Winfield will wear No. 32. His old number, 31,  is worn by pitcher Chuck Finley. Angel Manager Doug Rader would not say whether  Winfield will be in the starting lineup today.  </P> <P> "To our delight, David had already made a plane reservation to Milwaukee," Port  said by phone from Phoenix, where he was tending to personal business  Wednesday. "That's very much to his credit. That's the type of player we're  getting."  </P> <P> Winfield based his refusal of the trade on his rights as a 10-and-five player,  but apparently was not acting only on principle. Port said the Angels were  obliged to give Winfield a new contract before Winfield would agree to the deal  and drop a grievance that was scheduled to go to arbitration Wednesday.  </P> <P> And even as Winfield and the Angels came to terms, the Yankees apparently tried  to obstruct the deal. Port would not reveal specific details, but said he  "would not deny" that George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, almost  to the last minute attempted to prevent Winfield's exchange. The Yankees did  not pay Winfield $100,000 in bonuses, as they were required to do, until  Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I can say more on that in a day or two," Port said. "Perhaps we'll be in a  better position then. For the moment, I must be silent."  </P> <P> Winfield was vocal in expressing his relief that the deal was done. A 12-time  All-Star and career .287 hitter, he had been reduced to platoon status by  Yankee Manager Bucky Dent, who actively advocated Winfield's departure.  Winfield hit .213 with six runs batted in in 20 games this season.  </P> <P> "It's been an ordeal to a large degree," Winfield said. "Maybe things didn't  work out (in New York), but I know they're going to work out in California."  </P> <P> Port acknowledged that he, too, felt emotionally drained by the complications  of working out the agreement.  </P> <P> "It's been a trying few days," Port said. "Not at all because of Dave Winfield  or (Winfield's agent) Jeff Klein, because the negotiations with Dave and Jeff  were reasoned, logical and progressive, although they were detailed. Other  things were involved that made it trying. In spite of some obstacles that had  nothing to do with Dave or Jeff Klein, we are able to fulfill what he indicated  to our fans, that Dave Winfield is going to come to Southern California. . . .  </P> <P> "Dave Winfield is right there with Reggie Jackson in terms of leadership  capabilities and in the performance sense, his ability to carry a club on his  back for several days if need be. When he gets hot, he can take up a lot of  slack."  </P> <P> Winfield's contract extension has a no-trade clause. However, it does not  contain any stipulations regarding contributions by the Angels to the Winfield  Foundation, a charitable enterprise that was one of many sources of friction  between Winfield and Steinbrenner over the years.  </P> <P> Winfield and Steinbrenner went to court after Steinbrenner tried to prove that  Winfield was using foundation funds for personal enjoyment rather than for the  benefit of others, and the dispute was settled out of court.  </P> <P> Now that the acquisition of Winfield is settled, Port said he could "set sail"  on another deal that would reduce the Angels' outfield surplus. The Angels must  also make a roster move before Winfield can play because they are at the  25-player limit.  </P></p>

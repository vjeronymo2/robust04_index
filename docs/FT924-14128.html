			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / US Money and Credit: Uncertainty over fiscal policy induces caution AFTER an extremely trying week, the US bond market will be hoping that the traditional calm that accompanies today's Columbus Day holiday - the markets are open, but the banks are closed and trading is normally subdued - will be extended for a few more days. US Treasury investors will also want to think about anything but Federal Reserve monetary policy after the disappointments of a week which saw what one Wall Street analyst called a 'wrenching transformation of psychology about Fed policy'. Although the final blow to the market's hopes for easier monetary policy was inflicted by an article in Friday's Financial Times - which said that a senior Fed official believed there would be no further interest rate cuts before election day (November 3) - prices had been edging lower and yields inching higher for most of the week as the excitement surrounding the monthly meeting of the policy-making open market committee (FOMC) faded. Given that the market had been bubbling with rate-cut fever since late September, the apparent final confirmation that monetary policy would not be changed warranted a big correction in bond prices. The result was that long-term yields, which had dropped as low as 7.3 per cent at the start of the month, rocketed up to more than 7.5 per cent as many of the trades made in anticipation of a rate reduction were unwound in a hurry. Rates on short-term securities jumped by a similar 20 to 25 basis points. The explanation for the decision not to ease centred on the ambiguity of recent economic statistics, and an argument that the economy was not sufficiently weak to warrant further monetary stimulus, at least for the moment. Another possible explanation put forward by some observers suggested that the Fed did not want to cut interest rates because it is worried by the prospect of a Democratic victory in the presidential election. Assuming Mr Bill Clinton became president, it would not be long before he passed a potentially deficit-widening fiscal package through a compliant Congress. The Fed may therefore be wary of cutting interest rates now because the combination of lower rates and higher spending could prove dangerously over-stimulative for the economy. Although it is unlikely that the Fed's policy managers had the image of a President Clinton on their minds when they made their decision at the FOMC last week, the question of what a Democratic victory means for the bond market is one that investors are now beginning to ask themselves. It is possible that some of the recent fall in bonds can be put down to investors cautiously pricing into the market the impact of a Clinton victory. Their main concern is that the Democrat's fiscal policy, in particular the party's ambitious spending plans, will add to the deficit and push interest rates higher. The problem for the market, however, is not that it is scared about what Clinton might do, but rather that it is scared about all the uncertainty surrounding what he might do. Mr Mitchell Held, economist at Smith Barney, says: 'What this uncertainty translates into is more fodder for the markets to worry about.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Yu Jianhua (0060 1696 5478) and </F> JIEFANGJUN BAO reporter Su Ruozhou (5685 5387 5297)]    [Text] Jinan, 18 Jun (XINHUA) -- In the company of Chief of  General Staff Zhang Wannian, Liu Huaqing, Standing Committee  member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice  chairman of the Central Military Commission, inspected troops  stationed in Henan and Shandong from 13 through 18 June. He  stressed that the entire army should value and attach the utmost  importance to the fresh upsurge in troop training that has  already emerged, further strengthen and reform military  training, and upgrade the troops' combat capability under  high-technology conditions to strive for the fulfillment of  Chairman Jiang Zemin's overall demand that "the army must be  qualified politically and competent militarily, have a fine  style of work, maintain strict discipline, and be assured of  adequate logistical support."    After hearing a report on the state of troop training  reform,  Liu Huaqing on 13 June said in western Henan: Comrade Deng  Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed the need to give military  training a place in strategy, while Comrade Jiang Zemin demands  that army units pay close, proper attention to military training  as a regular central task. In recent years I have always  thought about the question: In what way can our troops complete  the shift from dealing with warfare under ordinary conditions to  winning a localized war under high-technology conditions?  Thanks to the deepening of training reform, some successful  ways have been found through our explorations, and a fresh  upsurge in troop training has basically taken shape throughout  the armed forces.    That evening, the Army and the Air Force held a nighttime  joint exercise at a hilly area. Liu Huaqing rushed to the  exercise ground and told the military unit leaders on hand: In  making nighttime warfare drill and troop training under  high-technology conditions the theme of nighttime training  reform, you have selected a good spot for a breakthrough.  Mobilizing the entire military in nighttime training reform is  a historical development. Now that the correct way has been  found, it is necessary to popularize, develop, and upgrade it,  and pay attention to its implementation in a solid and  down-to-earth manner.    Braving the high temperature of 36 degrees centigrade, Liu  Huaqing went to a certain tank regiment to view an exhibition of  night vision devices. When he saw the good effects of the  automated system for daytime and nighttime command of artillery  troops [pao bing qun zhou ye zhi hui zi dong hua xi tong 3517  0365 5028 2521 1123 2172 2264 5261 0520 0553 4762 4827], Liu  Huaqing cheerfully said: To pursue modernization with the  present equipment, our army should take the path of  technological innovation, tap the potential of existing  equipment, and upgrade combat efficiency to twice the current  level. The key lies in emancipating the mind, firming up our  will, and giving play to the subjective initiative and  creativity. So long as we make our way into this area and make  more explorations, we will be able to find the way through which  the inferior can prevail over the superior [yi lie sheng you  0110 0503 0524 0327].    Liu Huaqing visited grass-roots cadres and soldiers  everywhere he went. After a certain air division carried out a  nighttime joint exercise with the Army, he specifically called  the pilots to his side and said in sincere words and with  earnest wishes: You have put on a really excellent performance.  Fighting might take place not only during daytime but also at  night, or even alternately during daytime and nighttime. We  must prepare for both; we should carry out rigorous training  during daytime as well as nighttime.    During his investigation and study of the troops, Liu  Huaqing  repeatedly stressed in front of high-ranking military cadres:  The current state of troop training is very good; leading  cadres at all levels should take the lead in stepping up the  study of high technology know-how, studying high-technology  warfare, carrying forward the fine tradition of our army, and  carrying out reform and innovation. Should we keep paying  unremitting attention in this way, we surely will be able to  lift our army's combat capability under high-technology  conditions to a new level, and to justify the great trust placed  in us by the party and the people.</p>

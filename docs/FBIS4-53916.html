			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yasuhiro Nakasone, Liberal Democratic Party </F> (LDP) member of the House of Representatives and former prime  minister, by Soichiro Tahara, commentator and TV producer; date  and place not given]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Man of Crisis: Ichiro  Ozawa    [Tahara] Mr. Nakasone, you mentioned in your speech in  London that the coalition government incorporates Komeito, which  stems from the Soka Gakkai. How do you view this?    [Nakasone] I do not particularly think it has to be refused.  Now that it is the time of multiple parties, it is all right to  have men of different thoughts in the government. The Japan  Communist Party is out of the question because it will not  participate in the coalition even if it is solicited due to its  way of thinking. I am in agreement with the idea that political  parties other than the Communist Party can hold hands when their  policies and ideas are tune with one another. However, it is  always necessary to keep an eye on the method of management of  political parties and their policy direction in order to  safeguard democracy. In connection with Komeito's relationship  with the religious organization, after reading an article  contributed by Mr. Junya Yano in Tokyo BUNGEI SHUNJU, a question  flashes through my mind of whether complete separation of  religion from politics is observed internally. Whether such a  problem contributes to bringing harmful effects is another  question, but it is certain that caution is required.    [Tahara] Another point I would like to ask you is what you  said in connection with Ichiro Ozawa and his Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] that the party is carrying on intraparty guidance  based on authoritarianism with a tendency toward nationalism.  Is this criticism or praise?    [Nakasone] It is criticism. Looking at Shinseito, I come to  have questions such as whether such consultative bodies like the  executive committee or general affairs committee of the party  are working or whether decisions reached by a few people are  relayed to the lower echelon.    For example, when the new electoral system of single-seat  constituencies combined with proportional representation is  introduced, the biggest problem will be how to keep despotism in  check. In this connection, those who safeguard democracy should  keep an eye at all times on whether despotism sprouts or whether  it has a possibility of developing in that direction in the  future.    [Tahara] Is there any indication that Shinseito will become  despotic?    [Nakasone] I suspect it to be so.    [Tahara] Mr. Ozawa was a former LDP member and a junior to  you, Mr. Nakasone. As his senior, what do you think of him?    [Nakasone] I remember telling Mr. Kanemaru about him, "He  has the qualifications to be a "yokozuna" [sumo grand champion]  someday, and also has elements of a rascal."    [Tahara] Rascal?    [Nakasone] And I added, "He has to correct them, because it  is important not to suffer injury if he wants to be a grand  champion."    [Tahara] What do you mean by elements of a rascal?    [Nakasone] He had a quarrel with newspapermen, don't you  remember? You may say he is gallant because he dared to  confront someone nobody dares to, but he should not have because  he is a public figure in an important position. In the past,  Mr. Shigeru Yoshida threw a cup of water on the face of a  newspaperman, but he was such an old man that his act was  dismissed as a joke.    [Tahara] You would say it is 10 years too early for him to  act like that?    [Nakasone] So, Mr. Yoshida could be admired, but Mr. Ozawa's  case could not be praised. Furthermore, he summoned Messrs.  Miyazawa, Watanabe, and Mitsuzuka to his office for an interview  prior to deciding on the candidate for the LDP presidency to  succeed Prime Minister Kaifu. I hope that way of thinking is  now discarded, but ordinary citizens still suspect that he may  still have such a subconsciousness which is reflected in the  management of Shinseito. He is egoistic in abruptly going abroad  with his family when the Diet comes to an important moment.    [Tahara] It could be interpreted as an outburst of youthful  vitality.    [Nakasone] He is, however, a man of crisis, like Messrs.  Ichiro Nakagawa, Michio Watanabe, Shintaro Ishiwara, and the  like.    [Tahara] They have in common a little tinge of somebody like  a "yakuza" [hooligan].    [Nakasone] That's right. [laughter] In other words, a man  without something like forcefulness, decisiveness, swiftness, or  an intuitive flash of ideas will be good for nothing when  confronting a crisis. Mr. Ozawa has that ability, and that good  quality must be valued.    [Tahara] That is the point. Mr. Nakasone, you maintained  the government for five years without harm; what is the knack of  not being harmed?    [Nakasone] For one, you have to be humble, but you do not  have to be as humble as Mr. Takeshita. [laughter] And you must  keep a scrupulous watch around you at all times. Mr. Ozawa  seems to be rather meticulous about this, but he is half-witted  sometimes.  <H5>  Japanese Politics Adrift at Sea </H5>   [Tahara] When the Hosokawa cabinet was desperately trying to  accomplish political reform, Mr. Nakasone brushed it aside by  saying, "the current political reform is concerned about small  politics and is insignificant." What did you mean by that?    [Nakasone] The Hosokawa cabinet drafted political reforms to  be limited to amendments to the law governing elections. The  most important things are where Japan has to head now that the  Cold War has ended and the world is at a great turning point?  For that purpose, what kind of switchover in the basic  structure of politics should be made and what kinds of policies  are needed for that? What combination of political parties is  beneficial for the nation? How can the conglutination between  the administration and the Diet be remedied? I am talking about  "zoku-giin" [Diet members lobbying for specific ministries of  the administration]. And how will the Diet be reformed? These  questions were left untouched and the reform ended up just  touching up the election law.    In the beginning, the political reforms were intended to  prevent corruption; this originates from the Kanemaru scandal.  In other words, the major intent of the reforms was to prevent  the recurrence of such grave problems. And I am afraid that the  single-seat constituency election system has the danger of  escalating such corruption. Further, it incorporates a danger  of sprouting a legal autocratic system if things go wrong.    Such advantages and disadvantages should be presented for  everyone to see and let the people decide through repeated  discussion. Things were worked out recklessly without giving  plenty of time for discussion. I think this surely will fail  and in the long run it will not necessarily bring happy  consequences to Japanese politics.    [Tahara] The LDP helped the election system reform  materialize in the end. What do you think about this?    [Nakasone] I do not think the LDP should have compromised in  the first place.    In view of the characteristics of a constitutional  government, the fact that the bill was rejected in the House of  Councilors should have carried weight. The conference committee  of both houses should not have been the place to discuss such an  important issue which is directly related to the fundamentals of  politics and that was rejected by the House of Councilors. The  matter should have been dealt with anew, from the start, I think.    [Tahara] The bill would have been stillborn if LDP President  Kono had not extended his helping hand at the top-level talks  with the ruling parties.    [Nakasone] You are right.    [Tahara] How do you appraise the LDP as it is now? Did it  change after becoming an opposition party?    [Nakasone] Some within the LDP favored passage of the  political reform bill, although it is insufficient. Still others  worried about continuing the same thing for another year, if the  bill was shelved and the deliberations started all over again.  Considering these and various other elements, that sort of  judgment was made, I suppose. Since I and others were not  handling the matter directly, we followed what the party had  decided upon.    [Tahara] But you think that judgment was incorrect?    [Nakasone] History will render such a decision, I suppose.    [Tahara] In connection with what you said about such a  macroanalytic matter as how to deal with Japan's basic  structure, a number of magazines insist that what we should  ponder now is the matter of the Japanese Constitution.    [Nakasone] Before going in that discussion, I think what is  important in building the basic structure is what will become of  the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in the future. And  this is related to the Constitution.    The SDPJ joined the coalition under the condition that the  major LDP policies would be carried on, without telling the  people why. This is the No. 1 violation of its public pledge.  In the ensuing SDPJ response to various policies, it is making  repeated compromises under the pretext that such compromises  were inevitable to maintain the regime. It raises the question  of whether the SDPJ regards its being within the power structure  as more important than sacrificing what it had publicly promised  the people and what it had insisted on as its policies. In  party politics and parliamentary politics, can it so easily  throw away what it had promised the people during election  campaigns? Is this not originating from opportunism or from  authoritarianism?    Properly speaking, prior to joining the coalition, the SDPJ  should have convened a party convention, made certain amendments  to its policy platform or decided on measures in response to the  new cabinet, and should have decided on an official change of  its stance in the name of the convention. Instead, it did so in  a sneaky manner somewhere, like in the central executive  committee. It did not matter much or raise a public furor, only  because the people think the SDPJ policy platform is dead.  Rather, the people think the changes in the SDPJ are not so  bad, and this means that the party is no longer supported by the  people in a sense.    [Tahara] The SDPJ has become realistic and reasonable, so  the people think.    [Nakasone] But in a long-range view of constitutional  government and parliamentary politics, it cannot rid itself of  the blame that it has sacrificed chastity for power. In the  House of Councilors, there were SDPJ members centered in its  leftist faction who opposed the political reform bill, probably  out of such a view. Or they attempted to defend on the most  important occasion freedom of judgment and action as members of  the upper house. It may sound strange, but these leftist  members staged an independent struggle against control and  demanded freedom.    [Tahara] In a sense, they stuck to their principles.    [Nakasone] In that connection, I give them a certain good  score.    The SDPJ is urged to solve that matter at the earliest  possible date; whether it will or will not split as a party, and  redefine its policies by convening a party convention. They are  prerequisites to entering into discussions on the Constitution  and PKO [peacekeeping operations] problems.    [Tahara] You mean you cannot trust those who easily change  their way of thinking?    [Nakasone] It may be so in essence. And this applies to Mr.  Hosokawa, too.    [Tahara] And that kind of a government is at the helm of  Japan.    [Nakasone] That is why the current Japanese politics are  adrift. As for Mr. Hosokawa, he said he would head for a third  way and would not become prime minister after the election last  summer, did he not?    [Tahara] He told me so in a talk with me.    [Nakasone] Then you are a witness.    Despite this, he became prime minister at last. And at a  post-midnight press conference, he said that the consumption tax  rate will be raised to 7 percent and it will be renamed the  national welfare tax, followed by the cancellation of his  remarks the next day.    He publicly stated before the people concerned and the  press that he would carry out a cabinet reshuffle, but gave up  very easily. He is good at brushing aside his remarks. It may  be a kind of opportunism necessary to maintain his regime and  enforce his policies to a certain degree.    [Tahara] In that connection, Mr. Hosokawa and the SDPJ have  something in common.    [Nakasone] However, Mr. Hosokawa is attempting, in the name  of his cabinet, to realize higher objectives and the people seem  to be generous towards him.    [Tahara] Is the SDPJ deviating from permissible limits?    [Nakasone] That is right. In view of its history, it cannot  change its weighty public pledges so easily.    [Tahara] You mean that the SDPJ should have acted more  intelligently during the Nakasone cabinet days, if the SDPJ were  so intelligent in the first place?    [Nakasone] You are right. [laughter]  <H5>  Absence of Crisis Control System </H5>   [Tahara] If you think that you do not feel like discussing  important matters in sincere manner with the coalition  government in which the SDPJ participates, is wrecking the  government not the only thing you can do?    [Nakasone] What is more grave is that the present government  has no crisis control system in its basic structure.    [Tahara] What do you mean by that?    [Nakasone] It is demanding that bureaucrats be in charge of  crisis control, but it has nothing like that in its political  base.    One example is problems related to the DPRK. I doubt whether  Japan can immediately respond with measures that can satisfy the  international community, if and when the United Nations adopts a  resolution to that effect. You remember, Japan could not win  respect from anywhere because it was late in responding even  though it contributed $13 billion later. As long as the present  government keeps its perverted condition in its basic structure,  there is no guarantee of not repeating the same fiasco. In other  words, it is a grave national defect that the cabinet does not  firmly establish a crisis control system in its base. If this  situation is allowed to go on, Japan will be ruined for sure in  two years.    Such perversity exists between the prime minister and the  chief cabinet secretary. It is the extremity of disorder in  public authority that a vice minister discusses important  taxation matters with a party leader, without the chief cabinet  secretary. As such, no other ministries will follow the  leadership.    [Tahara] That is an important subject, about which I will  ask you later. Now I would like to focus our talk on the DPRK  problem. What is your opinion?    [Nakasone] It is a serious problem. In my opinion, it will  become a problem that will give the whole Japanese people an  opportunity to reconsider Japanese security and what Japan  should do in the international community.    [Tahara] That is the point. The Japanese people have a  strong tendency to think that it is a problem between the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and DPRK or between  the United States and DPRK, and Japan has little to do with it.    [Nakasone] Exactly. And that is a big mistake. First, as I  said before, what will Japan's response be if the United Nations  adopts a resolution of sanctions and the like? It would have an  immediate impact on domestic affairs. And there is a  possibility that it would touch on constitutional matters.    Another problem is how Japan would respond cleverly so it  would not lose its value in the international community. If  this problem is taken too lightly and overlooked and the DPRK  succeeds in getting way with it, many other countries would  follow suit. You cannot be sure that countries in the Middle  East and its vicinity are not alert for every possible chance to  produce nuclear weapons.    [Tahara] You used the expression "getting away with it"; do  you mean by that to succeed in the development of nuclear  weapons?    [Nakasone] I meant that the matter is overlooked with  ambiguity. By that, the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]  would be rendered almost ineffective and would collapse. It  will pose a hindrance to the problem of extending the NPT, due  to be considered next year. Stern attitudes are required not to  collapse the NPT.    I do not think the DPRK desires a decisive rupture like war.  It should know that war will lead that country to ruin.  However, in the international community, where it is cornered,  the DPRK wanted to demonstrate to the world that it is dealing  with the United States on equal terms, disregarding both the ROK  and Japan. Thus, it is playing a poker game with the United  States, with nuclear weapons as the hostage. It wants to gain  as much time as possible and will give out minute compromises to  evade a decisive catastrophe. For us, it is important to let  them put more weight on settlement through dialogue and evade  the catastrophe as much as possible.    In that sense, the DPRK is succeeding. On the other hand,  the United States is no ordinary negotiator in that it is  dealing with the matter with a strong intention to lead the  dialogue to settlement, knowing it is a poker game. Japan, for  its part, must get along with the poker game by providing the  United Nations Security Council with wisdom or talking with the  United States strenuously, with full knowledge of the DPRK or  PRC position.    As for the United States, it cannot make easy compromises  as the whole world watches before the NPT's extention. When the  United Nations adopts a resolution as a last resort, Japan  should wholeheartedly support it and do whatever it can. And I  think the matter should be dealt with by such a basic attitude.    [Tahara] You said Japan should take a stern attitude,  precisely what do you mean by that?    [Nakasone] Production or possession of nuclear weapons will  not be allowed. Withdrawal from the NPT will not be permitted.  Allow the IAEA to inspect nuclear facilities. Japan should take  a stern attitude to uphold such policies.    [Tahara] I do not know how to put it in words. Imagine that  economic sanctions took place. It is suspected that quite an  amount of money is remitted by North Koreans in Japan to the  DPRK and it will have far-reaching effects if Japan stops the  flow. If an economic blockade is enforced, the Maritime  Self-Defense Force has to dispatch its fleet to the Sea of  Japan. These kinds of problems will come up.    [Nakasone] The Security Council will issue unofficial  warnings. Then they are followed by gradual sanctions, probably  in three steps. For example, warnings will be issued to stop  human exchanges or to stop landings of aircraft in the  beginning. It is necessary to see how the other side responds  to this.    Prior to this, the government has to work out proper  measures  at this stage, in preparation for the worst. For example, North  Korean ships cannot be denied entry into Japanese ports because  of the treaties signed in the Ansei period [1854-1859]. A new  law is required to do otherwise. In addition, there are  problems related to trade, foreign exchange, and management of  remittances. Dealing with such problems early will also serve  as a warning to the DPRK.    From such loose measures to severe actions in an emergency,  Japan has to discuss such a multistage diplomatic strategy with  the United States and the ROK, while at the same time carrying  on preparations for both domestic and external measures in order  to be prepared for the worst. And this is the task of the  cabinet.    [Tahara] If a second Korean war breaks out, in the worst  case, how is Japan going to cooperate, regardless of becoming  either a member of UN forces or multinational forces? I am  afraid that the case of the Gulf war will be repeated unless  these matters are considered and properly dealt with.    [Nakasone] Since that matter is a delicate problem, I would  rather not comment now. It may unnecessarily get on North  Korea's nerves, and it is related to the constitutional problems.    At any rate, a solution is being sought through diplomatic  negotiations at this stage and we politicians must make remarks  praying for the success of such negotiations. What you  mentioned are things to be commented on when the situation comes  to a certain stage. Diplomatic negotiations and military  actions are completely different matters.    [Tahara] You mean that thoughtless remarks on military  actions should not be made?    [Nakasone] Yes, at least at the present stage. They are  engaged in a poker game, not a war game.    The politician's task is to attain objectives with patience.  Although the DPRK is a difficult country to deal with, its  neighboring countries must display a certain amount of  consideration. It is also necessary to show, where proper, that  the Japanese people have such consideration for the DPRK.  <H5>  Political Organization of APEC Urged </H5>   [Tahara] By the way, Mr. Nakasone, you were for amendments  to the Constitution before becoming prime minister. After  becoming prime minister, you refrained from referring to that  matter. What is your opinion now?    [Nakasone] When I was in charge of the cabinet, there were  piles of problems before us, such as diplomacy toward the United  States and the ROK and administrative reform. Therefore, I said  I would not put constitutional amendments on the political  agenda. I have consistently insisted, however, that it is  necessary to examine the Constitution.    There were fundamental defects in the Constitution when it  was formulated. At the Cabinet Commission on the Constitution,  Chairman Takayanagi said "it was a joint work of Japan and the  United States, but we resisted by saying that `it is a  nonindependent constitution formulated under U.S. leadership  with Japanese cooperation.'" At the time of its formulation, at  least over 6 million Japanese had not been repatriated from  China or Siberia. In addition, several hundreds of thousand  people could not act because they were purged from public  office. That Constitution was formulated under such completely  nonfunctioning conditions. Properly speaking, a new constitution  should have been formulated when everybody abroad was  repatriated. But it was neglected, due in part to leftist  pressure. Mr. Shigeru Yoshida took advantage of such a  situation in a veiled attempt to push through his policy  priority on the economy. When I formed my cabinet, I mentioned  "the final settlement of postwar political accounts," and I was  referring to getting rid of such Yoshida-style politics.    [Tahara] Mr. Ichiro Ozawa wrote in his book Nippon  Kaizo Keikaku [Blueprint for Building a New  Japan] that Mr. Yoshida's choice was good at that time, but  now it has to be amended. But Mr. Nakasone, you are more severe  about it.    [Nakasone] You are right. At present, the United Nations  has great power. Properly speaking, the matter should have been  settled when Japan joined the United Nations. Now this problem  must be presented before the people; the link between Article 9  of the Constitution and cooperation with the United Nations must  be reexamined to get a consensus.    [Tahara] I will ask you a straight question. Do you mean  that the Constitution should be amended and that Japan should  cooperate militarily when a situation like the Gulf war breaks  out, and that this reflects what Japan should be?    [Nakasone] It depends on the meaning of the word  "militarily." Japan will have to cooperate with UN forces or  with military actions taken at the initiative of the United  Nations. But it must be limited to such fields as  transportation, communications, medical treatment, construction,  and the like. Self-Defense Forces will not be dispatched for  the purpose of using armed force.    [Tahara] Is it not possible as UN forces?    [Nakasone] It should not be done before the Constitution is  amended.    [Tahara] When the time comes when the people are asked what  they think, what kind of view will you present for the people to  see, Mr. Nakasone?    [Nakasone] It is difficult to say at this time. But you  cannot deny the possibility of participating in acts of  hostilities in accordance with the mutual security treaty [with  the United States], in such inevitable situations as Japan being  invaded and its security in peril, or Japan being on the verge  of ruin due to an oil supply cut off. But it may be wise to  have a certain safeguard to restrain, to the best of Japan's  power, such acts from taking place as acts of the government,  while the constitutional possibility to undertake such acts are  acknowledged. For instance, make the consent of the Diet  necessary.    [Tahara] Now let us talk about the Mutual Security Treaty  between Japan and the United States, which is different from the  constitutional discussion. Now that the Cold War structure has  collapsed, what do you think about the Japan-U.S. Mutual  Security Treaty?    [Nakasone] The Japan-U.S. Mutual Security Treaty has  undergone some changes in its character, and due to these  changes I think it is functioning extremely well.    [Tahara] Is that so?    [Nakasone] What I mean is that the presence of U.S. Forces  from the Aleutian Islands to the Persian Gulf plays an extremely  vital role in deterring conflicts from occurring. Asian nations  welcome it. In this connection, I think the Mutual Security  Treaty, with important bases in Yokosuka and Okinawa, is  functioning as a potential deterrentforce in the prevention of  international conflicts.    In that sense, the Japan-U.S. Mutual Security Treaty has  become a kind of political alliance beyond one that focuses on  the defense of Japan. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is  similar in that it is a military alliance and at the same time a  political alliance. I think it necessary to respect and  maintain such functions to the full extent.    [Tahara] To maintain the security of such a wide region from  the Aleutians to the Gulf, it is conceivable that Asian nations  and the ROK or Indonesia, not only Japan and the United States,  will be included as in the case of NATO, is it not?    [Nakasone] I am not considering it. This is because there  are constitutional problems: Such problems as individual  self-defense rights or collective self-defense rights are not  defined as yet. I think we have the right to collective  self-defense under the present Constitution. But the government  is keeping it under control and a popular consensus has not yet  been obtained.    I want to say loud and clear that I want to set up a  political framework to discuss peace and security or to bring  about trust in the Asia-Pacific region. What I have in mind is  to set up an organization to talk about international security  or such a political framework as the CSCE and let world leaders  get together maybe twice a year and talk over the state of  military affairs, control of military expenses, measures to  bring about mutual trust, and prevention of arms transfer and of  conflicts. I wish to make the Japan-U.S. Mutual Security Treaty  a double structure backed up by such a political framework.    [Tahara] You envision the United States in that setup.    [Nakasone] Yes.    [Tahara] Is it something like a political version of APEC  [Asia Pacific Economic Conference]?    [Nakasone] Yes. I think it is indispensable to maintaining  the Japan-U.S. Mutual Security Treaty.  <H5>  Sole Reliance on Bureaucrats Would Not Do </H5>   [Tahara] With respect to the United States, the counterpart  in the Mutual Security Treaty, the common adversary has  disappeared and its relationship with Japan has begun to be  jerky. What is your view of the recent talks Hosokawa had with  Clinton?    [Nakasone] It is still too early to call it a failure, but  it certainly is not a success. Both sides have made mistakes.    [Tahara] What were they?    [Nakasone] On the U.S. side, there was a Glen Fukushima  paper. Parts Clinton was said to underline read, "Japanese  bureaucrats are exclusively for the status quo. It will result  in a big mistake to accept the suggestions of such bureaucrats."  It added, "Japan has never honored its promises. It has not  put into practice the agreement reached between Miyazawa and  Bush two years ago." "It will do no good to repeat the same  thing in dealing with such a unique country" "Let it set up  precise numerical targets." The paper read something like that.    This paper had a big impact. The Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative followed the parts underlined by Clinton as they  had been advised.    Clinton handed that paper to such government economic  officials as Bentsen, Kantor, or Cutter, but the State  Department did not seem to get it. In the past, leading State  Department authorities like Shultz, Baker, and so on handled  negotiations between Japan and the United States, but now  economic officials with the background of lobbyists or lawyers  are in charge of negotiations. These people, with less  diplomatic experience, have confronted Japanese bureaucrats of  the Finance and Foreign Ministries. Thus their talks ended in  rupture. Such excuses as "relations between adults" or  "excluding ambiguous agreements glossing over the problems of  the times" were used to cover up the failure, but the aim of  diplomacy is to lead the negotiations to an agreement, and that  is what adults are to do--parting after quarrels is what  children do.    [Tahara] What were Japan's mistakes?    [Nakasone] When the Bush-Miyazawa talks threatened to break  up two years ago like it did this time, the administrative vice  minister for foreign affairs, Owada, sat up all night  negotiating an agreement with the United States.    [Tahara] A consultative organization was set up as a result.    [Nakasone] When it realized in detail how the crisis had  reached a boiling point, the new regime should have immediately  started to work out the problem, but it did not and entrusted  the whole work to bureaucrats. Those bureaucrats had to protect  the interests of their own ministries, and no progress was made  in their negotiations. And Glen Fukushima's paper added fuel to  the fire. In other words, no diplomacy existed.    [Tahara] You mean that the negotiations were carried out  between bureaucrats, and political diplomacy had no part in it?    [Nakasone] Yes. And the primary responsibility rests on the  foreign minister rather than Mr. Hosokawa.    [Tahara] Many think that agreements are worked out by  bureaucrats beforehand and the prime minister and foreign  minister go to Washington only to shake hands. Is it not so?    [Nakasone] At least, not in my case. When the Japan-U.S.  cooperation on military technology was worked out in 1983, I  persuaded the director general of the cabinet legislative bureau  to reach an agreement, although the bureau itself had insisted  that it was absolutely impossible. And between Reagan and I  were MOSS [market-oriented sector-selective] negotiations which  resulted in market opening in the telecommunications field. At  that time, I gave instructions to the then administrative vice  minister of posts and telecommunications, Koyama, and dispatched  him to Washington three times. There had never been such  precedents as dispatching vice ministers abroad for negotiations  -- and on three occasions! From the stage of prior  consultations, the prime minister or the foreign minister must  instruct bureaucrats what to do, not letting them do the work by  themselves. Without doing this, the prime minister went to  Washington without giving too much thought to the matter,  relying solely on the worksheet written by bureaucrats.    The same thing can be said about the Uruguay Round. When the  chief cabinet secretary made the final draft public, he did not  refer to the sixth item that "after six years, tariffication  will be abolished and additional commitments have to be taken by  Japan."    [Tahara] Mr. Takemura said he "had not heard about that  part."    [Nakasone] It revealed that the prime minister or the chief  cabinet secretary had not given instructions of "their ideas" to  the bureaucrats, the foreign minister, or minister of  agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, but that the chief cabinet  secretary merely read what the bureaucrats in Geneva had  decided. If they had committed themselves from the beginning,  this sort of important thing could not be forgotten. As you see  from what I mentioned so far, the present politics are solely  dependent on what the bureaucrats suggest. I think this is a  dangerous practice.    There is no denying that Japanese politics were carried out  dependent on bureaucrats. In the case of the LDP, however,  there were fastidious members in various divisions and prime  ministers, to have their ideas reflected in policies, made good  use of them. In that sense, the Office of the Prime Minister and  Foreign Ministry bureaucrats were working together as a unit.  Now the unity is completely torn to pieces.    [Tahara] Mr. Hosokawa said in his press conference after the  collapse of the Japan-U.S. summit "from now on, say frankly what  we can and what we cannot compromise on." How about this point?    [Nakasone] It is a foolish remark. If you say "No" to the  United States, it was said earlier by Mr. Shintaro Ishihara. If  letting talks collapse is relations between adults, are they who  make talk successful children?    [Tahara] That means Mr. Nakasone was a child. [laughter]    [Nakasone] That is nothing but an excuse. Yosuke Matsuoka  was welcomed home by nationwide applause after having made Japan  withdraw from the League of Nations. And that action later led  Japan into World War II. It looks like the same thing is  happening again. Generally speaking, nationwide applause or  national frenzy tend to hurt the nation. Examples are Hitler of  Germany and the Cultural Revolution in China.    [Tahara] You mean the high popularity of Mr. Hosokawa is  somewhat dangerous in a certain sense?    [Nakasone] It is all right to have high popularity, but I  mean that he should not become elated.  <H5>  Qualifications of a Prime Minister </H5>   [Tahara] Incidentally, I would like to hear from a man who  served in the premiership for five long years what the important  qualifications of a prime minister are.    [Nakasone] It varies according to time and country. I  think three qualifications are required for a Japanese prime  minister today. One is the ability of eye measurement, an  ability to handle and solve problems, in other words, an  intuitive ability of conjecture. The second is an ability to  unite talented persons, wisdom, and clean money. And the third  is persuasive power, to persuade foreign countries as well as  his own people. [passage omitted on evaluation of past prime  ministers]    [Tahara] The LDP, a professional group led by such  successive party presidents, is now an opposition party. The  ruling coalition government has an amateur as its head and  embraces a dangerous entity, the SDPJ, within its fold. What do  you think the LDP should do under these conditions?    [Nakasone] The important things are how to make the basic  structure of Japanese politics stable in a medium-to-long range  prospect, rather than how to attack the ruling parties and  recapture the helm of government. The present coalition  government has some twisting elements in it and disproportionate  phenomena, something like detached farmlands. Real political  realignment can be possible by touching them up. Our utmost  task is to remedy as soon as possible the present  disproportionate and cloudy situation which take so much time in  reaching decisions. Foreign countries trust a government that  is predictable. Right now, it is in a fog.    The other day, I told an LDP Diet member that the present  LDP  has no "navel," like a frog. It has to make a "navel." Without  it, the LDP has no driving power.    [Tahara] I take it that "navel" means "hatajirushi" or  policy objectives. What objectives should the LDP have?    [Nakasone] Policywise, a neoconservative liberalism. It  means a small government, an open-door policy internationally,  and daring deregulation that will let free economic activities  demonstrate dynamism to the maximum. It is to learn many  lessons from history and tradition, respect self-responsibility  and treasure one's home, and stop wasting money for welfare for  no definite purpose. Those who work hard will be rewarded.  Those are the principles.    [Tahara] They seem to be close to the lines of the U.S.  Republican Party. Mr. Hosokawa, if anything, is close to the  Democratic Party of the United States.    [Nakasone] Since we live in a time of fertility, I think it  is our task to let individuals display their dynamism under free  competition. In this connection, there may be a need to  reexamine the bureaucratic system. The number of ministries  would be reduced to about 10. Employment of high-echelon public  servants and redistribution of personnel would no longer be  handled by each ministry or agency, but by the cabinet. A free  appointment system would be introduced to certain high-level  ranks. Once done, the present Japanese bureaucracy would change.    [Tahara] What do you think about the long-advocated  public election of the prime minister?    [Nakasone] By and by it is becoming realistic. Now that the  duel between liberalism and socialism has ended, such  confrontation seen in a free society like the Republican and  Democratic Parties in the United States emerges at this time.  As the sentiment grows that the current parliamentary cabinet  system, which has been subjected to great stress, has to be  replaced, the choice between public election of the prime  minister or the parliamentary cabinet system will be strongly  demanded. In the LDP, Mr. Taku Yamazaki and others are  sponsoring a study group on public election of the prime  minister, and many in the SDPJ are in favor of such a move.    [Tahara] What is the biggest defect in the present method of  choosing a prime minister?    [Nakasone] Because the prime minister is not chosen by a  direct mandate from the people, the authority of the executive  power is weak and tends to be short-lived. A major reason why  my cabinet could carry out powerful policies was that I became  prime minister after mustering 50,000 to 60,000 votes in an  earlier preliminary election. Yeltsin could wield power for the  first time after having been elected president in a public  election. I think that the Japanese prime minister should  follow this example. The emperor is the symbol of the unity of  the people in accordance with traditional authority and the  prime minister will be the functional political unity under the  emperor.    Thre is one more thing I would like to add that is  politically important and that is to reflect on the 20th century  with the 21st century at the threshold. I propose to establish  a censuring committee on the 20th century, because it was the  gloomiest period in the history of mankind.    Two world wars, financial crises, a 70-year confrontation  between communism and freedom, the menace of nuclear weapons and  so on. No other century witnessed so many miserable deaths of  human beings through wars and purges than the 20th century. Of  course, there were such encouraging factors as the denouncement  of colonialism, the birth of so many independent nations,  advances in scientific technology and medicine, Olympic Games,  and Nobel Prizes. Taking all these pluses and minuses into  account, there has never been such a miserable century as the  20th.    [Tahara] It was the worst century of all?    [Nakasone] There is a need for those who have lived in that  century to analyze and pass judgment on the 20th century during  a transitional period toward the 21st century and appeal to the  world that the same course not be repeated in the coming  century. How about each political party setting up such a  committee and make public that voice from Japan.    I think it would be better for Japan to initiate such a  large-scale civilized idea.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Confederation Life The travails of Confederation Life of Canada could work to the advantage of the UK life insurance industry. If its substantial UK operation can be sold to an established insurer, there could be a rare opportunity to reduce capacity in an overcrowded market. Despite the prospect of thinner margins once full disclosure of sales commissions comes into force next year, the industry has been slow to rationalise. Norwich Union's decision last month to reduce its sales force was a rare example of a company taking unilateral action. The biggest deals - such as Abbey National's acquisition of Scottish Mutual and Aegon's link with Scottish Equitable - have introduced additional capital rather than reduced competitive pressure. The reluctance of smaller life insurers to surrender their independence probably explains the scarcity of deals. In the case of Confederation Life there is at least a willing seller. It seems unlikely that many UK life companies make the kind of investment errors which undermined the Canadian giant. But the prospect of falling sales volumes and squeezed margins points to more UK life insurers changing hands in the months ahead.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 6 KYODO -- High-ranking North Korean  military officers arrived in Beijing on Monday [6 June] for  talks with the chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's  Liberation Army, general Zhang Wannian, China's official XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY reported.    The delegation from Pyongyang, headed by Choe Kwang, chief  of  General Staff of the Korean People's Army, was invited by the  Chinese General Staff Headquarters.    The XINHUA dispatch did not give any details about the  content of the talks, which were held later in the day.    Leaving aside North Korean President Kim Il-song and son Kim  Chong-il, who holds the post of supreme commander of the North  Korean Army, Choe ranks No. 2 in the North Korean military  hierarchy after Armed Forces Minister O Chin-u.    Choe's visit to China is the first by a General Chief of  Staff since August 1989.    Given the rising tension on the Korean peninsula with North  Korea's failure to dispel international suspicion that it is  pursuing a nuclear weapons program, both sides are expected to  discuss responses to possible developments in the controversy,  such as U.N. sanctions.    North Korea has warned that it will consider the imposition  of sanctions a "declaration of war." Political observers said  the dispatch of a top-ranking military official to longtime ally  China at this stage of the nuclear row is aimed at demonstrating  the close relations between Beijing and Pyongyang.    As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China  can  wield its veto to block any punitive action against the North,  which the United States, South Korea and Japan have been urging.    In contrast, by initiating talks with the North Korean  military leaders, the communist country's hard-liners, it looks  as though Beijing, which has advocated a negotiated solution,  hopes to sound out whether Pyongyang is keen to diffuse the  looming nuclear crisis.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sharp rally at Woolworth WOOLWORTH, the general merchandise and specialty store retailer, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 280m in the 53 weeks to January 30 - a considerable improvement on the previous year's Dollars 166m loss. Sales in the full year and the final quarter were flat. The 1992-3 profits total was free of any one-off accounting-related or restructuring charges and came after net profits of Dollars 165m in the final three months. The 1991-2 figure included an after-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 250m  -to cover an accelerated store redeployment programme - and an accounting-related charge of Dollars 113m. The restructuring charge was taken in the fourth quarter of 1991-2, when the net loss totalled Dollars 128m. Woolworth said sales in 1992-3 reached Dollars 9.96bn, virtually unchanged. The fourth-quarter sales figure was Dollars 3.13bn. The full-year and final-quarter revenues from the specialty stores increased slightly, while general merchandise revenues showed a small decline. Woolworth noted that sales figures had been depressed by the store closure programme, al-though it said this had a positive effect on operating profits. In terms of 1992-3 operating results, the specialty stores made a profit of Dollars 418m, against Dollars 312m in the previous 52-week period. The general merchandise operations recorded a profit of Dollars 156m, compared with Dollars 131m. Tiffany, the upmarket US jewellery retailer, continued to suffer from the decline in luxury goods spending and a decline in sales to Japan during the fourth quarter. It posted final-quarter profits of Dollars 8.66m after tax, down from Dollars 12.1m in the same period of 1991-2, taking the total for the year to end-January to Dollars 15.7m, compared with Dollars 25.5m last time. General Cinema, the investment company whose interests range from publishing to a majority stake in the Neiman Marcus retail business, announced an after-tax profit of Dollars 31.8m in the three months to end-January. This compared with Dollars 407.2m profits figure last time which was scored after a Dollars 39.2m accounting charge and a Dollars 419.6m extraordinary gain. Operating profits increased from Dollars 43m to Dollars 45.6m.</p>

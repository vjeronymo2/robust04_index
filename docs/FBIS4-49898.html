			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 KYODO -- A Chinese magazine will  later this month publish "top secret" Japanese documents aiming  to verify the true nature of the 1937 massacre of Chinese  civilians in Nanjing, state press reported Tuesday [10 May].    "MINGUO DANGAN (Files of the Republic) will publish for the  first time historic files written by the Japanese invaders  themselves which will uncover the true facts of the Nanjing  massacre," Xinhua News Agency reported.    The documents, marked "top secret," were produced by a  special group of the South Manchuria Railway, a railway company  set up in northeast China by the invading Japanese, the report  said.    In mid-January 1938 the group reported that a 600-member  team  was formed and had buried around 5,000 corpses by the beginning  of February.    By March 15, after three months, the group reported that  1,793 corpses had been buried inside Nanjing and 29,998 were  buried outside the city.    According to the XINHUA report, charitable and benevolent  groups, such as the Red Cross, were involved in burying the dead.    "So if the Red Cross could bury some 30,000 corpses in three  months, then it can be seen that the number of Nanjing citizens  slaughtered by the invading Japanese Army was large," it said.    The documents have been kept with files in the northeastern  province of Liaoning, it said.    The Chinese Government and citizens have long questioned the  Japanese interpretation of its 1931-45 invasion of China and was  especially outraged when former Japanese Justice Minister  Shigeto Nagano last week called the Nanjing Massacre "a  fabrication."    Nagano, who also denied Japan was the aggressor in the war,  has since resigned, but in China his statements have open up old  wounds that have never completely healed.    China estimates that Imperial Japanese Army troops massacred  more than 300,000 Chinese civilians following their invasion of  the then Chinese capital of Nanjing in December 1937.    According to estimates given at the Tokyo war crimes  tribunal  in 1948, about 42,000 civilians were killed in Nanjing and more  than 100,000 civilians and prisoners of war were killed in the  vicinity over the next six weeks.</p>

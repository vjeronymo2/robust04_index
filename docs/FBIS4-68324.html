			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Baberdin: "Space Recluses"; the first </F> paragraph is an introduction]    [Text] Eight female test subjects have consented to a  unique experiment: for 120 days they are to be exposed to  hypokinetic conditions. In this way a long-term flight in an  orbital complex will be simulated.    When I dropped by one of the hospitals in the Moscow area  where the experiment is being carried out (its doctors asked not  to be named), in my mind's eye I already had visualized a very  smart picture -- a group portrait on the first page of the  newspaper, the smiling charming faces of young women. But it was  not to be so. They point-blank refused to pose for us.    And this was understandable. We had dropped by without  warning, like a bolt out of the blue, and moreover, at what for  them was the end of a very hard work day. The fact is that the  experiment itself for the time being is still ahead and at the  present time the subjects are undergoing so-called background  (like prelaunch) medical examinations -- one had been spun  around on a centrifuge today, one had been on a bicycle  ergometer, another had been on the orthopedic table. Plus  prophylactic examinations, analyses and consultations with  specialists.    "When all these analyses, and consultations with specialists  are over we'll lie down and then you can come and there will be  time to talk and take pictures, the girls assured us. Indeed,  this is training for an experiment and it is being organized  by specialists of the Institute of Biomedical Problems and is  proceeding as for a real space launch. And there is no less  excitement. For one her teeth were bad and treatment was  necessary."    Another problem: to preclude contact with outsiders (God  forbid that an infection be brought in, then the entire 1 1/2  years of work would be lost). The scientific director of the  work, Boris Morukov, candidate of medical sciences, only  recently was one of the standbys for the space physician Valeriy  Polyakov. These investigations were nothing new for Boris.  Something like this was done, but with males.    "The experiment is necessary for the future flight of Yelena  Kondakova, who in the autumn is being sent to the Mir for a  half-year," comments Morukov. "A woman in space is nothing new.  There have been 20 in the United States alone. But our flight  will be long term. It is necessary to take into account all the  intricacies of the female body, female physiology."    The candidates for the tests were selected carefully, from  all of Russia. The call was already sent out early last year.  The competition was announced by television, by radio and in the  press. The requirements were quite rigorous, with respect to  medical requirements the same as for cosmonauts. Here are the  names of the subjects: Olga Semenova, Sveta Retsina, Tatyana  Turboyevskaya, Zhenya Chelnokova, Elena Berdyyeva, Zoya  Zhiyentayeva, Galina Kirillova, Natasha Chidikova.    Among them there are specialists of the Biomedical Problems  Institute and athlete trainers and a construction technician and  an economist. The experimental conditions are not easy. All 120  days (!) in a row they are to lie there without getting up in a  position with the head lower than the legs (it is necessary to  ensure an intensified blood flow to the head, as in a state of  weightlessness). The prophylactic tools used against hypokinesia  are the same as on a space station: treadmill and bicycle  ergometer. It will be necessary to employ these trainers in the  same horizontal position.    I listen to what the physicians on duty are saying and look  at the very complex equipment which will be used in the  experiment and I am involuntarily filled with respect for the  volunteer space recluses. Good luck to you, courageous subjects  with great patience!</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BET rises to Pounds 58m amid signs of better margins BET, the business services group, reported a 25 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 46.1m to Pounds 57.7m for the six months to October 1, and said it was seeing signs of improvement in its profit margins. Turnover fell from Pounds 880m to Pounds 864m, but last year's figure included businesses sold in the first half. Excluding disposals, sales rose by 1 per cent. Operating profits rose to Pounds 55.7m (Pounds 49.3m). Earnings per share grew to 4.5p (3.3p) and the interim dividend was increased to 1.2p (1p). Mr John Clark, chief executive, said: 'The increase in published earnings and the early signs of improvement in overall gross margins are both encouraging. 'We continue to seek improvements in productivity which will offset cost inflation and price pressure. These actions are key to 1994-95 earnings growth.' Capital expenditure in the first half more than doubled to Pounds 78m. Net cash at the period end was Pounds 18m, against Pounds 9m last September and Pounds 67m at the year end in April. Shareholders' funds increased to Pounds 288m, against Pounds 260m at the year end. Mr Keith Payne, director of finance, planning and development, said the group had spent Pounds 2m on bolt-on acquisitions during the first half. He expected to conclude several deals during the second half. Mr Clark said in May that the group was willing to consider acquisitions again after a long period of divestments. He said yesterday that he would be prepared to let gearing rise to about 30 per cent, if the right opportunity arose. A Pounds 5.2m gain on disposals was offset by a further Pounds 7m of rationalisation costs. Business services - comprising cleaning, personnel, security, catering and facilities management - saw sales increase 2 per cent to Pounds 370m, although operating profit fell 14 per cent to Pounds 11m. Distribution services increased operating profit by 19 per cent to Pounds 15.6m, led by the US tanker and Zimbabwean distribution businesses. Plant services increased operating profit by 13 per cent to Pounds 20.5m, excluding asset write-offs in the prior year. Turnover fell by 9 per cent to Pounds 190m. Turnover from textile services fell 2 per cent to Pounds 119m and operating profit was down 10 per cent to Pounds 17.2m. COMMENT Mr Clark gets credit in the City for stabilising BET, which overstretched itself by a series of acquisitions in the 1980s. The question is: where does it go from here? Since the chief executive joined in 1991, disposals and rationalisations have reduced the group from 180 operating companies to 59 profit centres. Mr Clark is now talking about 'growth over time', which suggests there will be no swift bounce in the group's performance. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 105m put the shares, up 3p yesterday to 114 1/2 p, on a prospective multiple of 13.5 - a small discount to the market. The shares are unlikely to move significantly unless and until BET demonstrates that its remaining businesses really can deliver improved productivity and profits.</p>

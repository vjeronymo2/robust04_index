Once Deng is gone, will  China plunge into great chaos?    Long ago, somebody predicted that Deng would not survive  1993. Rumors that Deng Xiaoping had fallen ill began to  circulate again at the end of 1993. I made a thorough  investigation and provided CHENG MING's readers with the most  up-to-date information: Deng took a special southbound train in  Beijing on the evening of 9 December 1993. He arrived in Wuxi's  Tai Hu on 11 December and went to stay in No. 2 Villa. The  result of the follow-up investigation shows that Deng Xiaoping  has survived 1993 safe and sound, mortifying some prophets.    The newsletter of the CPC Central Committee General Office  dated 13 December 1993 reported part of Deng's itinerary: On  the evening of 9 December, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, accompanied by  the comrades in charge of the CPC Central Committee General  Office, took a special train and went on a southward trip. On  the way, he had cordial conversations with the persons in charge  of local authorities in some provinces. Comrade Deng Xiaoping  and some other old comrades will have a brief rest in Wuxi and  later move on to Shanghai. Comrades Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing,  Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, and Zhang Wannian saw them off at the  railway station. This "official report" agreed with the report  in "Notes on a Northern Journey." As revealed by an informed  source, one of the purposes of Deng Xiaoping's southern trip was  to have a second round of therapy and convalescence after the  Lao Shan holiday last April, this time in winter. The main  objective was to improve his body functions and treat  rheumatism. He arrived in Shanghai on 23 December and stayed at  the lakeside of Dianshan Hu.  <H3>  Deng Has Been Seeing Military VIPs the Most Since He Retired  From the Political Foreground </H3>   On 3 January, Deng Xiaoping met with and entertained  military  leaders at the lakeside of Dianshan Hu. The 5 January  newsletter of the CPC Central Committee General Office said: In  Shanghai, Comrade Deng Xiaoping met with persons in charge of  the Central Military Commission and all services, arms, and  military regions and gave a dinner for them. After the dinner,  he had a cordial conversation with them.    In recent years, that is, since Deng retired from the  political foreground, he has been seeing top military personnel  the most. This is because Deng has a very firm concept that the  military not only produces political power, but also protects  political power; and that especially after he has passed away  the military will have to be relied on to consolidate and  preserve the leadership group with Jiang as the core and other  undertakings he will leave behind. For fear that wavering,  splitting, breakups, and rebellion may occur within the Army  once the situation changes, besides setting up a group loyal to  his cause and ideology to succeed him, he also considers  reinforcing the Army's loyalty to the CPC Central Committee and  the core of the party as the second most important matter. An  inside story reveals that at the 3 January meeting, Deng  Xiaoping made an emphatic speech on the question of whether or  not China will suffer disturbances after the old generation of  leaders is gone. What concerns people most is this question:  "Once Deng dies, will China plunge into great chaos?" Now Deng  Xiaoping is answering his own question.  <H5>  "It Is Possible That Partial Disturbances May Happen" </H5>   According to the minutes of the National Defense University  party committee meeting at which Zhao Nanqi relayed Deng's  remarks, the content of Deng's speech, disjointedly delivered,  is as follows.    There is one question that other countries, including those  friendly to our country, have been concerned with for nearly 10  years. The question is whether or not China will plunge into  chaos when our generation is gone, when I am also gone. Of  course there are some countries hoping China will have great  chaos, such as a civil war. Foreign hostile forces also hope  that China will have great chaos. Also, the hostile elements  within and outside China wish great chaos on China, the more  chaotic the better. I would like to tell these countries to  stop being idealistic and dreaming about it.    As long as the party's and the state's line and principles  are correct; their policies conform to the interests of the  broad masses; the party and government leadership groups have  rallying power and enjoy public support; and the party and the  people maintain close ties and the people rally around the party  center, then China will not have drastic changes or big  disturbances.    However, it is possible that some inappropriate policy may  cause partial disturbances, but we can redress it in time. It  is also possible that some people may try to make trouble in  China with support from foreign countries and hostile forces.  If that happens, it should be handled in good time without  procrastination.    Foreign countries and hostile forces have never stopped  trying to make trouble in China. We should not expect hostile  political forces to restrain themselves and let us carry on with  our four modernizations peacefully.    It is correct for the leadership group of our Army to have  such an awareness. This is in keeping with the objective  situation.    Why are hegemonists and the anti-China and anticommunist  forces hostile to, and afraid of, the People's Liberation Army  [PLA]? Why are foreign hostile forces and domestic hostile  elements afraid of, and why do they attack, the PLA? Because  the interests of our Army completely coincide with the interests  of the party, the people, and the state. Our Army is the  people's Army led by the party.  <H5>  Deng Mentions Two Possible Causes of Turmoil </H5>   Though many people in and outside China are certain that  there must be great chaos or even a civil war after Deng  Xiaoping dies, Deng himself has "prevailed over all dissenting  views." As to whether or not he is logical or convincing enough  to wipe out people's misgivings, people have to think it over  and make their own judgments. However, while ruling out the  possibility of great chaos, he did not rule out the possibility  of minor turmoil. In the two possibilities mentioned above, the  first obviously refers to the type of "turmoil" in the 1989  pro-democracy movement. To tackle such "turmoil," Deng did not  mention deploying the Army or tanks, but made this light remark:  "But we can redress it in time." Does this mean he has drawn a  lesson from the 4 June massacre, or does it mean he sees armed  suppression as something that naturally has to be done? The  first possibility and the second possibility are the two sides  of one coin: Though turmoil is caused by inappropriate  policies, there is also interference from outside. Deng  believes this should be handled in good time. Does this remark  smell of any gunpowder? Was the bloody suppression in the 4  June incident a case of "timely handling?" If not, does "timely  handling" mean solving "disturbances" or "trouble" before they  happen through peaceful means?  <H5>  Deng Is Laden With Anxieties About the Stability of the Army </H5>   Deng Xiaoping often stresses that the pace of the economic  reform, which is actually a semi-reform, should be quickened,  but discourages fast reform of the Army structure. He told the  military VIPs that though the pace of the military structural  reform is a bit slow, it is quite stable and this is the right  thing to do. Deng said: The Army is always a unique  organization which cannot afford to have turmoil or ups and  downs. The cadre contingent of the Army, mainly the leading  bodies and leadership groups at or above the regiment level,  should be streamlined. Some comrades have suggested that we  wait until the issue is more thoroughly deliberated and the  thinking at different levels is more aligned, so that problems  are easier to solve. I agree with Huaqing and the General Staff  Headquarters. The purpose of the reform is to greatly improve  the quality of the Army, raise efficiency, improve the knowledge  of science and technology and culture, and enhance fighting  capabilities. The reform is now under way in the Air Force,  some of the group armies, and the East China Sea Fleet. It is  making smooth progress, but we should keep watch on the changing  circumstances.    This remark by Deng Xiaoping indicates that contrary to his  lightheartedness toward the "partial disturbances" outside the  Army, he is laden with anxieties about whether or not the Army  can maintain long-term stability. Therefore, while not  demanding a quickened pace of Army reform, he is worried that  problems may emerge in some units where the reform is going on  and "making smooth progress."  <H5>  "The Problems in the Army Are Rather Outstanding" </H5>   Deng Xiaoping also said: It is correct for us to practice  omnidimensional reform and socialist market economy, but we  should be soberly aware that some decadent things from  capitalism have infiltrated our Army. The problems in the Army  are rather outstanding, though there has been a turn for the  better lately. The crux of the issue is that the Army must  strengthen party building, which will in turn contribute to the  Army building. The Army should have its own characteristics and  should consistently adhere to "four qualities (lofty ideals,  moral integrity, education, and physical strength), three  emphases (appearance and bearing, courtesy, and a sense of  discipline), and two undauntednesses (undaunted by difficulties  and hardships and undaunted by the need to sacrifice one's  life)." It was correct of the Central Military Commission to  criticize some Army cadres for being preoccupied with their  personal benefits, sulking, and affecting morale. The problem  is that we should get our thinking straightened out, truly  straightened out. This will make the job easier and more  effective.    Those two remarks by Deng Xiaoping indicate that the CPC's  Army is not a great wall of steel. There are many old and new  problems in the Army that must be solved through reform. But  reform will aggravate instability. Furthermore, the Army's  trust in the party, the party center, and the party leaders has  been shaken and it is very unhappy about the party's corruption  and all kinds of problems caused by corruption. In this way,  the Army's rallying power and fighting capabilities are bound to  decline. Even Army cadres are "preoccupied with their personal  benefits, sulking, and affecting morale." Deng demanded  "straightening out the thinking" in the Army. But how can it be  done?  <H3>  The 2d Artillery Corps, the Commission for Science,  Technology, and Industry for National Defense [CSTIND], and the  Military Regions Demand More Expenditure </H3>   According to military sources, in the middle of December  1993, the 2d Artillery Corps, the CSTIND, and the military  regions demanded more military expenditure and operating funds.  The 2d Artillery Corps asked for a 150 percent increase, the  CSTIND asked for an increase of 800 million yuan for scientific  research and production (the Central Military Commission having  granted 420 million yuan), and institutions of higher military  education demanded increases in operating funds of more than 100  percent (the Central Military Commission having granted 30 to 60  percent increases).    At the National Defense Ministry's committee meeting in  January, Chi Haotian announced that the State Council and the  Central Military Commission had, after examination and  deliberation, granted a 12.5 percent increase (with the  inflation rate deducted) in the military and national defense  funds for 1994. The budget for 1995 is set at a 15.8 percent  increase over 1993, while the military is asking for a 35  percent increase.    Can Deng properly solve all these practical problems in the  Army?  <H3>  Deng Feels Anxious About the Destiny of the Country After  His Death </H3>   Deng Xiaoping has survived 1993. Many people hope he can  survive 1994. But he can see that the end of his life is not  far off. He keeps persuading the top-echelon military leaders,  pacifying them, asking them not to be pessimistic about the  situation after his death, and asking them to stabilize the  general sentiment in the Army and raise the morale of the  troops. All this shows that this old man is still very anxious  about the destiny of the country after his death. This is what  is tragic about this chief architect of the "quarter-reform."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Japan welcomed Monday [28  February] the scheduled resumption of international inspections  of North Korea's nuclear sites Tuesday but called on Pyongyang  for further efforts to dispel allegations that it is developing  nuclear weapons. Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a  press conference Japan welcomes the scheduled inspections of  North Korea's declared nuclear facilities by the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) following an accord between  Pyongyang and Washington last weekend.    Saito said the focal point now lies on whether the  inspections, slated to begin Tuesday, will be fully carried out,  whether North Korea "seriously" engages in dialogue with South  Korea, and as a result, whether a third round of talks will  resume between North Korea and the United States.    More important, he said, is to seek a drastic solution to  North Korea's nuclear problem through Pyongyang's complete  return to the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT),  implementation of special inspections of its nuclear sites and  carrying out a joint declaration with Seoul to denuclearize the  Korean peninsula.    "We strongly expect North Korea to take positive measures to  achieve that," Saito said.    Japan also welcomes the U.S. initiative leading up to now,  Saito said. Tokyo will continue to maintain close contact with  Washington, Seoul and other related countries and make efforts  toward solutions to the problem, he said.    An IAEA inspection team left Vienna Sunday to inspect seven  declared nuclear sites in Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north of  Pyongyang. The seven-member group is expected to arrive in  Pyongyang Tuesday.    But so far, North Korea has rejected pressure to allow  inspections of two other undeclared sites at the nuclear complex  that are suspected of being part of a nuclear weapons project.    The inspection will be the first in more than a year by the  IAEA, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog.    North Korea allowed six inspections of its declared nuclear  facilities in 1992, but threatened to withdraw from the NPT last  March when pressed to open to checks of the two undeclared  facilities.</p>

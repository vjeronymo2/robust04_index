			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Letter: Search for a new job Sir, Michael Dixon (Recruitment, April 29) considered why a recent opinion survey carried out by the Wyatt Company showed a significant increase in the proportion of employees intending to find a new job now in comparison with a similar survey in 1988. However, the conclusion that there is an increase in employees with 'itchy feet', dissatisfied with their current jobs is not the only explanation which can be drawn. Rather, it may be that in a more buoyant job market four years ago, more employees thinking about a move could actually do so and therefore fall out of the statistics. Nowadays, with continuing high employment, many of those wanting a move for positive or negative reasons can only stay put, waiting for a suitable opportunity - filling surveys while they wait.

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EARTHA KITT ASSAULT ALLEGED  </P> <P> A former wife of jazz great Miles Davis has filed a $100,000 lawsuit against  Eartha Kitt, accusing the singer of assaulting her after a performance in  Hollywood.  </P> <P> Kitt's New York-based agent declined immediate comment, saying she had not yet  reviewed the allegations.  </P> <P> Frances Davis of Los Angeles claims in her lawsuit filed Tuesday that she and  others were invited for cocktails with Kitt in her suite after the performer's  July 26 show at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.  </P> <P> "As (Davis) was leaving the suite and approaching the elevator, (Kitt) grabbed  plaintiff from behind (and) put her hands on plaintiff's face and throat," the  suit alleges.  </P> <P> Davis "struggled to get away and fell on the floor, with (Kitt) falling on top  of her," the complaint says.  </P> <P> Davis claims that she injured her back and shoulder and also suffered a wrist  injury. Her glasses were also broken, the suit says.  </P> <P> Davis' attorney, Marvyn Gordon, said there were several people present when the  62-year-old singer allegedly attacked Davis. He said he did not know what  prompted the alleged incident.  </P> <P> Attempts to resolve the dispute out of court were unsuccessful, the attorney  said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALLERGAN PROFIT DIPS IN QUARTER; REVENUE RISES  </P> <P> Citing costs from the expansion of its sales force, Allergan Inc. on Tuesday  reported first-quarter net earnings of $13.6 million, down 5.6% from $14.4  million for the first quarter last year.  </P> <P> The Irvine-based manufacturer of eye and skin products posted a 9.2% increase  in sales to $195.1 million for the three months ended March 31, up from $178.6  million for the same period in 1989.  </P> <P> Jeff D'Eliscu, Allergan's director of investor relations, said increased sales  were offset by higher expenditures related to the expansion of the company's  sales effort, including the addition of a consumer sales force targeting such  retailers as pharmacies and grocery stores.  </P> <P> Also, he said, Allergan has incurred higher operating costs because of  duplication of its manufacturing activities as the company gradually moves them  from Irvine to Puerto Rico and Waco, Tex.  </P> <P> However, D'Eliscu said the Irvine manufacturing unit will be completely closed  down soon, and the company should begin to reap cost savings from the move.  </P> <P> Commenting on the first-quarter sales results, Gavin S. Herbert, the company's  chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Sales in the pharmaceutical,  surgical and international businesses continue strong."  </P> <P> But he also noted that "adverse market trends affecting our optical business  are continuing, with sales down slightly by 0.4% as compared to the first  quarter 1989. These sales were negatively affected, in part, by competitive  pricing and product pressures and the ongoing softness in the contact lens  market."  </P> <P> Allergan spokesman Norris Battin said the company is "definitely feeling" the  repercussions of a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine last  fall that talked about harm done to eyes by contact lenses that are worn  overnight.  </P> <P> Battin said that although Allergan primarily sells contact lenses that are  meant to be removed and cleaned daily, the adverse publicity has hurt the  entire industry.  </P> <P> The company's sales strategy, company officials said, is to develop new lens  disinfection systems and other products to serve existing contact lens wearers.  </P> <P> In addition, they said, the company is moving aggressively into the bifocal  contact lens market with the realization that the 18- to 24-year-old group that  traditionally bought the most contact lenses is shrinking as the baby boom  generation ages.  </P></p>

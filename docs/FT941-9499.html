			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / World Trade News: South African status boosted by Gatt talks Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, had talks yesterday with senior officials of the South African government and the African National Congress. This follows South Africa's participation in the final stages of the Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations, ending decades of passive involvement resulting from international isolation and trade sanctions. Mr Sutherland held meetings with Mr Derek Keys, the minister of finance, trade and industry, and Mr Trevor Manuel, the head of the ANC's economics department. Today he will meet President F W de Klerk and representatives of the National Economic Forum, the tripartite body made up of business, labour and the government. South African officials have said the talks are part of private four-day visit to the country by Mr Sutherland. In the Uruguay Round sessions, South African negotiators secured what has been billed as a tough but fair trade reform deal package. The deal was reached only after protracted negotiations with South Africa's main trading partners in the final days of the Round's negotiations in December. The high levels of protection wanted for the clothing, textiles and motor industries proved sticking points, as South Africa was forced to revise its original offer under pressure from the US and Europe. A 45 per cent tariff on textiles - an industry badly hit in recent years by low-priced imports from the Far East - is preserved, but the tariff on clothing has been trimmed to 45 per cent compared with the 60 per cent first offered and existing protection of 100 per cent. The tariff protection for the car manufacturing industry is reduced to 50 per cent from 100 per cent. Overall, the country's Gatt deal will see tariffs - which for manufactured goods stood at 27 per cent or six times the Gatt average in 1990 - simplified and lowered by a third on average in a phased reduction programme starting in July next year. The government is waiting for final acceptance of its revised proposals and has until April to accept the conditions of the Uruguay Round.</p>

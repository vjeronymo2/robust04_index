			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Major-General (Reserve) B. Morozov, chief of the </F> cosmodrome space units from 1986 through 1990, under the rubric  "Cosmodromes: Missiles and People": "Plesetsk"]    [Text] July 15, 1957 is considered to be the official date  of the creation of the northern cosmodrome. Built initially by  military construction personnel as a scientific-research test  range for missile technology, it gradually came to be one of the  principal domestic cosmodromes. About 1,500 spacecraft (60  percent of the total number) have been put into orbit from here.  They include satellites for military, scientific and  national-economic purposes. Located 800 km [kilometers] from  Moscow among forests, lakes and peat bogs, the cosmodrome  occupies an area of about 10,000 km[.sup]2[/] (120 km from  north to south and 80 km from east to west), and is a  complicated technical complex for the preparation and launching  of artificial Earth satellites.    The choice of the location for the cosmodrome was no  accident. Many scientific, national-economic and military  programs require the placement of spacecraft into low polar and  near-polar orbits. The use of launch complexes that are located  in the higher latitudes is expedient for this purpose. The  active portion of the flight of launch vehicles also passes over  the lightly settled terrain of Arkhangelsk Oblast, which makes  it simpler to provide for safety along the flight path of the  rockets and choose the areas where the spend stages fall  (northern Tyumen Oblast and Taymyr Peninsula). The proximity of  the cosmodrome to the country's scientific and production  centers was also taken into account.    The city of Mirnyy, not shown on many maps, is located seven  kilometers from the Plesetsk station on the Northern Railroad.  The test personnel live there. The population of the city and  the residential compounds of the centers for the preparation of  launch vehicles and spacecraft for launch varies from 40,000 to  60,000 people. The infrastructure of Mirnyy meets all  contemporary requirements. The city is provided with heat,  water, electric power, foodstuffs and industrial goods mainly by  servicemen. The sights, aside from monuments to prominent  figures in space science, include memorials to the tragic events  that have occurred at the cosmodrome and memorable dates on the  occasion of the launches of the Kosmos-500, Kosmos-1000 and  Kosmos-2000 satellites, among others. There is an  instrument-building technical school, a branch of the Novator  VNII [All-Union Scientific-Research Institute] of Electronic  Machine Building and the Pero airfield.    There is an engineering site next to the city for the launch  preparation of light (from 800 to 3,000 kg [kilograms])  spacecraft and their launch vehicles. Testing of satellites  (aside from military ones) in the Kosmos, Interkosmos, Okean and  Nadezhda series, among others--about 20 types of spacecraft in  all--is conducted in the installation and testing wings. The  stages of the Kosmos launch vehicle are also joined and tested  here before being brought out to the launch complex.    There are servicing areas for each craft and launch vehicle  with sets of ground testing equipment. The check-out processes  are highly automated. Some spacecraft, such as the Meteor, can  be delivered by aircraft to the Baykonur cosmodrome for launch  into heliosynchronous orbits after they are checked out.    Rockets for space purposes (the rocket and spacecraft  covered  by a cowling) that are prepared for launch are delivered on  transport and placement units to the launch pad located 50 km  from Mirnyy, where they are placed on the launcher and are  located inside a movable service tower during pre-launch  preparations. This structure is 100 meters high, with an area of  2,000 m[.sup]2[/] at the base and a weight of 450 tonnes. The  tower is retracted from the rocket before launch on railroad  tracks 12 meters apart. A spacecraft can be changed on a  vertically positioned rocket using it, as opposed to other  launch complexes. It also supports the normal functioning of the  service personnel under any weather conditions and at any time  of day. Deep enclosures are located near the launch complex,  housing storage areas for the rocket fuel components and the  engineering and technological preparation systems.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-005-10A>           Graphic </FIG>       Spacecraft checked out and ready for launch by the Tsiklon  launch vehicle are delivered from the engineering site in the  installation and testing wing, located 40 km from the city,  where they are joined with the rocket and transported to the  launch complex. The mounting, hook-up of all service lines and  pre-launch checks for these rockets are entirely automated. The  operation of on-board and ground technological systems and units  is monitored using an automated control system, with the  depiction of the technological schedule on the display of the  main operator. Manual control of the launch can be used when  necessary. The pre-launch structures (storage areas for the  rocket fuel components, accommodations for the ground testing  equipment, panels and the like) provide for the complete safety  of the personnel in launch.    The engineering and launch sites where medium-class launch  vehicles and spacecraft are prepared and launched are located  40--45 km from Mirnyy. They include four standardized launch  complexes 10--15 km apart located on the steep bank of the small  taiga river Yemtsa. This makes it possible to perform not only  simultaneous pre-launch preparation, but also timely technical  servicing and upgrading. One of their specific features is the  fact that the gas diversion lines of the launch structures have  been run out to the river floodlands in the interests of fire  safety, which made their construction considerably cheaper. All  the launch pads may be used for manned spacecraft. The Soyuz and  Molniya launch vehicles and the spacecraft (military, Kosmos,  Bion and Resurs series and the like) are tested in four  installation and testing wings. Each rocket and craft has its  own equipped servicing areas, some of which are standardized and  suitable for the testing of both military and civilian craft.  More than ten types of satellites may be tested in all.    The telemetry complex includes the Vega system of external  trajectory measurements, two telemetry stations on the grounds  of the cosmodrome and four along the flight path of the launch  vehicles in the area of Vorkuta, Norilsk and Syktyvkar and on  Novaya Zemlya. The information coming in from them is processed  at the computer center in Mirnyy. Its capacity is such that it  could satisfy the requirements of all of Arkhangelsk Oblast in  the resolution of national-economic tasks.    The oxygen and nitrogen plant provides all the launches with  the necessary liquefied gases.    The cosmodrome continues to develop. Launch and engineering  complexes for the Zenit launch vehicle and the spacecraft  launched by that rocket will enter service in the next few years.

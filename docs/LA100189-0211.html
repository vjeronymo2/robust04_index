			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KANSAS STATE'S WINLESS STREAK ENDED AT 30  </P> <P> Tears of joy streamed down the face of the quarterback whose last-second  touchdown pass ended the longest losing streak in the country.  </P> <P> "Sorry, fellas, but I'm still kind of emotional," said Carl Straw of Kansas  State. "But, for the rest of my life, no matter what happens, I don't know what  could ever be a greater feeling than this."  </P> <P> Straw guided the Wildcats 85 yards in nine plays and threw a 12-yard touchdown  to Frank Hernandez with no time left, lifting the Wildcats past North Texas,  20-17, Saturday.  </P> <P> It snapped the Wildcats' 30-game winless streak and 16-game losing skid, both  the longest in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. The Wildcats (1-3) hadn't  won a game since beating Kansas, 29-12, in 1986.  </P> <P> Adding to the drama was the timing of the go-ahead touchdown by North Texas. On  fourth-and-19 with 1:35 left, the Eagles took a 17-14 lead on a 47-yard  touchdown pass from Scott Davis to Carl Brewer.  </P> <P> North Texas came into the game tied with Eastern Kentucky for the No. 1 ranking  in Division I-AA.  </P></p>

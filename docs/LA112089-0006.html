			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAUDIS SECRET STAKE IN MARINA  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia's embassy in the United States has great respect for the accuracy  and responsibility of The Times but would like to clarify a reference in the  article of Nov. 12, regarding a report that two Saudi businessmen had made an  investment in Southern California for a younger son of the king. The young man  is 16 years old and still in school. Neither he nor anyone else has authorized  any Saudi, American nor other business person to handle any financial matter on  the young man's behalf in this situation nor any other one.  </P> <P> With regard to another part of the article, the embassy also wants to reiterate  its government's firm position that no agent, whether Saudi or foreign, is  allowed in connection with any Saudi defense purchase.  </P> <P> As to the rest of the article, the embassy does not comment on the business  activities of Saudi firms or individuals or of Americans doing business in  Saudi Arabia so long as those activities do not violate our laws or those of  the host country.  </P> <P> HABIB A . SHAHEEN  </P> <P> Director, Office of Information Embassy of Saudi Arabia  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From 31 January RAHVA HAAL, PAEVALEHT, pp 1,2] </F>   [Text] Monday, January 31 -- Commander-in-Chief of the  Defence Forces General Aleksander Einseln held a news conference  on Saturday [29 January], answering to the recent accusations by  some politicians of harming Estonia's reputation. The general  rejected the accusations and explained that some of his  expressions may have been caused by misunderstanding or  inadequate translation. But he repeated his statement about the  regrettable corruption in the Estonian society and added that  his January 5 decree on combatting corruption in the army had  gone unnoticed by the mass media and the government  institutions. Only one private company had expressed its  interests in the guidelines, he pointed out.    General Einseln also repeated his criticism of the Laanemaa  Volunteer Rifle Company, which he had compared to the Nazi  stormtroopers. The company, "an experimental unit organised by  politicians", is completely useless to Estonia, he said, but  refrained from further comments, since no definite decision had  been made. He did express his opinion that forces outside  Estonia may have been involved and also cited the judgement of  the Finnish military expert, Colonel Matti Lukkari, of the Rifle  Company.    The general further criticised the draft law on peacetime  military service as useless in its present form and repeated his  conviction that the defence concept must be approved by the  nation. He rejected the accusations by MP [member of parliament]  Katrin Linde and Minister Peeter Olesk, explaining that Linde  had never discussed the matters she had included in her draft  law. General Einseln pointed out that Olesk had not met him or  asked for information concerning the Rifle Company affair before  accusing him of failing to react to the events.</p>

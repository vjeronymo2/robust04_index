Most proceeded from their  patriotism, their love for Hong Kong, their support for reform,  and their demand for the progress of the country and the CPC.  Participation was widespread. People of the left, the middle,  and the right all got involved. There were people ranging from  big capitalists to ordinary residents such as taxi drivers and  street vendors. Several middle-aged big capitalists told me  personally that they had taken part in million-man marches, and  walked some distance. When interviewed by a reporter, Li  Ka-shing openly expressed support for the students' patriotic  movement. Some large stores conducted "benefit sales," donating  the revenues or profits to be used for supporting students'  patriotic activities at Tiananmen Square. Vendors and small  business operators along the streets also voluntarily carried  out similar "benefit sales" activities. During that period the  patriotic torrent swept most people in Hong Kong along with it  and swept across every corner of Hong Kong, creating an  unprecedented situation.    Most workers of XINHUA SHE, and Chinese-owned institutions  also, like others, voluntarily got swept along by the torrent,  becoming an exceptionally prominent force in the movement,  thereby creating an unprecedented episode in the history of the  Hong Kong Branch of XINHUA SHE and Chinese-owned institutions.    Some time back when the Tiananmen student movement had just  started, some workers of the XINHUA SHE and Chinese-owned  institutions had already begun to participate in activities in  society which were carried out to show solidarity with the  patriotic student movement in Beijing; there were even signature  drives in the XINHUA SHE in support of the patriotic student  movement.    Zheng Hua was in charge of party affairs and organizational  work. He suggested that those activities should be stopped.  During discussions at a meeting of the CPC Work Committee, I  said: "Don't call such a move stopping; call it persuading. If  persuasion is not successful, let it pass. They should not be  forced to do things!" "Leading cadres of the level of directors  and deputy directors of the departments or above must be  persuaded, in whatever ways, to refrain from taking part in  activities in society and to refrain from giving their  signatures."    Actually, almost all directors and deputy directors of the  departments had by then given their signatures. After being  informed of the decision of the CPC Work Committee, most  retracted their signatures, but a few people stubbornly refused  to retract their signatures. Zhen Hua asked me the question of  what to do. I asked him to let it pass if they should refuse to  retract their signatures, and told him not to force them to do  things.    At that time some cadres of the Hong Kong Branch of the  XINHUA SHE not only took part in the marches but also used  identity banners of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA SHE.  Furthermore Xu Haining made a speech at a mass rally held at the  racecourse. With regard to those incidents, I told him not to  blame them. We also decided that mass organizations and trade  unions of the left be also permitted to take part in marches and  show their identity banners and that their leaders be permitted  to openly take part in marches or other activities. In my view,  amidst the current upsurge of mass patriotism on such a scale in  Hong Kong, if leaders of mass organizations did not participate,  those leaders would become seriously divorced from the masses,  and the mass organizations might collapse; or, even if the  organizations did not collapse, they would weaken greatly. Only  by taking the initiative in participating would it be possible  to keep contact with the masses. Later things developed to the  extent that some marchers shouted the slogan, "Down with Deng,  Li, and Yang." We decided that mass organizations of the left  should not use such a slogan, and we pointed out that using such  a slogan was a radical move.    We applied the same policy to Hong Kong's leftist newspapers  like WEN WEI PO and TA KUNG PAO, imposing no restrictions on  their reporting and letting them report the student movement in  Beijing and activities in Hong Kong in support of the student  movement in an objective manner. We did not impose restrictions  on the newspapers' own statements, but only asked them to say  less.    On 20 May, after Li Peng imposed martial law on Beijing,  Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the Hong Kong Branch of the  XINHUA SHE, told me that colleagues at WEN WEI PO intended to  react to the development by leaving the editorial space blank,  and were planning to use one of the two phrases, "extremely  pained and bitter" and "what else to say." After discussions,  most colleagues at the newspaper favored using the phrase, "what  else to say." Zhang Junsheng was inclined to use the phrase,  "extremely pained and bitter," and asked for my advice. I knew  that the action could not be stopped, and that such a way of  handling things might have serious consequences. Nevertheless I  still nodded approval, saying: "You handle this matter." In this  way I clearly indicated my approval of his idea.    The four Chinese characters meaning "extremely pained and  bitter" appeared in the editorial position on the first page of  WEN WEI PO on the next day, causing quite a stir. Beijing was  very angry. Li Peng ordered the Hong Kong Affairs Office to  investigate into the incident. I asked them to tell Beijing in  their reply: that Hong Kong was different from the hinterland  and that we would handle the matter in an appropriate manner. In  this way I indicated my refusal to cooperate. Later this  incident developed into quite a storm. I will discuss the  incident again later in the book.    In terms of my personal emotions, I had very complex  feelings, seeing the warm support given by the masses of  residents of Hong Kong as well as the marches, rallies, benefit  sales activities on an unprecedented scale in Hong Kong. After  20 May Hong Kong was hit by a typhoon, and No. 8 wind globes  were hung. Amidst violent storms Hong Kong people of all walks  of life still persisted in carrying out a sit-in all night long  in front of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA SHE, singing  petition songs. I was in my bedroom on the 12th floor. Seeing  the rain and wind and hearing the continuous singing and slogan  shouting of people on the ground, I had all kinds of complex  emotions. The CPC got started by promoting mass movement. In the  past, in order to promote the interests of the masses of the  people, the CPC led them in the fight against the Kuomintang  rule; now, in a reversal of roles, the masses were demonstrating  against the CPC and raising their demands. The CPC not only was  unable to satisfy them but would also suppress them. In the face  of such a situation that I could do nothing to change, I was  unable to fall asleep. Seeing the masses sitting on the ground  in the wind and rain and hearing their mournful and indignant  singing and shouting, I could not stop my tears from flowing  down. [End of Installment No. 117]  <H5>  [30 Aug 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] Got Involved in the Infighting at the Core  (Part One): Zhao Ziyang Regretted the Publication of the April  26 Editorial of RENMIN RIBAO; Intended To Ask Yang Shangkun To  Persuade Deng Xiaoping To Change the Conclusion on the Nature of  the Student Movement    On 30 April 1989, Zhao Ziyang returned home from his visit  to  Pyongyang. He telephoned me on the next day, asking me to go to  Beijing. I immediately set out on the journey. I took with me  many materials and videos on the student movement in Beijing  presented by the Hong Kong media so as to show them to Zhao  Ziyang.    On 3 May, Zhao Ziyang talked with me for nearly two hours at  his Zhongnanhai residence. First of all, he asked about my views  on this student movement. I said: "This is a patriotic movement  and a movement which supports the CPC-led reform; some people  hope that the reform can advance further, while some people fear  that the reform will stop or even go backward."    I told Zhao Ziyang that after coming to Beijing on 2 May I  had met with some people in order to grasp the situation in  Beijing, and that support for the student movement was  widespread, with supporters including most cadres of party and  government organs. There were two categories of people in  society who supported the student movement. In the first  category were individual business operators, and in the second  category were executives of reformed enterprises; those people  had benefitted from the reform and feared that there would be  policy changes, leading to retrogression.    I said: "This student movement appears to be high. The  slogans, indicating support for the CPC and Deng Xiaoping, are  very wise in a tactical sense. On the one hand this shows that  most people do think this way, but on the other hand this also  shows that some people are giving them advice. I estimate that  it is perhaps some young teachers and researchers at  universities and research institutions who are doing the  advising. But it should not be ruled out that some foreign  forces or even some reactionary forces from Hong Kong are  involved and have a hand in the movement. Nevertheless, the  movement is good in the main."    I said that the 26 April editorial of RENMIN RIBAO labeling  the student movement as "turmoil" had exacerbated the conflict  and had thus been, in my opinion, very unwise. I had been told  that Beijing's cadres and residents at large had been shocked by  the editorial, and that most people had been in disagreement  with the opinion expressed by the editorial and had cursed Deng  Xiaoping, with some people also saying that Deng Xiaoping had  been hoodwinked by Li Peng, Chen Xitong [7115 1585 0681], and Li  Ximing [2621 6932 6900]. According to a rumor, during  discussions at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC  Central Committee, Li Ximing and Chen Xitong had reported that  the students would launch a rebellion. Chen Xitong had even said  that if he should be given 50,000 troops he would be able to put  down the students immediately. It seemed that Deng Xiaoping had  believed them, thereby making a mistake.    I suggested: "It is still necessary to persuade and divide  people but not suppress them. It is necessary to win over the  overwhelming majority of the students, and to isolate a handful  of anti-Communist elements who are trying to carry out sabotage."    I also suggested: "We (the Communist Party of China) cannot  afford making another mistake. The Cultural Revolution ruined  Mao Zedong, resulting in the emergence of the confidence,  conviction, and belief crisis. Over the past few years we  depended on Comrade Xiaoping. Now it is imperative not to allow  Comrade Xiaoping to also be ruined."    After listening to me, Zhao Ziyang said: "We are in  agreement." He specially stressed: "We must safeguard Comrade  Xiaoping's prestige. I am willing to publicly accept the  responsibility. We should tell Comrade Xiaoping the actual state  of affairs, and persuade him to change the conclusion on the  nature of the movement."    Zhao Ziyang said: "In fact I am also responsible for the 26  April editorial in RENMIN RIBAO. I was in Pyongyang. The CPC  Central Committee sent me the draft of the editorial, asking  about my opinion. I indicated my approval. I will not have the  Standing Committee held responsible. I am willing to publicly  accept my personal responsibility."    He also said: "The students demand clean government, oppose  corruption, oppose "official profiteering," and oppose  privileges... those ideas have all been put forward by our  party. It is good that students and the masses are now  supporting the ideas. We should accept the reasonable part of  the masses' demands through carrying out a dialogue. I intend  to recommend the Standing Committee to take some concrete  measures to suppress and eradicate those problems."    Zhao Ziyang discussed some specific ideas. For example, the  fight against privileges should start at the center; Central  Standing Committee members should take actions first. First,  terminate the "special supplies" (referring to the system of  proving central cadres of the vice premier level or above with  inexpensive food and living goods) for Central Standing  Committee members. Implementation of the measure may be delayed  in the case of old people. Reform the system governing the  special planes, special trains, guards for Standing Committee  members during their trips outside the capital. Some old people  should be allowed to keep the privilege. But the idea that new  Standing Committee members should travel in a simpler manner and  have smaller entourages should be considered.    With regard to privileges enjoyed by children of  high-ranking  cadres, Zhao said: "I intend to write a letter to the CPC  Central Committee, saying that my children should be  investigated first, that if they have problems they should be  punished according to the law of the land, and that if I myself  am involved, I should be dealt with in the same manner." He also  said that he would propose convening a meeting of the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress to discuss and  formulate measures to fight corruption, officials' profiteering,  and privileges.    We also discussed some other issues, such as the issue of  price increases and inflation. I suggested that from a long-term  perspective it was necessary to consider carrying out financial  reforms, and that for the time being it might be proper, first  of all, to raise bank interest rates, so as to promote savings  and gather more idle funds from society.    We also discussed the issue of the Autonomous Students'  Union  and the Workers' Autonomous Federation, that is, how to view the  situation where aside from the traditional trade unions and  student organizations there were now also independent  organizations of students and workers. Zhao Ziyang said that we  should not be afraid of such independent organizations and that  it was proper to let them operate and participate in elections.  As long as our mass organizations represented the interests of  the masses, there should be no fear of competition.    Zhao said that the main issues for now were, firstly, to  persuade Comrade Xiaoping to change the conclusion on the nature  of the student movement and, secondly, to solicit opinions from  Standing Committee members in an effort to change the decision.  Zhao Ziyang said: "Please give me some help. You get along well  with Shangkun. Please tell him the ideas we discussed today and,  especially, the reactions from the outside world and your views,  and ask him about his views. If he is in agreement, then ask him  to go to talk to Comrade Xiaoping so as to persuade Comrade  Xiaoping to change the conclusion on the nature of the movement."    Zhao Ziyang indicated that he planned to talk with Li Peng.  He estimated that among the Standing Committee members, Qiao Shi  and Hu Qili would agree with him, and that the main problem lay  in Li Peng and Yao Yilin. [End of Installment No. 118]  <H5>  [31 Aug 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] Got Involved in the Infighting at the Core  (Part Two): Zhao Ziyang Was in Danger of Losing His Power  Because of Indiscreet Remarks Made During a Meeting With  gorbachev; the Political Bureau Rejected Zhao Ziyang's Idea on  Handling the Student Movement    I agreed to do the thing that Zhao Ziyang asked me to do  because I felt duty-bound.    After coming back to the place where I was staying, I  immediately set an appointment with Yang Shangkun. We met in  Yang Shangkun's home on the next day. I told Yang Shangkun the  main contents of my talk with Zhao Ziyang and the main ideas  discussed during the talk. Yang Shangkun readily expressed his  total agreement. Yang also told me that he had just returned  from the Great Hall of the People and had listened to the speech  made by Zhao Ziyang to the heads of delegations to the annual  conference of the Asian Development Bank [ADB] and senior ADB  officials, and that in his opinion the speech was very good.  When he had met Qiao Shi, Qiao Shi had also expressed his  approval. In view of the statement contained in the April 26  editorial that "this is a planned conspiracy and a case of  turmoil," Zhao Ziyang said in his speech: "There will be no  large-scale turmoil in China." He argued that the basic demands  raised by the student marchers "are exactly our party's policy  ideas." He also said that efforts would be made to resolve  problems of common concern through a dialogue involving various  social strata.    Later I learned that Zhao Ziyang's speech had been discussed  at a meeting of the Central Standing Committee, and had been  drafted by Bao Tong, political secretary of the Standing  Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee  and Zhao Ziyang's personal secretary. During the discussion at  the Standing Committee meeting, Yao Yilin had suggested that a  segment on fighting bourgeois liberalization be added to the  draft. Zhao gave some explanation, arguing that the matter  should not be stressed for the time being in view of such a  climate. Standing Committee members all expressed their approval.    Yang Shangkun said to me: "I will talk to the patriarch  (referring to Deng Xiaoping). You know the patriarch's  disposition. He may accept the idea, but may also reject the  idea. You tell Ziyang to start handling the matter in this way.  If there is any question of responsibility, I will be the first  to be held responsible." I told Yang Shangkun: "It is rumored  that this time either Zhao or Li will be out of power." Yang  Shangkun said resolutely: "No one is going to be out of power.  Neither Zhao nor Li will step down."    After talking with Yang Shangkun, I telephoned Zhao Ziyang  to  tell him what had happened. He met me again to discuss in detail  my talk with Yang Shangkun. Zhao Ziyang told me that he had  talked to Li Peng. But he did not tell me the results.    At that time Zhao Ziyang's speeches at the May Fourth  Commemoration Meeting and to ABD officials were well received by  those within the party as well as the students and society at  large. As a result I and Zhao Ziyang became overly optimistic in  terms of our assessment of the situation of the time. Zhao  Ziyang said to me then: "It seems that the student movement can  stimulate reform." Thus I returned to Hong Kong, feeling  assured. After coming back to Hong Kong, I transmitted the basic  policy on handling the student movement (without touching on the  related situation in the Central Standing Committee) to members  of the CPC Work Committee. We discussed the relevant policies  followed by Hong Kong and Macao and sent a special written  report to the CPC Central Committee, so as to provide support  for Zhao Ziyang's work in Beijing. The report contained mainly  four points, basically embodying the contents of the talk with  Zhao Ziyang in Beijing.    On 13 May things changed suddenly. Students began a hunger  strike. The strike went on for several days in a row. As the  domestic and foreign media reported the strike continuously in a  sensational manner, the situation of the student's hunger strike  became increasingly tense, and some students even declared that  they would refuse to drink water.    I specially telephoned Zhao Ziyang and Yang Shangkun,  suggesting that the matter of students' hunger strike be dealt  with without any further delay, that several hundred buses be  prepared, that hospital beds be made vacant, that doctors,  nurses, some office workers all put on white gowns and take  students on hunger strike to hospitals in a compulsory manner at  dawn through having several people support or carry one student,  that then Tiananmen Square be closed, and that a dialogue be  carried out. I feared that conflicts would further intensify if  some students should die because of the hunger strike. Both of  them said on the telephone that those were good ideas. But then  I waited and waited, but never saw any action. Perhaps they were  also unable to do anything at that time.    On 15 May CPSU General Secretary Gorbachev came to visit  China. On the morning of 16 May Deng Xiaoping said in his  meeting with Gorbachev: "This evening you will also meet Zhao  Ziyang, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee; that  meeting will signify the normalization of relations between the  Chinese and Soviet parties." However, in the evening Zhao Ziyang  said to Gorbachev: "Your summit meeting with Comrade Deng  Xiaoping this morning is the climax of your trip to China. I  want to say that your summit meeting signified the restoration  of relations between our two parties and the normalization of  relations between our two parties. Therefore the normalization  of relations between our two parties did not happen now but in  the morning." Zhao Ziyang then went on to say: "The First Plenum  of the 13th CPC Central Committee made a formal decision that  Deng Xiaoping would still be needed to steer the course when  important issues should be involved."    After seeing this news on television I said to several  deputy  directors that these remarks would make things worse, and that  although he might have meant well in making the remarks, making  the remarks at this point in time would result in having the  remarks misunderstood by Deng Xiaoping.    Just as expected, the news from Beijing was that the Central  Standing Committee had held a meeting, that Deng Xiaoping did  not approve of changing the conclusion on the nature of the  student movement, and that Zhao Ziyang had resigned. But, on the  morning of the 19th Zhao Ziyang still went to visit students on  hunger strike at the square. As I learned later, on the night of  the 18th the Political Bureau meeting, which lasted to the early  hours of the next day, rejected Zhao Ziyang's idea on handling  the student movement. After the meeting, Zhao immediately went  to visit the students at the square, saying tearfully that he  hoped that the students would stop the hunger strike and take  care of their health. And he said that he had come too late, and  also said sorry to the students.    After I learned, while in Hong Kong, that Zhao Ziyang had  gone to visit the students at Tiananmen Square, I also decided  to visit the Hong Kong students in front of the XINHUA SHE  Building for there were also Hong Kong students who were  carrying out a sit-in and hunger strike night and day in front  of the XINHUA SHE Building.    At the scene some reporters asked me about my views on the  student movement. I said that I was in total agreement with the  views of General Secretary Zhao Ziyang.    On the night of that same day (19 May), Li Peng, with a  stern  face, declared the imposition of martial law on Beijing City.  (Installment No. 119)</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / EC loan proposals alarm Lilley THE GOVERNMENT risked provoking a fresh row with the European Commission last night by demanding assurances that UK coal and steel areas will not be hit by planned changes to an EC loan scheme for hard-hit regions. Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, said he was 'much concerned' at the damage the new rules may cause. He complained that the commission had made the announcement without consulting member states. His comments came only three days after the UK settled a long-running dispute with the commission, which had blocked the release by the European Regional Development Fund of Pounds 120m for coal-mining regions. The latest row centres on fixed-interest, medium-term loans available under the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty for projects which create jobs in areas affected by redundancies in the coal and steel industries. UK companies have been the biggest recipient under the scheme with loans in 1990 reaching Pounds 191m - almost half the community total. The Department of Trade and Industry fears the loans available to the UK would fall under the new arrangements. According to commission officials, guidelines will be set for the loans, which have previously been handed out on a case-by-case basis. One official said: 'Now there will be more planned action and better co-ordination with the objectives of structural funds.' Mr Lilley said it was 'still far from clear what the commission intends'. He understood, however, that loan applications already made would not be affected. Regional aid and loans under the old treaty of the European Coal and Steel Community are overseen by different commissioners - Mr Bruce Millan and Mr Karel Van Miert - even though their goal is often identical.</p>

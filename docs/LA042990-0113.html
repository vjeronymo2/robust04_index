			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCIAL ELITE'S VALUES AT WORK IN PARTY SCENE  </P> <P> Jeannine Stein's "Party Politics" (April 15) spotlights the shallow values of  the powerful social elite.  </P> <P> These Southern Californians make the frivolous, wealthy New Yorkers in Tom  Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities" look semi-sincere. Even Wolfe's fictional  hosts didn't hire plainclothes detectives to keep their esteemed guests from  pilfering the jewelry.  </P> <P> The values underlying the lifestyles of the socially correct and powerful  leaders in your society section frighten me.  </P> <P> If the poor aspire to the pompous, materialistic lifestyles of these successful  trend-setters, the chasm between the two groups will continue growing  dangerously more ludicrous.  </P> <P> Perhaps that's why the socialites are hiring security personnel to walk their  guests to their cars.  </P> <P> AMBER COSTA  </P> <P> Redlands  </P></p>

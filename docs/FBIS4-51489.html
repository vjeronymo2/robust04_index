			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Sat -- The Army has proposed  upgrading its Commando V-150 armoured personnel carriers [APCs]  instead of buying new vehicles and to overcome the shortage of  armoured vehicles and save costs.    Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said today that  the army was now facing a shortage of armoured vehicles as it  had sent a substantial number of such vehicles to protect its  troops serving under the United Nations in Bosnia and Somalia.    He said although the army had about 1,000-odd armoured  vehicles in its inventory, almost one-third were between 20 and  30 years old.    He added that the choice was between buying new armoured  personnel carriers, which would cost hundreds of millions  ringgit or upgrade and refurbish the existing armoured vehicles.    "We are studying the cost of such work and hope to make a  decision soon," said Najib in an interview.    Apart from the 200-odd Commando V-150 APCs, the army also  has  about 500 German-made Condor APCs, 165 Belgium-made Sibma  Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) 25 British-made Scorpion AFVs,  26 Stormer APCs, and an unconfirmed number of Ferret Scout cars.    The Scorpions and Stormers are armoured tracked vehicles  while the others are armoured wheeled vehicles.    The most modern of the vehicles are the Scorpions and the  Stormers, which were delivered in the mid-80s.    The Ferrets, he said, were about 30 years old and were used  by security forces as escort vehicles during operations against  the communist terrorists during the 1960s and 1970s.    The Commandos, which were also used extensively in counter-  insurgency operations, were delivered in batches from 1973 with  the last delivery in 1983.    MMC Engineering Services Sdn Bhd [Company Limited] (MMCE), a  wholly owned subsidiary of Malaysia Mining Corporation Bhd, had  been awarded a contract to modernise the Ferret Scout cars at  its plant in Nilai, Negri Sembilan.    It is also carrying out general overhaul work on the Condors  which are more than 10 years old with the help of the  manufacturer, Thyssen Industrie AG Henschel of Germany.    MMCE had also been given a contract to reengine some of the  Commandos from petrol to diesel to save costs and ensure a  longer engine lifespan.    Meanwhile, Cadillac Gage, the United States manufacturer of  the Commando APCs, said refurbishing the vehicles would cost  one-third of the price of buying a brand new APC and that it  would extend the service lifespan of the vehicles by between 10  and 15 years.

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP SEEKING PIC 'N' SAVE BID TRYING TO LURE INVESTORS  </P> <P> The investment group that is attempting to take over Pic 'N' Save said Tuesday  that it has started trying to lure investors to its side even as the  Dominguez-based close-out retail chain evaluates ways to boost its stock price.  </P> <P> Girard Partners, led by David H. Batchelder, former strategist for Texas  corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr., previously has revealed plans to oust  five members of the Pic 'N' Save board and install three of its own nominees,  giving the group a majority.  </P> <P> The group, which owns 6.6% of Pic 'N' Save, has said it would then sell part or  all of the retailer to the partnership or another bidder.  </P> <P> At a meeting last Saturday between the two camps, Pic 'N' Save said it is  responding to the threat by "evaluating potential courses of action to enhance  stockholder value," Girard Partners said in a filing Tuesday with the  Securities and Exchange Commission. Girard representatives replied "that they  believe that a sale of the company is the most desirable alternative," the  filing stated.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Pic 'N' Save refused to comment on the filing. No one from  Girard Partners could be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Girard Partners also said it has asked Pic 'N' Save for access to non-public  financial and other information about the company and would agree to  "appropriate confidentiality arrangements."  </P></p>

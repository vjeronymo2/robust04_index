			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PARKENING GUITAR RECITAL AT AMBASSADOR  </P> <P> Although he rarely challenges himself or his listeners anymore, guitarist  Christopher Parkening continues to be an exceptionally popular recording artist  and recitalist. Saturday night, a sold-out audience at Ambassador Auditorium  witnessed the native Angeleno performing his usual fare of light guitar  classics.  </P> <P> His mellow sound can soothe even the most unsophisticated of ears, while his  hands and memory are perhaps less dexterous than those of many of his peers.  </P> <P> Free use of sul ponticello, vibrato and other effects, as well as fluctuating  tempos, gives less authenticity to his Baroque and Classical repertory, though  Parkening banks on these techniques to give him his signature style.  </P> <P> With the exception of the lack of his usual Bach piece, the program offered no  surprises. The performance of Sor's Variations on a Theme of Mozart proceeded  joyfully, though not without its rough edges.  </P> <P> Three suites -- a transcription of selections from Praetorius' "Terpsichore,"  four Catalan dances arranged by Andres Segovia (Parkening's teacher) and  guitarist Miguel Llobet, and a short opener by Murcia -- were the best examples  of Parkening's penchant for simplicity.  </P> <P> Three transcriptions of Albeniz piano pieces proved colorful and satisfying  items. Other works such as Sanz's "Canarios," Granados' "Villanesca" and  Tarrega's "Capricho Arabe" were all executed with engaging vim.  </P> <P> Guitarist David Brandon, who has toured with Parkening since 1984, collaborated  dutifully on the last four works by Falla, Castelnuovo-Tedesco and local  composer Andrew York, plus an encore of Gordon Young's "Hymn of Christian Joy."  Parkening closed by himself with another encore, his own quirky arrangement of  the Shaker hymn " 'Tis a Gift to Be Simple." GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

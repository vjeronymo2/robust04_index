			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOESKY ASSOCIATE INDICTED ON 42 STOCK FRAUD CHARGES  </P> <P> Former stock speculator John A. Mulheren, arrested last year for allegedly  threatening the life of fallen arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky, was indicted  Wednesday on 42 federal counts of securities fraud, conspiracy and other  charges stemming from his business dealings with Boesky.  </P> <P> A federal grand jury in Manhattan charged the flamboyant Mulheren, 39, of  manipulating the stock of Gulf &amp; Western Inc. -- recently renamed Paramount  Communications -- so that Boesky would profit by selling a huge block of its  stock to the company. The indictment also accused Mulheren of carrying on a  series of sham stock transactions with Boesky to enable Boesky to evade taxes  and avoid government rules requiring investors to maintain minimal levels of  capital.  </P> <P> In return for these favors, Mulheren received secret inside stock information  from Boesky, the indictment said, which he presumably used to make money  himself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arrested Carrying Assault Rifle  </P> <P> Also indicted was Leonard DeStefano, a trader who worked for Mulheren at his  now-defunct Wall Street firm, Jamie Securities. DeStefano was charged with  conspiracy, securities fraud and maintaining false records.  </P> <P> Wall Street was jolted in February, 1988, to hear that the ace arbitrager had  been arrested with an Israeli assault rifle after threatening the life of  Boesky and Boesky's chief trader, Michael Davidoff. Mulheren, once a close  friend of Boesky, had feared that Boesky's cooperation with prosecutors in the  unfolding insider trading scandal would lead them to him, authorities said at  the time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Felony Charges to Come  </P> <P> Mulheren, who has been undergoing psychiatric treatment since the arrest, is  expected soon to face state criminal charges in addition to those brought  Wednesday.  </P> <P> State prosecutors in New Jersey are expected to charge him with two felony  counts: illegal possession of a firearm, and possession of a firearm with  intent to cause harm, according to Benito Romano, the acting U.S. attorney in  Manhattan. He said federal prosecutors plan to dismiss pending charges of  threatening a federal witness, as soon as New Jersey authorities bring their  charges.  </P> <P> Each of the 42 federal counts is punishable by five years in prison and a  $250,000 fine.  </P> <P> Mulheren's attorney, Thomas Puccio, said his client would plead not guilty. The  charges, he said, "have been around for two years and, like Ivan Boesky's  credibility, they don't get better with age."  </P> <P> Defendant DeStefano could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> According to the indictment, Mulheren set out to manipulate Gulf &amp;  Western's stock on Oct. 17, 1985, after the company agreed that it would  repurchase Boesky's huge 3.47-million-share block if the price reached $45 a  share. Mulheren put in three large orders for the stock and succeeded in  raising the price to $45 from $44.75.  </P> <P> This manipulation "defrauded the investors in Jamie Securities, the management  of Gulf &amp; Western and the investing public," Romano said.  </P> <P> As Boesky sold his block to Gulf &amp; Western, a second, unidentified investor  sold a second block of 3.23 million shares to the company. Prosecutors declined  to explain why this investor's identity was concealed.  </P> <P> They also would not comment on Gulf &amp; Western's motives in buying back the  block, which they valued at $156 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Paramount Cooperated  </P> <P> The company may have agreed to buy Boesky's shares to get rid of a potentially  threatening shareholder; Gulf &amp; Western earlier bought a large block of  stock held by corporate raider Carl Lindner, at the market price.  </P> <P> On the day of its purchase from Boesky, the company explained the heavy volume  by announcing that the transaction was part of a share buyback program.  </P> <P> In a brief statement Wednesday, Paramount would only say that it had cooperated  fully with prosecutors. "As the indictment states, the alleged manipulation of  our stock was concealed from us," the company said.  </P> <P> The indictment said Mulheren and Boesky's company, Seemala Corp., on a series  of occasions planned transactions that would make it appear that Jamie  Securities had bought shares from Boesky. But Seemala maintained the right to  repurchase the shares and to take any profits that would accrue during the  period.  </P> <P> Seemala agreed to make up any losses that Jamie incurred if the shares declined  in price while Mulheren held them. Jamie Securities repaid Boesky his profits  with inflated bills for brokerage services it had purportedly received from  Seemala; also, it sold Boesky 500,000 shares of Beatrice securities at an  inflated price, the indictment alleged.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mulheren Must Take Lithium  </P> <P> The indictment didn't say how much Boesky earned from the transactions, and it  gave no hint of the value of Boesky's tips to Mulheren.  </P> <P> Mulheren is currently free on a $20-million personal recognizance bond secured  by his two homes, which are located in Rumson, N.J., and near Roanoke, Va.  Under a complicated bail arrangement, Mulheren must have his blood checked  weekly to assure that he is continuing to take lithium, a drug prescribed for  psychiatric patients, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> He must consult regularly with his psychiatrist, cannot contact any witnesses  in the case and is sharply limited in his movements.  </P></p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / World Trade News: The new French government finds itself in an old corner - EC trade and agricultural meeting allows Paris scope to escape from a tight spot THE European Community is nervously awaiting the Euro-debut on Monday of France's new centre-right government to see whether its election rhetoric about hard-won deals on farm trade and agricultural reform will become policy. In Luxembourg, EC foreign ministers will look again at whether to endorse the EC-US agreement on oilseeds reached last November in Washington. But they will not push for a vote, aiming to give the new French government room to get out of the corner it entered. The outgoing Socialists in Paris refused to sanction the Washington deal. But the coalition of neo-Gaullists and centrists now in power has threatened to veto the whole farm trade pact with the US and seek renegotiation of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy agreed last May. The Washington agreement staved off an incipient transatlantic trade war and laid the basis for ending more than six years of world trade reform negotiations in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Furthermore, majority opinion in the 12, and the now unanimous opinion of the European Commission that negotiated it, is that the Washington deal was better than the EC could have hoped. It needs to be 'banked' quickly, Brussels insists, lest Washington in its present assertive mood try to 'rebalance' the deal in its favour. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in Brussels this week for tough negotiations on the public procurement row, confirmed 'we continue to look at it (the Washington accord)' which could 'not be seen in isolation from an overall package' including greatly im-proved access for US goods, farm produce and services. The oilseeds part of the deal is separate from the Uruguay Round proper, coming after two Gatt panels condemned the EC's regime of subsidies for rapeseed and soya producers as illicit. It is, though, as one EC ambassador puts it, 'the front ship in the convoy'. France opposes the oilseeds deal, even though it allows the EC to plant the same acreage as envisaged under the CAP reform of last May - an outcome which improved on the 'bottom line' Paris drew at the time. France, moreover, affixed its signature to the unanimous agreement on the new CAP when it passed into EC law at the end of last June. Since November, French officials have systematically tried to refute Commission claims that EC undertakings within Gatt are compatible with the new CAP. A recent report by senior agriculture officials of the 12 has concluded that they are - provided the Commission's assumptions are correct about yield and output in 1994-99, particularly for cereals. While Mr Jacques Chirac, the neo-Gaullist leader with his sights now set on the French presidency in 1995, and his colleagues may be concerned to preserve the French rural vote, which traditionally backs Gaullism anyway, the substantive French concern is to protect its lucrative cereals trade. Agreement within Gatt would restrict subsidised cereals exports. But Brussels believes the EC's exportable surplus in 1999 will be well below the Gatt ceiling, because the CAP reform's deep price cuts will enable cereals farmers to recapture domestic markets lost to cheap US cereals substitutes. The French want a stronger 'rebalancing' clause in the EC-US deal - meaning restraints on US cereals substitutes equal to cuts in EC cereals subsidies and exports. The problem for France is that the clause in the existing agreement is copied word for word from a draft prepared by the office of Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, France's main ally. Mr Edouard Balladur, the new French prime minister, is seeking to strengthen the Paris-Bonn axis. France wants to cement German backing for its franc fort policy at a time when Bonn has accorded top priority to a Uruguay Round deal to improve its worsening economic outlook, and started publicly to remonstrate with Paris over its protectionism. 'The French must be allowed time,' counsels one EC ambassador. 'Or rather the Germans must be allowed time' to persuade Paris of the advantages of an overall settlement, he said. Help might emerge in various guises. This week the EC statistics office reported a 1992 fall in real farm income across the Community of 3.5 per cent - but only 0.9 per cent in France. These results are the product of the old and failed system of mandatory 'stabilisers' on output - that is, cuts without compensation. But the Commission is still deciding whether to circulate its projections on farm income under the reformed CAP, with its generous compensation for cuts in production. These show significant gains for all except big cereals farmers (see table). The grain barons of the Paris Basin see a sharp fall in their subsidised surplus earnings; but there are many more French farm votes in the winning categories. There is also a suggestive precedent. In February 1988, Germany deserted its French ally when the 'stabilisers' regime was introduced. But Mr Chirac, then prime minister, was able to return home and immediately announce massive state aids for farmers while, as one EC ambassador put it, 'we all looked the other way'. Germany itself has just had a big, three-year national farm aid programme pushed through on the nod. It is well within the bounds of credibility that France might get similar treatment later this year, if the aid is Gatt-compatible.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INCOME EFFECTS OF CAP REFORM (% change)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Net farm      Net*       Net**                                 Total     value     value        farm                                output     added     added     incomes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Small cereal farms                -13        -2       +15         +19 Medium cereal farms               -26        -8        +5          +8 Large cereal farms                -27        -8        -5         -14 Dairy farms                        -4       -10        +6          +8 Extensive beef production         -14        -6       +11         +16 Intensive beef production         -13        -9       +11         +16 Mixed beef/dairy                   -6        +9        +9         +12  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  * Revenue before deduction of salaries, rent. ** After deduction of salaries, rent and interest.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: European Commission  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

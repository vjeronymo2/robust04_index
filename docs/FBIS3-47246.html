The nations involved are India, Hong Kong, Papua New Guinea,  Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Panama, Egypt, Algeria and Kazakhstan.    An official said that the countries are expected to attract  more investment from Korean companies. As of the end of last  June, Korean firms had invested an estimated $365 million in the  10 countries.    Domestic companies are expected to be active in investment  in  India in the wake of Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's visit  to Seoul last September, the official said.    With Hong Kong, Korea should take action after 1997 when the  island state will be handed over to China, he said, adding that  there has been no investment pact signed by the two sides  although Korea and China concluded a similar pact last year.    Mexico is important as it is a member of the three-nation  North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) put into effect Jan.  1 this year. Mexico without investment guarantee pacts with  foreign countries due to a constitutional ban is seeking such  pacts to attract foreign investment, he said.    The agreement with Argentina will be signed soon as  obstacles  have been brushed away, the official said. The government is  also seeking an agreement with Kazakhstan as domestic companies  are eager to invest in the country which has a large number of  ethnic Koreans.    Korea has concluded investment protection pacts with 24  countries and initialed them with eight.</p>

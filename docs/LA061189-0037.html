			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAST CARS, TEDIOUS TRAFFIC  </P> <P> Paul Dean's recent article about the Corvette ZR-1 was of particular interest  to me because of the "ZR-1's favorite party trick" of going from zero to 100  m.p.h. and back to a dead stop in 14 seconds. With this capability, the ZR-1  would be the ideal vehicle for an automated freeway ("For Just $50,000 Leave a  Ferrari in Your Rear-View Mirror," May 26).  </P> <P> Controlled roadbeds have been discussed for at least 50 years (the 1939 World  Fair had an exhibit), but never implemented. An automated freeway is based on  the conclusion that our existing transportation system using independent motor  vehicles cannot be optimized. For example, we assume that entering vehicles  will not slow down the system. On-ramps are designed to allow acceleration, yet  we see vehicles enter at reduced speed. A ZR-1 in an automatic system could be  directed to accelerate from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in a little over four seconds.  </P> <P> The freeway system in Southern California does not now work satisfactorily and  it is getting worse. Car-pool lanes are only a minor improvement. Why not try a  controlled ultra-high-speed lane of vehicles with the performance of a ZR-1?  </P> <P> EDWARD C. PERRY II  </P> <P> Palm Springs  </P></p>

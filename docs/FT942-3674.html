			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Berlusconi achieves target - Italy Mr Silvio Berlusconi obtained precisely what he wanted from the European elections and as a result has further strengthened his position as prime minister. Heading a heterogeneous government no more than a month old, Mr Berlusconi had to obtain two things. He needed to boost the share of the vote of Forza Italia, the political movement he founded in January, to demonstrate his popularity; and he needed to see his own position reinforced in relation to his other two main partners in government - the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini. Anything less than this would have been seen as a cooling of electoral enthusiasm for his centre-right government which has unveiled only a handful of policy initiatives. At this stage he should still be at the height of his honeymoon with the electorate. But Mr Berlusconi certainly gambled on winning by presenting himself in all five of Italy's electoral colleges and by ensuring that Forza Italia splashed out large sums on the campaign. Forza Italia is believed to have spent more than all the other parties combined. Indeed with budgets exhausted by the March general election, most parties made remarkably little effort, recognising Mr Berlusconi was still impregnable. European issues scarcely figured in a lack-lustre campaign - perhaps explaining why an electorate, among the most pro-EU, should have swung behind a leader who is a Euro-sceptic. The election was not about Europe but who governs Italy. Forza Italia obtained almost one in three of all votes, raising its share of the vote by over 10 percentage points. With bad weather and a 75 per cent turnout (low by Italian standards) this was an impressive performance and will undoubtedly confirm Mr Berlusconi's public image as a winner. All the other parties of any note, whether in the government or among the opposition, lost ground. The former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the main opposition party, slipped two percentage points to just below 20 per cent - a poor performance which is bound to poison the already bitter behind - the - scenes debate on who should succeed Mr Achille Occhetto who resigned as leader yesterday. The centre was further squeezed as support slipped to Forza Italia. It was also significant that the League slipped in its northern heartland at the expense of Forza Italia, especially in the cities. In a little more than two months in Milan the League share of the vote fell from 16 per cent to 11 per cent, in Venice from 14 to 8 per cent. Mr Berlusconi was quick to insinuate this was the product of Mr Bossi's provocative disloyalty in the government coalition, constantly sniping at Forza Italia and the MSI. But the decline in the League's fortunes is explicable by other factors as well. It was the sole centre party in the north representing a genuine break with the past until the advent of Forza Italia, created by another northerner with northern values of hard work and free enterprise. Forza Italia has become an attractive alternative for those who dislike and mistrust the League's regional narcissism and wish to see a renovated version of the old Christian Democrat Party ruling Italy. On the basis of Sunday's result, the government coalition has not just a parliamentary majority but a majority of the vote. More important, Forza Italia and the MSI combined have almost 45 per cent of the national vote, which would probably give them a parliamentary majority. Mr Berlusconi need not consider the unpredictable League a permanent partner and the pressure is on Mr Bossi to be co-operative. However, he knows that co-operating too long in government could submerge the League's identity and his own political career.  -------------------------------------------- Population: 57.0m Seats: 87  -------------------------------------------- Results (Turnout 74.8%; 1989, 81.0%)  -------------------------------------------- Party*     Parliament    % vote      Seats               group    '94    '89  '94   '89  -------------------------------------------- FI             NA     30.6      -   27     - PDS**         PES     19.1   27.6   16    22 NA             NA     12.5    5.5   11     4 PPI           EPP     10.0   32.9    8    26 LN             NA      6.6    1.8    6     2 RC**           NA      6.1      -    5     - Greens     Greens      3.2    8.7    3     7 Segni          NA      3.2      -    3     - PR             NA      2.1      -    2     1 PSI           PES      1.8   14.8    2    12 Rete           NA      1.1      -    1     - PRI           LDR      0.7      -    1     - PSDI          PES      0.7    2.7    1     2 SVP           EPP      0.6    0.5    1     1 LF            RBW      0.4    0.6    0     1  -------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Interior  -------------------------------------------- *Abbreviations:  -------------------------------------------- FI = Forza Italia; LF = Unione Valdostana; LN = Northern League; NA = National Alliance; PDS = Party of the Democratic Left - formerly Communists; PPI = Popular Party - formerly Christian Democrats; PR = Pannella-Riformatori; PRI = Republican Party; PSDI = Social Democrat party; PSI = Socialists; RC = Reformed Communists; Segni = Segni Pact; SVP = Sudtiroler Volkspartei  -------------------------------------------- ** PDS 1989 results included the RC  -------------------------------------------- Parliamentary group abbreviations: see bottom front page this section  -------------------------------------------- Electoral system:  -------------------------------------------- Proportional from regional lists Compulsory voting: No  -------------------------------------------- MEPs  -------------------------------------------- PSI Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto, Celia Binney, Graham Lever, Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto, Celia Binney, Graham LeverRoberto Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett,  -------------------------------------------- PSDI Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett  -------------------------------------------- CN Roberto Prodicci  -------------------------------------------- DC Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto, Celia Binney, Graham Lever, Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto, Celia Binney, Graham Lever Roberto Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto, Celia Binney, Graham Lever, Roberto Prodicci, Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto, Celia Binney, Graham Lever, Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto, Celia Binney, Graham LeverRoberto  -------------------------------------------- SVP Roberto Prodicci  -------------------------------------------- PDS Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto, Celia Binney, Graham Lever, Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto, Celia Binney, Graham LeverRoberto Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto, Celia Binney, Graham Lever, Roberto Prodicci, Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto, Celia Binney, Graham Lever, Roberto Prodicci  -------------------------------------------- RC Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto  -------------------------------------------- Polo Laico Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto, Celia Binney  -------------------------------------------- DP Roberto Prodicci  -------------------------------------------- LV (uv-psda) Roberto Prodicci  -------------------------------------------- MSI-DN Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto, Celia Binney, Rodrigos  -------------------------------------------- Verdi Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett, Rodrigos Concerto, Celia Binney  -------------------------------------------- ARCOB Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett Rodrigos  -------------------------------------------- LA Droga Roberto Prodicci  -------------------------------------------- LL Roberto Prodicci, Samuel Beckett Rodrigos  -------------------------------------------- Based on preliminary results issued by the European Parliament.

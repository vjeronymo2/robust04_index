			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading MARCH stock index futures slipped back in volatile trading as the market sought some direction on the back of a weak Wall Street, writes Christopher Price. With the New York equities market off 21 Dow points overnight, the FT-SE futures opened weak, but in a busy initial trading period March reached its high point of the day of 2,576 by 9am. However, the appearance of a number of sellers saw March begin to drift away in mid-morning trading. Wall Street's opening in the early afternoon failed to give any direction and March retreated to 2,544, the low point of the day, and around its fair value premium to cash. This proved to be a rallying point and the index eventually stood at 2,550, down 28 on the previous session and some 5 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 10. Turnover reached 5,925 contracts. In the traded options market, the stock option expiry day boosted the volume in a number of stocks, including the leading three lots traded: Hanson (4,212), Thames (3,178) and Cadbury (2,910). The day's total turnover was a healthy 40,234 contracts, with the FT-SE 100 reaching 6,435 lots traded.</p>

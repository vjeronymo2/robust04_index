			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Tough targets for job training TOUGH targets for placing long-term unemployed people into jobs or training have been set by the government for its new jobplan workshops, Lisa Wood writes. The week-long workshops, which will be mandatory for people who have been unemployed for 12 months and longer, will be able to recommend the withdrawal of unemployment benefits for individuals who are unwilling to participate. Jobplan is part of the government's strategy for tackling the rise in long-term unemployment. Training and Enterprise Councils, which manage training programmes in England and Wales, fear that the targets will result in the Employment Service, which runs Jobplan, referring unsuitable candidates to the new Training for Work Scheme. From April this will offer training and work experience to the unemployed.</p>

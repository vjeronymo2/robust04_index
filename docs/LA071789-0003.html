			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DRASTIC CHANGES UNLIKELY IN WAKE OF BAJA ELECTION UPSET  </P> <P> Much has been made of the "historic" nature of the opposition victory in the  Baja California gubernatorial, state and local elections of July 2.  </P> <P> "This electoral process marks a parting of the waters in the democratic life of  the country," declared Arturo Guerra Flores, Baja's secretary general of  government and former state president of the long-dominant Institutional  Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.  </P> <P> Both the national and international press have hammered away at the theme,  bestowing plaudits on Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who sits  atop the PRI hierarchy, for "allowing" the victory by Governor-elect Ernesto  Ruffo Appel, the candidate of the opposition National Action Party, or PAN. In  results finally confirmed last week after a tedious count, Ruffo handily  defeated Margarita Ortega Villa, the federal senator who was the PRI candidate.  </P> <P> Upon his scheduled inauguration Nov. 1, Ruffo will become the first opposition  governor in modern Mexican history, and, in another precedent-setting  development, will be working with a state legislature in which the PRI is the  minority.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Watershed Election  </P> <P> Although there is no question that Ruffo's ascension to the governorship is a  watershed for Mexico and Baja California, most independent analysts agree that  life and government will not change drastically in this fast-growing border  state, now home to an estimated 3 million people.  </P> <P> Judging by PAN pronouncements to date and the results in municipalities where  PAN has captured mayoral seats, observers say that the new Baja governor will  probably lead anti-corruption and pro-efficiency campaigns, purge PRI leaders  from senior positions, and encourage stability, investment and a strong  private-sector presence in government. Many PRI loyalists traditionally  rewarded with no-show jobs will undoubtedly lose their principal sources of  income. And PRI-affiliated contractors and concessionaires, from taxi drivers  to water-truck deliverers, may find that their former monopolies face new  competition.  </P> <P> And there may be some high-profile revelations, notably in the 1988 murder of a  well-known Tijuana journalist, Hector Felix Miranda -- a case that Ruffo has  publicly promised to investigate thoroughly. For the first time, PAN appointees  will head the state police, judiciary and Tijuana police. (PAN also won the  mayoralty of Tijuana for the first time.)  </P> <P> But dramatic departures in governance appear unlikely.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Symbolic Factor  </P> <P> "I think the most important difference will be the symbolism," said Tonatiuh  Guillen Lopez, a political scientist who directs the department of public  administration at the College of the Northern Frontier, a Tijuana-based  research institution. "We are definitely entering a distinct period in the  history of our country. . . . But I don't expect radical or spectacular  changes. There will be an effort to increase efficiency, to demand honesty and  respect of the law in government."  </P> <P> Whatever happens, the nation -- and the world -- will be watching. For Baja  California has become the paramount laboratory for the political opening and  modernization proclaimed by President Salinas. It is also the foremost  opportunity for PAN, for half a century the perpetual bridesmaid in Mexican  politics, to show that it can wear the ring of authority.  </P> <P> "We're now really going to learn a lot about whether PAN can be really trusted  to run a government," said Gabriel Szekely, associate director for the UC San  Diego Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies. "Baja California will be a showcase for  the PAN, and it's in their interest to do the best that they can."  </P> <P> Asked about their plans, PAN leaders, many of whom have close ties to U.S.  investors, talk much about Republican Party-style economic policies -- they  favor increased foreign investment in Mexico, a greater nexus between the  private and public sectors, volunteerism and the like. But PAN's conservative  economic orientation, once widely divergent from the mainstream, is now much in  line with recent policies enunciated by the PRI presidency in Mexico City.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foreign Investment  </P> <P> The PRI's former public distaste for some foreign-investment schemes, such as  the booming assembly-plant industries along the U. S. border, has diminished  considerably in recent years as financial planners have sought some way out of  the nation's economic quagmire. The government has embraced the assembly plants  and virtually any other form of foreign investment.  </P> <P> Thus, major changes in economic policy seem unlikely.  </P> <P> That prognosis may have been different had the governor's seat been captured by  the left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution, which is led by  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the PRI defector who was almost elected president last  year. (Baja was one of a handful of states won outright by Cardenas.)  </P> <P> Although Salinas was apparently willing to lose Baja to the right, observers  say that concurrent election results from the interior state of Michoacan, the  home state of Cardenas, demonstrate that he was not about to concede that state  to a leftist opposition that has quite contrary ideas about how to solve the  country's economic woes. The PRI has claimed a disputed victory in electoral  results there.  </P> <P> "There was a clear double standard," said Lorenzo Meyer, a well-known political  scientist affiliated with El Colegio de Mexico, a Mexico City-based research  institution. "We have an advance in Baja California, but evidence of the old  politics in Michoacan."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fear of Strangulation  </P> <P> On the financial front, there has been some fear that the PRI-dominated central  government in Mexico City, source of most state funding, might try to strangle  an opposition regime by reducing the flow of federal cash, thus making a PAN  regime appear in its worst light. In fact, PRI state governments in the past  have withheld funds from city halls run by a number of opposition mayors,  including Ruffo when he sat as mayor of Ensenada.  </P> <P> However, there is widespread belief that the national PRI leadership and  President Salinas recognize that it would be counterproductive to attempt to  strangle an economically booming border state such as Baja California, which  boasts something that few areas of Mexico can now claim: A vibrant economy,  thanks largely to tourism, international trade and the assembly-plant industry.  </P> <P> Apart from hurting Salinas' reformist image, Szekely noted that taking fiscal  action against Baja California "would just be sending the wrong signals to  foreign investors. I don't think Salinas will do that. I think he will use Baja  as an experiment for cohabitation with the PAN."  </P> <P> During his campaign, Ruffo also doubted that the central government would seek  to straitjacket a PAN-led state. "Baja California is too important economically  to the entire country for the PRI to attempt to make it difficult for us," the  PAN candidate said in an interview shortly before election day.  </P> <P> Throughout the campaign and post-election period, Ruffo has been largely  conciliatory toward the Mexican president, going out of his way to thank  Salinas for ensuring a democratic transformation in Baja California. Ruffo did  this even while condemning clumsy attempts at fraud by local PRI apparatchiks  eager to rig the election in favor of the ruling party.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Making Peace With PRI  </P> <P> Ruffo's olive branches offered to the president are seen as a portent.  Stridency has never been part of his political style, even while he was a  beleaguered mayor of an almost-bankrupt Ensenada, under vicious attack from  PRI-dominated local unions that accused him of incompetence. As governor, Ruffo  must rely on assistance from Mexico City, as well as cooperation from PRI  elements within the state, to allow government to run smoothly -- a precept  that PAN leaders consider critical. There has even been talk that Ruffo might  place a PRI official in his Cabinet.  </P> <P> "The first thing Ruffo has to do is conciliate," said one PRI insider here. "It  doesn't do him any good to have conflict within the state while he's governor."  </P> <P> Indeed, PRI leaders themselves have been speaking of the need for tranquility  in the state, both during and after the elections. Interim Gov. Oscar Baylon  Chacon has called for an orderly transition of government. No one wants  tourists and investors, the area's lifeblood, frightened away by reports of  disruptions or violence.  </P> <P> Among those most resistant to change, and with the most to lose, are the many  PRI loyalists who have for years existed off the public trough, finding a  comfortable new position with each state government. The PRI, like political  machines elsewhere, has long functioned as a massive patronage dispenser, and,  with each new administration, functionaries in search of "bones," or jobs, have  traditionally paid their homage to the new governors and mayors. No-show  employees are known as "aviators," because they are seldom seen after their  quick landings to pick up their checks or make ceremonial appearances at their  offices.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No One Behind the Door  </P> <P> "The party has always been there for them when they came knocking at its door,"  said a longtime PRI insider, who declined to be identified. "But no more."  </P> <P> Of course, the PRI will continue to be a large presence here, subsidized as  always from Mexico City. And the party will still be able to dole out jobs  within its own apparatus as well as within the many grass-roots organizations,  unions and concessions that it controls. But party leaders have acknowledged  that some changes are necessary.  </P> <P> "We have to seek good from this adversity, and we'll accomplish this when we  recognize our errors and mistakes and eliminate them," Rene Trevino Arredondo,  a long-time PRI leader, ex-mayor of Tijuana and current federal congressman,  said in an interview last week with the daily El Mexicano.  </P> <P> As governor, meantime, Ruffo will have to rely on the cooperation of at least  some of the many PRI loyalists among the 5,000 or so state employees. Although  he may replace high-ranking department heads, the experience and know-how of  middle-level bureaucrats will be needed.  </P> <P> Meantime, the PAN itself will have to ensure that it doesn't fall prey to the  same tendencies -- cronyism, corruption and bureaucratic paralysis -- that have  turned so many Mexican citizens against the PRI.  </P> <P> The precise program of PAN leaders in Baja remains murky, but one specific goal  is clear: A reform of state electoral laws to allow minority parties more  opportunity to challenge the PRI monolith. As now drafted, the state's  complicated election statutes favor the ruling party in many ways, allowing PRI  manipulations at many stages in the process. PAN leaders charged that the  tortuous delays in releasing official election results were yet another example  of ruling-party shenanigans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Party With Majority  </P> <P> Pushing through reforms may not be as easy as PAN loyalists would like,  however. No party, it appears, will have a majority in the new, 19-member state  legislature that convenes in October. PAN is now slated to have eight seats,  the PRI seven, and minority parties four others, although those numbers could  change as the Electoral College, now dominated by PAN, hears complaints  surrounding a disputed PRI victory in Mexicali's 3rd Electoral District.  Whatever happens, though, both the PAN and the PRI will have to seek alliances  from third parties, all on the left of the political spectrum, far from the PAN  ideology.  </P> <P> For PRI lawmakers, such negotiation will be a learning experience, as the party  has never before been in the minority. But new skills will be needed most  everywhere.  </P> <P> "We're entering an experimental time, something completely new for the  country," concluded Guillen, the Tijuana political scientist. "By watching what  happens here, maybe we can anticipate the future direction of the nation."  </P></p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Institutions stand firm says Bank of Japan's governor MR YASUSHI MIENO, the governor of the Bank of Japan, said yesterday that the end of Japan's speculative boom, together with the debts the period had left behind, was 'very, very unlikely to shake the stability of financial institutions'. Nevertheless, the central bank had to keep a closer eye on financial stability than it did before, he said in an interview with the Financial Times. Central banks had two goals: price stability and the stability of the financial system. 'In the past, previous governors put a little more weight on the maintenance of price stability (than on financial stability). But under the current circumstances we should attach equal importance to these two objectives'. In a speech to Japanese businessmen later, he warned the US and Europe against seeking rapid solutions to the problems of slow growth and recession. Group of Seven countries should not resort to short-term policies to promote growth at the expense of long-term sustainable growth, Mr Mieno said. Mr Mieno's remarks were seen as warning other G7 countries, particularly the US, to avoid hasty cuts in interest rates or increasing public spending to stimulate the economy. Long-term economic adjustments were often difficult to carry out for political reasons and tended to be postponed, Mr Mieno said, referring to the need for the US to cut its federal deficit. But delay would leave countries prey 'to the risk of excessively stimulating their economies'. Mr Mieno also said that even though international policy co-ordination was important, each country should pursue its own policies and not rely on other G7 members to make short-term changes in their economic management for the benefit of others. 'Instead of focusing unduly on short-term growth, we should look at the growth fundamentals.' Mr Triple Trouble fights his corner, Page 13</p>

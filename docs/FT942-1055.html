			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Big day gets ever nearer - Rolling Settlements There is only one complete stock exchange account period left until rolling settlement begins on July 18. The stock exchange divides the year up into account periods, named by letters of the alphabet. We are now in the middle of account period M, in which the last day for dealings is July 1. All trades conducted any time in the account period, which began on June 20, are totalled and a single bill for the net amount is sent out. It has to be settled on July 11. This allows some investors (particularly, those who have dealt early in the account) up to 15 working days to settle their accounts. The system allowing them to settle the net amount is useful for all investors, and especially speculators who aim to buy and sell at a profit within the same account. If successful, they can make money without ever having to put up a penny of their own money. Account periods will disappear from July 18, although investors who dealt in the last period - account N - can still settle in the usual way on July 25. From July 18, the settlement day will be 10 working days after dealing day - or T+10.</p>

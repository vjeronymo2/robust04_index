			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRITICISM DIRECTED AT REVIEWER'S REMARKS  </P> <P> Rarely do I take the time to respond to a review. I must, however, take  exception to Mark Chalon Smith's review of my production of "Lu Ann Hampton  Laverty Oberlander" (" 'Lu Ann' Offers Flavor Over Substance," Calendar, April  12) largely because he is so completely wrong.  </P> <P> Smith says the script "neglects to tell us much about her or how she got to be  the person she is." Nothing is further from the truth. The play is riddled with  recall as the character fills us in on the consequences that have shaped her  life. Evidently, Smith is far more used to TV, where all one has to do is watch  instead of listen.  </P> <P> Smith indicates that a "more complex performance might be able to" transcend  the "superficial" script. Deborah-Leigh Schmidt's performance is so complex  that audience members have failed to recognize her as the same actress in all  three acts.  </P> <P> Smith's evaluation of Mark Perkins portrayal of Skip is that "he does pretty  well." What does that mean?  </P> <P> Smith, moreover, missed the carefully layered nuances in the play that make the  script strong and actually replicate the sadness and stagnation from decade to  decade. To anybody with a trained eye, it is almost painfully obvious that  daughter Charmane's teen-age years mirror those of the now adult Lu Ann, and  that her future is just as dim as Lu Ann's past has been.  </P> <P> This is not a superficial script, only a superficial review / reviewer.  </P> <P> I am sure you won't have the nerve to print this. What is more unfortunate is  that you will continue to print the unsophisticated drivel of Mark Chalon  Smith, who desperately needs some classes in dramatic theory and criticism.  </P> <P> WILLIAM WAXMAN  </P> <P>  Waxman directed the production of "Lu Ann Hampton Laverty Oberlander," which  continues at the Newport Theatre Arts Center through May 7.  </P> <P> </P></p>

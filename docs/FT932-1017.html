			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Euro-mergers MR KAREL Van Miert, the new EC competition commissioner, must shortly decide whether to recommend an increase in Brussels' powers to vet large EC mergers. The European Commission is under a legal obligation to carry out a review, before the end of the year, of the EC Merger Regulation turnover thresholds, above which the Commission has exclusive competence to investigate mergers. European industry is broadly in favour of giving Brussels greater powers over cross-border deals. Business likes the advantages the regulation offers of 'one-stop shop' merger control and rapid clearance. But there is little enthusiasm for lowering the thresholds among the member states. Only Belgium and the Netherlands are strongly in favour. Britain, France and Germany are opposed. Britain believes that a shift in power to Brussels is premature and runs counter to the new emphasis on subsidiarity. Germany resents the Commission's consistent refusal to refer cases back to the Bundeskartellamt. France, infuriated by the blocking of the Aerospatiale/Alenia bid for De Havilland - the only deal to be blocked under the regulation so far - wants higher thresholds to scale back the Commission's powers. Continued opposition by these three would be sufficient to defeat any Commission proposal for change. That may be no bad thing. Before contemplating any increase in the Commission's jurisdiction there is a need both for greater transparency in the Brussels decision-making process and for an injection of some element of independence into the system. Analysis of the merger regulation for the Centre for Economic Policy Research points to a number of weaknesses. The Commission is accused of defining markets too narrowly. Procedures are excessively opaque and unnec-essarily open to manipulation. Many of the conditions attached to the clearance of deals are cosmetic and of doubtful effectiveness. The transparency of merger control could be improved immediately by requiring publication of proposed conditions of settlement before a final decision on clearance is made. This would allow for proper evaluation and for interested third parties to comment. It would also place a much-needed onus on Brussels to justify competition decisions. But a reduction in the scope for political manipulation will never be achieved while the Commission remains investigator, prosecutor, judge and executioner. Responsibility for the investigation of mergers should be hived-off to an independent body leaving the powers of negotiation and decision-making with the Commission. These proposals will not of themselves safeguard against all political interference but they are likely to produce fairer, more open and more consistent decision-making. Until they have been implemented Mr Van Miert should leave the thresholds alone.</p>

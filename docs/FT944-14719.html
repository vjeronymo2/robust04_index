			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: A Fisher's Pounds 35m masks setback - Lower seafood profits and lettuce prices make disappointing cocktail Disappointing results in the European seafood and North American produce divisions were behind a fall in annual operating profits from continuing activities at Albert Fisher from Pounds 41.7m to Pounds 38.7m. The food processing and distribution group blamed sharply lower produce prices for the setback in North America, where profits almost halved. It cited as an example the average price for a case of iceberg lettuces at Dollars 5.20, compared with Dollars 8.05 a year earlier. The fall in European seafood profits reflected intense competition in the mussels market, combined with a sharp rise in prawn prices and difficulty in sourcing white fish. Mr Stephen Walls, chairman, said it had not been an easy year. 'We may be disappointed - but we are certainly not gloomy about the prospects of the group.' Pre-tax profits for the year to August 31 rose from Pounds 26.9m to Pounds 34.8m. The latest figure included an exceptional gain of Pounds 600,000 and a Pounds 3.6m contribution from discontinued operations, compared with a previous exceptional charge of Pounds 15.4m and Pounds 7.5m input from discontinued operations. Sales improved to Pounds 1.42bn (Pounds 1.28bn), including Pounds 51.5m (Pounds 122.1m) from discontinued operations. The shares fell 3p to 44p yesterday - still below the Pounds 51m rights issue offer of 52p in May. North American operating profits tumbled to Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 11.6m) on sales up from Pounds 360m to Pounds 482m. The group said the intense price competition for produce, following excess supplies, had cost it Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.32m). Fresh Western, the Californian fresh produce supplier acquired at the beginning of the year, suffered an operating loss of Dollars 2m, although the group said the export side had fared better than expected with Dollars 50m worth of sales. In Europe, operating profits improved by Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 32.3m, and sales increased from Pounds 802m to Pounds 891m. Profits in the seafood sector, which the group has targeted for growth, fell from Pounds 10m to Pounds 8.1m. Sales grew by Pounds 40m to Pounds 166m, including a Pounds 30m contribution from Rahbek, the Danish-based seafood company bought for Pounds 59m after the rights issue. The fresh produce sector increased profits from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 10.7m, reflecting better prices, particularly for citrus fruit and onions. Food processing profits were flat at Pounds 13.5m. Net debt at the year-end was Pounds 93.5m (Pounds 84.5m). But gearing is expected to fall to below 30 per cent following the recent Pounds 37.1m disposal of parts of Stratford-upon-Avon Foods and Rowats Foods to Campbell Grocery Products, a subsidiary of the US food group. Earnings per share were 3.34p (2.43p). The proposed final dividend is maintained at 1.9p, taking the total for the year to 3.71p (3.75p). COMMENT This company is under pressure to maintain its dividend and high yield, which is about the only thing it has to offer after these disappointing results. Fortunately the balance sheet remains strong, although the rights issue could be seen as robbing Peter to pay Paul. There is no denying that the group has radically changed shape over the past couple of years - the question is whether the prospects have improved as much as the management claims, or whether it will remain vulnerable to commodity price swings. If the seafood division delivers the expected growth, profits this year could be about Pounds 40m, giving a low looking prospective multiple of 11. The main support will continue to be the 10 per cent yield, assuming an unchanged dividend.</p>

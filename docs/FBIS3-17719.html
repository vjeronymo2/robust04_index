And a Great Many More Will  Cling to Its Shoulder" -- first paragraph is boxed "Calling  Card" introduction]    [Text] Ivan Petrovich Rybkin was born in 1946. He  graduated from the Volgograd Agricultural Institute, the CPSU  Central Committee Academy of Social Sciences, and the Foreign  Ministry Diplomatic Academy; he is a candidate of technical  sciences and senior lecturer, worked in industry, and spent 17  years lecturing in a higher educational establishment. Until  his election as a Russian people's deputy in 1991, he was second  secretary of the Volgograd CPSU Oblast Committee. In the  Russian Federation Supreme Soviet he was coordinator of the  "Communists of Russia" faction. He was elected to the State Duma  in December 1993. He has been chairman of the State Duma since  January 1994.    [Yermolin] Ivan Petrovich, let us begin with our traditional  questions: What is your attitude toward military service? What  was your military rank?    [Rybkin] My current military rank is major in the reserve.  I did compulsory service in my time. After graduating from the  school for junior aviation specialists I served in the Air Force  near Tula -- the regiment was called "Normandy-Neman" in the old  style. So far as I know, all the men in our family served in  the Army. My great grandfathers received land on the right bank  of the Khoper for 25 years of irreproachable service. One of my  great grandfathers fought at Shipka, and the other fought in the  Russian-Japanese war and World War I. My father is a Great  Patriotic War invalid. He came home badly wounded and severely  shell-shocked, mute and deaf. My mom married him when he was in  that state.... My uncle, a colonel in the reserve, has five  combat decorations. My two cousins are officers and both serve  in the North. In a nutshell, I regard military service as a  sacred duty.    [Yermolin] Such an attitude toward service and the Armed  Forces can scarcely be described as commonplace today. There  are many reasons for this. But I think you will agree that  legislators too must have their say here and work to increase  the Army's prestige.    [Rybkin] You are quite right. The Army must be thoroughly  helped today. The serviceman still does not enjoy full legal  protection today.    At this point I can say the following: The State Duma  Defense Committee and the Russian Federation Defense Ministry  must have joint working groups which, among others, would  resolve the task of monitoring the way in which the laws that  are adopted are implemented. In other words, monitoring the  entire sequence: the law, the procedure for application, and  implementation at local level. Our committee is vested with  monitoring functions, and I know its members intend to strictly  oversee the implementation of laws from the "military package."  As for the package itself, we are not going to start over from  scratch. Some things will be revised and added to. We will  also reinstate a great deal that had been lost. For instance,  providing retirees with land. Remember the norms of the postwar  period: When, say, a colonel who had fought bravely was  discharged, his chest covered in decorations, the state would  give him a house and one hectare of land. This also  demonstrated the state's attitude toward the military, its  defenders. Today former officers could also do a great deal to  develop private farming. The most effective assistance will be  given to them here. It has to be said that nowadays those who  are discharged from the Army into the reserve or who retire are  much less well protected than formerly. If only because these  processes used to be planned, whereas now mass discharges are  taking place as a result of the reform while people at local  level are often simply unable to handle all the retirees. In  principle, I will say one thing: So far as we are concerned,  the Army and legal support for it are a priority sphere of  activity. And in the very near future we hope to begin  examining draft laws from the "military package." But I will  note that I would like to see a prompter response from the  Defense Ministry to our request to provide help in the form of  skilled advisers and to assign experienced specialists to work  on the committee. There are professional soldiers on the  committee, but assistance would be nice. I also want to  emphasize that, despite the fact that the Defense Committee  represents literally all factions, there are no disagreements  over approaches toward solving the Army's problems: Everyone is  unanimous that the Armed Forces need a reliable legal base today.    [Yermolin] There is also another problem that perturbs the  military today -- the protection of the defense budget. It is  no secret that even the funds assigned for defense purposes  according to the budget often have to be wrestled out of the  Finance Ministry, so to speak.    [Rybkin] I can only repeat -- here too the State Duma will  monitor things most strictly. Unfortunately, we are still not  able to live according to a single state budget. So now we are  having to ratify the budget quarterly. The government recently  sent us the draft budget law for the second quarter: to  authorize funding in the amounts for the first quarter. The  State Duma already adopted it by 23 March. I would emphasize  that the Army must receive everything allocated to it under the  law. We will keep a constant eye on this, and we will react  promptly and harshly to any attempts to hurt the military in any  respect.    [Yermolin] Problems of funding and social protection are  certainly keenly felt as far as the Army is concerned. But the  military react just as sensitively to political instability in  the country. It has long been noted that, as a rule, it is  purely civilian people who speak lightly of war. The  professional soldier, more than anyone, knows the price of peace  and is interested in civil accord. Today we can see how various  forces in society -- the president, the government, parliament,  and movements and parties -- are attempting to arrive at general  accord. Admittedly, it is somewhat worrying that some people are  attempting to use even peace initiatives, memorandums, and  statements for purposes of political confrontation. In this  connection my question is this: How do you, as chairman of the  State Duma, envision the road to civil accord?    [Rybkin] First of all, I think that in October we all  received a real inoculation against any relapse into the  sickness of "civil war." The extremists gained the upper hand  then, and we all suffered a defeat. We must learn from this. I  have always said and I reiterate today: We are all doomed to  reach accord. Doomed. I have seen for myself that the president  is today particularly persistent on the road toward accord. We  have mutual understanding and cooperation with his structures  and with Boris Nikolayevich himself. I do not feel any  particular concern that some people are putting forward their  own peace initiatives. Here, as the poet said, "let fame be the  spur." I see no contradictions on this path. The president  voiced his proposals in his message. Then Boris Nikolayevich  assembled a conference and two cochairmen of a working  commission were appointed. The commission is now working on a  document that will reflect the desire of all Russia's branches  of power, parties, social organizations, trade unions, and  religious groups for civil peace. The Duma has delegated  Alevtina Vasilyevna Fedulova to the commission, and  representatives of different factions and deputies' groups are  also taking part. That is, normal cooperation is under way. I  do not know where this talk of a "war of peace initiatives"  originates. Like the rumors of conspiracies and confrontation  in general. The president will return to Moscow, and everyone  will get together and I am sure will sign a memorandum or pact  of civil peace. You can call it what you will, but the  important thing is that they will sign a common accord not to  violate but to strengthen peace in society. In fact the  recently announced amnesty was the first step toward this. I am  sure that the majority of Russian citizens welcome the fact that  we have had sufficient sense and sufficient heart to forget the  black days of enmity. It could not be otherwise. People can  breathe freely, and hopes for a better future have emerged.  There is no need to keep a worried eye on the political  pendulum to see which way it is going to swing and who is going  to arrest and put on trial whom tomorrow. All the people who  have been released have been given an opportunity to embark on  creative activity. If some do not take this opportunity and  again attempt to stage a political brawl, we, together with the  president, are able to give them an appropriate warning or put  them back behind bars, this time under tougher articles of the  Criminal Code. I would remind you that amendments of this sort  to the Criminal Code have already passed their first reading in  the Duma. It is precisely the amnesty that in many respects  made possible the appearance of the document on all-Russian  accord that is now in preparation.    [Yermolin] Politics is capable of bringing about such an  accord, but only the economy can preserve and consolidate it.  Do you agree with that view, Ivan Petrovich?    [Rybkin] Of course. This is why we are working so hard in  the Duma on a code of laws capable not only of ensuring the  progress of the economic reforms but in some respects of  anticipating them. Our main problem is the decline in  production. Until producers begin to work, you can write the  most beautiful budgets in ornamental Slavonic script but nothing  will change for the better. We have a state sector in the  economy -- we must restore its full controllability.  Controllability not so much by administrative methods as by  economic methods. As for the private sector, it should be borne  in mind that in all countries it is regulated by means of taxes,  the system of benefits, and so on. And the private sector must  work in the interests of the state. This is entirely natural.  Unfortunately, legislators are at present lagging behind the  processes that are taking place in society, in the sphere of  economic relations. But, I repeat, a package of draft laws  forming the legal framework for economic reform is largely ready  in the Duma committees, and work on the draft laws at plenary  sessions will begin in the next few days.    [Yermolin] Returning to the topic of civil peace, I would  like to know: How explosive do you think the very fact of such  sharp stratification of society into poor and rich may prove to  be? After all, today over one-third of Russians are below the  poverty line.    [Rybkin] The state is obliged to support and will support  those who, for objective reasons, have been left helpless in  market conditions -- elderly people, invalids, large families,  orphans.... But it is impossible to turn Russia back into one  big social security department. Yes, the state must protect its  citizens' rights -- the right to work and to remuneration. Work  and provide for yourself and your family by your labor. You can  put your trust in the state today, but you must rely primarily  on yourself. As for "budget-financed workers," including the  military, as I have already said, the State Duma insofar as its  rights permit will act as the guarantor that the state does not  renege on its commitments here.    [Yermolin] Do you think that the social base exists for  civil accord in the country?    [Rybkin]) I am sure that the overwhelming majority of  Russians realize that today you cannot have everything all at  once and today you cannot think in terms of "Whites and Reds."  People also realize this. Where does this clear division exist  in real life? Nowhere. Everything is interwoven. My  grandfather got on his horse and went to fight against Yegor  Gaydar's grandfather. Brother went to war against brother. Do  we want all this to happen all over again? I am sure that if in  1921 Soviet power had not declared an amnesty on everyone who  fought against the "Reds" in the civil war, it would have been a  long time before there was peace on the Don and in southern  Russia. Only after "amnesia" had been declared did real civil  peace and a transition to creative life become possible. In  1921 my grandfather got off his horse and hung up his saber. I  remembered this when I supported the idea of an amnesty for all  participants in political clashes. Understanding by Russian  citizens that civil war is the ruin of Russia is the basis that  will unite everyone.    [Yermolin] In addition to that understanding, I would like  to hope that Russians also have a sense of being a power, one  power for all. A power that has its own interests and dignity.    [Rybkin] Unfortunately, we have rather forgotten our own  interests in recent years. Take the problem of credits. In  1992 we paid off more credits than the United States. Why? At  a time when we ourselves need credits. We must put an end to  this. Relations with foreign countries, including nearby ones,  must be based on the proverb: "Prudence will not spoil a  friendship." Especially with regard to warning countries.  Anyone who picks up a weapon must be aware that his is  primarily ruining his own country and his own family.    [Yermolin] The example of the peacemaking mission in  Yugoslavia indicates that we still remember our geopolitical  interests.    [Rybkin] That is true. Our actions here must be very  considered. Not everybody likes the inclusion of Russia in the  European security system. Remember merely the fact that we are  still being kept in the "antechamber" to the Council of Europe  whereas the Baltic countries got through it quite quickly. We  should not be in a hurry and fuss about. Incidentally, this  also applies to the "Partnership for Peace" program. Russia is  not an ordinary participant in the international process.  Accordingly the terms of the proposed partnership must take  this into account. Incidentally, U.S. Defense Secretary William  Perry, who recently visited our country, agreed with me on this  point. If along with the withdrawal of troops from Germany and  the Baltic states, we also join in a process of standardization  [unifikatsiya] "after the pattern of so and so," there will be  more than enough negative consequences. Negative so far as  Russia's defense capability is concerned. As for partnership,  this can only be welcomed. Especially as partnership in this  instance is mutually advantageous. Russia has been and remains  one of the crucial factors in world security. Whether some  people like this or not.    [Yermolin] Ivan Petrovich, finally let me ask you a few  short questions. What is your view of Mikhail Poltoranin's  statement about the prospect of extending the powers of the  Federal Assembly until 1998?    [Rybkin] From a purely legal viewpoint this is possible. By  kind agreement with the president and the Federation Council.  But the main say here belongs to the people. Even without a  referendum it will be clear whether our activity suits Russian  citizens or not. Then we will decide. At the moment we are  laying the foundations for full-blooded work by the sixth State  Duma. Not a sitting goes by without our adopting one or two  laws. So much for the question of the effectiveness of the  Duma. We are close to working in a more coordinated fashion.    [Yermolin] How do you understand the expression "The Army is  outside politics"?    [Rybkin] It is desirable for the Army to be outside  politics, but to know what is happening in politics. Don't  forget that enlightenment has always been a strong point of the  Russian Army. Having a clear idea of the world in which you  live, and knowing the line that cannot be crossed. Russian  officers were world-renowned for being marked by education,  culture, and a lofty understanding of duty, dignity, and honor,  and the Russian intelligentsia used to devote the best years of  its youth to service. And this was correct.    [Yermolin] Do you take an optimistic view of the future?    [Rybkin] I can answer that question as follows. U.S. Vice  President Gorn [as published] said to me: "I want to share your  confidence in the success of the reforms if only because Russia  is a country of highly educated people, more educated even than  in the United States." Admittedly, he added that we lack  pragmatism. Yes, I am confident that Russia has been and will  remain a respected country in the world and a power. And many  will cling to the shoulder of this power in search of protection  and support.</p>

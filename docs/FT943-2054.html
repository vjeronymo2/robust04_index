			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Buthelezi dismissed by king in KwaZulu leadership feud The feud between two of the leaders of South Africa's 9m Zulus came to a head yesterday when King Goodwill Zwelithini dismissed Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi as his prime minister. The confrontation could lead to a change in the political control of Natal's provincial parliament, currently held by the chief's Inkatha Freedom party, and help reshape the political future of South Africa. The sacking could undermine Chief Buthelezi's position as a minister in the country's coalition government if he were challenged from within his party. In an announcement released at Nongoma in KwaZulu/Natal province by the royal council, a group of advisers to the monarch, the king said he was dismissing Chief Buthelezi as traditional prime minister to the royal house  -an advisory position - and would have no further contact with him. The move is the biggest political upheaval since President Nelson Mandela took office after South Africa's first all-race elections in April. The statement also said the king was cancelling this year's Shaka Day celebrations, an annual festival to celebrate the Zulu kingdom's 19th century founder which had been due next Saturday. The king called instead on the Zulu people to observe a four-day period of 'prayer, unity, reconciliation and peace'. Both men will be vying for support of the conservative, traditional rural vote which in April helped give Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party a narrow victory in KwaZulu/Natal over Mr Mandela's African National Congress. Should the king win what may be a violent contest, control of the province could pass to the ANC, with whom the king has established close links. Victory for Chief Buthelezi could reinforce Inkatha's hold over the region's assembly and keep open the possibility that he might press for greater powers for what would become a virtually autonomous Natal. Mr Mandela, in Cape Town with Mr John Major, visiting British prime minister, expressed optimism that the issue could be speedily resolved. Chief Buthelezi said he had received no formal communication from the king. Mr Ziba Jiyane, Inkatha secretary general, said the party would press ahead with next weekend's celebrations without the king. The king's decision was apparently prompted by rioting by Inkatha supporters after a meeting on Monday night at the monarch's palace between himself, Mr Mandela and the chief. The talks were aimed at resolving a dispute stemming from Chief Buthelezi's anger over the king's apparent failure to consult him about an invitation to Mr Mandela to attend the Shaka Day festival.

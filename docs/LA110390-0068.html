			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROSS GETS HIS MARK; RBV WINS  </P> <P> The full moon was shining bright, like a big spotlight, on the Vista High  School football field.  </P> <P> And Markeith Ross, the Laurence Olivier of running backs, was Friday night's  star on the 100-yard stage.  </P> <P> Ross, a Rancho Buena Vista senior, became San Diego County's most prolific  rusher in a 38-24 homecoming victory over Fallbrook in front of 3,500. He  gained 159 yards on 18 carries, giving him 4,496 for his career, surpassing the  record 4,486 yards held by former RBV back O.J. Hall (1987-89).  </P> <P> Since opening in 1987, RBV has been a virtual running back factory. Scott  Garcia (1987-88) is fifth in career rushing with 3,466 yards.  </P> <P> Ross figured he would get the record sooner or later. And it wouldn't matter to  him at all if the record didn't come at all. "(The Stadium) is my goal," Ross  said of advancing to the championship game at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  "The rushing records can all pass, I just want to go to The Stadium."  </P> <P> This is not Ross' first county record. He already holds the career mark for  most points scored with 416.  </P> <P> He also set a single-game touchdown and scoring record when he rushed for seven  in a game against Poway earlier this year.  </P> <P> He finished the night with three touchdowns for RBV, on runs of four, two and  five yards. He has 23 this season, 22 rushing.  </P> <P> With the victory, RBV (7-2, 6-0) clinched the Palomar League title. Fallbrook  (4-4-1, 1-4-1) was hoping for an upset to try to ensure an at-large berth for  the playoffs.  </P> <P> They were unwilling to let Ross' record come easily. Although Ross gained 64  yards on his first carry, the defense keyed on him the rest of the night,  opening the door for backfield mates Tyrone Cormier, Edric Hall and Derrick  Breaux.  </P> <P> Fallbrook held a 24-19 lead, in large part due to sophomore quarterback John  Dutton and the running of Tony Burton.  </P></p>

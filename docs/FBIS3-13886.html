			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Position on Jerusalem"] </F>   [Text] The thing that arouses concern about the UN  Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre is not the  resolution itself, but the foot-dragging that sought to empty it  of any meaning or practical use. All this, however, is needless  repetition and self-evident truth known by everyone.    Even graver than this is what news agencies reported about  the U.S. abstention on one of the resolution's clauses. That  clause considers Jerusalem to be part of the Arab territories  occupied in 1967 and the same international resolutions and  negotiating points of reference applying to those territories  also apply to Jerusalem.    It is common knowledge that after the massacre at the holy  al-Ibrahimi Mosque, U.S. pressure continued on the Palestinian  leadership in a bid to empty the resoution of content.  Washington linked its approval of the resolution to the  Palestinians' resumption of negotiations with Israel. In other  words, the United States adopted the Israeli stance. The  Palestinian leadership's refusal to deal with the U.S. position  delayed voting on the draft resolution for three weeks.    This U.S. stance, biased in favor of Israel, encouraged it  to  continue its settlement policy in the occupied Arab territories,  particularly in the Jerusalem area, where various Israeli  ministries are making plans to build more settlements and  settlement neighborhoods in a bid to impose a new fait accompli.    All Arab and Islamic parties concerned with the future of  the  occupied Palestinian territories, foremost of all Jerusalem,  must realize these facts and act to confront designs and plans  aimed at the Arab presence in the holy city. Inalienable  Palestinian rights include all the occupied territories, which  begin from Jerusalem and end in Jerusalem.</p>

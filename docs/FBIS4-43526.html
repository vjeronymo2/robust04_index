			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Peres in Vienna: `Israel's </F> Relations With Austria Could Not Be Any Better!'"]    [Excerpt] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres arrived in  Vienna on an unofficial visit Tuesday [14 June]. The highlight  of a short meeting with [Chancellor Franz] Vranitzky was Peres'  statement: "We have no problems at all with Austria, relations  could not be any better." It was not always like that, and it  might become different with Italy. However, regarding questions  in this connection Peres said that Prime Minister Berlusconi and  Foreign Minister Martino were great friends of Israel. As far  as the neofascist government members are concerned, one would  have to wait and see. Peres appeared to be as optimistic as  ever about the progress in the peace process, even though a  severe controversy about Jerusalem flared up in the past few  days. [passage omitted]</p>

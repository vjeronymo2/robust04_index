			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Directors 'stole' Pounds 2m of fine wine Two directors of London wine dealer Green's stole Pounds 2m of fine wines, vintage port and champagne being stored for customers, Inner London crown court heard yesterday. Joseph Mankowitz and Raymond Burroway, who bought the 207-year-old company in 1990, engineered a bogus sell-off of the storage part of Green's operations to cover their tracks, said Mr Paul Dodgson, prosecuting. The 'buyer' was called John Ryan. He had no address and no solicitors acting for him. He not only paid too much but did so in cash. Mr Dodgson said it was the prosecution's case that Ryan was a 'stooge' and the sale was a 'charade' to cover up the theft of 6,800 cases of wine, port and champagne in the autumn of 1990. 'We say that that was just a fiction, just a smokescreen to try to persuade the outside world that whatever happened next was not Mr Mankowitz's and Mr Burroway's fault, but Mr Ryan's,' said Mr Dodgson. 'So in due course when the truth came out . . . you had to have someone there to blame and the man who would be subsequently blamed was Ryan.' Mr Mankowitz, 47, of Earls Court, west London, and Mr Burroway, 52, of Wandsworth, south-west London, deny conspiring to steal the wine. Mr Anthony Boylan, 58, of Park Road, Dulwich, south-east London, also denies the charge. He is alleged to have used a false name to remove some of the wine from storage. Much of the wine was kept in the company's duty-free bonded warehouses in London and Wiltshire. He claimed the Crown could prove that Mr Burroway received Pounds 80,000 from the proceeds of the sale of some of the stolen wine. However, there was no direct evidence Mr Mankowitz received any money from any sales. He told the jury that in considering the scenario he had outlined, they might well feel there was a 'strong case' that the two men, helped by Mr Boylan, stole the vintage stock. The trial was adjourned until today.</p>

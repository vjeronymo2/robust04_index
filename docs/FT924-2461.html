			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Theatres in England to receive government subsidies from regional arts boards DEVOLUTION on the boards: the leading regional theatres in England, including Manchester's Royal Exchange (above), will receive government subsidies from regional arts boards instead of from the Arts Council, Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage minister, said yesterday, Antony Thorncroft writes. The reform devolves 42 arts clients, sharing a subsidy of Pounds 14m, from the control of the Arts Council in London. The council will still deal directly with 144 companies, including the national companies such as the Royal Opera House and the Royal National Theatre. The council's budget this year is Pounds 225m. Other theatre companies devolved include the Bristol Old Vic, the West Yorkshire Playhouse, the Leicester Haymarket, the Nottingham Playhouse, and in London the Bush, the Young Vic and the Hampstead Theatre. The London Arts Board will also fund the Wigmore Hall and the Photographer's Gallery. The devolution is less drastic than that envisaged by Mr Richard Luce, a previous arts minister, who planned to confine the Arts Council to a mainly advisory role. The leading orchestras, including the LSO, the LPO, the RPO, and the Philharmonia, along with the CBSO in Birmingham and the Halle in Manchester, have won their fight to remain centrally funded, as have the Royal Court Theatre in London, Opera North, the Institute of Contemporary Arts, and the Serpentine and Whitechapel galleries in London and Ikon in Birmingham. Mr Brooke said the quality of the orchestras is judged nationally while theatres have regional competitors, enabling local arts boards to evaluate their performance. The changes in funding take place in April 1994. In the meantime, the role of the Arts Council will be examined. It is likely to become more of a strategic organisation, although it will still supervise the workings of the regional arts boards. It could also distribute money to the arts from the national lottery.</p>

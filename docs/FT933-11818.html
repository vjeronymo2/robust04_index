			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Bombings plunge Italy in disarray A CAR bomb in Milan, followed just 40 minutes later by two more in Rome, last night revived the spectre of terrorist violence in Italy and re-awakened fears of a co-ordinated attempt to destabilise the country. The Milan bomb killed five people and injured six. In Rome about 20 were feared injured by the car bombs, which appeared directed at two historic buildings. The back of the Basilica of St John the Lateran, a former papal residence, was severely damaged; the other blast occurred by the 12th century church of St George in Velabro, near the Capitoline Hill. The bombs followed a similar pattern to one planted three months ago outside the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, which killed a family of five, and another a few days earlier in a residential suburb of Rome. The government claimed that these bore the stamp of the Mafia and dissident elements of the security services. But no arrests have since been made and no developments announced. Last night's bombs appeared designed to achieve the same destabilising objectives. The explosions come at a time when Italy's entire political structure is changing, in the wake of a widespread corruption scandal, and when the country is facing the prospect of early elections and electoral reform. Leading politicians accused of receiving massive bribes in the Montedison-Enimont industrial scandal are also expected to be named shortly. The Milan blast took place just after 11.15pm, as emergency services responded to an anonymous call which said a car was on fire in the city's Via Palestro, just outside a former villa once occupied by Napoleon's family. A second anonymous call soon afterwards apparently informed the authorities that a bomb was on board the car, believed to be a Fiat Uno. Three firemen who arrived at the scene were killed by the eventual explosion, along with a policeman. The fifth person killed was believed to be a North African immigrant. Coming at the peak of the summer tourist season, the bombings look set to cause the maximum economic damage and create an atmosphere of extreme tension. Mr Marco Formentini, Milan's new Lombard League mayor, immediately denounced the explosions as 'an attempt at intimidation' and pledged a firm response by the authorities. Mr Formentini said: 'Certainly someone wants to impede this country's desire to renew itself. They want to impede the democratic process.'</p>

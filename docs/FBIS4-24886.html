			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yueh Shan (1471 1472): "Reviewing the Causes of </F> the `Turmoil,' Diehards Insist That the Massacre Was Correct"]    [Text] There are different opinions within the CPC on the 4  June massacre. The diehards insist that the massacre was  "reasonable." This finds full expression in their analysis of  and conclusions on the causes of the 1989 "turmoil."    In mid-December 1993, a discussion meeting was held by the  General Office of the CPC Central Committee to review and sum up  the causes of the political "turmoil" in 1989. Also attending  the meeting were such institutions as the Policy Research Office  of the CPC Central Committee, the Policy Research Office of the  State Council, the Policy Research Office of the Chinese Academy  of Social Sciences, the International Relations Research  Institute, and the Information Institute of the Ministry of  Public Security.    The subjects discussed at the meeting included the main  causes of the evolution of the "political turmoil" in 1989, the  current unstable factors inside the country, and their  relationship with external factors. The meeting also drew  conclusions on the serious deviations of bureaucratism and  rightism in the party's work. The material on the meeting,  although a bit out of date, remains useful for reference.    When reviewing the main causes of the 1989 political  turmoil,  the meeting enumerated six points.    First, it was correct that the party focused its work on  economic construction, but the party neglected the existence of  the hostile forces in society, which continued to organize  activities with the support of certain external forces from 1984.    Second, from the central to local levels, the party leaders  neglected the existence of the ideological struggle between the  right and the wrong; and for a certain period, neglected and  even negated the existence of the ideological trend to oppose  the "four cardinal principles" inside the party.    Third, a number of bureaucratic and corrupt elements inside  the party and government leading organs violated and disrupted  the party's established principles and policies, and thus harmed  the relationship between the party and the masses.    Fourth, a considerable number of party organizations gave up  political and ideological studies and did not properly  consolidate themselves. After criticizing and correcting the  previous ultraleftist line of putting politics in command, they  slipped into the rightist deviation of regarding political and  ideological work as useless. So they were bogged down in a  helpless position and became panic-stricken when the turmoil  occurred.    Fifth, some people inside the party neglected the fact of  the  U.S. hegemonists' nature and basic strategy of subverting,  infiltrating, and interfering in socialist China; and they even  neglected the fact that the United States had never stopped its  ideological infiltration aimed at effecting peaceful evolution  in China.    Sixth, some party leaders tried to split the party, and they  used the turmoil and the party's lack of preparation against the  turmoil to divert people's attention from the serious mistakes  in their work and style. They even did not scruple to split the  party and support the turmoil.    Only the third of the above-mentioned six points is somewhat  pertinent. This showed that the diehards inside the CPC did not  have any guilty conscience for the social unrest in 1989 and the  4 June massacre; on the contrary, they just put the blame on the  so-called "hostile forces," "hegemonists," and "splittists"  (referring to Zhao Ziyang). How ridiculous this is!    They also summed up four external factors:    First, the hostile elements inside and outside the country  and inside and outside the party made use of the problems in the  implementation of the party's line in the realm of  superstructure and the rightist deviation of the party  leadership to create public opinion against the party's  leadership and against socialism.    Second, the hegemonist forces and power politics represented  by the United States used the opportunity of China's  concentrating on economic construction to instigate, abet, and  support domestic hostile forces to stir up trouble and create  turmoil in order to overthrow the current socialist system, to  oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, and to make China  follow the system of the United States.    Third, the Western mass media continued their habitual  practice of cooking up rumors and creating sensational events in  their anti-China and anticommunist propaganda so that they  played a role in adding fuel to the flames and aggravating the  seriousness of the events.    Fourth, hostile elements in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas  areas took advantage of the turmoil to create sensational news,  thus instigating people who were not aware of the true facts to  donate money in order to achieve their anti-China and  anticommunist purpose and to aggravate the turmoil in China.    The so-called "external factors" were also based on the  stereotypical "class analysis" method and "class struggle"  theory. They did not mention the actual and important external  factor. That is, in the contemporary world, democracy has  become a historical trend, and the autocratic system is at its  last gasp. Why did the CPC authorities not dare to face this  reality squarely?    The meeting pointed out the unstable factors and the  possibilities inside China:    First, the rightist deviation still existed in the thinking  and routine work of some party organizations in terms of being  alert to the activities of hostile forces and their destructive  effects.    Second, the bureaucratic style of work of some party and  government institutions produced very bad effects among the  masses, and the relationship between the party and the masses  had yet to be further improved by initiatives taken by the party.    Third, although corruption and abuse of power among party  and  government cadres were rectified to a certain degree, the state  of affairs was not improved to the degree of winning trust and  support from the masses.    Fourth, the price hikes aroused discontent among cadres and  the masses, who hoped to improve their living conditions.    Fifth, there were difficulties in the implementation of the  rural and agricultural policies; and local leaders had certain  wrong ideas about the rural work and the issues concerning the  peasants. This led to certain problems in the rural work.    Sixth, the exodus of the rural population and the increasing  jobless population in society added pressure to society as a  whole and caused problems in law and order.    Seventh, although the hostile forces in society did not act  as flagrantly as before, they were still carrying out seditious  activities by making use of the errors of local party  organizations and local governments in the implementation of the  policies and in their routine work.    Eighth, the local party and government institutions did not  correctly understand and effectively carry out the policies and  principles laid down by the central authorities; some local  leaders made mistakes in the course of carrying out the policies  and produced negative effects among the masses.    It seemed that the discussion meeting came to recognize some  problems in reality only in the last part of its agenda, but it  still adopted some improper and extremely erroneous approaches,  such as criticizing the "rightist deviation." The criticism of  the "rightist deviation" just showed the leftist deviation of  the meeting's participants. The conclusions of the meeting  were, on the whole, the product of leftism, and were used as the  "ideological grounds" for further suppressing the pro-democracy  movement.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Borland sees operating loss in third quarter Borland International, the troubled US computer software company, expects a 'substantial' operating loss for its third fiscal quarter, with revenues falling sharply from the previous quarter. The group said it was planning a restructuring in the first quarter of 1995. Analysts said Borland was expected to lay off about one-third of its 1,700 employees next year. Borland also said its chief operating officer, Mr Keith Maib, planned to resign. Yesterday, the share price fell Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars 6 5/8 . Since the beginning of this week the stock has fallen 19 per cent. 'We must re-engineer and re-size the company in a manner that enables us to operate profitably and allows us to meet the changing needs of our customers, especially as they move to client-server,' said Mr Philippe Kahn, chairman and chief executive. Borland has been hurt by price-cutting and delayed products. The company had pinned its hopes on a new version of its database program, dBASE for Windows, which was introduced this summer after lengthy delays. But analysts said sales had been disappointing. Borland reported net income of Dollars 350,000, or 1 cent a share, in the second quarter, down from Dollars 2.8m, or 11 cents, a year earlier.</p>

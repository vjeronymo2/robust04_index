			<p>BFN     [Text] North Korea and Russia have agreed to revise the  "North Korea-Russia Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual  Assistance Treaty," involving the abrogation of a provision on  automatic military intervention, to meet a change in the  situation at home and abroad. However, due to North Korea's  refusal, it has been dragged on over a year even without having  consultations.    According to a diplomatic source on 24 April, then Russian  Vice Foreign Minister Georgiy Kudnadze, current ambassador to  the ROK, visited Pyongyang in February, 1993. In the talks with  North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, Kudnadze brought  forth the issue regarding the revision and agreed with the North  side to fully revise the treaty in conformity with the current  situation. Nonetheless, North Korea has so far showed no  reaction.    In particular, upon Russia's proposal, Russia and North  Korea  reached an agreement to abrogate or re-interpret the so-called  provision on automatic military intervention which stipulates  that a country should automatically render military assistance  to the other country that is invaded since the provision is a  relic of the Cold- War era. However, North Korea has declined  to take up the issue.    As regards to this, a government official predicted:  "Chances  are very slim that the discussions will soon be made on the  issue."</p>

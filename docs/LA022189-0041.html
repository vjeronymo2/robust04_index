			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PULPIT ARREST BRINGS CLAIM OF $15 MILLION  </P> <P> A dispute in a small Monrovia church has escalated into a $15-million claim  against the city by a former pastor who was handcuffed by police and taken from  the pulpit during a Sunday service.  </P> <P> The Rev. Obie S. Fox, who was arrested Dec. 18 at the 125-member Community  Baptist Church, said he believes racism played a part in the unusual arrest at  the black church. Fox contends that police would not have disrupted a service  in a white church.  </P> <P> Mayor Robert Bartlett said he could not discuss the case because of pending  litigation, but he said the arrest was legal.  </P> <P> Fox was arrested for investigation of trespassing and disturbing the peace  after two deacons lodged the charges. The incident was videotaped by another  deacon, who routinely records the services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bent Pastor's Arm  </P> <P> The videotape shows Deacons Leon Washington and Clarence Jackson telling police  Sgt. Rand Loechner and Officer Rich Wagnon to arrest Fox. When Fox attempted to  show Wagnon the church bylaws, the officer took him by the right arm, bent it  behind his back and escorted him from the pulpit.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office said the dispute "should be settled civilly."  </P> <P> Fox last week filed a $15-million claim against the city of Monrovia and its  Police Department, alleging "false arrest, assault and battery, intentional  infliction of emotional distress."  </P> <P> The city has six months to respond to the claim. After that time, Fox may file  suit, said Stephen Wolfson, Fox's attorney.  </P> <P> Jackson declined to discuss the issue on advice of his attorney. Washington  could not be reached for comment Monday.  </P> <P> Fox said he believes the uproar between the two factions arose from budget  disputes.  </P> <P> Robert Larking, a former deacon, said he had questioned a financial report  Jackson and Washington had submitted. He said the two deacons told congregants  at a meeting the day before Fox's arrest that the pastor "was spending all the  money."  </P> <P> But Deacon Olen Graves called Larking's allegations "a bunch of lies."  </P></p>

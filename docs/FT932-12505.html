			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Friend when in need: The west holds Turkey at arm's length but relies on its support Turgut Ozal deserved more than a polite nod from western leaders. There is something about Turkey that deflects the gaze of the western onlooker. Everyone knows it is important, but no one seems to like thinking about it. I suspect the problem is that it is not quite big enough to have a department all to itself, whether in a foreign ministry or a university, and yet it does not fit neatly into any group or category. That, of course, is precisely what makes it such a fascinating country, when you do look at it. But most westerners are just too busy to be fascinated. At least one caller to this office last week assumed, on being told I was in Turkey, that I must be on holiday. I wish I had been on holiday. Alternatively, I wish I could truthfully say I had gone there to attend President Ozal's funeral. In fact I went to help write the Financial Times's annual survey of Turkey, and it was pure chance that Ozal died the day before I arrived. The result was, however, that I was able to listen to a lot of Turks talking about the leader they had lost. To say they were unanimously grief-stricken would be an exaggeration, though certainly many were more charitable than they would have been before his death. The fact is that, while alive, Ozal was disliked by many of his countrymen and especially by the media. Like Lady Thatcher, whom he admired (though he did not follow her monetarist policies), he was attacked both for widening the gap between rich and poor and for making the country subservient to the US. He stuck his neck out especially during the Gulf war, rather as she did in allowing US aircraft from British bases to bomb Tripoli in 1986. Indeed, Turkish feeling against the use of Turkish bases to bomb Iraq was stronger and more widespread than the corresponding feeling in Britain at the time of the Libyan attack. At the time western leaders heaped praise on Ozal. George Bush and Margaret Thatcher both claimed him as a personal friend. I fully expected to see them at his funeral, and so did many Turks. But they failed to show, as did their successors. The US was represented by Jim Baker, the former secretary of state, and by his successor's deputy, Cliff Wharton; the UK by Baroness Chalker, minister of overseas development; France by its foreign trade minister. John Major and Douglas Hurd, of course, were required in the division lobby  -Maastricht oblige. Bush was busy with his presidential library. Clinton was struggling to get his economic package through the Senate. Thatcher and Vice-President Al Gore were somewhere in eastern Europe. No doubt Francois Mitterrand and Warren Christopher had equally good excuses. But couldn't we have managed at least a member of the royal family? Anyway, for the funeral of a close friend and valued ally none of the excuses is good enough. When a friend dies you drop everything and rush to console his family. If these people really valued Turkish friendship, as they claim to, they would have been there. 'Turkey helped the west in the Gulf war,' said my friend Sait Dilek sadly. 'Perhaps another time it will not bother.' Of course that is a highly sentimental response. Sait, a young Kurd who worked for Ozal's government and was deeply devoted to him, was feeling sentimental that day. Many Turks were. Ozal, however, did not decide his Gulf policy on sentimental grounds, and it is unlikely that another Turkish leader would do so in a future crisis. It was not in Turkey's national interest to give free rein to an aggressive and expansionist ruler in a neighbouring country. Still, it is not always easy to act on a rational calculation of national interest when public opinion is against you; and public opinion can be swayed by sentiment. A convincing show of gratitude to the dead president would not have cost the west much. Why was it not forthcoming? 'I suppose they just thought of him as a wog,' says one disillusioned English Turcophile. Perhaps, at its crudest, that is right. We think of the Turks as Moslems, ergo non-Europeans. So their insistence that they are European only irritates us. With their suits and ties and their Roman script, the Turks lack even the exotic charm of the desert. The Islamic lobby in Turkey feeds on this attitude. It loves to quote a remark, allegedly made by Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, on the day before Ozal addressed the European Parliament, to the effect that Europe consists of 'countries of Judeo-Christian identity'. To Turkish minds that explains a lot of things, such as why Europe leaves Bosnian Moslems to their fate; why children born in Germany of Turkish parents are not entitled to German citizenship; and why Turkey's application for membership in the EC is pigeon-holed, while 'Christian' countries, not only from the European Free Trade Association but from the former Warsaw Pact, are encouraged to jump the queue. Some people think that Ozal, himself a devout though liberal Moslem, deliberately courted this reaction when he slammed in Turkey's EC application in 1987, and that the present Demirel government is more sincerely, as well as more subtly, European in going for a customs union first, leaving both Turkey and the Community more time to evolve before the issue of full membership is taken up again. Maybe. There are certainly many problems to be solved before full membership could be realistically considered, not the least being the Cyprus issue and the consequent Greek veto. But at least Greece does not make the mistake of underrating Turkey's importance - Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, did show up in Ankara last week.</p>

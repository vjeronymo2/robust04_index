			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian National Alliance leader Gianfranco </F> Fini by Gianfranco Ballardin in Rome; date not given: "The  Knight's Words Do Not Annoy Fini -- `We Do Not Want a Right-Wing  Government Either'"]    [Text] Rome -- [Ballardin] Deputy Fini, the Knight [Forza  Italia leader Berlusconi nickname] has "very forcefully" made it  clear that his alliance with you is not a right-wing alliance,  and he pledged himself to "keep the tiller constantly in the  center." Do you agree with the new government's centrist  positioning?    [Fini] During the electoral campaign, Berlusconi endlessly  repeated that Forza Italia is not a right-wing movement, but a  center one. On the other hand, National Alliance [AN] is most  certainly a right-wing force, a very variegated right, with a  thousand different shades and contents. If a government is  formed, it will be a center-right government. But these are  just labels.    [Ballardin] The Knight added: "AN comes from the Right, but  it has resolutely asserted its liberal stand. We will judge  from their performance whether this resolve is born out by the  facts."    [Fini] There is no reason whatever why the Right should not  be liberal. All this, however, is only wordplay. The  government must be characterized exclusively by its platform.    [Ballardin] In Pontida [League rally venue], [League  Secretary] Bossi said: "We are antifascist, and we will not  tolerate any resurrection of that ideology. Let Fini and AN be  aware of this."    [Fini] Bossi will somehow have to explain to the League's  supporters why, after having proclaimed "Never with AN"  throughout the electoral campaign, he is now forming a  government with us. My reply is that there will be no  resurrection, because AN is certainly not a fascist or  neofascist formation. I now hope Bossi will contribute to  turning 25 April [Liberation Day] into a national appeasement  date, rather than one of hate.    [Ballardin] Yesterday Bossi was very moderate.    [Fini] Yes, I believe that by now he has not only fully  accepted joining the government, as he made the League  supporters who were present pledge themselves to do, but also  that he has understood that certain typically rally-like tones,  which he had adopted lately, had to be dispensed with, and this  is a positive development.    [Ballardin] Major exponents of the international press  continue to define you as neofascists. Is this definition  correct or unfair?    [Fini] One of the reasons why I will not join the government  is precisely in order to explain what we really are to the  international public opinion. Since I would probably not manage  to perform two such important tasks at the same time, as are  leading a party and acting as a minister, I have decided to  continue to lead AN, precisely so as to dispel any doubts  concerning our identity.    [Ballardin] Would you rather be called neofascists or  postfascists?    [Fini] Last January, when it was set up, AN clearly  explained  that it did not constitute a neofascist Right, but a European  Right, that believes in freedom and democracy, and that can be  defined as post-fascist.    [Ballardin] [League ideologue] Miglio stated that he was  very  satisfied with the first meeting with AN experts on federalism.    [Fini] Miglio knows very well that, for us, the federal  model  cannot certainly be based on Miglio's three different Italies,  or his macroregions. The study conducted by the Agnelli  Foundation might constitute a good starting point. We believe  in the importance of having a powerful counterweight, in the  form of a directly elected prime minister, who should have  greater powers than at present.    [Ballardin] Speaking of the government, should [Radical  leader] Pannella become a minister?    [Fini] Personally I have many reservations -- among other  reasons, because the Radicals' position on drugs is the opposite  of ours.    [Ballardin] Should the League be given the Interior  Ministry?    [Fini] A coalition government can only be formed if its  composition is agreed among all the partners involved. It is  still too early to discuss the various portfolios.</p>

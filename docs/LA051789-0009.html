			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST  </P> <P> A former resident of a downtown hotel who allegedly set the place on fire two  years ago, causing one death and $1 million in damage, has been sentenced to  six years in state prison.  </P> <P> William Forrest Hughes, 35, received credit for the two years and two months he  has spent in jail and in a mental hospital since his arrest in the March 21,  1987, fire at the Las Flores Hotel on 4th Avenue.  </P> <P> Major Garrett, 54, who was asleep at the time of fire, died of smoke  inhalation.  </P> <P> Hughes was found mentally incompetent to stand trial in 1987 and was remanded  to Patton State Hospital until earlier this year, when psychiatrists determined  that he had regained his mental competence.  </P> <P> He pleaded innocent by reason of insanity and went on trial for murder and  arson in February. However, a jury deadlocked, 11-1, for acquittal and a  mistrial was declared.  </P> <P> Rather than face a retrial, Hughes pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter,  and the other charges were dropped.  </P> <P> San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez also fined Hughes $500.  </P></p>

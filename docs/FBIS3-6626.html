Touching on the  first drop in the cabinet's support rate below 50 percent as  indicated in the two opinion polls conducted by the JNN [Japan  News Network] data bank, composed of such agencies as the TBS  [Tokyo Broadcasting System] and by the JIJI News Agency,  Hosokawa said: "It must have been affected by such troubles as  the National Welfare Tax and the cabinet reshuffle. Also, the  rice issue (concerning the shortage of rice at stores). Various  factors are involved." Then, he continued to say: "I have no  other choice but to carry on without paying much attention to  this. I believe what I am supposed to do is to pay attention to  what I am doing now."</p>

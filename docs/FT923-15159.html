			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Hungary ends bank's exchange monopoly HUNGARY has established a foreign exchange, ending the central bank's official mono-poly and underpinning progress towards currency convertibility. Commercial banks begin foreign exchange trading among themselves this month, freed of the obligation to sell hard currency to the state and to stick precisely to the official exchange rate. With liberalisation, the banks have also gained the right to make forward and swap deals. However, the new interbank foreign exchange market exists within tight contraints. Exchange rate movements are restricted to within a narrow band of 0.25 per cent either side of a fixed central rate. This may later broaden to 2.25 per cent.</p>

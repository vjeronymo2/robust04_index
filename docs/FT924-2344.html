			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Arts (Christmas Entertainment): Singing (most of the time) - Malcolm Rutherford recommends a few London shows guaranteed to cheer you up THERE are no pantomimes in mainstream London this year. However, there is a relatively recent crop of shows in the West End which are guaranteed to cheer you up. Start with a musical. Annie Get Your Gun at the Prince of Wales Theatre contains more favourite songs than you would believe possible in a single show. 'My Defences are Down,' 'Anything You Can Do,' 'Falling in Love is Wonderful' and the ultimate show-stopper 'There's No Business Like Show Business' are all there. The total is 17. Moreover, there is a wonderfully dynamic Annie in Kim Criswell. Watch the way she sets the tone with 'You Can't Get a Man with a Gun': in the end, she doesn't. Yet if you persist in believing that Annie is old hat, try Stephen Sondheim's Assassins at the Donmar Warehouse. On the face of it, nothing could be more bizarre than a musical grouping the assassins, would-be and real, of American Presidents. But it works. The jolliest song of the lot, 'I'm Going to the Lordy', comes from Charles Guiteau, assassin of President Garfield, as he climbs to the scaffold. Better known assassins are there as well, and the restyled Donmar near Covent Garden is a very cheerful place. Music behind you, switch to Travels With My Aunt at Wyndham's. Possibly you need to have read Graham Greene's novel fully to appreciate it. If you have, you will love it, though it should stand up even if you have not. The wonder in Giles Havergal's adaptation is that practically every line comes directly from Greene's dialogue. The entire cast is played by four men, including John Wells and Simon Cadell. It is the most pleasantly amusing show in London. You can also rise to farce. The old master, Ray Cooney, has bought the Playhouse Theatre, writes for it, acts in it and directs it as well. His new piece, It Runs in the Family is also topical - about funding a London teaching hospital. Never look down on this style of writing or acting. Cooney himself is a delight. Still, if you want comedy on a higher plain, there is Noel Cowrd's Hay Fever at the Albery Theatre. You may think that you know it by heart, and some of the lines and situations you probably do, but there is always something to rediscover. In this production there is Maria Aitken as Judith Bliss, splendid in hats, wellington boots or indeed whatever she wears. Ms Aitken can be marvellously petulant. The direction by Alan Strachan gives unusual scope to the unfortunate visitors to the Bliss household: Sara Crowe, who made her name in Coward's Private Lives a couple of years ago, as the flapper, and Christopher Godwin as the diplomatist out of his depth. For sophisticated writing of a more modern kind, try Three Birds Alighting on a Field by Timberlake Wertenbaker at the Royal Court Theatre. Although there will be no performances during Christmas week, the play's run has been extended until January 9. About the price and value of art, and the fashions in the market, it is one of the wittiest new English plays to have emerged in the last year or two. It has a splendid opening from the auctioneer's stand and an outstanding performance by Harriet Walter, the girl from Benenden who marries a Greek millionaire and finally achieves self-confidence. Such elegance is not always associated with the Court: you should see it while it lasts. In the same vein you should catch Me and My Girl at the Adelphi Theatre, for after a run of seven years it is coming to an end on January 16. For innocent enjoyment the show that contains 'The Lambeth Walk' can scarcely be beaten. The walk is infectious. There are or course other shows worth seeing. The new Carousel at the National Theatre is reviewed in today's paper. There is a new Cyrano at the Haymarket next week as well as a new Hamlet with Kenneth Branagh at the Barbican. The common thread of those listed above, however, is that you are almost bound to leave the theatre more cheerful than when you went in. From some you will come out singing.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Royal assent for Insolvency Act The Insolvency Act was among measures which received royal assent before parliament adjourned for the spring recess yesterday. It was introduced as an emergency measure to modify the obligations of receivers to avoid the wholesale sacking of employees of financially troubled companies. Mr Neil Hamilton, junior trade minister, again called for the views of interested parties on whether it would be appropriate to extend to other receivers and managers the restrictions introduced by the act on liability under contracts of employment adopted by administrators and administrative receivers. Representations should reach the insolvency service policy unit by August 15.</p>

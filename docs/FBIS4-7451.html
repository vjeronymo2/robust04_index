			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Becic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] Eight killed and 25 wounded is the tragic result of  this morning's frenzy of the chetnik artillery men against  Gorazde. Most of these were civilians, and unfortunately again  several were children between the ages of three and 10.    The (shelling) from the aggressor's strongholds has not  stopped for long enough to let the guns cool. The area of  (Gradina) has been pounded with howitzers from the right side of  Gavran Stijena. They have attempted an infantry attack along the  Ustipraca-(Mesici) line, and the intensive attacks have not let  up since last night.    It is equally dramatic on the southern part of the front, in  the region of (Zibovi), (Potrkusa), and (?Oblenceva). At noon,  the aggressor intensified attacks on the area of Orahovice, on  the border between the Gorazde and Pale communes. Behind the  enemy front lines, the new forces of the regular army of the  so-called Yugoslavia have been grouping. There is no doubt that  the rest of the day will be even more dramatic.    It is hard to believe that high-altitude flights of what are  probably NATO planes will change anything. When they flew away,  heavy artillery shells came flying in from the aggressor's  positions. We do not yet have precise information about the  consequences. It is particularly hard to obtain information  from the remote parts of the front.</p>

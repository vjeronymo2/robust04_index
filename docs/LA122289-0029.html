			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: CD CORNER;  </P> <P> RESTLESS RECORDS LOOKS TO THE '70S  </P> <P> The focus of most independent U.S. record labels when reissuing material on CD  has been on American or British recordings from the '50s and '60s -- possibly  because of the proven nostalgia audience for these records.  </P> <P> As we move into the '90s, however, it only seems right to step more  aggressively in the reissue program to the '70s, and that's one of the things  Restless Records has in mind in its new Restless Retro series.  </P> <P> The Culver City independent has already released nine albums by the Buzzcocks,  Stiff Little Fingers and Wire -- innovative groups that were influenced, to  varying degrees, by the energy and anyone-can-start-a-band punk spirit of the  Sex Pistols. In addition, Restless has 15 albums on the way by Can, the  progressive German rock band. The first nine are due in mid-February.  </P> <P> "We want to make available in CD (and cassette) music that we feel was  important and innovative in its time and remains influential today," said David  Gerber, vice president and general manger of Restless.  </P> <P> The Wire albums -- "Pink Flag," "Chairs Missing," "154" and the retrospective  "On Returning" -- were from the British group's early and most influential  period in the late '70s, while the four Stiff Little Fingers collections  include "Inflammable Material," regarded by many rock critics as one of the  punk-era classics. The other albums by the Belfast group are "Nobody's Heroes,"  "Hanx!" and "Go for It."  </P> <P> But the most impressive of the initial releases is "Product," a three-disc  boxed set saluting the Buzzcocks, the band co-founded by Pete Shelley (who  later, as a solo artist, recorded the techno-dance classic "Homosapien").  </P> <P> It's hard for anyone who has heard the Fine Young Cannibals' version of "Ever  Fallen in Love" to imagine that the writers of the song were in a punk band.  Yet the opening tracks in this 61-song collection show how very much the  Buzzcocks were involved in the punk movement.  </P> <P> Even in the early days, however, the Buzzcocks -- who just came through  Southern California on a reunion tour -- mixed punk energy with an undeniable  pop sensibility that suggested an equal influence of David Bowie and T. Rex.  </P> <P> "Product" contains all of the Buzzcocks' studio recordings (including the  original version of "Ever Fallen in Love") plus a 24-minute live recording and  one song previously available only on a British sampler.  </P> <P> BACK TO THE '50s AND '60s: Chameleon Records, another Los Angeles area  independent, has just released the first five titles in a "Vee Jay Hall of  Fame" series saluting the historic Chicago label.  </P> <P> Founded in 1952, Vee Jay specialized in Southern blues acts, Midwestern R&amp;B  groups and gospel attractions, but entered the rock market occasionally -- as  with the 1964 release of the Beatles' "Please Please Me."  </P> <P> The first five "Hall of Fame" entries feature late '50s or '60s recordings by  Jerry Butler, John Lee Hooker, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, Little Richard and  Jimmy Reed.  </P> <P> Though Butler, Knight and Hooker are often associated with other record  companies, each did noteworthy work on Vee Jay or affiliated labels. But the  Little Richard package consists mostly of inferior reworkings of the songs --  including "Long Tall Sally" and "Tutti Frutti" -- that were hits for the rock  pioneer earlier on Specialty Records.  </P> <P> The Reed collection may be the most satisfying because the bluesman had his  greatest commercial success on Vee Jay -- 18 Top 20 R&amp;B hits between 1955  and 1961. Among the ones included in the CD: "Bright Lights, Big City," "Baby,  What You Want Me to Do" and "You Got Me Dizzy."  </P></p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Minimum wage 'would not cost jobs' The commission's labour-market recommendations swing between broad policy speculation and technical detail. The technical detail - for example, introducing part-time unemployment benefit - is more interesting but, like most other proposals in the report, is not costed. The report provides a spirited defence of what could be Labour's Achilles' heel at the next election, the claim that it will create full employment while re-regulating the labour market and introducing a minimum wage. The commissioners argue powerfully that intelligent labour market regulation need not cost jobs. They say that a minimum wage of Pounds 3.50 an hour - substantially below the level sought by most union leaders - would benefit about one in 10 employees without a negative effect on employment. They even say that it would save the government between Pounds 1.3bn and Pounds 1.6bn by reducing in-work benefit. But while the commissioners claim that new regulations are not going to cost jobs they have little to say about job creation. It is assumed that the stronger economy Labour will create will sustain a higher level of non-inflationary demand and so more jobs. At times the commissioners appear to doubt that this will be enough and speculate about more employment-intensive growth. Japan - with its highly efficient trading sector but highly inefficient and therefore job-rich services sector - is cited admiringly. Many of the most effective sections of the report reproduce the arguments of Ms Patricia Hewitt - spelt out in her book About Time - who argues for a modernisation of both labour-market regulation and the benefit system to take account of the more part-time and feminised labour market. Most policy proposals are aimed at 'work-poor' households where nobody has a steady job. This concern leads to a focus on two groups - long-term unemployed men, and women who have had to give up work so that their families can qualify for enough means-tested benefit. There are two main proposals for dealing with these two groups. The first, aimed mainly at the long-term unemployed, is called the Jobs, Education and Training (JET) programme. The second, aimed mainly at the women who have to give up their jobs, is reform of the benefit system to reduce the need for means-tested household benefits. The JET programme is the less original of the two. Some of the suggestions are too general to be very useful - for example that training investment should improve people's employability. Other suggestions are already an established part of public policy. It says, for example, that a 'comprehensive re-employment service' should be set up, but that is what the best Jobcentres already provide. It also calls for the sponsorship of 'micro-entrepreneurs', which is what the government's enterprise allowance scheme aimed to do. A further set of suggestions are part of a growing cross-party consensus in favour of providing extra childcare facilities for lone parents or examining the selective use of job subsidies. The more original policy ideas come in the sections on reforming national insurance and income support. This is part of a larger enterprise to beef up the national insurance scheme which currently excludes a large number of low paid and part-time workers. Some of the problems that the commission addresses are not susceptible to legislation - for example, convincing men to take jobs they consider demeaning to their mascu-linity. The report points out that more than one-third of the long-term unemployed have qualifications to A levels or their equivalent, in which case training to get them back to work may not be the solution. The commissioners do not stray far from the new centre-left orthodoxy - which they have helped to create - but there is a hint of President Clinton's 'tough love' when talking about requiring single parents to seek work if childcare is provided. The report is strong on restraining wages to help create jobs, something which the unions - whose vital role is stressed - may not be keen on.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Unabashed Perot cuts his Dollars 10m losses and runs: The would-be candidate made a difference before concluding he could not win THE end for Mr Ross Perot, when it came, really was quick, almost businesslike. Less than a day after a top adviser walked out, and with poll after poll showing his popularity in free fall, the Texas billionaire 'picked up his marbles and went home', as Molly Ivins, the Dallas newspaper columnist, said he would the night before. He did it in Perot style too - unabashed, unapologetic, ad- mitting no more than a minor mistake here or there. He felt for his 'volunteers' but offered them no guidance, beyond a complimentary nod to the revitalised Democratic party. In effect, he cut his losses, about Dollars 10m (Pounds 5.2m), and ran. But he left claiming to have made a difference, and, in that belief, his confidence is not entirely misplaced. For this has been the political year of the protest - from Pat Buchanan, Jerry Brown, even Paul Tsongas and certainly Mr Perot himself - and though each has individually failed, their cumulative effect has been to change the tenor of the presidential election campaign. The critical question now for the two who remain standing, President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton, is who is best positioned to pick up the pieces, above all those left stranded by Mr Perot. Mr James Carville, Mr Clinton's top strategist, is sure it will be his man. He said yesterday that, whatever else might be said of Mr Perot, he had tapped a well of discontent in a country dissatisfied and demanding change. The Clinton premise throughout, he argued, has been change, while that of Mr Bush has been retention of the status quo. The fact that Mr Perot has quit while Mr Clinton is in the climactic stages of a successful convention, leaping ahead in popularity, may also provide an extra boost, even justification for the claim that it was Mr Clinton, not the president, who proved the Perot-slayer. The president has also been portraying himself recently as the architect of change. But he has also consistently maintained that the electorate will not make up its mind until the last two months of the campaign, when he promises to pull out the stops. In reality, Mr Perot's softer support had already begun to switch in droves to Mr Clinton, as all the recent polls prove. Its harder core element is probably overwhelmingly Republican and concentrated in the southwest and west. If Mr Bush wins this back, he will have evened the odds. The all-southern Clinton-Gore ticket is intended also to boost the Democrats in the deep south, where a breakthrough is imperative for national success and where Mr Bush is still more popular than elsewhere. The three-way contest would have been helpful in this respect. But the Perot factor was more than just a demand for change. It was a direct and adverse reflection on the perceived abilities of Mr Clinton and Mr Bush, seen as practitioners of politics as usual. Mr Clinton may be on the up at the moment, while Mr Bush is not. But both still have a way to go to convince Americans that they can lead the country effectively. The Perot jury is not the only whose judgment is still being reserved. The disappearance of the Texan also illustrates the immense practical difficulties of waging an independent campaign, albeit one whose appeal is purely populist and not lacking in finance. The departure from the Perot camp on Wednesday of Mr Ed Rollins, President Ronald Reagan's campaign strategist in 1984, shows that professionals and amateurs do not live together easily in politics, that a campaign chest which is a personal fortune is not a common campaign property, and that the executive decision-making of business and the collectivity and compromises that are the essence of politics are inherently very different. Mr Perot reached the peak of his popularity last month very much on his own. He captured the TV talk shows, set up his own phone banks, conducted his own personal schedule, and spent his own money - not a lot of it, compared with what he has and what he would have to spend if he were to run for president, but a sum beyond the reach of just about any other mortal. He brought in Mr Rollins and Mr Hamilton Jordan, Mr Jimmy Carter's former political guru, 45 days ago because, he said, 'world class' supporters (his volunteers around the country) needed 'world class' professional direction. A lot of the volunteers promptly took umbrage. The specific grouses of Mr Rollins are symptomatic of the dichotomy. Mr Perot did not think the experienced ad-man they wanted to hire was worth the money; he reportedly did not show them in advance his patronising speech last weekend to a black audience (if he did, their professionalism was wanting); and he did not believe them when they said he was losing momentum and had to kick into another and more expensive gear straight away. Now he does not have to. The billion-dollar man has gone back to earning more millions. It is probably easier than politics anyway.</p>

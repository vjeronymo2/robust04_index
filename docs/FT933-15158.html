			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / UK and China edge forward over HK: Hurd talks to Beijing leaders, but few believe there is a quick solution in sight BRITAIN and China have resolved to make faster progress in their talks about Hong Kong's political development, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said yesterday after holding talks with Chinese leaders. In Beijing he said his discussions with Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, had been useful in clarifying how the two sides should proceed in future rounds of talks about elections due in Hong Kong in 1994 and 1995. Mr Hurd also met China's president, Mr Jiang Zemin. 'The tone and atmosphere of the meeting (with Mr Qian) seemed to me positive, it was entirely forward-looking and from my point of view, and I hope his, the meeting was well worthwhile,' Mr Hurd said. The British foreign secretary gave no hint of a swift resolution to negotiations, saying that there would be further rounds after the eighth session which begins on July 20, and that he would meet Mr Qian in New York in September to review progress. However, he indicated there had been some progress in the last two rounds. 'There have been specific ideas, and that is important because the governor (Mr Chris Patten) and we all have made it clear that we are ready to listen carefully to Chinese ideas on this matter.' It was understood that in the seventh round which finished this week China presented a comprehensive proposal for the conduct of the 1994/95 elections. British officials, while not necessarily agreeing with the shape of the proposal, nevertheless hoped that the Chinese move would advance the negotiations. UK officials said the meeting with Mr Qian was a 'really very positive exchange' which would boost the momentum of the talks and had increased confidence that, although there would be problems along the way, there would be an eventual agreement. Mr Hurd, who said he was not visiting Beijing to make proposals or arrange a deal, stressed to Mr Qian that the election arrangements must be 'open, fair and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong,' and also that they should guarantee a 'through train' to the next scheduled elections in 1999. He referred to the so-called 'functional constituencies' which make up part of Hong Kong's Legislative Council and to the composition of the election committee which will also elect some seats. Last October's proposals by Mr Patten, vehemently rejected by Beijing, sought to increase democratic representation by broadening the electoral franchise of both. The two men agreed to speed up work within the joint liaison group, which is charged with negotiating the details of Hong Kong's transfer to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, and to quicken the pace of talks about Hong Kong's airport project. Mr Qian told Mr Hurd that China had no objection to the first stage of a large land reclamation proceeding. The foreign secretary defended pursuing a negotiated settlement with China by claiming that an agreement would secure the 'prize' of a smooth transfer of sovereignty in 1997. However Mr Yeung Sum, deputy leader of Hong Kong's United Democrats, said Mr Hurd's visit might have helped the talks along but his party was more concerned with their outcome. 'Aspirations for democracy must not be sacrificed just for the sake of agreement,' he said. The Beijing meeting confirmed that Mr Qian, who made a full member of the Chinese politburo last year, was in day-to-day charge of affairs related to Hong Kong. There was relief among UK officials that Britain could at last talk to China about Hong Kong at a senior political level.</p>

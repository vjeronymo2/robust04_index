			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Quebec separatist election defeat The separatist Parti Quebecois has suffered a surprise setback with its first by-election loss in five years in Canada. The victory by Quebec's ruling Liberal party in the largely French-speaking Shefford constituency, east of Montreal, gives an unexpected fillip to Mr Daniel Johnson, the provincial premier, ahead of provincial elections this year. Mr Johnson, who took over from Mr Robert Bourassa last January, is strongly committed to retaining - if not strengthening - Quebec's ties to the rest of Canada. Until a few weeks ago a PQ victory in the forthcoming election seemed all but assured. The separatist party has promised to hold an independence referendum within 12 months of taking office. An opinion poll published yesterday also suggested support for the separatists might be waning. According to the poll, conducted by the Angus Reid group, backing for the PQ's federal counterparts, the Bloc Quebecois, has dropped to 38 per cent of decided voters, compared to 49 per cent at last October's general election. However, the mood remains volatile. Last week the Liberals lost a by-election in a constituency they had held for 37 years. Opinion polls suggest almost a third of Quebecois remain undecided. This week's victory gives backbone to Mr Johnson's efforts to bring aggressive leadership to the Quebec Liberals after two years of indecision caused by the illness of Mr Bourassa.</p>

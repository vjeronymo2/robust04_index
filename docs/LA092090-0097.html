			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ADVISERS TELL SCHOOLS SUPERINTENDENT TO RETURN ANY BILLS FOR TAX COLLECTION  </P> <P> The Ventura County superintendent of schools has been advised by attorneys to  send back the bill if county supervisors charge his office for collecting  property taxes.  </P> <P> Under a new state law, the County Board of Supervisors could charge school  districts and the community college district a total of $3.1 million to collect  property taxes.  </P> <P> A letter from the Schools Legal Service of Bakersfield addressed to County  Schools Supt. James F. Cowan said the law does not take effect until Jan. 1,  1991, and any invoice received before then "should be returned to the county  which generated it, along with a notation that there is no present legal  authority for presentation of the invoice."  </P> <P> The supervisors will vote Tuesday on whether to charge such fees.  </P> <P> Cowan said the county superintendent's office is awaiting the board's vote  before taking a position on whether to pay the bill, which would amount to an  estimated $134,000 for the superintendent's office, which runs special  education programs at several schools in the county.  </P> <P> "We'll be doing a lot of research before we take any final position," Cowan  said. "We don't know until we find out if they're going to charge us. Once they  do that, we'll be deciding from there where we're going to go."  </P> <P> Attorneys from Schools Legal Service have advised 100 school districts that it  represents statewide to return bills for the fees.  </P> <P> The letter said the fees are illegal because a state education statute  prohibits counties from charging the fees. That law was not repealed or amended  under the new legislation, the letter said.  </P> <P> But County Counsel James L. McBride said the county disagrees with the letter.  McBride said that the intent of the legislation is to override previous laws  and make the fees mandatory.  </P> <P> "The courts will have to decide, if it comes to that, if the legislation takes  precedence" over the previous law, McBride said.  </P> <P> Costs to individual districts would range from $1,446 for the 31-student Santa  Clara Elementary School District to $555,204 for the Conejo Valley Unified  School District.  </P> <P> Officials in other school districts, including Oxnard Elementary, have said  they plan to return the invoices to the county if they are billed.  </P> <P> The letter advised school districts to seek legal advice if a county withholds  property tax revenues to cover the fees or if a county sues the district to  collect the fees.  </P> <P> The county counsel, which normally represents the superintendent of schools  office in most legal matters, is representing the County Board of Supervisors  on this issue, Cowan said.  </P> <P> "We haven't seen any of the legal information that the county has put  together," Cowan said. "I would expect if there would be a lawsuit, a lot of  districts statewide would be involved . . . but we're way aways from that."  </P></p>

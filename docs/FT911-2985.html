			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (34): The industry needs small investors - Marketing / But seeking them through independent financial advisers will mean paying the same sort of commission levels that unit trusts have paid in the past - Investment trusts FOR FAR too long investment-trust companies assumed that investment trusts would sell themselves. After all, they were plainly such an attractive investment, when compared with say unit trusts, that savers would surely come knocking at the door. But they didn't. Over the decades the private investors in many investment trusts died, or at any rate sold their shares, and the shares drifted to wider and wider discounts against underlying assets. During the early 1980s the average discount regularly came close to 30 per cent. As prices drifted, investment institutions such as life-insurance companies and pension funds came in to mop up the investment-trust shares. Usually they did not regard them as appropriate investments, but at a low enough price they were worth tucking away in institutional portfolios. In this way, the big funds often came to own 70 per cent of an investment trust's shares. This is the topsy-turvy situation in which the boards of many trusts find themselves, and they know that such trusts have little future unless the balance is redressed. The takeover of the giant Globe Investment Trust last year, to be broken up by the pension funds of British Coal, was yet another ghastly warning, if another were needed. Now, nearly all the investment-trust managements accept that more effective marketing to personal investors is essential if the investment trust industry is to survive in anything like its present form. In the distant past, investment trusts were able to rely on stockbrokers to market their products. The reward of the brokers was the commission on the deal, nowadays of something like 1.7 per cent on small bargains (it used to be rather less). But stockbrokers have in many cases tended to become less interested in private clients. Alternatively, they have sold unit trusts on a significantly bigger 3 per cent commission. Meanwhile, larger and larger proportions of the long-term savings of the public over the years have gone into life insurance contracts and personal pensions, sold by intermediaries who receive even more lucrative commissions. Such products can be sold aggressively through advertising or through mail-order shots, and even through 'cold calls' on a door-to-door or telephone sales basis. These rules have applied for many years now. Investment trust shares, on the other hand, have come under the tight restrictions which apply to the promotion of company shares in general, and are designed to curb the activities of unscrupulous share pushers and 'boiler room' telephone selling operators. But now big changes are in the offing. The Securities and Investments Board, the top watchdog body for investments, has decided that investment trusts should be put more in line with alternative savings products. Investment trust savings schemes, at least, will soon be much more freely marketable to the public. The new regulations may come into force later this year. So far, investment-trust savings schemes have had to skate around the existing rules. Investment trusts have not been permitted to sell 'off the page' using coupons, as unit trusts can. Rather, investment-trust management companies have had to advertise brochures, which is selling at one remove. Still, investment-trust savings schemes pulled in Pounds 91m during 1990, a 42 per cent increase on the 1990 figure, despite poor market conditions. Moreover, investment trusts have already been given a role in personal equity plans. They are on a par with unit trusts in this tax privilege, which gives both of them something of an advantage over life insurance products. The latest Budget changes will serve to widen the range of investment trusts which can qualify for Pounds 3,000 peps. Now, the investment-trust marketing men are gearing up to take on the rival savings media more directly. More and more, they are seeking to reach the public through independent financial advisers, the sort of intermediaries who sell life policies, pension plans and unit trusts. The trade body, the AITC, has just hired a marketing executive with a brief to help member investment trust companies to reach such intermediaries. However, this means paying the same sort of commission levels - usually 3 per cent of a lump sum investment - that unit trusts have paid in the past. Thus there are pluses and minuses in all this for the investor. Investment trusts are starting to offer rather worse value for money, but on the other hand the discount on assets is shrinking, which is very good for existing investors and offers the promise of reduced share price volatility to future investors too. A further step has been taken by Foreign &amp; Colonial, now the biggest investment trust. In a pioneering deal with Skandia Life, its shares are being used as the investment medium for life insurance and personal pensions products. There is still, however, something like Pounds 15bn of funds of institutional investors in the investment-trust market. If that pool of capital is to be replaced by private investors' money within a reasonably short period of time, the investment trusts' new marketing men are going to have to work very hard.</p>

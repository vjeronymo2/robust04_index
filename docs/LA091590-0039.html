			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHY NOT A PLAZA?  </P> <P> Your article regarding the Laguna Beach municipal art project under the Arts in  Public Places program ("Can Laguna Beach Commission a Worthy Sculpture for  $27,000?" by Cathy Curtis, Calendar Aug. 20) has no doubt illicited many  responses. I certainly have been hearing them. . . . I would like to share with  you and your readers a slightly more productive and positive response which,  hopefully, could improve the process of developing this particular and future  municipal art decisions.  </P> <P> While I agree with you that $27,000 is a modest (you said "paltry") amount, a  greater insult is the designated site and lobbying by several councilmen for  "the kind of art they'd like to see" . . . traditional, in keeping with the  architecture (Spanish colonial).  </P> <P> All this is rectifiable by reconsidering the present site (and) creating a  downtown municipal plaza of the street (Loma) that connects the city's  administrative office building with the Laguna Beach County Water District  (also recently remodeled). Such a change would offer infusion of additional  funds toward a total site development: Funds scheduled for paving, curb,  gutter/drainage, lighting, etc. could recombine and support a plaza format for  a work of art. This format would assuage those who are entrenched in having the  site become thematic. What could be more in keeping with the architecture and  the "Village Laguna" theme than a plaza?  </P> <P> An important factor in all of this would be the integration of all municipal  services, the use of the plaza for city staff and the public, for official and  non-official events, for assigning a sense of place to the administrative  buildings for the city, to bring together the three-way traffic points into a  very visible and functional arena that gives more than lip service to Laguna's  desire to be perceived as vanguard in its securing of open spaces for future  generations and its commitment to its artists and art. In no way would the  plaza eliminate all vehicular emergency access; its paving and design, though  re-formed to support and extend itself for pedestrian use, would allow  necessary use by police, fire and utility equipment.  </P> <P> What has been proposed is a reasonable solution that may open other areas for  municipal development with art incorporated into the initial planning, rather  than an afterthought.  </P> <P> LEAH VASQUEZ  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P> <P> Vasquez is an artist currently working on another privately funded Arts in  Public Places project. From 1983 through 1987, she chaired the Laguna Beach  Arts Commission developing the AIPP guidelines.  </P> <P> </P></p>

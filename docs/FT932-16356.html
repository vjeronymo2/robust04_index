			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Confusion at SelecTV as legal probe is completed CONFUSION still surrounded the affairs of SelecTV, the independent television production company last night, following the completion of a legal investigation by company solicitors Richards Butler. SelecTV yesterday issued a statement saying that the report had drawn attention to 'certain minor technical shortcomings in the formal administration of the company.' The release added that the appropriate remedial action had already been taken. Following the issuing of the statement, it is believed Richards Butler contacted SelecTV suggesting that the statement may not have been wholly supported by their draft report. The main issue of contention seems to have been the fact that Richards Butler regarded the matters under investigation as serious allegations. SelecTV then issued a new press release saying it wanted to make clear that the report it commissioned from Richards Butler included allegations relating to Mr Allan McKeown, chief executive. 'After considering the report the board has concluded that Mr McKeown should at once be exonerated from allegations of misfeasance,' the statement said. Richards Butler, whose report has not been published, then withdrew its reservations. SelecTV confirmed yesterday that Mr Tony Brook, until recently deputy chairman and managing director of TVS Entertainment, will join the board as chairman. He is expected to head a remuneration committee which will look into the salaries of directors. He is also expected to look at the rent paid to Mr McKeown for the house he owns in central London which is used as company offices. The rent was the main item in a writ issued against Mr McKeown by Mr Michael Buckley, chairman, with the knowledge of Mr Peter Laiser, an independent director. The writ was never served and when it became public Mr Buckley was ousted as chairman. Last night Mr Buckley said that the events of the day confirmed his view that the company should now appoint an independent firm of solicitors to look at all the issues that led to the issuing of the writ. A number of directors confirmed yesterday that an increase in the rent paid to Mr McKeown from Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 80,000 a year had happened without being recorded in board minutes. The directors insisted that they all knew about the increase, which reflected the fact that other SelecTV subsidiaries had moved into the house.</p>

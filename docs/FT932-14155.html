			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Excitement in Hong Kong, Ireland Last week featured bullishness in the US, sheer excitement in Asia and a reward for economic consistency in Ireland. A 1.6 per cent gain in the US was the main reason why the FT-Actuaries World index rose by 0.8 per cent in local currency terms. In New York, share prices began by moving higher in tandem with government bonds as consumer and producer prices data allayed fears that inflationary pressures had been building up in the economy. Last Friday, bonds declined but equities rose again, pushed up this time by company results. Hong Kong had its best gains on Tuesday and Wednesday, domestic trading bracketing a surge in London on the resumption of Sino-British talks on the colony's future. Share indices and turnover both hit record levels before easing back towards the end of the week. In Europe, Ireland's 5.1 per cent advance on the week left it with the best performance in the FT-Actuaries World Indices this year, a rise of 34.2 per cent in local currency terms. The gains began in anticipation of a further interest rate cut last Friday. When this actually transpired, it was the seventh reduction in eight weeks, following the punt's devaluation in January, and subsequent cuts in German interest rates. In addition to the interest rate prospects, the market had indications of improved cash flow at domestic institutions, the placing of the government's 55m shares in Irish Life and a US bid for Fyffes, the fruit wholesaler. On prospects, Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin, thinks that the market is still attractive on a strategic time frame, valued at 15 1/2 times earnings for 1992 and a prospective 13 1/2 p/e for 1993. In London, Mr Adrian O'Carroll at Dillon Read reckons, however, that significant undervaluations in the big blue chips have disappeared, and that attention will turn to second line stocks from now on.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change   % change in                % change in local currency**      sterling** US Dollars**               1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of   Start of     Start of                                          1993       1993         1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       -2.09    -5.58   -18.49    +0.40      -0.59        +0.23 Belgium       -0.02    +0.81    +8.19   +14.69     +13.76       +14.69 Denmark       +2.76    +4.11   -12.30   +12.40     +12.95       +13.89 Finland       -0.06    +6.12   +38.63   +29.39     +19.85       +20.84 France        +0.09    +1.50    +1.49    +9.13      +9.68       +10.58 Germany       +1.63    -0.57    -5.85   +10.29      +9.79       +10.70 Ireland       +5.09    +8.56   +12.98   +34.20     +23.99       +25.02 Italy         +0.53    +5.66   +10.64   +20.34     +14.05       +15.00 Netherlands   +1.17    +0.77    +7.87   +12.36     +11.86       +12.79 Norway        -0.62    -1.73    -3.83   +10.81     +11.19       +12.11 Spain         +1.71    +1.15    -3.49   +12.54      +9.42       +10.33 Sweden        +0.18    -1.09   +10.78    +4.86      -2.13        -1.32 Switzerland   -0.98    -0.61   +15.18    +5.25      +3.65        +4.50 UK            +0.20    -2.59    +8.11    +0.34      +0.34        +1.17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE        +0.45    -0.58    +4.75    +6.24      +5.39        +6.26 Australia     +2.55    +1.24    +5.04    +9.62     +13.32       +14.26 Hong Kong     +6.43    +9.72   +26.37   +20.57     +19.75       +20.74 Japan         -0.25   +10.17   +18.28   +18.80     +30.64       +31.71 Malaysia      +1.97    +6.73   +29.96   +12.72     +13.27       +14.20 New Zealand   +1.12    -1.43    +9.13    +4.15      +8.17        +9.07 Singapore     +2.03    +5.04   +13.05    +8.74      +8.81        +9.71  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        +1.02    -0.12    +0.90    +5.78      +5.95        +6.83 USA           +1.61    -0.19    +8.25    +2.92      +2.08        +2.92 Mexico        -1.24    +5.41    -4.18    -1.19      -0.95        -0.13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  -1.30    +1.66    +4.23   +11.23     +10.22       +11.12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +0.82    +2.84    +9.90    +8.55     +10.75       +11.67  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on April 16th 1993.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>   [Text] Vladimir Kravtsov, State Duma deputy and deputy  general procurator of the Russian Federation, announced last  Friday that criminal proceedings against Viktor Cherepkov, mayor  of Vladivostok, have been temporarily suspended. He emphasized  that the matter has been suspended only until Konstantin Mavrin,  general procuracy investigator for particularly important  matters, arrives in Vladivostok.    Kravtsov's Duma statement resulted in the chamber's decision  to hear the General Procuracy of the Russian Federation's  representative on the Vladivostok events, regarding the  instigation of criminal proceedings against the city's mayor on  bribery charges. Kravtsov also said the matter against Cherepkov  was instigated on 10 February this year. The size of the bribe  was quoted to be 3 million rubles. A portion of the money,  which incidentally was marked by the bribe-giver, was found in  the mayor's office. According to the deputy general procurator,  the bribe-giver is someone without fixed abode or employment.  According to Kravtsov, the hand over of the bribe, notification  by the bribe-giver that the money had been handed over, and  instigation of proceedings against Cherepkov, all occurred on 10  February.</p>

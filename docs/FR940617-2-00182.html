On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor at their own costs will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The directors of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any Plan Fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any Plan Fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under the Plan relating to a particular class will be borne exclusively by each such class and except that any class expenses will be borne by the applicable class of shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of income and expenses among the various classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert''). The Expert has rendered a report, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, they will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to section 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

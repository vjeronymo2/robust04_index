			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Robert Fleming ahead sharply to Pounds 209.9m Robert Fleming Holdings almost doubled pre-tax profits in the year ended March 31, from Pounds 106.4m to Pounds 209.9m. Administrative expenses also rose sharply to Pounds 259.6m (Pounds 198.2m), 'almost all of which reflects a rise in performance-related bonuses to staff,' said Mr John Manser, chief executive. Mr Manser said that all parts of the group contributed to the profits rise, although east Asian dealing profits and commissions were a significant part of that. 'A big factor was profits from securities on the equities side, particularly in the Far East,' he explained. Overall, fee and commission income rose strongly to Pounds 273.1m (Pounds 224.3m), while net dealing income nearly doubled from Pounds 40.4m to Pounds 77.8m. Mr Bill Harrison, chief executive of the investment banking division, said the group was beginning to see results from its efforts to achieve greater integration of banking, securities underwriting and distribution and research. It was the lead underwriter of Euro-convertible issues in the past year and had won mandates on several key corporate finance deals, including acting as adviser to Enterprise Oil in its bid for Lasmo, he added. In Fleming's investment management activities, worldwide funds under management increased by about 50 per cent to Pounds 49.5bn (Pounds 33.4bn). Some Pounds 7bn of the increase represents net new cash, with the remainder provided by investment returns from buoyant stock and bond markets worldwide. The company continued to lose clients in its traditional UK pension fund business, although its international and retail client base grew strongly. 'It is an area where we were one of the leaders and now clearly we are not,' Mr Manser said. Fleming has recently recruited a new head for its asset management activities in an effort to improve performance. Looking ahead, Mr Manser identified two key growth areas; the activities of Jardine Fleming, its 50 per cent owned east Asian joint venture, and a further expansion of its continental European investment banking activities. Also later this year, Fleming will open its first offices in Latin America and intends to launch a broking service based in New York, which will specialise in the distribution of research on Latin American companies. Earnings per share jumped to 299.8p (149.6p) and the group announced an increase in dividends for the year from 38p to 50p - a rise of 32 per cent.</p>

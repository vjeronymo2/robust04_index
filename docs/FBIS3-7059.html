Hosokawa and Kim also agreed in a meeting at the Akasaka  state guesthouse on the importance of building future-oriented  bilateral relations based on the history of the past, the  officials said.    Talks between the two leaders, held amid mounting tension on  the Korean peninsula, focused on issues concerning North Korea's  suspected nuclear arms development, according to the officials.    Hosokawa and Kim, who arrived earlier in the day for a  three-day stay in Japan, agreed that the international community  should take a firm stance against North Korea while leaving the  door open for dialogue and handling the situation step by step,  they said.    Kim described the situation as "very serious," citing  Pyongyang's refusal to allow full inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its recent  aggressive postures, such as threatening to destroy Seoul "in  flames," they said.    Although South Korea will always hold the door open to  dialogue with the North, there are limits to its patience if  Pyongyang remains obstinate and tries to procrastinate, the  officials quoted Kim as saying.    Kim told Hosokawa that South Korea has a good security  system, taking into account the possibility of various  "accidental" situations occurring, and that it will do its  utmost to maintain stability on the Korean peninsula, the  officials said.    He explained the decision to deploy Patriot missiles  following talks with the U.S., and also said Seoul and  Washington plan to resume the joint Team Spirit military  exercise unless North Korea changes its attitude, they said.    The president said he will decide on the specifics of the  Team Spirit exercise after he returns home from Beijing, where  he will fly on Saturday. He did not specify when the Patriot  missiles would be deployed, the officials said.    Hosokawa said Japan will take a "responsible" measure within  the spirit of the Constitution if the problem of North Korea's  suspected nuclear weapons is brought to the United Nations  Security Council, according to the officials.    Hosokawa, who returned on Monday from a three-day visit to  China, briefed Kim about his trip and said he conveyed Japan's  strict view of the situation and the importance of China's role  in solving the problem, they said.    In connection with the nuclear problem, Hosokawa touched on  some allegations that Japan intends to build its own nuclear  weapons, saying it would be impossible for Japan to do so  because of its three-point nonnuclear policy and because it is  the only nation to have suffered atomic bombing, the officials  said.    He also said Japan supports the peaceful unification of the  Korean peninsula in the future.    In their meeting, which lasted over 90 minutes, Hosokawa and  Kim, who met last November in Kyongju, South Korea, also agreed  on the importance of building a future-oriented relationship by  looking correctly at history, the officials said.    The reference was to the 1910-45 Japanese colonization of  the  Korean peninsula.    Kim was quoted as saying such future-oriented bilateral  relations would have great meaning for Asia nations as well as  the rest of the world.    Hosokawa and Kim also agreed that Japan, South Korea and  Russia should make efforts to effect as soon as possible  measures to solve such problems as the return of Koreans left  behind on the Russian Far East island of Sakhalin to their  homeland, the officials said.    Japan forcibly took tens of thousands of Koreans as laborers  to Sakhalin, whose southern half it ruled from 1905 until the  end of World War II, but left them behind when the island came  under Soviet rule.    About 43,000 ethnic Koreans are currently living on  Sakhalin,  according to Sakhalin government statistics. Hosokawa said his  heart aches to think of the hardships the people left on  Sakhalin suffered.    Also during their talks, Hosokawa and Kim exchanged views  about their respective political and economic reform efforts,  the officials said.    Kim and Hosokawa are scheduled to hold a second round of  talks on Saturday to discuss mainly economic matters. They also  agreed to discuss the North Korean problem again if necessary,  the officials said.    Later Thursday evening, Kim attended a dinner hosted by  Emperor Akihito.    On Friday, he will deliver speeches in the Diet and at  Waseda  University.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Letter: Protection of database copyright Sir, Celia Hampton (Business Law, May 28) has constructed an argument against the European Community's draft directive on database copyright based on a misapprehension of the nature of electronic databases. She claims that databases 'normally include all the information on a given subject'. That is true for only a small minority of databases - such as telephone numbers and share prices, which she cites as examples. The vast majority of databases involve value added by the database producer, which either codes and indexes, produces brief abstracts, or selects from the mass of information only those items of relevance. These are the features which make electronic databases valuable to clients. For the vast majority of databases, therefore, there has indeed been intellectual effort in their selection and arrangement, and therefore under the proposed EC directive they will be subject to copyright protection. It may well be that the proposed directive poses potential harm to BT's copyright on telephone directories; but for the majority of the electronic information industry the proposals regarding copyright are non-contentious. What is contentious is the proposal for compulsory licensing, an issue which Celia Hampton surprisingly did not address.

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Blockbuster and Sega in video game trials Sega of America, the US arm of the Japanese video game company, is to test market a system for electronic distribution of games in several Blockbuster Video stores this summer, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. The system has been jointly developed by NewLeaf Entertainment and Fairway Technologies, both joint ventures between IBM and Blockbuster. It allows video game software to be stored on computers installed in retail stores and downloaded on-demand on to specially-designed reprogrammable video game cartridges. The blank cartridges can be reprogrammed an unlimited number of times, allowing inventory of video game titles to be matched to demand.</p>

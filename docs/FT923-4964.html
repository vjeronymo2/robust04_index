			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls again as profit-taking continues Tokyo SHARE prices lost further ground yesterday as profit-taking continued after the market's two-week rally, agencies report from Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 152.34 easier at 17,587.72, after profit-taking on one hand and buying by dealers and individuals on the other limited the day's high and low to 17,688.38 and 17,477.92 respectively. Volume was estimated at 420m shares, down from 550.8m. Declines led advances by 824 to 199, with 92 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 21.22 to 1,349.05. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 4.25 to 1,072.31. Japanese institutional investors stayed on the sidelines. Although Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, said late on Tuesday that the economy should begin to recover before winter, many fund managers doubt that corporate earnings will pick up until next year. Furthermore, continued pressure on institutions from the Finance Ministry to refrain from heavy selling of equities was not inspiring confidence in the market. Trading remained dominated by incentive-backed shares, with dealers and individuals buying Aids-related issues and Isuzu Motors, the latter following a report that the auto maker had succeeded in developing a highly efficient ceramic engine. Isuzu climbed Y80, or 28 per cent, to Y370. Other motor manufacturers were mostly lower amid signs that Japanese auto sales continued to decline sharply from year-ago levels. Nichiboshin, a non-bank financial institution which lends to smaller companies, was another bright spot following reports that Sanwa Bank was likely to lower the interest charges on its outstanding loans to the financially strapped company. Nichiboshin rose Y80, or 23 per cent, to Y423. Aids-related shares attracted heavy interest. Meiji Milk advanced Y20 to Y1,130 on 21.87m shares traded, 5.2 per cent of the day's total volume. Roundup THE Pacific Basin region was mostly lower yesterday. HONG KONG was an exception, the Hang Seng index finishing 22.88 higher at 5,734.45. Retail investors maintained some momentum in the afternoon in the absence of European buying. Volume totalled HKDollars 2.65bn, near Tuesday's level. Interest continued to focus on blue chips, with HSBC Holdings leading the actives list. It closed 50 cents off at HKDollars 56, after touching HKDollars 57. AUSTRALIA weakened on concern about earnings and on steady offshore selling. The All Ordinaries index ended 13.5 down at 1,528.5 in turnover of ADollars 210.1m. Diversified miner CRA tumbled 40 cents to ADollars 12.24 after posting a 6.8 per cent fall in net profits. Transport group TNT dipped 3 cents to ADollars 1.24 after its ADollars 195.4m loss. NEW ZEALAND was dragged down by selling pressure on the leaders, particularly Brierley Investments. The NZSE-40 index fell 13.58 to 1,470.30 in volume of just NZDollars 14.3m. Brierley hit its low for the year, 84 cents, before ending 3 cents off at 85 cents. Carter Holt lost 6 cents to NZDollars 2.58 on indications that a strike at its four forest products mills will drag on. SINGAPORE declined in sluggish trading, the Straits Times Industrial index shedding 10.32 to 1,365.14 in volume of 24.3m shares, against 28.1m. Property issues lost some ground as investors reacted to reports that the government had raised development charges for residential plots by between 8 and 40 per cent. City Development fell 14 cents to SDollars 3.40 and Hotel Properties 2 cents to SDollars 1.68. KUALA LUMPUR closed softer after initial steadiness failed to prompt follow-through buying. The composite index was off 0.58 at 572.92. SEOUL finished higher as a late-afternoon buying spree in large-capitalisation shares outweighed earlier profit-taking. The index, off 7.82 in the early afternoon, ended 4.14 ahead at 562.74 in turnover of Won462.5bn (Won639.6bn). BANGKOK was lifted by Thai Airways, one of the biggest stocks on the market, which rose by its 10 per cent limit, Bt5, to Bt58. The SET index put on 8.89 to 762.42 in turnover of Bt8.89bn. TAIWAN was pulled lower by late profit-taking, the weighted index closing 26.84 down at 3,933.61. Turnover was moderate at TDollars 24.35bn, against TDollars 25.56bn. MANILA rebounded on thoughts that the peso's climb was slowing. The composite index gained 25.43 at 1,392.34 in combined turnover of 181.84m pesos, after 163.36m. PLDT rose 35 pesos to 940.</p>

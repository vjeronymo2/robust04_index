			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Scots schools 'fail in basic skills' THE SCOTTISH education system, although widely recognised as good, is failing too many children by not teaching them basic skills, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday. Large numbers of young Scots were leaving school unable to read or write, or add up, he said in a speech to Conservatives in Aberdeen. 'They don't even have the tools to do the jobs of yesterday, never mind tomorrow.' He said calls for a period of calm to digest recent changes were understandable but they could not be allowed to stand in the way of the need for change to achieve higher standards. Teaching had to return to the backbones of education of the past - 'spelling, punctuation, grammar, arithmetic'. Assessment by regular testing was essential, in spite of the 'overblown rhetoric' of its critics, he said. Mr Lang said the policy outlined last year and broadly accepted by the teaching profession, provided for pupils aged between five and 14 to be tested five times in reading, writing and mathematics when the teacher judged them to be ready to 'negotiate the test successfully'. He highlighted the problem of truancy and said that each school's truancy performance would be recorded for 1993-94 and included in the school's handbook from the following year. He reminded education authorities that they had the power to prosecute parents who did not ensure that their children went to school. Mr Lang said that school boards - the equivalent of boards of governors in England - which were introduced in the late 1980s by Mr Michael Forsyth, then Scottish education minister, were 'frankly, of varying quality'. Many still lacked self-confidence or were less interested than they might be.</p>

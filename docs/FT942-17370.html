			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: Hermes bucks trend with 19% improvement Hermes International, the French leather goods group, last year bucked the downturn in the global luxury goods market with a 19 per cent increase in net profits to FFr210m (Dollars 35.6m) from FFr176m in 1992. The group, which ended its long tradition of independence last June by going public on the Paris secondary market, said that it expected to achieve yet another increase in profits for 1994 after a 'strong performance' in the opening months of the year. Hermes' strategy of concentrating on the top of the luxury market helped it to achieve a sales increase of 16 per cent to FFr2.85bn in 1993 from FFr2.46bn in 1992. Operating profits rose by 19 per cent to FFr406m from FFr341m over the same period. The board proposed raising the net dividend to FFr4.10 a share against the payment of FFr3.70 in the previous year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Responding to questions on the Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue, government  spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said that American and  European efforts on the Skopje issue tend to be in the same  direction on the matter of how they should formulate the  preliminary conditions for dialogue between the two sides. He  stressed that the coordinator of the efforts is Cyrus Vance.    The government spokesman also said that there is no  possibility for a temporary lifting of the measures against  Skopje and that Greece will lift the measures only when Skopje  gives practical signs of goodwill, as demanded by the Greek  side. A temporary suspension of the measures to allow a  resumption of the dialogue is not in the government's plans,  Venizelos said.</p>

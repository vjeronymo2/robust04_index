The article says:    Through the dismantlement of the U.S. military bases the  Libyan Arab people showed that the strength of the people who  value their national dignity and sovereignty of their country is  tremendous.    Today the Libyan Arab people steadfastly maintain the stand  of independence against imperialism. This enjoys sympathy and  support of the world progressive people including the African  people.    The imperialists are persisting in their pressure and  interference against Libya which is advancing along the road of  independence, regarding it as a thorn in their flesh. But they  could not break down the will of the Libyan Arab people.    The Libyan Arab people are firmly safeguarding their  national  dignity and sovereignty of their country under the leadership of  Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the great September  first revolution.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Letter: The training anomaly that puts nanny at a disadvantage Sir, As an employer committed to training, I train my employees in my business and believe that a nanny employed at home should be given the same support and training as any 'business' employee. Training has been given a high profile by government and industry in the UK. The government is supposedly supporting a national target designed to ensure that, by 1996, all employees take part in training or development activities. You would think, therefore, there would be some support for individuals training employees. I rang the tax office to ask if our nanny's course fees - she has registered for a six-year part-time degree course in subjects relevant to her job - would be an allowable expense against my personal tax. The response - a snort and 'this is a new one on me' - perhaps said it all. It seems that not only do businesswomen have to pay for childcare out of taxed income - even though I could not run my business without this back-up  -but the government does not even support those who carry out the training philosophy for every employee. The final word comes from the tax office. No, they said, a nanny cannot claim personal tax relief if she pays the course fees herself - even though the course is relevant to her job. According to the tax office this is because it is increasing her marketability and career chances. It would be interesting to hear their views on what they think business training across the country does for the individuals.

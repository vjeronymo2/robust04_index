			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Boeing urges move to curb Taiwan aid BOEING yesterday urged the US government to move swiftly on a bilateral agreement with Taiwan to prevent the use of 'unchecked government subsidies and other trade-distorting measures' in Taiwan's proposed venture with McDonnell Douglas, writes Nancy Dunne. A senior Boeing official told the congressional joint economic committee that the government of Taiwan is undertaking a much larger role in the enterprise than originally had been expected. Boeing pointed out that world demand for aircraft had slowed to no more than 600 a year with current world production capacity at about 1,000.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["News Focus" by Keiji Urakami: "Private Role Sought in </F> Breaking Auto deadlock"]    [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Japan's trade ministry is  turning to the private sector to play an increasing role in  breaking an impasse in auto trade talks with the United States.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has  implicitly requested major automakers to formulate their own  plans for voluntary purchases of U.S.-made auto parts, MITI  sources said.    The step, termed by some an administrative guidance, is in  response to growing U.S. pressure for Tokyo to establish a  specific program for increasing American access to Japan's auto  and auto parts markets, ahead of the February 11 meeting between  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President  Bill Clinton.    MITI, unwilling to cave in to a U.S. call for Tokyo to use  numerical targets as a means of gauging its penetration of  Japanese markets, is trying to get the private sector to soften  Washington's stance, the sources said.    But the U.S. policy runs the risk of leading to managed  trade, a concept the Japanese Government has strongly rejected  under the framework talks.    This would run counter to the Hosokawa administration's  chief  goal of easing government controls on rules and regulations.    Earlier this week, top executives of Japan's three major  carmakers -- Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co. and Honda  Motor Co. -- were separately called to meet MITI Minister  Hiroshi Kumagai, the sources said.    Details of the meetings were not disclosed but they must  have  discussed the carmakers' foreign parts purchase plans, the  sources said.    Asking the auto industry for cooperation may be one idea  Hosokawa can take to his meeting with Clinton in Washington, the  sources said. But cooperation must not go beyond that made on a  voluntary basis, the sources added.    The latest request to the auto industry came after a  proposal  by a senior MITI official for a more cooperative approach by the  private sector, which is designed to increase Japanese purchases  of U.S. automobiles and auto parts.    "The cooperation approach" being recommended by MITI is  aimed  at dispelling "mutual distrust" between Washington and Tokyo in  the framework talks, Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice MITI minister for  international affairs, said in a recent press conference.    The new cooperation scheme consists of three phases --  setting of objective criteria by each automaker in U.S.-made  parts buying and other areas, evaluation of buying records in  accordance with the criteria on a semiannual basis and deciding  whether or not to devise extra steps based on the assessment.    Criteria for Japanese automakers may also cover the number  of  their dealership chains handling U.S. autos, dealers' records  of U.S. car imports and whether the "design-in" cooperative  approach between users and makers from the initial stage of  development to manufacturing is being adopted by makers.    The cooperation approach is also applied to U.S. automakers  by measuring their business efforts based on such criteria as  whether products are tailored to meet the needs of Japanese  motorists by, for instance, having right-hand steering wheels,  Okamatsu said.    Okamatsu said the approach is not like administrative  guidance, which he said is inconsistent with Hosokawa's  deregulation policy.</p>

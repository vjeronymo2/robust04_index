			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau, 5 May -- The heads of the Moldovan and  Belarusian Governments signed an agreement on commercial and  economic cooperaton in 1994 in Chisinau today. According to  Moldovan Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli, this document removes  obstacles to the movement of goods between the two countries.  Minsk is now one of Chisinau's main partners. Chisinau sends  foodstuffs to Belarus, receiving in return engineering products  and refined fuel.    Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich told ITAR-TASS  that the greatest obstacle to integration among the CIS  countries was the shortcomings of the payments system and  fluctuations in currency rates. Merging monetary systems with  Russia would not be an impediment in Belarus's relations with  the other republics, but, on the contrary, would work to get rid  of this shortcoming. He denied rumors saying differences had  arisen between the leadership of Russia and Belarus over  differing approaches to the merger of monetary systems. The  first stage, Vyacheslav Kebich said, of this merger is now under  way: removing duties, quotas, licences and other obstacles to  the movement of goods and people.    "What we are doing with Russia is way ahead of the processes  taking place in the CIS and even the proposal by President  Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan for a Euroasian Union,"  Kebich emphasized. "We believe that our example might perhaps be  followed by other republics, which will achieve the same degree  of synchronization of legislation, as we are with Russia."    The Moldovan prime minister expressed regret that the time  for merging the monetary systems of the CIS countries had been  missed. "Moldova has introduced its own currency, and we believe  everything has to be done to make the CIS and the inter-state  bank, which has been set up within the CIS, work properly," he  told ITAR-TASS. "To do this we need to summon up our courage and  implement what has been signed at previous CIS heads meetings.  If this happens many problems, including those concerning  payments, will disappear."</p>

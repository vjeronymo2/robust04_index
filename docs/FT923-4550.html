			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / High marks for Mitterrand show: France's TV debate on Maastricht has helped to calm the electorate's worries It is touch and go, but it looks as if France's baffled European Community partners can start to breathe a bit more easily. The signs are that French President Francois Mitterrand's magisterial television appearance before an audience of 8.3m viewers on Thursday evening has helped to calm his disillusioned electorate's fears of the consequences of accepting the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. It is, however, too early to predict whether his three-hour performance, backed by an appearance from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, will turn the fine balance between the Yes and No vote into a firm majority when France votes on the treaty on September 20. A poll by the CSA institute last night showed a swing to a 55 per cent majority in favour of the treaty, but this is still a long way short of the majority of nearly 70 per cent in favour in early June, when Mr Mitterrand announced a referendum. The debate was clouded by the peculiarities of French politics. Yet it also underscored certain general weaknesses in the Maastricht treaty, which are there to be exploited by its opponents in other EC countries. Mr Mitterrand achieved two important objectives under questioning from a panel of 14 supposedly representative citizens, three journalists and a surprisingly emollient Philippe Seguin, the Gaullist former government minister who leads the anti-Maastricht campaign. First, he cooled the temperature of what has been until now an emotional and ill-informed public wrangle. He avoided the temptation to predict Armageddon in the event of a No, saying instead that Europe would lose several years in its development - a moderate argument that is bound to increase his credibility, battered by rising unemployment, perceived remoteness from the electorate and party political scandals. At the same time, Mr Mitterrand sought to calm fears of loss of sovereignty by reminding viewers that the treaty was designed to 'protect France and Europe from the free-for-all that would have followed the simple application of the Single European Act', the 1985 treaty which paved the way for the abolition of trade barriers between member states. Second, he resisted pressure from both pro- and anti-Maastricht campaigners to consider resignation, at least for the time being, in the process helping to take France's tangled domestic politics out of the debate. All this should encourage the electorate to lay aside their own feelings about the increasingly unpopular president and focus on the real issues in the treaty when they vote. Yet even if the French do manage to boil down the debate to the nuts and bolts of the treaty - economic and monetary union, plus security and foreign policy co-ordination - the balance between the Yes and No camps is painfully fine. The show uncovered a gamut of gripes about the European Community as it is now and as it would be were Maastricht to be ratified by the 12 EC member states. They ranged from loss of economic sovereignty, to fears of German domination, an autocratic Brussels bureaucracy and the shackling of French diplomacy to its EC partners. The gripes also centre on issues that have nothing to do with the treaty, such as immigration, which might seem ironic from one of the few countries to have ratifed the Schengen free travel accord, which sets a common visa policy for its eight signatories. Working hours, the threat from Japanese industrial competition and the future of farming were other strictly non-Maastricht issues - all the daily bread of French politics - thrown into the debate by the citizens' panel. It could be that the French public has woken late to the general obligations of existing EC membership and that Maastricht has snapped the country out of its Euro-doze with a nasty start. This might seem surprising to other Europeans who think of France as a self-confident wielder of power in an EC it has largely designed. But it is understandable given that the current campaign is, as Mr Mitterrand sadly admits, France's first proper debate on Europe for 40 years. Mr Mitterrand took a risk by agreeing to appear at all, just as he did in deciding on June 3 to call a referendum, when the treaty could have been ratified by parliamentary procedure. Many pro-treaty campaigners feared he might do more harm than good by appearing on television this week, by linking people's feelings about Maastricht with the Socialist government's image. Perhaps, argued some commentators, the Yes cause would have been better served by an opposition party leader favourable to Maastricht. Candidates include former president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the centre-right UDF, or Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the Gaullist RPR. A majority of their supporters are against Maastricht, so unlike Mr Mitterrand they would not just be preaching to the converted among their party rank and file. And they pull more votes than the Socialists, who won a mere 18.3 per cent of the vote in March's regional elections. In the event, Mr Mitterrand performed with cool audacity, betraying not a hint of worry over his unpopularity. 'How can I be Mr Seguin's opponent?' he joked. 'I am president of all the French, including Mr Seguin.' Few leaders can speak unscripted for so long without making a blunder, let alone sweltering under spotlights in an echoing hall of the Sorbonne. Mr Mitterrand seemed positively to flourish under pressure, smiling with satisfaction as he thought up answers to aggressive questions. The wily old fox may be temporarily cornered, but he is not finished by a long chalk. As usual, when pushed on his own future, he was enigmatic. Some, including his own supporters, have urged Mr Mitterrand to resign to guarantee a Yes, while the opposition is obviously urging him to stand down in the event of a No. 'I will take the responsibilities that fall to me' a day or so after the result is known, said Mr Mitterrand. 'If it is true that I do that much harm to the treaty of Maastricht, then I must take the greatest possible account of the advice of my adversaries and others - but do you think that it has got to that point?' he added. If the Mitterrand show might help to soothe French agonising over Maastricht, it is less certain that it succeeded in laying to rest all the popular fears of the consequences of European union as underlined by Mr Seguin. He did not draw as much blood as he could have done, perhaps conscious that he might again become a minister if the right wins next March's parliamentary elections, as seems likely. However, he drove hard at a theme that strikes a chord in many member states, by complaining of the weight of 'technocratic' rule from Brussels. This has become a sensitive point on all political sides in France over the past year, with several Commission rulings against French industrial interests. Mr Seguin pushed Mr Mitterrand on to weak ground by referring to the prime role which the Maastricht treaty gives to the European central bank in running the eventual single currency. Economics have never been Mr Mitterrand's strongest suit. The president agreed that technocrats could be 'cold monsters', but stressed that it would be 'politicians, elected by universal suffrage, and not the technocrats' who would decide overall economic policy. The criteria by which economies must bring their inflation levels, budget deficits and interest rates to converge would be applied with the utmost sensitivity, he said. Political control over the central bank was France's negotiating aim in the long wrangling over Maastricht. But it is not at all clear in the Maastricht text whether France really achieved its aim of keeping the 'economic government' of Europe out of the hands of unelected central bankers. It was of course Germany's minimum demand over Maastricht that the central bank be properly insulated from political pressure. Mr Seguin must have made a telling point to many French viewers - victims of some of the highest real interest rates in Europe - when he argued that 'anyone who has mastery of monetary policy has the main hand in setting and carrying out economic policy'. In other words, how would the French like to see their government's spending policy steered by European banking officials? Most of the talking on another French public worry, German domination, was left to Mr Kohl, addressing the debate from his office in Bonn. Here, he might have steered too close to the truth for the liking of touchy French opinion in saying that France need not have an inferiority complex. He went on, however, to sound more comforting, by pledging that a post-Maastricht Europe would not be German, but belong to all member states. 'There is no German demon,' he said. Take the 'advice of a friend', said the chancellor - suddenly looking avuncular  - and vote Yes. Another difficulty in selling Maastricht, as Mr Mitterrand found out on Thursday night, is the special treatment it gives one country, Britain, on monetary union and social policy. As Mr Seguin noted, once France ratifies the treaty, it would have no chance to opt out of a single currency as the UK will. Mr Mitterrand finessed the issue of Britain's opt-out on social policy, saying one needed 'patience, as in all families', for everyone to agree. But it became clear on Thursday that for proponents of EC labour regulation, Britain's opt-out on social policy is a serious flaw, while for opponents of such regulation it is an unfair privilege. It is doubly odd for Mr Seguin, and other No compaigners, to rail gainst Maastricht for shutting eastern Europe out, when fears of people and food flooding into France from the east are precisely those that rally people to their cause. But the fear of loss of national identity is what lies behind the anxieties raised by Mr Seguin and others. Nevertheless, the sovereignty card is a hard one for a Gaullist to play against Mr Mitterrand, who has all the haughtiness of De Gaulle. 'You cannot give the impression,' he told Mr Seguin, 'that France is suddenly losing its sovereignty, and submitting itself to foreign domination. Do you think I could accept that any more than you?' At the very least, Mr Mitterrand's rare television debate has regained some of the ground lost by the Yes campaign. Those among his supporters who thought that calling the September 20 referendum was a crazy risk must now be breathing a sigh of relief. Yet he is not home and dry.</p>

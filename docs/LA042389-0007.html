			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH WAMBAUGH  </P> <P> I note that Wambaugh tends to blame attorneys for his legal problems ("The  Crimes of Joseph Wambaugh," by Sean Mitchell, Feb. 26). I believe in and would  defend Wambaugh's right to write about any subject, fiction or nonfiction, that  inspires him. In exercising this right, your article estimates, Wambaugh  realizes a return of about $1 million per book. Obviously, Wambaugh would like  to keep exercising this right both as an expression of his creative freedom as  well as for economic gain. On the other hand, when certain individuals feel  abused by Wambaugh's work, he would deny them the right to seek redress.  </P> <P> MARTIN L.

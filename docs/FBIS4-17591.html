			<p>BFN     [Text] Commander of the Black Sea Fleet Admiral Eduard  Baltin said he was surprised by Ukrainian politicians'  statements that a third party should be involved in tackling the  Black Sea Fleet problem (the U.S.--Interfax). He told Interfax  that he categorically opposed the idea of involving Washington  in this dispute.    "To begin with, this is Russia's problem. Historically, it  is Russia that is conducting talks with Ukraine. So Russia will  hardly put up with the idea of American participation," he said.    Speaking about the talks on the Black Sea Fleet between the  Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers, Baltin said that Kiev  had interpreted the Moscow agreement between the Russian and  Ukrainian presidents in its own way and violated one of its  basic provisions on the separate location of the Russian and  Ukrainian headquarters. The presence of the Ukrainian and  Russian headquarters in Sevastopol would destabilize the  situation in the city and complicate the work of the personnel,  he said.    Such a situation may entail unpredictable consequences, he  added.    To quote Baltin, behind the Ukrainian position is the lack  of  money for the construction of its own naval base. "It is much  easier to live at someone else's expense," he said.    Commenting on the allegations that Russia scuppered the  talks, he said that "attack is the best form of defense."  "Obviously, Kiev has taken this saying to heart," he said.</p>

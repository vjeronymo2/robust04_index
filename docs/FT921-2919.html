			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / A new industrial resilience belies Rust Belt blues: The story of the Midwest's economy is not as bad as that of the country as a whole IN CHICAGO recently, 9,000 people queued in a blizzard for hours to apply for 500 hotel jobs. Last month General Motors told 4,000 workers in Ypsilanti, Michigan that their plant, rather than one in Texas, would be closed. To many it feels as if the worst days of the Rust Belt are back. It is not surprising, then, that the candidates in the presidential primaries this year have been tempted to play to the region's economic distress. However, the story of the Midwest's economy is not in fact as bad as it is in the country as a whole. The region has suffered less in this recession than it did in the early 1980s, said Mr David Allardice, assistant director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. While the slowdown has recently begun to deepen in the Midwest, many regional analysts still say the region will pull through 1992 in better shape than the rest of the country. In the past, the Midwest, as the industrial heartland, has tended to lag behind the nation in its economic downturn and then rebound more slowly. Analysts believe the Midwest may have fundamentally changed. 'The region has been restructuring and is in a better competitive position,' said Mr Robert Schnorbus, manufacturing analyst at the Chicago Fed. This has included retooling through more capital expenditure, reduced workforces and higher productivity. Helped by a slimming of inventories over the past several months, the Midwest may well be able to bounce back more quickly than ever, he said. While the General Motors' cuts, the demise of Midway Airlines and a long strike at Caterpillar have taken their toll on employment in Illinois and Michigan, the total number of jobs has edged up - 0.5 per cent between December and January - in the five-state area of Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin. One of the key boosts for the trimmer heartland since the start of the recession in July 1990 has been exports, in particular of capital goods. The region accounts for a large share of US capital goods production exports of which have been growing at about 10 per cent a year over the last two years, compared with total US export growth in 1991 of 7.6 per cent. The export picture for this year has, however, been clouded by the economic slowdowns in Germany and Japan. But, says Ms Diane Swonk, regional economist for First Chicago: 'Trade won't fall apart like some people think.' Ms Swonk believes that as long as the dollar stays relatively competitive, Mexico and other newly-industrialising countries will pick up some of the slack in exports. Capital goods demand from Canada, which alone accounts for between 40 and 50 per cent of the region's trade, would also pick up later this year, she said. Other evidence suggests that even European markets might not be as bad as expected. At Giddings &amp; Lewis, the largest North American maker of machine tools and assembly systems, orders shot up during the 1991 fourth quarter - and 35 per cent of them were from Europe. The company won its first order from France in more than five years. Strong interest came from the Pacific Rim, in particular South Korea. The real estate sector in the Midwest has not been the plague that it has in other regions, largely because commercial property was not excessively over-built - though the vacancy rate is rising in Chicago - and home values did not rise sharply as they did elsewhere. One of the more marked differences between the region and the nation is in single-family homes. Between 1988 and 1991, single-family (detached) housing starts, an indicator of middle-class prosperity, remained almost unchanged in the Midwest while they dropped 22 per cent in the country as a whole. First Chicago expects them to rise 24 per cent in the Midwest this year. Agriculture has recuperated from its trough in the mid-1980s and has been on a steady if unspectacular course. The US exports 20 per cent of its maize and half its wheat, the bulk of which come from the region. Net cash farm income dropped 6 per cent last year and is expected to fall slightly again this year. But, overall, the farm sector has not had as serious a downturn as the rest of the economy. Exports are expected to enjoy a slight increase this year, largely from more shipments of and higher prices for wheat. Meanwhile the Midwest's old complaint that it has not won enough defence contracts has turned out to be a blessing. The wrenching shrinkage of the US defence industry will barely be felt in the region. With respect to the Midwest's longer-term prospects, adjustment in the motor industry, some 60 per cent of which is concentrated in the region, and an increasing orientation to exports will be key, according to Mr Robert Dieli, regional economist for Northern Trust Company in Chicago.</p>

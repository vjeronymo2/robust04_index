			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses retain forward momentum Activity among the major equity markets on the continent was generally muted yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS ticked up another rise as the CAC-40 index added 28.97 or 1.5 per cent to 1,949.75. Turnover remained low at FFr2.5bn. In the automotive sector Peugeot rose FFr28 to FFr789 after reporting a 12.4 per cent rise in first half car sales, Michelin improved FFr2.80 to FFr238.50 and Valeo FFr4.30 to FFr278.90. In a review of this sector Kleinwort Benson noted that in spite of the 'ephemeral and artificial' nature of a recovery in the market following the government's initiative earlier in the year to boost sales, there did seem to be an underlying trend towards recovery of registrations throughout Europe, although the risk remained that demand could dry-up in the second half. France, and the UK, they added, stood to benefit the most. FRANKFURT kept track of movements in the currency markets but the Dax index managed a slight increase on the day in spite of continued dollar weakness. The Dax closed the official session up 14.81 at 2,065.66, off the session high of 2,072.99. In Ibis-indicated trading the index rose further to 2,069.46. A number of brokers have moved to an underweight position in Germany, in spite of the equity market's outperformance of the continental average. Hoare Govett, for instance, noted in its third quarter review that while corporate earnings forecasts had become more positive, 'ratings still look historically demanding'. Favouring the chemicals sector among cyclicals Hoare's also recommended an overweight position in construction which continued to be supported by rising investment in the east. Siemens, up 50 pfennings at DM655, drew moderate interest after forecasting that 1994 earnings would be in line with year ago results. Elsewhere Mannesmann made DM11.50 to DM418.50 while Volkswagen slipped DM3.40 to DM469.60 as rumours, all of them denied, swept the market regarding the future of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez. AMSTERDAM moved higher with the AEX index rising by 1.40 to 387.24. Paribas Capital Markets has maintained its neutral weighting on the market given that Dutch equities are so closely tied to dollar movements. Paribas added that it had lowered its AEX target to 415 for the year-end, and to 435 for 1995. However, the broker said that it expected 'some momentum from positive surprises in interim earnings, given the generally good first quarter results and the characteristic caution of the majority of Dutch companies'. Fokker rose 40 cents to Fl 16.10 following the announcement a cash injection of Fl 1bn. MILAN remained becalmed in very thin trade with much of the activity technically driven by end of account considerations. The Comit index dipped 2.57 to 684.35, the mood soured by further friction within the government coalition, and the continued absence of clear budget proposals. Banks were mixed with some benefiting from Cariplo's last minute decision last Friday to postpone its planned flotation. Credito Italiano picked up L10 to L2,040 and IMI put on L120 to L10,650 as cash reserved for the flotation flowed back into the sector. In the opposite direction BCI fell L99 or 2.2 per cent to L4,375: it will ask shareholders this week to approve its planned capital call. Insurers remained under pressure as investors switched to the newly-privatised INA. Generali lost L650 to L40,000 while Fondiaria was down L15 to L12,190. ZURICH was flat in low volume with most activity restricted to trading among professionals. The SMI index rose 2.2 to 2,562.5. The weak dollar limited activity and weighed on shares like Ciba, SFr7 easier at SFr757, and Nestle, up SFr3 at SFr1,096. Roche certificates held steady at SFr6,000, supported by reported buying by BZ Bank. Roche is due to release its half-year revenue figure this week. Elsewhere, Alusuisse saw some buying interest, rising SFr7 to SFr654 after the company announced that it had sold its Conalco US unit to Ormet for an undisclosed price. Banking and insurance issues closed higher on buying off the lows. UBS rose SFr5 to SFr1,169 and Zurich Insurance gained SFr15 to SFr1,310. MADRID was higher in thin trade although prices came off their highs as Wall Street opened. The General index rose 2.48 to 296.4 but trading volume of Pta17.6bn was one of the lowest recorded this year Among the banks, Banco Santander rose Pta165 or 3.7 per cent to Pta4,665 on expectations of an 8 per cent profits rise and Bankinter dropped Pta10 to Pta10,690 before the bank disclosed a higher than expected 9.2 per cent drop in consolidated net profit in the first half of 1994. STOCKHOLM was helped higher by a number of positive factors, with the Affarsvarlden general index rising 22.3 to 1,378.3. Turnover improved to SKr1.6bn from SKr1.3bn as Volvo B shares, the day's most active issue, rose SKr24 to SKr682. WARSAW was stronger for the fifth consecutive session, with the Wig index gaining 445.9 to 9.610.0. ISTANBUL regained most fo Friday's fall to close the session up 3.3 per cent on bargain hunting. The composite index added 682.87 to 21,106.38, although volume was reported as light. Brokers forecast that the index could rise to the 22,000 level before encountering a resistance level. Among the days most actives Izmir Demir Celik rose TL250 to TL2,175. The equity market will extend trading to four hours from Thursday, and also switch to a two-day settlement period.

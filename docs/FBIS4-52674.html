			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korean National  Unification Board Minister Yi Hong-ku said Thursday that if  North Korea developed "even one-half of a nuclear weapon," it  would nullify the joint declaration of the denuclearization of  the Korean peninsula signed on Dec. 31, 1991.    Speaking at a meeting of the Korean Newspaper Editors  Association, Yi, who is also deputy prime minister, said the  current military balance between South and North Korea and peace  on the peninsula would be broken if the North came to possess  nuclear arms.    The Seoul government cannot retract its policy of linking  the  nuclear issue with South-North economic cooperation until the  dispute starts heading in the right direction, Yi said.    The government is nonetheless ready to respond to changing  developments, Yi added, indicating that the policy of linkage  could be flexible.    Commenting on a North Korean bid to replace the armistice  agreement with a peace treaty with the United States, the  minister said the government is trying to formulate measures on  the move through consultations among concerned ministries.    "In any event, there is no change in the principle (of the  Seoul government) that this problem has to be resolved between  the two Koreas," he said.    In this respect, the United States is fully aware that  inter-  Korean accord is necessary to ensure peace and stability on the  Korean peninsula, he added.    With regard to North Korean loggers fleeing from Siberia, Yi  said there is no change in the government's policy of trying to  help them settle in the South.    The problem should be handled quietly, however, so as not to  irritate Russia and other countries involved, he said.</p>

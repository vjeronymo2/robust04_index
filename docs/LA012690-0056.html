			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CONTRAS PLOTTING TO ASSASSINATE ORTEGA, NICARAGUA CHARGES  </P> <P> Nicaragua has told the United States that it intercepted messages between  U.S.-backed Contras last Sunday that referred to a plan to assassinate  President Daniel Ortega in an ambush.  </P> <P> In a protest to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, also circulated as a  U.N. document, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said that the  messages were transmitted over U.S.-supplied equipment.  </P> <P> He accused Washington of trying to disrupt elections in Nicaragua set for Feb.  25.  </P> <P> The letter, dated Jan. 22, said that military intelligence deciphered messages  sent between Contra troops in which they mentioned a plan to assassinate Ortega  in an ambush to be set up between the towns of Quilali and San Juan del Rio  Coco.  </P> <P> D'Escoto said the messages were sent "by means of sophisticated equipment  supplied by the government of the United States as part of the misnamed  'humanitarian aid.' "  </P> <P> Washington, which has not yet commented on D'Escoto's protest, has continued  providing the Nicaraguan rebels with non-lethal assistance.  </P></p>

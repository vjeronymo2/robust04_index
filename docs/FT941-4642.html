			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: RTZ It is a measure of RTZ's quality that earnings and the dividend have been edged higher despite the cyclical trough in metals prices. If the company looked hemmed in following the acquisition of Nerco's US coal assets a year ago, the sale of Pillar has restored its room for manoeuvre. Year end gearing of 12 per cent - rising to perhaps 20 per cent as higher capital expenditure starts to bite - leaves plenty of scope for deal-making. Another step in US coal would make good sense. Not that RTZ needs a deal to deliver earnings growth. Capital expenditure of Pounds 500m this year points to no lack of investment opportunity within the existing business. Big gains should come from the cyclical upswing in metals prices. True, RTZ's heady cocktail of currency and commodity exposures makes the pace of profits growth unusually difficult to judge. On the company's own view that average metals prices this year will be little different from last, the immediate outlook is far from sparkling. But if metals prices peak towards the end of the decade at levels which are in real terms similar to the late 1980s, RTZ might squeeze up to Pounds 1 a share of earnings from its existing assets. On that basis the shares - having risen by 30 per cent since November - stand on a peak earnings multiple of nearly 9 times. While investors are prepared to take an optimistic view of metals prices, that rating seems fair enough. It will take another well-judged deal to move the shares much higher.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SINEAD O'CONNOR'S YEAR  </P> <P> I find Sinead O'Connor's courage and honesty inspiring ("Nothing Compares 2 Her  Year," by Robert Hilburn, Dec. 16). But I'm puzzled about her regret for  avoiding a potentially uncomfortable experience with "Saturday Night Live."  </P> <P> Why should she beat herself up on the censorship issue? Media veterans who care  about honesty can tell you that sometimes the line between editing and  censorship gets fine.  </P> <P> JED GOULD  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

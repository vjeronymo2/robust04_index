			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / MI5 chief moves out of shadows into spotlight MRS STELLA Rimington, director-general of Britain's internal Security Service, posed under conditions of appropriate secrecy for her first official photographs yesterday. Press photographers, summoned to the Home Office for an undisclosed assignment, were taken by minibus to the service's headquarters. The curtains of Mrs Rimington's office were drawn to avoid identifying the room's location within the building. The photograph is a step forward for open government: Mrs Rimington is the first director-general of the Security Service - still widely known by its 1916 title MI5 - to have been officially identified while in office. The government also published yesterday a booklet on MI5 on staffing and fields of operation. Intrigue under wraps at MI5, Page 7</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Court told of 'simple' Pounds 5.2m Guinness theft MR THOMAS Ward, the US lawyer and former Guinness director, laid the ground for the theft of Pounds 5.2m from the company after its successful takeover bid for Distillers in 1986, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. Opening the prosecution at the start of the final Guinness trial, Mr Victor Temple alleged that Mr Ward sought and obtained the co-operation of Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman and chief executive, who lent his direct assistance to the dishonest enterprise. Mr Ward faces one charge of stealing Pounds 5.2m from Guinness and single charges of false accounting and procuring the execution of a valuable security in relation to the alleged theft. He denies all the charges. Mr Temple said Mr Ward and Mr Saunders had been friends and confidants for a number of years. Mr Ward was Mr Saunders' principal adviser and had joined the Guinness board in January 1985. After Guinness won its bitter takeover battle with Argyll to take control of Distillers, the company had to pay its advisers. Mr Temple said the chances that any particular invoice would be checked were remote and both Mr Ward and Mr Saunders were sufficiently powerful to be able to deflect any queries that might arise. This allowed the two men, doubtless motivated by greed, to put into effect a simple, clever and effective joint enterprise to steal the Pounds 5.2m, he said. Through the submission of a false invoice the money was paid to Marketing and Acquisition Consultants, a Jersey-based company controlled by Mr Ward. Guinness's strategy during the takeover was decided by a committee of three directors - Mr Saunders, Mr Ward and Mr Olivier Roux, the company's finance director. Mr Temple said Mr Roux would appear as the prosecution's principal witness. There would be a 'head-on clash' between his evidence and Mr Ward's version of events, he told the jury. The trial, which is expected to last about three months, continues today.</p>

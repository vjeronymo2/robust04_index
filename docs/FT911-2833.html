			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Council Tax is unveiled HOW WILL the new Council Tax affect you, if and when it finally rolls into action? Some patterns can now be discerned through the fog of figures which surround the tax, which will be introduced in 1993. The sizeable reduction in bills compared with the poll tax which the Conservatives are hoping for can be enforced, if the government provides enough money from central funding. However, this would lead to continued 'gearing', where small differences between council spending and government estimates lead to big variations in the tax levied. The most important determinant of the new tax will be the value of your home. In the words of environment minister Michael Heseltine: 'Properties in England will each be allocated to one of seven bands. There will be no need for precise valuations of every house or flat, nor need there be regular general revaluations.' These words are vague enough to show that there will be room for haggling in the two years which remain before the earliest possible date for the starting point of the tax, April 1993. As it stands, every property will be assessed so that it can be given a value relative to the average value of a property in the country as a whole. This calculation will be done separately for England, Scotland and Wales - in Wales your house will be banded relative to the average Welsh house price, and so on. Then, as with the poll tax, each council will set a level of charge for each household. The proportion you have to pay will depend on the band your property falls in. Only one bill will be sent to each house. The following bands, based on the Department of the Environment's average property value in England of Pounds 80,000 and a council tax of exactly Pounds 400 per household, should carry a health warning in the light of the government's miscalculations on the introduction of the poll tax. The average figure was set by the DoE to be Pounds 278, and turned out, even after 21 councils had been capped, to be Pounds 357. Do not make definite plans on these figures, but at present the bands of property values will be as follows: Up to 50 per cent of average (Pounds 40,000): 67 per cent of council tax (Pounds 267) 50-65 per cent (Pounds 52,000): 78 per cent of council tax (Pounds 311) 65-85 per cent (Pounds 68,000): 89 per cent of council tax (Pounds 356) 85-110 per cent (Pounds 88,000): full council tax paid (Pounds 400) 110-150 per cent (Pounds 120,000): 122 per cent paid (Pounds 490) 150-200 per cent: (Pounds 160,000)144 per cent of tax paid (Pounds 579) More than 200 per cent: 167 per cent of tax paid (Pounds 668). As the figures are set relative to averages for the whole country, not just the local area, many districts in the south east will see most people paying more than the standard council tax. There is a personal element. These charges are made on the assumption of two adults living in the dwelling. If you are the only adult in the property, you will only pay 75 per cent of the council tax. The rules on second homes are similar to those for the poll tax. You will have to pay the flat council tax on any holiday home, but with a 50 per cent discount. However, David Hunt, the Welsh Secretary, has asked for further consultation and it is possible that holiday homes in Wales will not receive the full 50 per cent discount. Those on the lowest incomes will not have to pay anything. If there is only one person above the income support line in a household, they will be taxed as a single person. For students, the current plan is that a household of full-time students (including student nurses, apprentices and YTS trainees) would pay 50 per cent. If a student is the only or second adult in a property, they will receive a 25 per cent discount. It looks good if you share with several others in a northern inner city. If you live on your own in a south east suburb, it is not such good news. How much is yours worth? - Page IV</p>

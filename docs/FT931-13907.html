			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Rate of pay increases criticised as too high THE competitive gains of devaluation will quickly disappear if the UK does not deal with its 'long-standing pay problem', says a pamphlet published today, Emma Tucker writes. Mr Fred Bayliss, chairman of the independent Employment Policy Institute, argues that employers are still awarding pay increases higher than the rate of inflation in spite of rising joblessness. This trend persisted throughout the 1980s and into this decade when it was the received wisdom that pay was best left to the unimpeded judgment of individual private employers, the pamphlet says. For this reason, the UK needs to adopt a co-ordinated approach to pay settlements. According to the pamphlet, the rate of earnings increases in the UK is too high even during a recession. Earnings growth needs to fall below inflation if the real economy is to derive maximum advantage from the devaluation of the pound. Does Britain Still Have a Pay Problem? Employment Policy Institute, Southbank House, Black Prince Road, London SE1 7SJ. Pounds 6.50.</p>

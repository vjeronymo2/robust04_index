			<p>BFN     [Text] Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the opposition  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], held a news conference  at a hotel in Hachinohe City, Aomori Prefecture, on 4 June.  During the news conference, he touched on the issue of imposing  economic sanctions against North Korea for its suspected  development of nuclear weapons and stated: "At a time when the  United Nations has yet to make any decision, Japan, the United  States, and South Korea must be cautious about the economic  sanctions against North Korea. The SDPJ takes a position against  the economic sanctions on North Korea." In this way, Kubo made  it clear that the SDPJ will oppose any economic sanctions  imposed by Japan, the United States, and South Korea against  North Korea. During the news conference, Kubo also said that,  through an SDPJ delegation which is scheduled to leave Japan for  Pyongyang on 10 June, the party intends to urge North Korea to  accept nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] and hold dialogue with the United States and South  Korea.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Royal Mail may open its network to private couriers THE POST Office is considering opening up its postal network to private couriers. The Royal Mail, the Post Office's letter service, is looking at proposals to introduce more competition in anticipation of the European Commission's green paper on liberalising postal services, due to be published in June. The Royal Mail, which has a monopoly on all letters on which postage is below Pounds 1, is compiling details of the cost of sending a letter to enable it to draw up a pricing structure for the use of its services. Private couriers such as TNT, the Australian delivery company, and DHL, the international courier, might seek to carry mail and then, in rural areas, be able to pay the Post Office network to deliver their letters on the final leg through the Royal Mail. The concept is similar to inter-connection in the telecommunications industry, where long-distance telephone companies, such as Mercury, can pay British Telecom to route the final part of a call. The move by the Royal Mail to conduct a detailed account of its costs follows the disclosure that the Department of Trade and Industry is looking into the Post Office's finances as a prelude to possible privatisation. Mr Bill Cockburn, managing director of the Royal Mail, said: 'In order to be able to offer a delivery network to other companies we want to have a more detailed understanding of our costs. 'If a company has no presence in a particular part of the country then we may be able to offer them our services for the right price.' Mr Alan Jones, managing director of TNT, said: 'This is a very interesting idea. We will monitor it with great interest.' However, private couriers may only decide to make full use of the Post Office's services if the government abolishes, or reduces, its monopoly on letters under Pounds 1. Mr Cockburn disclosed that the Royal Mail is conducting its investigation of costs with the Post Office Users' National Council, a government watchdog, which will have confidential access to all the figures. Mr George Brown, a member of the council's executive, said: 'We hope to get to the bottom of how every penny of the first and second class stamp is spent.' Meanwhile, the Post Office published figures showing that 85 per cent of first class letters arrive the day after posting, representing a 7.4 per cent improvement in first class mail reliability.

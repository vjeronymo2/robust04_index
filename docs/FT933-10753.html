			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Adult European partner wanted The fate of the franc is more than a matter of French pride. It is the essential test of European monetary co-operation, and will determine the fate of European Monetary Union. Few European politicians of stature have questioned these propositions in the currency turmoil of the past nine months. Still fewer have queried the assumptions behind EMU. Now, in the moment of supreme crisis, many are predicting the collapse of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, with dire consequences for European political and economic integration. A paper on US-European Community relations by the Carnegie Endowment Institute for International Peace offers a more balanced picture of the EC's future. Whatever the disadvantages of distance from daily events, the authors have produced constructive proposals which are a welcome change from 'all-or-nothing' mentality gripping many European policy-makers. Mr Robert Zoellick, a former aide to Mr James Baker while he was US secretary of state, chaired the study. His premise is Americans should not magnify the EC's problems, but should instead pursue America's 'strategic interest' in having an outward-looking, internationalist EC as an adult partner on the world stage. Mr Zoellick writes: 'The emergence of new economic and political obstacles should not be misperceived as a European rejection of the fundamental commitment to overcoming a destructive legacy through closer integration. European integration will proceed - albeit in fits and starts - although its exact course is still an open question.' The study's main proposal is the creation of a 'transatlantic single market'. That sounds like a cute re-working of European Commission President Jacques Delors' 1992 project to create a single European market covering the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. But the group is more intent on drawing up new rules to defuse trade rivalries and head off the subsidy wars which currently plague the agricultural, textile and steel industries. Other ideas include a protocol on foreign investment, reaffirming 'national treatment' for European and US firms operating in their respective foreign markets; closer co-operation on industrial and environmental policies; and new rules providing for more predictable tax policy. The implicit message in the paper is that Clinton should take a more activist approach to the EC's development. No historical parallels are perfect, but Mr Zoellick's inspiration may well be the Truman administration's policy of encouraging European integration after World War II. By any measure, it was a success, leading to a liberal order built around the Gatt-Bretton Woods trading system. The cold war's end has raised questions about the future of the old order. Mr Zoellick wants Clinton to shape the new by strengthening existing institutions, of which the EC is one of the strongest. There is, however, a sting in the tail. Mr Zoellick says the US should be 'increasingly discriminate about the content, form and resulting outlook of the EC'; he suggests the US Treasury be involved in unfolding European Monetary Union, 'if (the US) wants to avoid unpleasant surprises'. Some in Brussels will complain this is a demand for a '13th seat' at the EC table. The US commerce department tried a similar ruse early in the Bush administration, but were shown the door. Mr Zoellick's sweetener - more involvement for the EC in international councils such as the Group of Seven industrialised nations - will not dispel the impression the US wants to slip a Trojan horse into Europe. From Brussels's vantage, the most refreshing aspect of the paper is that it takes European aspirations for closer integration seriously. This should silence those in Europe who believe the US is part of an Anglo-Saxon plot to sabotage EMU, a notion which gained currency in the second battle for the franc last February. Yet it remains true that many Americans find the European attachment to the Exchange Rate Mechanism and the convergence criteria on inflation, budget deficits and government debt baffling. They find it incomprehensible that Europeans are willing to suffer high unemployment for the questionable prize of fixed exchange rates. This was the message behind last week's call by six leading economists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology for France to lead the way in the abandonment of the ERM. The Six Wise Men argued in the FT that Europe is repeating the mistake of the 1930s, when countries tried to hang on to the gold standard at any price. The response in Brussels is unchanged. Mr Delors has argued that maintaining franc-D-Mark parity aims to avoid the mistakes of the 1930s, when Europe fell victim to competitive devaluations. The last 12 months have shown that the franc-mark parity is less about economics and more about politics. It may be the men from MIT have overestimated the Bundesbank's power to set the EC's political course. Final judgment will rest on the response in Paris and Bonn.

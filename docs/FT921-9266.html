			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Mackay unmoved as lawyers protest LORD MACKAY, the Lord Chancellor, stood firm yesterday in the face of a mass meeting of legal-aid lawyers called to protest at the government's plans to introduce standard fees for criminal legal-aid work in magistrates' courts. Lord Mackay, who was barracked and hissed, told more than 2,000 lawyers gathered in Central Hall, Westminster: 'Only those who do not have to face the harsh realities could believe that any publicly funded legal service could be provided without regard to price.' He made it clear that he would not be intimidated by threats of strike action or boycotts of emergency-duty solicitor schemes in police stations. 'Your threat to refuse to answer calls for help would hit members of the public at their most vulnerable in a police station and, if successful, it could lead to the very miscarriages of justice which we all wish to avoid,' he said. Lord Mackay's defence of the government's decision to impose a below-inflation increase of 3 per cent in legal-aid fees met with laughter. With legal-aid expenditure set to exceed Pounds 1bn in 1992-93 - more than double the figure of five years ago - he said lawyers doing legal-aid work could not be immune from the pressure to hold down costs. Correcting what he said was a misconception about the new arrangements, Lord Mackay said standard fees would be related to work done. They would not be just average fees. He was adamant that standard fees were not a cost-cutting measure. Mr Gareth Williams QC, chairman of the Bar, told the rally that the legal-aid system was 'creeping towards collapse'. No one got fat on legal aid work, he said. 'What we want and demand is prompt payment of money earned. Our entitlement is fair pay, fair terms for fair work properly done.' Mr Alastair Logan, the solicitor who represented two of the Guildford Four, said the fixed-fee proposals, coupled with below-inflation increases in fees, represented a 'life-threatening attack' on the whole system of criminal legal aid.</p>

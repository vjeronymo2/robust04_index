			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand may hold talks with the United States on  reducing import duties on foreign films during GATT meetings  later this month in Morocco, Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai  Phanitchaphak said yesterday. He said Washington wants Thailand  to reduce its import tariffs on foreign films even further than  it already has.    Dr Suphachai said the US should not use the issue as another  stick with which to beat Thailand. Washington already has  Thailand on its Priority Watch List pending passage by the Thai  Parliament of an improved copyright bill. Once that bill is  passed, then Washington should take Thailand off the list, he  said.    Dr Suphachai also said that the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade talks would focus on establishing the World Trade  Organisation [WTO]. Thailand faces only one problem in its bid  to become a founding member of the WTO -- a tax-collection  system based on prices and conditions.    GATT wants Thailand to base its tax collection on price, and  Dr Suphachai said Thailand would do so.    In a related development, Business Economics Department  deputy director-general Khanitson Nawanukro said Thailand had  finally agreed to offer greater tariff cuts on five products  under GATT in a bid to end negotiations on market access for  industrial and agricultural products at the Uruguay Round.    The cuts, which apparently are being offered in reply to  demands by the United States and Canada, will set the bound rate  on compressors at 30 percent, other wood at 10 percent,  herbicides at 20 percent, film at five baht per metre and gems  at 1 percent. In exchange for the tariff cuts, the department  expects Thai exports to gain about 102.4 billion baht, or 74.3  percent of the total value of industrial goods exported to the  US in 1991. The offer would help reduce the tariff on 37.6  billion baht in imports from the US, or 43.4 percent of the  total in 1991.    He said Thailand also agreed not to collect specific tariff  rates more than ad valorem rates, to cut taxes more in five  categories for the US and Canada, and to try to conclude the  negotiations with the two countries at the market-access talks  of the Uruguay Round.    Several countries have protested against Thailand's  tariff-cut offer. Thailand added specific tariff rates to its  list submitted last December 15 and on February 15, while only  ad valorem rates had been put on its list submitted in March and  December 1992.    There are considerable differences between these two rates.  Thailand's proposed deductions are considered invaluable because  the country will get more protection and higher net import  limits, so it agreed not to collect more specific tariff rates  than ad valorem ones.    The US and New Zealand were the major GATT members that  complained about the Thai offer of specific tariff rates. For  example, the 50,250 kilogrammes of Kiwi fruit worth 3.9 million  baht that was imported by Thailand in 1993 would have been  charged 1.17 million baht in tariffs if based on the ad valorem  rate of 25 percent. But the tariffs would have totalled 1.25  million baht if based on the specific tariff rate of 25 baht a  kg.</p>

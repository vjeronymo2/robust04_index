			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Minor stakes I AM forming a small limited company with a friend. We wish to issue some of the shares to our minor children. Is this possible without unusual formality? We wish to avoid complicated and expensive legal procedures. There is no restriction on minors owning shares in a limited company: you can issue shares to the children in the normal way. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

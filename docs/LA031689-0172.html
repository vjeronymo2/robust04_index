			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARA STALKS A STATE BASKETBALL TITLE  </P> <P> Most of the following information on Cardinal Newman High of Santa Rosa will be  new to Coach Lou Cvijanovich and his Santa Clara boys' basketball team.  </P> <P> Santa Clara faces Cardinal Newman for the State Division IV championship Friday  night at 7:30 at Ventura College. But that does not mean Santa Clara is  spending the week studying film and researching the tendencies of its opponent.  </P> <P> "I don't believe in scouting by video, especially having players watch it,"  Cvijanovich said. "We'll concern ourselves with ourselves and not our  opponent."  </P> <P> That should not be surprising to those familiar with Cvijanovich, 62, and his  ambivalence for technology. This is a coach who says he would like "every  television set blown up."  </P> <P> What is surprising is that Tom Bonfigli, the 35-year-old coach at Cardinal  Newman, also prepares the old-fashioned way.  </P> <P> "We won't watch any video and nobody scouted Santa Clara for us," said  Bonfigli, who is in his eighth season. "I've just talked to a lot of coaches  about them."  </P> <P> He also could observe his own team in practice to get a feeling for Santa  Clara's style. The teams are mirror images of one another.  </P> <P> Both are heavy on man-to-man defense, depth and discipline. Both are light on  forcing the fast-break or outside shots. And both are accustomed to enjoying a  height advantage that will be neutralized Friday.  </P> <P> "We like to play man defense, so do they," notes Bonfigli, who coached with  Cvijanovich at a camp a few years ago. "We are kind of deliberate, so are  they."  </P> <P> Cardinal Newman (31-3), which qualified for the state playoffs as runner-up in  the North Coast Section, works the ball inside to one of three starters who  stand at least 6-foot-5.  </P> <P> Center Michael Hostetter (6-6) averages 18.2 points and 10.4 rebounds.  Hostetter, a senior, scored 29 points in Cardinal Newman's 62-57 victory over  Archbishop Mitty of San Jose for the Northern California championship. "He  plays well in big games," Bonfigli said.  </P> <P> Santa Clara answers with 6-7 Bubba Burrage, a big-game player in his own right.  Burrage, a senior who averages 18.6 points and 11.1 rebounds, scored a  game-high 19 points in the Saints' 78-55 win over Washington of Easton for the  Southern California title.  </P> <P> Cardinal Newman senior forwards Tom Wellborn (6-6) and Jake Johnson (6-5) are  powerfully built players in the mold of Santa Clara forwards John McGill (6-5)  and Foster Cole (6-4). Johnson averages 10 points and 10 rebounds.  </P> <P> Santa Clara is led on offense by Shon Tarver, a 6-5 left-hander with a great  touch. Tarver, a junior forward, averages 23 points and has shot well over 50%  in the playoffs.  </P> <P> Cardinal Newman's best outside shooter is 6-4 guard Sheridan Silver, who  averages 13.6 points and will let fly from behind the three-point line. The  fifth starter is 5-10 point guard Ryan Vice. Brad Monahan, a 6-6, 230-pound  forward, is the top reserve.  </P> <P> "We are deeper than they are," Bonfigli said. "I play nine guys every game  pretty equally."  </P> <P> Santa Clara has stayed with its starting five and Cole recently after  exhibiting great depth during the regular season. Seniors Bill Lajoie and Leon  Palmisano are capable backups for starting guards Art Santana and Kasha  Clemons.  </P> <P> A distinct Santa Clara advantage throughout the playoffs has been the superior  physical strength of its players. Santana and Clemons look more like bodyguards  than basketball guards, and their enormous arms and chests are a tribute to a  rigorous weight-lifting program.  </P> <P> Bonfigli, as well, puts his players through year-round weight lifting.  </P> <P> If Santa Clara has an edge, it probably comes from what amounts to a home-court  advantage. "I know we're playing an exceptional team and they have the  advantage of playing at home," Bonfigli said. "It should be at more of a  neutral site, but I don't gripe about things like that."  </P> <P> "Lou has one of the great programs in the state of California. I respect him as  a foe and a great coach, there's nothing wrong with that. But there is no fear  with the respect. We are coming to Ventura for a purpose."  </P></p>

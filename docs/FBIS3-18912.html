			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Pronk Wants More Aid To Bypass </F> Surinamese Cabinet"]    [Text] Amsterdam -- Minister of Development Cooperation  Pronk wants the development treaty between the Netherlands and  Suriname to be changed. The continuing bad policies of the  Surinamese Government are the cause of the country's deplorable  state, the minister said on Sunday [6 March] on the "Meer op  Zondag" NOS [Netherlands Broadcasting Foundation] television  program.    The time has come to review the entire development  relationship with Suriname, Pronk said. Aid should be directed  to a far greater degree toward combating poverty via private  organizations, he said.    Direct support to the Surinamese Government has proved  ineffective, Pronk said in a frank examination of Surinamese  politics. He said he was aware that there were still  innumerable politicians and civil servants with good will in the  country, "but they simply cannot get through."    The development relationship which Pronk wants would bypass  the Surinamese Government for a large part of the aid, the  minister said. However, the current development treaty between  the Netherlands and Suriname does not allow that. The minister  wants to spend part of the money to which Suriname is entitled  under the development treaty via nongovernmental organizations  (NGO's, like the Novib [Netherlands Organization for  International Development Cooperation] and its foreign partners).    "Private organizations do not carry out the most work,"  Pronk  said. "But they do the best work when it comes to combating  poverty, providing health care, organizing activities for women,  etc."    "When we drew up the development treaty we said: You have  many good groups who could do this work," Pronk said. "But it  was pulled into the political field. The organization's  political and ethnic background was examined, and that means  sometimes waiting for years. That is not necessary, because in  Suriname there is a structure which is separate from politics."    Very recently the minister was far more positive about the  resumption of aid to the Surinamese Government. Last November  Pronk visited Paramaribo to discuss the matter with the  Venetiaan government. The talks took place "in such an open and  constructive atmosphere that I am optimistic about the  possibility of finding a solution in the foreseeable future," he  told Parliament three months ago.    Pronk made it clear on Sunday that he no longer feels such  optimism. "Suriname had a fantastic opportunity, but has made  little of it," he said. "There has been a democratic regime for  a substantial number of years now, there is a lot of support,  but there are bad policies."    Suriname could receive more emergency aid if the government  carried out reform policies, Pronk repeated. "People know that,  but nothing ever comes of it," he said. "Every time there is a  new reason to not begin proper policies."    The minister now regards the poverty problem in Suriname  partly as a problem of distribution in Suriname itself.  "Enormous wealth has grown up in parts of the population due to  corruption and drug dealing," he said. "People do not want to  abandon such self-interest."</p>

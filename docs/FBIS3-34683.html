			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad -- Over the next few days, the al-Rashid and  al-Rafidayn Banks will begin pumping dollars into the market to  create a balance between supply and demand, to lower the price  of the dollar against the Iraqi dinar, and to effect stable food  prices. A responsible source told AL-JUMHURIYAH that the coming  phase will witness further measures to bolster the value of the  Iraqi dinar in the market and ensure that the speculators and  parasites who have caused the rise in the dollar exchange rates  are wiped out.    The source said that citizens are allowed to own dollars  provided the buying and selling of dollars is confined to money  changing offices and the al-Rashid and al-Rafidayn Banks in  order to facilitate the process of money changing and protect  the citizens against speculators. He noted that the State has  allowed citizens to bring in any amount of foreign currency and  that it has given them the opportunity to buy it from, or sell  it to, designated parties, or, alternatively, it has given them  the chance to invest it in the country.    The banking source said that the dollar exchange rate has  nothing to do with Western media lies and rumors, which are  circulated by the mean speculators in the local markets.    Yesterday, the dollar exchange rate was fixed at companies  authorized to sell or buy currencies and at the branches of the  al- Rashid and al-Rafidayn Banks. Al-Rashid Bank has designated  six branches in Baghdad and the governorates to buy and sell  foreign currency in accordance with the exchange rate and as of  5 February. These branches are: al-Shurjah, Jamilah, al-Sa'dun,  and al-Mansur central market, as well as in the Ninawa and  al-Basrah Governorates.    The Central Bank has also authorized al-Rafidayn Bank  branches in al-Harithiyah, Karradat Mariyam, and al-Kifah, and  its main branch, as well as the Bank's branches in al-Basrah and  Ninawa to begin the buying and selling operation as of 5  February.</p>

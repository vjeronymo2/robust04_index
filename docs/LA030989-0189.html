			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POULTRY PRICES RISE IN WAKE OF STORMS IN NATION'S MIDSECTION  </P> <P> Consumers may pay at least 5 cents a pound more for poultry over the next two  months because winter storms earlier this week left millions of birds dead and  hundreds of chicken barns destroyed in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.  </P> <P> Wholesale prices for chickens went up 5 cents a pound Wednesday and should be  reflected in supermarket prices in two to four weeks.  </P> <P> "The price increases will be felt nationwide," said Bill Roenigk, economist for  the National Broiler Council in Washington. "There is generally always an  overreaction to weather in the market. The question is where do we go from  here."  </P> <P> The storms last Sunday and Monday dumped ice and then wet, heavy snow on a  broad area of the nation's midsection from Oklahoma to central Illinois. The  weight of the ice and snow collapsed the roofs of more than 600 of the  country's 40,000 broiler houses and left between 5 million and 6 million birds  dead.  </P> <P> Broilers are the whole and cut-up chickens consumers buy at supermarket  counters and as fast food in carryout restaurants. Several of the collapsed  barns also housed hens that lay breeding eggs used to raise broilers.  </P> <P> "What we're facing is not only a disruption in the actual number of birds going  to market," Roenigk said, "but because breeder hens have been lost, we're also  going to be losing some hatching eggs, and they have been in tight supply even  before this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Cost Millions  </P> <P> The storms are expected to bring the average retail price of chickens up to  about 85 cents a pound.  </P> <P> "We're talking about tens of millions of dollars, whether that is $30 million  or twice that number remains to be seen," said Roenigk.  </P> <P> Arkansas, the nation's No. 1 poultry producing state, bore the brunt of the  storms with losses that may exceed $35 million in buildings and birds, said  Susan Whitacre, spokeswoman for Gov. Bill Clinton. At least 280 poultry barns  were collapsed in four counties where the state is now seeking federal disaster  aid.  </P> <P> "It's pretty devastating," said Robert Moorman, a Sulphur Springs, Ark., farmer  who grows chickens for Tyson Foods Inc., a major poultry packager. "It looks  like a disaster. There are chickens just everywhere. We're trying to catch them  and put them in other houses.  </P> <P> "My chickens are 6 weeks old and would go to market in two weeks, but they  (Tyson) can't get here to pick them up because of the road conditions. The  chickens have had no feed or water since Sunday. I don't know how many are  going to live. There are maybe 10,000 to 12,000 chickens (on the farm). I've  lost probably 3,000 to 4,000, but that is a drop in the bucket compared to my  friends."  </P> <P> In Oklahoma, state officials are seeking disaster declarations in at least 16  counties.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Surplus Reported  </P> <P> California, the nation's leading egg producer, was unaffected by the storms. If  anything, the state's poultry producers, led by Foster Farms, Zacky Farms and  Louis Rich, will benefit from the temporarily higher prices caused by the  storm-shortened supplies of broilers, observed a spokesman for the agricultural  marketing service in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Roenigk said the storms will not affect the price of table eggs -- in  particular demand before Easter -- because there was a surplus of them before  the bad weather hit.  </P> <P> Researcher Rhona Schwartz in Houston and staff writer Bruce Keppel in Los  Angeles contributed to this article.  </P></p>

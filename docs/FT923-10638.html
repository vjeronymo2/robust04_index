			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Observer: Unsuitable Red faces in Cleveland. When lawyers for the families of the victims of the air-crash at La Guardia in March slapped in a claim for Dollars 80m in damages, they duly cited all companies involved. There was USAir, which flew the airliner; Fokker, which made it; Dow Chemical, which supplied the de-icer used before the fatal take-off attempt; and Rolls-Royce, whose engines powered the jet. Alas, some legal whizz in Ohio thought Rolls-Royce meant fancy motor cars, so the lawsuit named 'Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Inc' as a defendant. But the car business has long been owned by Vickers, and the aerospace engine manufacturer is a separate quoted company. 'We don't know why the car company is cited - perhaps it's the Vickers connection,' purred an airy and disingenuous spokesman for the 'right' Rolls in London. 'The suit's being refiled,' said a spokesman for the Cleveland law firm, not a little embarrassed.</p>

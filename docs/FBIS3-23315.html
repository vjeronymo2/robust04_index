			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Wiesbaden/Karlsruhe (DPA) -- The Office of the  Federal Public Prosecutor has rejected the view of members of  the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV]  that the terrorist Red Army Faction (RAF) has ceased to exist in  its former form and as a single entity. The RAF has not given  up its armed struggle, Rolf Hannich, deputy spokesman for the  Office of the Federal Public Prosecutor said on Monday in an  interview with DPA. At the same time, he warned against assuming  that the RAF no longer constitutes a terrorist threat.    It is true that in late October 1993, the majority of RAF  prisoners, the so-called hard-liners around Brigitte Mohnhaupt,  left the RAF. Nevertheless, one cannot assume that the RAF has  given up its fight against the state. On the contrary, in its  last command declaration of 2 November 1993, the RAF made it  clear that it continues to be active as a terrorist group. One  must assume that, despite the arrest in Bad Kleinen, the RAF  remains capable of taking action, Hannich said. Hence, attacks  have to be expected from the RAF command level in the future,  too.    Hannich thus rejected an assessment by the Bavarian Office  for the Protection of the Constitution that the RAF had ceased  to exist as a single entity. [passage omitted]</p>

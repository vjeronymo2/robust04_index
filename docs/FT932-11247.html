			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Sturge closes eight Lloyd's syndicates STURGE HOLDINGS, the biggest group of Lloyd's agencies, yesterday surprised the London insurance market by closing eight syndicates - including two of the market's largest - and dismissing 40 staff. The closures are part of a rationalisation geared to improve efficiency, strengthen management and attract fresh capital - including corporate investors - to Sturge's remaining 15 syndicates. They follow the announcement last week by Lloyd's of its new business plan, which aims to guide the market back to profitability. 'We have carried out an effective cull and tied our thinking in with the business plan,' said Mr Terry Hayday, chief executive. The group, which is chaired by the former Lloyd's chairman, Mr David Coleridge, announced the resignation of its finance director, Mr Peter Davis, earlier this year and has now sacked 170 of its 1,320 staff since September. The closure has caused consternation among brokers who suggested the market's capacity to accept business could be adversely affected since both syndicates 206 and 210 were regarded as leaders in marine and United States non-marine business respectively, often accepting large individual risks on their own account. 'It is terrifying that a group of that size could do something so radical,' said one London broker. 'Capacity will be tight all round.' Mr Hayday said that each of the eight axed syndicates had performed poorly in 1990 and in some earlier years and were unlikely to be able to attract support, either from Names - the individuals whose assets currently back Lloyd's - or new corporate investors. Syndicate 206 lost Pounds 61.53m (compared with capacity of Pounds 175.8m), while syndicate 210 also faces a deficit of Pounds 68.06m (capacity of Pounds 183.97m). The six other axed syndicates also incurred losses in 1990: they are 203, 209, 428, 212, 782, and 950. The losses reflected poor trading conditions generally although syndicate 782's losses reflected Pounds 3.4m in claims from a scheme to compensate local authorities for employing supply teachers to cover for sick colleagues. Mr Hayday said he hoped to stem the decline in the agency's capacity to its present level of Pounds 725m by attracting fresh corporate capital.</p>

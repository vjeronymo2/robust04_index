That is because the  political situation in Russia has become unstable due to the  ultranationalists' victory in the Russian parliamentary  election. In addition, it is inevitable that the president's  "reform line" will face a difficult situation in wake of the  resignation by Yegor Gaydar, first deputy prime minister, who is  in charge of President Yeltsin's economic policies. A top  Foreign Ministry official disclosed the prospect that the first  meeting of a working group for a peace treaty will be delayed  from its originally scheduled January date to sometime in  February. Formation of the working group was agreed upon during  a meeting between Hosokawa and Yeltsin last October.  Consequently, it appears unlikely that Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata will visit Moscow in the first half of the year as planned.  The visit was partly intended to lay the groundwork for Prime  Minister Hosokawa's trip to Moscow in the future.    Following Russia-U.S. summit talks, Hata and his  counterparts  from the seven major developed countries (G-7) announced on 14  January a plan to continue supporting the Russian economy.  However, while it is difficult to improve the northern  territorial issue, some government officials are beginning to  say that the "atmosphere of the G-7 is quite different from that  of last spring, and they are tired of giving financial aid to  Russia," (according to a Foreign Ministry source). It is  expected that some countries may start to call for a review of  their aid to Russia.    Among other things, President Yeltsin, when he visited Japan  last October, apologized to people detained in Siberia and  admitted to the validity of various documents signed between  Japan and the Soviet Union, including the 1956 Japan-USSR Joint  Declaration. He displayed a diplomacy that could be called the  first step toward establishing "normal relations," (according to  a senior Foreign Ministry official). Immediately after the  visit, however, it was revealed that Russia had been dumping  radioactive waste materials into the Sea of Japan. Although the  Japanese Government is trying, in a positive manner, to prevent  waste dumping from happening again, many government officials  are saying: "Fundamentally, this is an issue Russia has to  solve by itself."    A factor that is making Russo-Japanese relations more  unstable is the victory of the Liberal Democratic Party, led by  extreme nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Regarding the  territorial issue, the Japanese Government explained its stance  of ignoring Zhirinovskiy's remarks, who said that "the territory  will never be returned to Japan." But, the internal condition  of the government is not calm. Some Foreign Ministry officials  are beginning to think that "President Yeltsin may try to delay  settlement of the territorial issue by taking advantage of  Zhirinovskiy's remarks and behavior."</p>

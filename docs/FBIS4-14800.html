In reply, Sherimkulov expressed thanks for the meeting held  in a warm (?atmosphere), and stressed that visits to Baku and  Yerevan will give the members of the CIS Interparliamentary  Assembly delegation the opportunity to gather in-depth  information on the situation first-hand, and find various  mutually-acceptable views for the solution of the Karabakh  problem, which the peace mission has expressly come to examine.

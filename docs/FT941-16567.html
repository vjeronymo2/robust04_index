			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Clinton calls for unity of east and west Europe: President says US depends on the security of a democratic continent Mr Bill Clinton opened his first presidential visit to Europe with a powerful call for integration of the continent, east and west, as part of a renewed partnership with the US. At least 100,000 US troops, he said, would remain in Europe 'not out of habit' but because the commitment was 'justified'. Proclaiming a 'new day for our transatlantic partnership' in a speech at Brussels town hall, the president declared that the US depended on the security of a free and democratic Europe. Mr Clinton said that the 'new security' would rest on three pillars - military strength, to be discussed at the Nato summit beginning today; economic security (Mr Clinton also announced that the long-delayed 'jobs summit' would be held in March); and the growth of democracy, which could prove effective in preventing another Bosnia. Mr Clinton commended to European attention the US Partnership for Peace proposals, to be endorsed at the Nato summit which would allow eastern European states gradually to strengthen their links with Nato. Alluding to fears aroused by the rise of Russian nationalism, Mr Clinton maintained it would be wrong 'to draw a new line between east and west that could create a self-fulfilling prophecy of future confrontation'. While 'the statements of some Russian political figures have given us all genuine cause for concern', the 'staggering' recent developments in Russia had to be kept in perspective. 'Our road to Europe's integration will be wider, smoother and safer' if Russia could be helped to evolve into 'a market democracy at peace with its neighbours', he said. It was vital that what might prove to be a 'fleeting' opportunity to bring the former Soviet bloc on should board not be missed, he said. Integration might prove 'gradual and often difficult', as Germany's experience had shown, but 'the Iron Curtain must not be replaced by a veil of indifference'. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, echoed Mr Clinton's theme yesterday, saying fears of a new 'threat from the east' would be dispelled by a strategy of partnership with the democratic forces in Russia, in spite of the success of the ultra-nationalist and communist parties in last month's elections. In particular, Mr Clinton urged western Europe to open its economic doors to the east. The success of eastern Europe 'will ultimately depend more on trade than aid', given the shortage of money in western government coffers. This meant continuing to reduce barriers to trade and investment, a message he will reinforce at a session with European Union leaders tomorrow. He is due to travel on to Prague, Moscow, Minsk and Geneva but that itinerary could change should a satisfactory agreement be reached over the dismantling of the nearly 1,800 former Soviet nuclear missiles based in Ukraine. A senior US official last night said 'a great deal of progress' had been made in negotiations involving Ukraine and Russia to resolve the question of the warheads. But he refused to speculate on whether Mr Clinton would fit in a meeting with Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk to initial any agreement, which would still be subject to ratification by the parliament in Kiev. A US offer to buy up to 500 tons of uranium extracted from Russian and Ukrainian missiles remains on the table.

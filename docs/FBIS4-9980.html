			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 5 Par (EFE) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister  Celso Amorim said here on 5 April that Brazil prefers dialogue  to the imposition of sanctions on the DPRK because of its  alleged nuclearization for military purposes.    The minister thus replied to a question asked by an EFE  journalist on a request that U.S. officials made today in  Brazil, asking this country to cooperate with an eventual  imposition of sanctions on the DPRK if it refuses to engage in  dialogue and does not follow the UN recommendations in this  regard.    Amorim explained that developing nuclear weapons is not  favorable to the DPRK's interest, but demanded prudence on the  subject, noting that this would give more credibility to the  United Nations, and adding that the Chinese position on the  subject is "very constructive."    In response to another question asked by the EFE reporter on  Beijing's opinion on the expansion of the UN Security Council,  and -- in a such case -- about the possibility of Brazil  occupying one of the new positions as a standing council member,  Amorim replied that China and his country have several  similarities on the subject.    Brazilian authorities, Amorim explained, believe that an  expanded Security Council will have more legitimacy, will  prevent the expansion of the imbalance between developed and  developing countries, and will make Security Council action more  efficient. He noted that the Chinese position "is very similar,"  although he gave no details of it.    Brazil and the PRC act jointly in the United Nations to  preserve world peace, the chief of Brazilian diplomacy said.  This, he said, falls within the framework of "strategic  relations" that the two countries maintain.    The largest Latin American country seeks to reinforce its  presence in Asia, with whom it maintains -- except for the  Middle East oil-producing countries -- 16 percent of its trade.  This is why on 2 April Amorim held a working meeting with 24  Brazilian ambassadors accredited to this continent, including to  the Russian Federation.    Brazil, which is under the supervision of the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), recently ratified a nuclear  cooperation agreement for peaceful purposes with Argentina and  is willing to broaden this cooperation to the PRC, Amorim said.    Brazil also is willing to sign without conditions the  agreement on the control of medium-range missiles (MCR) [acronym  as received] because, according to Amorim, it will allow a  greater possibility of cooperation in the field of space  research with countries like the PRC, whose "Long March" rockets  will place two Brazilian natural resources monitoring satellites  in orbit by 1996.    The Brazilian foreign minister announced that his Angolan  counterpart will visit Brazil to discuss the situation in his  country, and he asked the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola (UNITA) for "the necessary flexibility"  to reestablish peace in Angola.</p>

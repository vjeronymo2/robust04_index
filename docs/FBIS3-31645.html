			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara Feb 21 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister  Antonin Baudys said here today he had informed Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec he was preparing his own personal initiative to  solve the Bosnia conflict and about its main features.    "It is undeniable truth that during a joint luncheon on  Friday [18 February] I informed Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec  that I had drawn out my personal proposal to solve the situation  in Bosnia and I gave him rough outlines of my initiative's  contents," Baudys told a group of Czech journalists in Ankara,  where he has been on a three-day official visit since Sunday [20  February].    The Foreign Ministry today published a statement saying that  Baudys had consulted his proposal with neither the foreign  minister nor the government and that the Foreign Ministry had  learnt about it from its foreign partners.    Baudys said that after hearing the information, Zieleniec  said that "if he is asked, he will reply that he had not been  consulted on the matter."    Nevertheless, he tried to reach Baudys in the morning on  Saturday [19 February] because he had found out that the  initiative had already been dealt with by visiting Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.    "Kozyrev probably got a copy of my plan from the Russian  Embassy in Prague, to which I also sent the document," Baudys  said.    He stressed that in reaction to Zieleniec's effort to reach  him he personally delivered the complete text of his proposal to  the Foreign Ministry. "It is true it was in English, but the on  the other hand, the Foreign Ministry had the document as early  as Saturday's morning," Baudys added.    Some members of the Czech delegation in Ankara said the  "almost hysterical" reaction by Czech political circles had  harmed his position in talks with Turkish officials.    Baudys's initiative was received quite favourably by Turkish  Defence Minister Mehmet Golhan on Sunday, the day of the Czech  delegation's arrival in Ankara, but on Monday [21 February]  Turkey's stance palpably changed and at the start of the  official talks, Golhan rejected the initiative diplomatically,  but unequivocally.    This happened in spite of the fact that Golhan was  acquainted  with the initiative as early as Sunday, as he himself said,  because he got it via the Turkish Embassy in Prague.    According to information from the Czech delegation, it  cannot  be ruled out that Baudys's reception by Turkish Prime Minister  Tansu Ciller and Foreign Minister Himket Cetin planned on  Tuesday [22 February] will be cancelled. The possible excuse  would be lack of time due to a government session and  preparations for local elections.    According to the same sources, Baudys's initiative was  accepted during his talks at the U.S. diplomatic mission in  Ankara and "it is not ruled out" allegedly that U.S.  high-ranking officials will appreciate it.</p>

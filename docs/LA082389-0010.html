			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY'S MAJOR TASK  </P> <P> Grumblings from Poland's Communist Party in recent days have sounded somewhat  ominous. All the same, they are less threats to Solidarity's new position than  sour grapes over the party's loss of position. The grumblings actually  emphasize the fact that, in the course of a few weeks, Solidarity has become  Poland's only political force with a mandate broad enough to lead a government.  The party, therefore, "should stop rocking the boat," Solidarity leader Lech  Walesa scolded Tuesday, "and start doing its job." Their job, it seems, is to  sit quietly in the back of the boat while Solidarity tries to chart a new  course for the troubled country.  </P> <P> This is no easy task, as Poles themselves recognize. Solidarity faces two sets  of challenges, one technical, one social. The technical challenge is to  adequately feed and clothe Poland's deprived population. Weighed down by a  rotting infrastructure, little capital and $39 billion in foreign debt,  Poland's economic difficulties are deepening. Western experts point out that  solutions will require further cuts in wages and living standards.  </P> <P> This is bound to precipitate a dilemma for Solidarity which, like other unions,  tends to protect workers' wages and benefits at all costs. Cutting back on real  income, whether through wage cuts, inflation or price reform, will be the most  unpalatable aspect of the coming economic reforms. Anticipating this problem,  Poland's newly designated Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said Monday that  "if we have to make a choice between efficiency and the interests which the  union upholds, then we will refer to public opinion." But, he added, "if  sacrifices are necessary, then people must accept them."  </P> <P> The social challenge, consequently, is how to manage public discontent during  this period of austerity. "We need bread, not a prime minister," a young Pole  hollered at Mazowiecki during his first speech to the Polish people. Mazowiecki  agreed with the heckler, but added that history "has shown in several moments  that Poles can strive for new solutions, unusual and innovative ones. I hope  that such a psychological moment is arriving now, that people will feel that  there is a situation in which our future depends on us." In other words, the  best thing going for Poland is her people's very hope for the future.  </P> <P> But hope could backfire on Solidarity. If hopes rise faster than realities, if  expectations increase without any sign that they will be realized, observers  fear that Solidarity will lose its social support. And that might spell the end  of Poland's first popularly installed government since World War II.  </P> <P> So while Solidarity is trying to find the right mixture of austerity and  incentive, of hope and hardship, the United States must do all it possibly can  to help out. President Bush promised a package of $100 million in aid and  economic programs when he visited Poland in July. There were budget constraints  then and there are budget questions now, but nonetheless the government must do  what it can to give more. Aid cannot fix the economy, of course, but it can  help ease the austerity. Domestic instability, which is more or less certain in  the months to come, should not be cause for alarm in the Adminstration; after  all, instability is the birthing pain of history. This is a historic time for  Poland and for Europe. The least the United States can do is play its part.  </P></p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / PM probed on NHS chief's Bupa job The government yesterday faced demands to explain whether the prime minister's approval had been given for Sir Duncan Nichol, former National Health Service chief executive, to join the private health sector. Sir Duncan - who left the NHS in March - is to become a board member at Bupa, Britain's biggest private healthcare organisation, which is involved in partnerships with public-sector hospitals. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, wrote to the government asking whether the approval of Mr John Major had been sought and given for 'one of the architects of the NHS market-led changes' to join the Bupa board. He said the move appeared to be a 'blatant breach of civil service guidelines' on the employment of former senior officials. The strength and range of reactions to Sir Duncan's appointment showed the continuing power of health to explode as a political issue. Opposition MPs and health union leaders accused him of jumping ship, blurring the distinction between public and private provision, and exposing government ambitions to privatise the NHS. But the Independent Healthcare Association, which represents the private sector, congratulated Sir Duncan on taking a 'grand step towards a mixed market in healthcare'. Sir Duncan stressed that he believed the private sector could complement the NHS. The central issue, he said, was that if private hospitals attracted more work they would do so under public contracts. 'If those who spend the money choose to contract part of the money out to a service in the private sector, they retain control of it,' he said on BBC Radio. This did not in any sense undermine the NHS. Bupa already has some partnerships in place with the NHS, and is involved in discussions with up to 30 hospitals and health authorities about further possibilities. An agreement was signed in the summer with Bradford Hospitals Trust for Bupa's first big capital project in the NHS - a proposed Pounds 2m private-patient unit in the grounds of a public hospital, with the NHS receiving rent based on the unit's revenue and profit. Last month a partnership was agreed between Papworth NHS Trust and Bupa's Cambridge Lea Hospital to pioneer laser heart surgery. Mr Peter Jacobs, Bupa chief executive, said yesterday: 'There are no losers in co-operation between the public and private health sectors. It is not about privatisation.' He hoped Sir Duncan's arrival at Bupa would help demonstrate the value of the two sectors working together. 'But there is a need for a culture change in parts of the NHS - some people do not like the idea of NHS money being spent outside the public system.'</p>

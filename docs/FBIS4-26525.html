			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai will build  the country's largest container-shipping base in co-operation  with a Hong Kong company.    Shanghai is China's largest port and its container shipping  operations have boomed in recent years.    The port handled a record 937,000 standard containers last  year, and the number of containers it handled in the first five  months of this year was up 40 percent over the same period of  last year.    To meet the needs of the rapid development of container  transport, the Shanghai Port Comprehensive Container Development  Corporation is co-operating with Orient Overseas (Holdings) Ltd  of Hong Kong to develop a 260,000-sq-m area into a container  shipping base on the outskirts of the city.</p>

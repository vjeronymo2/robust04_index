			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government announced Friday it has decided to withdraw  unconditionally its demand on an inter-Korean envoy exchange as  a condition for Pyongyang to hold further high-level talks with  Washington.    The decision represents a major concession by South Korea  and  the United States and will likely raise the pressure on North  Korea to allow additional checks of its nuclear facilities.    The government also said it will accept all North Korean  escapees from Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia wishing to  settle here.</p>

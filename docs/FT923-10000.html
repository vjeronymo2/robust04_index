			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Property: Fifth Avenue from the waist up - A 1920s building with the latest technology FORTY-five apartments in a 1920s building with late-20th century technology are now coming on to the market at 1049 Fifth Avenue, in New York's Manhattan. The Pounds 42m venture involves international investment bank Investcorp, which has a base in London, and New York entrepreneur Jack Keller. The 23-storey building originally was a hotel. Most of the interior has been ripped out and re-designed to make apartments with three and four bedrooms. This fills a gap in the market for larger properties, says Investcorp's John Thompson in London. Unusually for the area, where most of the the apartments are co-operatives governed by management committees with rights to approve or veto buyers, the new development will be sold as condominiums. Prices of the units - each of which will have 12 telephone lines - range from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 3m. While Fifth Avenue is one of New York's most sought-after locations, potential buyers should know that No. 1049 is not actually in Fifth Avenue at all. It is about 50 feet along East 86th Street, which runs off the avenue at right angles. No. 1049 is separated from Fifth Avenue by the Yivo Institute, a low corner building. Keller tried to buy this to combine it with his re-development next door but nothing came of his approach. The institute's address was 1047/1049 Fifth Avenue, so an arrangement was made - sanctioned by the local authority - for the new building to take over part of that address. Thus, the former 86th Street hotel is now 1049 Fifth Avenue. After all, say the vendors, all its floors above the seventh look over the institute building on to Central Park - just like real Fifth Avenue buildings. The irony of the manoeuvre is that the institute building is now for sale. A London estate agency is to be appointed to handle marketing of the apartments. Meanwhile, information can be gained from Investcorp in London (071-629-6600) or New York (212-650-0066).</p>

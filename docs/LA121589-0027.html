			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : COUNTYWIDE  </P> <P> The San Diego County district attorney's office has decided to forward its  investigation into Sheriff John Duffy's unreported outside income to the state  Fair Political Practices Commission.  </P> <P> Steve Casey, a spokesman for the district attorney, said Thursday that, after  many interviews and a review of state law, his office believes the  investigation into Duffy's work as a private consultant should be conducted by  the FPPC in Sacramento.  </P> <P> In sending its case file to the state agency, Casey added, the district  attorney has made no conclusions as to whether Duffy violated any laws by not  disclosing the income he received as a consultant for private firms.  </P> <P> "The only determination made at this point is that it's appropriate for them  (the FPPC) to review it," he said. "We've talked to them about it, and they  agree. Now, it's up to them to make any conclusions."  </P> <P> The district attorney's office announced in October that it was reviewing state  laws to see whether Duffy should have included the outside income in his annual  Statement of Economic Interest forms.  </P> <P> Although Duffy had in the past claimed he lived solely on his county salary, he  later conceded working as a private consultant on law enforcement-related  projects. But he has asserted that, because the work was performed for other  government agencies, he was not required to disclose the income on his annual  forms.  </P></p>

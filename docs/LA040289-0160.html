			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRITING FOR CHANGE IN SOUTH AFRICA;  </P> <P> THE ESSENTIAL GESTURE WRITING, POLITICS AND PLACES BY NADINE GORDIMER, EDITED  AND WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY STEPHEN CLINGMAN (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 356 PP.)  </P> <P> What does literature do? What is it for? These splendid essays, selected from  25 years' worth of sharp, firm responses to the particularly grotesque and  challenging conditions for writers in South Africa, do nothing less than answer  these huge questions. But they are not bombastic utterances. Nadine Gordimer is  an unboastful, honest writer who dislikes cant. One of her mentors, cited with  respectful pleasure, is Turgenev, whose "unpretentious essays," she says, in a  phrase that can be reapplied to her own work, "make up a remarkable testament  to a writer's creed."  </P> <P> Her own creed is simple. Politically, it rests on two absolutes: "Racism is  evil"; "Art is on the side of the oppressed." (If you question the latter, ask  yourself, she says, "what writer of any literary worth defends fascism,  totalitarianism, racism?") The writer's job is twofold. He (or she, but  Gordimer, who has other things on her mind than feminism, always says he) has  to reconcile his interior, secret, imaginative world with his responsibility to  what's outside, to history. Through this reconciliation (an especially  difficult one to make in her country), writing tries to go beyond what has so  far been "allowed."  </P> <P> When Gordimer played truant from school as a child, she needed, like all  children, to be told that the world she felt so confined by was not the only  possible world, that there might be an existence she did not yet know was  "permissible." That, she insists, is what writing is for: to "explore  possibilities present but undreamt of in the living of a single life," to  record "unconfessed history"; in Yeats' words, "to express a life that has  never found expression."  </P> <P> If writing's job is to permit or express the impermissible and unexpressed, it  follows that although "censorship may have to do with literature, literature  has nothing whatever to do with censorship."  </P> <P> Gordimer's life is spent where a conflict over the right of books to be read  (and written) is built into the writer's life -- as it is still in Eastern  Europe and in many other parts of the world. In the West, this conflict has  just been brought home to us in momentous and horrifying form by the  ayatollah's anathematizing of Salman Rushdie. In the earlier stages of the  Muslim vendetta against "The Satanic Verses," Rushdie had to cancel a visit to  South Africa, one of the countries where the book is now banned. Gordimer was  among those who spoke out strongly against this curtailing of a writer's  freedom. The case would be close to her heart, since it is the most extreme  version imaginable of the perpetual opposition between art and orthodoxy.  </P> <P> That opposition displays similar features in widely variant contexts, whether  these be Iranian fundamentalism, apartheid, Stalinism, anti-Semitism or the  militaristic variant of Zionism. In the context in which Gordimer writes, the  government's efforts, at once ludicrous and malevolent, to ban, raid, censor,  imprison, exile and silence writers who express alternative versions of history  to its own, can provide any of them with a South African version of Rushdie's  nightmare.  </P> <P> The essays in "The Essential Gesture" are not only about censorship. They range  widely over politics, literature, travel to other African countries and notable  individuals. But their essential subject is always the writer's responsibility.  This makes the book at once a life story and a history of South Africa. Stephen  Clingman's clear (if a little too hagiographical) commentary places the essays  in a changing context and points up their interesting connections with  Gordimer's fiction. So we move from the liberal, optimistic response to events  like the 1957 Treason Trial of Chief Luthulu and other ANC members, to the  outrage at the dark acts of the '60s, the Sharpeville killings, the banning of  the ANC and the trial and life imprisonment of the white Communist Bram  Fischer, the inspiration for "Burger's Daughter." In the '70s, with the "Soweto  Revolt," the essays record the "failure of the liberal ideal" and the changing  relations between white progressives and the Black Consciousness movement. More  recently, as in her novels, "July's People" and "A Sport of Nature," the  writing looks, not always hopefully, at the example of other post-colonial  African countries and anticipates the implications of revolution in South  Africa.  </P> <P> There is a danger for the writer in being always on the side of the angels.  Sometimes these essays, speaking of "relevance" and "commitment," edge toward  the worthily pious. Gordimer is acutely aware of the problems in "conforming to  an orthodoxy of opposition." The risk is greatest, she sees, for the black  writer, who is expected to adopt the "kit" of "reliable emotive phrases,"  partly because "agitprop" has been "the first contemporary art form that many  black South Africans feel they can call their own." But this is a dilemma for  white writers too. Gordimer knows that nothing she says in her public speeches  "will be as true as my fiction" and that fiction cannot do the job of speeches.  </P> <P> The perils of belonging too much to an ideology of resistance are set against  the problems of having nowhere to belong. In many of these essays, Gordimer  considers, realistically and penetratingly, changing relations between black  and white writers in South Africa, and the inevitable "double alienation" of a  writer such as herself, "non-European" and "non-Black." How the white writers  who stay on in South Africa are to accept their future role as the voices of an  unwanted and isolated minority is a subject that requires all her honesty and  firmness of mind. She can only hope that by continuing to say "we" of white and  black writers, she can endorse the possibility of "a single, common, indigenous  nature for art in South Africa," not a falsely imposed or fatally divided  culture.  </P> <P> It is also apparent to her that alienation is (up to a point) not a burden but  a necessity for the writer. This perception makes her an excellent observer of  countries where she is made to feel non-existent: "To be white in the streets  of Accra is to feel oneself curiously anonymous and almost invisible; one is  aware of one's unimportance, in terms of what a white face has meant and now  means to people." She records, with wonderful exactness and curiosity, scenes  from a world where the white view is irrelevant: the night-time halt of a river  boat in the Congo, gorgeous "ladies of joy" in a Brazzaville open-air cafe,  lavish erotic designs -- symbols of fertility -- on Malagasy tombs, a picnic  party of women in full Victorian dress (unchanged descendants of pre-1914  refugees from Namibia) eating porridge in the Kalahari desert. Throughout her  travels, Gordimer compares the African states (such as Ghana) that are  "dedicated to radical change in the life of the masses" and those (such as the  Ivory Coast) that have fostered a black elite and are dependent on foreign  investments. In these diagnoses of possible African developments, she takes as  her motto the messages she spots written up on buses and taxis in Ghana: "It  changes," and "Merci Dieu." These essays, too, records of a dramatically  changing history by a tolerant, flexible, adaptive mind, are sermons on that  text: "Merci Dieu, it changes."  </P></p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian mine ruling challenged NEW CREST Mining yesterday took the Australian federal government to the High Court, challenging a Cabinet decision last year to ban mining of gold, platinum and palladium at Coronation Hill in the Northern Territory, writes Emilia Tagaza in Canberra. The company, on behalf of the Coronation Hill joint venture, claimed that the government's June declaration of Coronation Hill as part of the Kakadu National Park, which closed it to all mining activities, was unlawful. New Crest's managing director, Mr John Quinn, said the joint venturers acknowledged that governments had the right to act in what they judged to be the national interest. 'However, if their action has an impact on private property rights, it is only fair that the owners be compensated for the full value of that property.' The other members of the joint venture are Plutonic Resources, an associate of Malaysia Mining Corporation, and Norgold.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Breaking up is hard to do: Imperial Chemical Industries will this week decide whether it should split itself into two companies. Tony Jackson and Paul Abrahams examine the implications On Wednesday, the 14 directors of Imperial Chemical Industries assemble for the most important board meeting in the company's 67-year history. The topic on the agenda is simple but momentous: whether the most distinguished survivor of Britain's industrial past should split itself in two. As they take their seats in the wood-panelled boardroom overlooking the River Thames, the directors can be in little doubt about the outcome. In the seven months since the plan was made public, the world recession has got steadily deeper and the trading outlook grimmer. But however unlucky the timing, ICI has invested too much effort and credit in the venture to pull out. The idea is that ICI should be carved into two separate companies: Zeneca, which will comprise pharmaceuticals and other high-tech products, and a new ICI, made up of bulk commodity chemicals. The plan has the formidable backing of ICI's chairman, Sir Denys Henderson, and the equally redoubtable Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating officer. It also involves raising about Pounds 1bn of new money from the stock market. It is, according to one of the non-executive directors, '99 per cent certain' to go through. Both the new companies face a rough ride; rougher, indeed, than could have been foreseen when the plan was revealed last July. The European bulk chemical market is in worse shape, according to some industry executives, than at any time since the second world war. The plan envisages floating the new ICI with a much reduced burden of debt. Even so, at least one board member has expressed doubts on whether it would make enough profit in its first year of operation to maintain its share of the dividend. Zeneca's problem is slightly different. Its industry is largely recession-proof. But like all international drug companies, it depends heavily on the US market. The US patent of its biggest product, the heart drug Tenormin, expired last year. US sales have since halved. Zeneca has no big product to take its place, at least for the next two or three years. It is central to the demerger plan that Zeneca should raise about Pounds 1bn through a rights issue. This raises another problem. The newly-elected Clinton administration has asserted its determination to slash healthcare costs. The share prices of US and UK drug companies have tumbled as a result. Shares in Glaxo, the biggest UK drug company, have fallen by 17 per cent since the turn of the year. Yet Glaxo has just reported a 16 per cent rise in profits. Zeneca's profits for 1992 are widely expected to fall. Pharmaceuticals aside, the rest of Zeneca's portfolio - consisting of agrochemicals and speciality chemicals - is not in very good shape either. The threat to European Community and US farmers posed by the Gatt round and the reduction of farm subsidies is also a threat to the agrochemical industry. In the UK, Germany and France the market fell on average by some 8 per cent last year. This year it may well fall further. As for the speciality chemicals division, it made a mere Pounds 35m of profits in 1991 on sales of Pounds 1.2bn. Profits this year are expected to be lower. As a drug company, Zeneca is not among the industry's most attractive. As a hybrid, it is less attractive again. Given all the drawbacks, ICI's apparent determination to press ahead might seem perverse. The counter-argument is that all these difficulties are essentially temporary. The plan is designed for the longest possible term. Nothing has changed in its underlying logic. The chief argument for demerger, as expressed by Sir Denys and Mr Hampel last July, is that it allows both parts of the business to concentrate on what they do best. Some ICI directors argue that the business as it stands is too complex and far-reaching to be understood by any one person. In practical terms, there is no connection between the breeding of pest-resistant crops at one extreme and the operation of giant petrochemical complexes at the other. In addition, Zeneca's drug business is by general consent not big enough to stand alone in world terms. Freed from entanglement with the rest of ICI, it could start to plan mergers or joint ventures of a kind which have become commonplace in the world drug industry in recent years. This is one reason for the planned Pounds 1bn rights issue. The other is that Zeneca can then afford to take on most of the debt of the old ICI, leaving new ICI to face the more volatile world of commodity chemicals with a clean balance sheet. There is another important motive for pressing on. In the months since the plan was announced, the demerger has already gone ahead internally. This has involved considerable upheaval, and is a source of occasional complaint among ICI's middle managers. Indeed, it is suggested by competitors that ICI has sometimes been too preoccupied with internal change to address itself fully to its markets. Faced with those arguments, the board can scarcely shelve the whole idea. To do so would be to admit that the plan was misconceived at the outset. It would also make it impossible to implement in anything like the same form in future. On the other hand, as the directors debate the arguments round the boardroom table on Wednesday, they will doubtless reflect that their choice need not be quite so clear cut. They could postpone the demerger on the grounds of recession. They could press on with the demerger, but postpone the rights issue until the market for drug stocks has recovered. More daringly, City analysts suggest, they could announce a rights issue not for Zeneca but for ICI in its present form. They could then demerge at leisure. The last option is not as fanciful as it sounds. It would certainly involve a public change of tack: in its statement of July 1, ICI specified that any rights issue would be held by Zeneca, or ICI Bio as it was then known. But the attraction lies in the fact that while drug stocks are out of fashion on the stock market, shares in supposedly cyclical companies such as ICI are decidedly in vogue. Hence the curious fact that at Friday's closing price of Pounds 11.18 per share, ICI's shares stand at a multiple of some 22 times last year's earnings. In today's market, Zeneca could only expect an earnings multiple of little more than half that. And the higher the multiple, the more cash can be raised for a given number of shares. The original logic, that money raised through the drug side could be obtained more cheaply, has thus been stood on its head. It is also becoming apparent that something more novel than an old-fashioned rights issue is on the cards. ICI has made plain to its advisers that the London institutions must be offered first refusal of the new shares in the traditional way, if only because of their support against the predatory manoeuvres of Lord Hanson a couple of years ago. It is also adamant that the issue must be conventionally underwritten in London, so that receipt of the Pounds 1bn is guaranteed in advance. But it also wants to tap the resources of new shareholders, particularly in the US. How these conflicting goals are to be reconciled is not yet clear. But to an extent, these minutiae can be left to Warburg and ICI's other financial advisers. The central decision to be weighed by the directors is of quite a different order: whether to call a halt to ICI's remarkable history and culture, and start afresh. They might perhaps take courage from a historical analogy. The formation of ICI in 1926 was Britain's response to the merger of the German chemical industry into one gigantic conglomerate, IG Farben. At the end of the second world war, IG Farben was broken up by the victorious allies into its original constituents: Hoechst, Bayer and BASF. All three went on to become world-class chemical companies, at least as big as ICI itself. If ICI could perform the same trick by splitting itself in two, it would be a satisfying act of historical revenge.  -----------------------------------------------------            ICI: THE CASE FOR DEMERGER  ----------------------------------------------------- Against  ----------------------------------------------------- 1.

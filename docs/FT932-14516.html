			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Appreciating Japan's soaring exchange rate problem THE POLITICAL economy of the yen-dollar exchange rate remains mystifying, as the events of the past week demonstrate. Surely, with the US increasingly hot under the collar over Japan's rising trade surplus, the surge in the yen to record levels against the dollar ought to be a cause for celebration in Tokyo? Nothing could be further from the truth. Disapproving noises about the yen's rise have been seeping out in recent months from the Ministry for International Trade and Industry, the Liberal Democratic party and, recently, from Bank of Japan governor Yasushi Mieno. Yesterday finance minister Yoshiro Hayashi joined the chorus, declaring that the appreciation had been too speculative and was having 'a negative effect on the economy'. It is easy to see why Miti is worried. Japanese companies are troubled by weak domestic demand and squeezed profit margins. The appreciating exchange rate, already 10 per cent higher against the dollar since the beginning of this year, compounds these domestic difficulties by undermining companies' ability to divert production abroad. With 60 per cent of export contracts denominated in dollars, a stronger yen raises the dollar price of Japanese exports in foreign markets while reducing the yen prices of foreign imports into Japan. The Economic Planning Agency calculates that each 10 per cent yen rise cuts half a percentage point from Japanese gross national product. Harder to understand are the concerns of the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan. Economically, an appreciating currency is the inevitable counterpart to Japan's growing trade surplus, needed in order to persuade investors to provide the capital outflow to balance the trade surplus. Politically, a higher yen ought to ease tension by meeting the US administration's demands for tangible steps to reduce the trade surplus. Financially, a stronger currency is a good way to keep a lid on inflation by reducing import price pressures. The yen appreciation is already pleasing inflation hawks: wholesale prices fell by 0.5 per cent in March, and were 2.3 per cent lower than a year ago. The problem is that the short-term effects on the trade surplus of a strong yen make the trade surplus bigger and so worsen Jaoan's international relations. The reason is the close relationship between changes in the yen-dollar exchange rate and changes in the trade surplus, as the chart taken from the Bank of Japan's latest quarterly bulletin reveals. When the yen appreciated in 1985 and 1986, the trade surplus grew too; when the yen weakened throughout 1989 and 1990, the trade surplus contracted; the rise in the yen since then has been accompanied by renewed growth in the surplus. For, while a higher exchange rate makes Japanese exports more expensive and thus should reduce volumes, it also raises the dollar value of each export unit sold. The chart breaks the change in the trade surplus into three components: the change in the volume of exports and imports, changes in the price of imports and exports, and changes in the product composition of exports and imports. Exchange-rate driven price effects tend to dwarf the volume effect, at least in the short run. While the rise in the yen between 1985 and 1987 cut export volumes and raised import volumes throughout the rest of the decade, the price effect of the yen's appreciation swamped the volume changes. Little wonder the Japanese are worried about the yen's continued rise. The rise in the dollar value of the trade surplus over the past two years is almost entirely the result of the yen's appreciation since 1990, while the latest trade figures show a monthly surplus in March of Dollars 13.8bn, 26 per cent up on the previous year. In time a stronger yen should should reduce Japan's surplus by boosting import values. But the dollar value of the surplus is likely to rise before it falls. President Clinton was right to welcome the yen's appreciation at last week's summit with Japanese prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa. But if he wants results, Mr Clinton will have to wait.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------     INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRICES AND COMPETITIVENESS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Yearly figures are shown in index form with the common base year of 1985.

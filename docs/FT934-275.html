			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Steinhardt bids Dollars 250m to control America West Mr Michael Steinhardt, the New York money manager, has offered to pay Dollars 250m to gain control of America West Airlines, the struggling Phoenix-based carrier which has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the past two and a half years. The investment, which will give Mr Steinhardt 80 per cent of America West, should be enough to allow the airline to emerge from bankruptcy procedure. Other investors, however, may make rival offers before February 10, the deadline set by a Phoenix court for the company to accept bids or propose a separate plan of its own to leave Chapter 11. This is not the first time Mr Steinhardt, who runs Steinhardt Management, a hedge fund with more than Dollars 3bn in assets, has expressed an interest in owning an airline. In 1989, he was reported to have considered taking over USAir after building up a 9 per cent stake in the carrier, although no bid transpired. His offer for America West fits into his policy of investing in troubled or bankrupt companies which he believes can be turned around. In recent years he has put money into the computer group Wang and the consumer products company Sunbeam-Oster. Steinhardt Management also speculates heavily in foreign financial markets, including currencies, and in the US equities market, often through short-selling stocks. Mr Steinhardt's bid for majority control of America West followed the withdrawal of a Dollars 150m bid from an investment group led by the Pritzker family of Chicago and the investment bank Wertheim Schroder. The Pritzker-Wertheim bid was said to have been pulled because the group could not reach an agreement with America West's chairman, Mr William Franke. The Steinhardt bid is believed to be supported by Mr Franke. Mr Steinhardt has followed in the footsteps of the Pritzker family before. Earlier this year the Pritzkers abandoned their attempt to acquire the bankrupt financial services group Integrated Resources, leaving the field open to the money manager's rival bid. America West has attracted interest from bidders because of its earnings performance. In the first three quarters of 1993 it reported profits of Dollars 26.8m.</p>

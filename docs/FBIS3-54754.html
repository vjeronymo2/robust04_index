After  discussing the situation which has developed in relations  between the newspaper and its founder, the former Council of  Ministers of the Russian Federation, the meeting adopted the  following decision:    On 23 December 1993 B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian  Federation, signed Edict No. 2277 "On the Transformation and  Reorganization of the Council of Ministers-Government of the  Russian Federation." Part four of Article 18 of the Russian  Federation Law "On the Mass Media" says that "in the event of  the abolition or reorganization of the founder -- an association  of citizens, enterprise, institution, or state organ -- the  founder's rights and duties shall pass in their entirety to the  editorial office unless otherwise specified by the charter of  the editorial office." The Interim Charter of the editorial  office which is in force at the present moment makes no other  provision.    The meeting states that the former Council of Ministers of  the Russian Federation, as founder of the newspaper, has not  fulfilled its statutory obligations with regard to assisting the  work of the editorial office and providing it with information  at its disposal. On the contrary, the chief editor and  journalists have been impeded in the performance of their  professional duty by workers of the government apparatus. In  particular, the decree on the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI editorial  office, which would have enabled it to work normally, and the  new editorial charter have been held up within that apparatus  for a long time now. Attempts are being made to get rid of an  editor who is proving unsuitable. Criticism of the government  will not be accepted. It has reached the point where certain  apparatus workers have stated that the newspaper is  "antigovernment." On the other hand, while remaining formally a  government publication, the newspaper was considerably  restricted in its actions, and the image of being an obedient  semi-official publication, albeit an unjust image, had an  adverse effect on its standing.    The meeting considers that by becoming an independent  publication but preserving in full the newspaper's profile as an  all-Russia daily which covers questions of Russia's state life  first and foremost, keep readers informed about the actions of  the authorities, and monitors them on society's behalf,  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI will be able to perform its social role  considerably more freely and professionally.    On that basis the meeting of the journalists collective of  the editorial office resolves:    1 That in connection with the reorganization of the founder  of the newspaper and on the basis of part four of Article 18 of  the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass Media," the newspaper's  editorial office in the form of its journalists collective shall  be considered the founder of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI.    2. That the "Interim Charter of the Editorial Office of the  RSFSR Council of Ministers weekly ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI," which has  operated since February 1991, shall be considered inoperative.    3. That a new charter is to be adopted for the editorial  office of the sociopolitical daily newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI.    4. That the newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI is to be registered  at the Ministry of the Press and Information (the Committee for  the Press) with its editorial office as founder.    5. The Ministry of the Press and Information (the Committee  for the Press) is to be asked to approve the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  editorial office Charter.    6. The decision of the journalists collective of 21 December  1993 on confidence in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI chief editor V.N. Kucher  is to be confirmed.    [signed] P. Shinkarenko, chairman of the meeting    N. Kudryashov, secretary    [Dated] 29 December 1993    [The back-page box of editorial information in the 31  December edition includes the notation "Founder: The  Journalists Collective of the Editorial Office"; referent item  explains how 29 December edition dropped the "Founder: Council  of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation" notation  which had been present prior to that date]</p>

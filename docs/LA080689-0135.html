			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Kremlin painted a gloomy picture of the Soviet economy, with a national  debt of nearly $500 billion -- one that is also growing faster than that of the  United States. The assessment came in a speech by State Planning Committee  chairman Yuri D. Maslyukov before the Supreme Soviet, or legislature, which is  to consider the 1990 budget during a session that begins Sept. 26. Inflationary  pressures are growing, and the deficit for 1989 is now projected at $192  billion, up 20% from estimates given six months ago. That is four times the  U.S. budget deficit in terms of the economy's ability to adjust to it, Soviet  officials said. The Soviet deficit amounts to 13.8% of all the country's goods  and services produced in a year.  </P></p>

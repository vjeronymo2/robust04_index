			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / More than 2m E German restitution claims filed MORE than 2m claims for the restitution of property expropriated by the former Communist regime in east Germany have been filed, and it could take 10 years for the majority to be settled. That is the daunting conclusion of the Federal Property Office set up in Berlin to deal with the flood of claims, mostly from former residents of East Germany who have settled in the west. Disputes over property ownership have been the biggest single factor delaying new investment in the east, in spite of efforts to limit the right of former owners to demand the physical restitution of their property. The latest figures were issued by Mr Horst-Dieter Kittke, deputy president of the office, who based the estimate of 2m on a total of 1.1m legal notifications received since German unification in 1990. He said only 67,000 cases had been settled so far , and many of those were still being challenged by counter-claims. The claims concern all forms of property, ranging from enterprises to buildings, land, and purely monetary claims. The scale of the problem was a big reason behind the proposal made two weeks ago by Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, for a drastic acceleration in the processing of property claims. He proposed former owners should have a maximum of two weeks for a hearing. He also wants to amend the property law so that once an investor has been given the green light, a former owner can only demand financial compensation. One delaying factor preventing resolution of claims is that the Treuhand agency, responsible for the privatisation process in the whole former East Germany, has filed objections to most demands for physical restitution of property. The reason is that the agency faces crippling claims for compensation for any damage to the property if it is returned to its former owner. However most property claims are aimed at getting financial compensation, rather than outright restitution, according to officials involved in the processing. In those cases, the former owners are waiting for the passing of a new compensation law to see how they would be better off: from financial compensation or restitution. Nearly 400,000 east Germans lost their jobs last December in former state companies controlled by the Treuhand agency, the largest number in any month since the collapse of the communist regime in autumn 1989, Leslie Colitt writes from Berlin. But the jobless rate - 11.8 per cent last November - is expected to rise much less sharply because many of those released from short-time work were cushioned from unemployment by state-subsidised job creation and retraining programmes. Mr Alexander Koch, a member of the Treuhand Executive Board, said the worst loss of jobs in east Germany was over. He expected no big wave of dismissals this year, though unemployment would remain high until the third quarter. The privatisation agency, which when founded in early 1990 had 4m employees in its companies, now has only 1.65m. Nearly 1m jobs were guaranteed by private investors who bought more than 5,000 companies.</p>

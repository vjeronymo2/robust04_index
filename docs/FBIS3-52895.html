Recently one  of America's most important newspapers warned that the  suspicious financial dealings of President Bill Clinton and his  wife have taken away the people's confidence in the White House  statesmen. Last week, the U.S. Congress Republican leaders  called for an investigation into President Clinton's role in  land and estate deals in Arkansas. Republican leaders called on  U.S. Attorney-General Janet Reno to appoint a special  investigator to look into Clinton's role -- as governor of  Arkansas -- in the Whitewater development company.    Critics of the U.S. President's financial misuse say that  before becoming president, when Clinton was governor of  Arkansas, he put special government treasury facilities at the  disposal of the Whitewater company, of which he was a main  shareholder. That finally resulted in the government losing $60  million. But the difficulty is that the judiciary must appoint  a special investigator. The attorney-general is in open  collaboration with the White House and so far has procrastinated  in appointing a special investigator to look into the scandal.  Her pretext is that the legal period for implementing the law  concerning the appointment of a special investigator by the  judiciary has expired; whereas the U.S. press say that she has  other legal authority for a close examination of the issue. The  collusion between the judiciary -- which carries out justice --  and the executive power indicates that both powers are trying  hard to erase the ignominy of this obvious scandal from the face  of the U.S. President.    The White House earlier announced that as soon as the  numerous documents concerning Clinton's banking, personal, and  electoral files are bound they will be handed over to the  attorney-general's office. Clinton, under increasing political  pressure two weeks ago, announced that he will be handing over  documents concerning the financial connection between himself  and his wife and the Whitewater company in the state of Arkansas  to the attorney-general's office. But so far he has not handed  them over.    Finally, we point out the fact that U.S. society has always  been faced with such scandals at the level of political  administrative authorities. The 1988 U.S. presidential  candidate, Garry Hart, sometime after the revelations about his  ethical scandal, said that the personal and private lives of the  leaders of U.S. society have nothing to do with the people. Now  it must be asked whether that is merely his point of view or the  viewpoint of all U.S. statesmen and a permanent principle in  U.S. diplomacy.</p>

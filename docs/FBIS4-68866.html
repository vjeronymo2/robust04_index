			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikola Shelyagovich: "The Republic before </F> Presidential Elections"]    [Text] First the minister of internal affairs and the  chairman of the KGB, who dared to be willful, were discharged,  then speaker Stanislav Shushkevich was removed from his position  and Myacheslaw Hryb became the head of parliament. After a  three-year marathon a new Constitution of the Republic of  Belarus was adopted. And on 15 March the constitution went into  effect.    The desperate attempt at opposition by the Belarusian  People's Front (BNF) and others of this ilk, as was expected,  was not crowned with success. Moreover, it clearly demonstrated  the impotence of the Belarusian national-radicals, who in this  way decreased their political rating to an extremely low point.    The attempt of the BNF and the strike committees that they  encouraged to bring out the workers of Minsk plants onto the  square on cold February days remained just that--an attempt. At  the same time the Supreme Soviet, which finally came to believe  in its own legitimacy, found a way of overcoming the problem of  a quorum--a vote was taken by name ballot in the course of three  days. The vote was on whether or not to be a presidential  republic. As a result, more than two-thirds of the deputy corps  came out for a strong presidential authority.    Members of the BNF opposition in the Supreme Soviet, as  could  be expected, did not take part in the voting by name  ballot--they, who not very long ago worked for a presidential  form of government, today, when their ratings are falling, are  categorically against a strong president. In alliance with them  in nonacceptance of the presidency, and their most powerful  opponent, was Sergey Gaydukevich--the leader of the People's  Movement of Belarus (NDB), which unites within its ranks members  of 25 republic parties, movements, and organizations. He,  claiming in perspective to the first role in the republic, also  understands that today is not yet his time! Nevertheless, a  faction of the NDB in parliament (and this, according to a data  list, has more than 100 persons) almost entirely voted for the  introduction of the post of president. This fact showed  eloquently that the most powerful and influential in parliament,  and probably in the republic as well, remains as before the  unofficial "party of the Council of Ministers," whose first  authority is Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich.    A month and a half remain before the election of the  president of the republic. Named among the candidates are  Premier Vyacheslaw Kebich, speaker of the Supreme Soviet  Myacheslaw Hryb, the tireless fighter against Belarusian  corruption, Aleksandr Lukashenko, yesterday's speaker, Stanislav  Shushkevich, leader of the Party of National Accord, Gennadiy  Karpenko, mayor of the city, and the nationalist and leader of  the People's Front, Zyanon Paznyak. It is difficult to say which  of them will be able to get the support of the powerful. One  thing is clear: It will be a person who, after ending up in the  position of president, will be managed by those whose authority  he will personify and defend. Perhaps most likely a person who  gets along with Kebich's team.    However, there is one "but." It is the support of the  candidate for the president of Belarus on the part of Russia.  Russia's game can significantly correct an election campaign  that is predicted on the basis of internal factors: Moscow is  interested in seeing in Minsk a rudder of authority that is  "eastern" in orientation, so that Belarus will at no time become  a real foreign state for Russia.    At the beginning of the integration process of the two  Slavic  countries, Moscow was visited first by representatives of the  government of the republic--to coordinate the positions of the  agreement on the unification of monetary systems, then by a  delegation of the opposition headed by Zyanon Paznyak, who in  many ways seems to be supported by Yegor Gaydar, and later by an  NDB delegation that was received hospitably in Russia's State  Duma. All these visits to Moscow were followed by attempts by  Belarusian politicians to go through a preliminary political  "inspection of a prospective bride" for "an older brother."    It is quite probable that Russia's sluggishness on the  question of a real unification of monetary systems can be  prolonged if not to the end then at least until the beginning of  the presidential elections in Belarus. It is quite likely that  by that time Russia will also clarify its position regarding its  protege for the post of president of the neighboring country,  which is extremely dependent on it economically and financially.  But in order that Belarus not forget its dependence on its  eastern neighbor, it was given a good reminder when Russia  publicly announced that it was stopping deliveries of gas to the  republic until debts are repaid. The debts were hurriedly paid  in several days.    At the same time, political activeness in the republic can  be  seen with the naked eye. And it is not only the capital that is  active. In western Belarus, where the bulk of the citizens of  the republic who are of Polish nationality live, the Polish  Democratic Party was established and operates actively under the  influence of the Union of Poles.    In western Polesye, with the very active participation of  activists of the sociocultural association Polisyse, a network  of electoral associations has been established in the form of  the regional sociopolitical organizations Brest Choice-94, Pinsk  Choice-94, etc., whose staff has been joined by the most  prestigious industrialists, bankers, entrepreneurs, and  intelligentsia of the region.    In Vitebsk Oblast the Russian-directed Slavic Council Party  Belaya Rus is announcing itself more and more actively, and the  main forces and structures of the Liberal Democratic Party of  Belarus--the native sister of the Russian party of  Zhirinovskiy--are located in the Gomel region.    As for the old parties--the Social-Democratic Gromada, the  NDPB [National Democratic Party of Belarus], the Christian  Party, the Party of National Accord--they are undergoing a  crisis. A majority of them were unable to leave the asphalt of  Minsk and go to the periphery. The former alliance with the BNF  also left the imprint of nationalism on them, which today is  extremely unpopular among the people and which was promoted by  BNF announcements that promised, in the event the BNF came to  power, to introduce a law concerning the ban on professions, and  to build Belarus as a national Belarusian state, etc.    Entirely possible is a variant in which the sociopolitical  structures of the Belarus regions that carry unquestionable  weight there unite in behalf of their common success and attempt  to bring out their own candidate for president, especially if  this candidate is not from the old clan and finds mutual  understanding with the Russians.    But the fact that the oblast principle of distribution of  power in the republic still has force was also shown by the  elections of two new deputy chairmen (until now only a first  deputy has been elected) of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic  of Belarus. The candidates for the posts of deputies were not  considered in political parliamentary factions but in oblast  deputy groups.    As a result: The speaker of the parliament, Hryb, is a  representative of the Vitebsk region, his first deputy is from  Minsk, and the other two are from the Gomel region and the Brest  region respectively.    However, such a balanced division of the republic's power,  in  the opinion of Belarusian political scientists, is a guarantee  of preservation of the integrity of the republic.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A third-party servicer would be required to have an audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed at least once every two years if the servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administers less than $1,000,000 under the Title IV, HEA programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the period covered by the audit, or if the servicer's most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently submitted audit report did not contain any material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies and was submitted in a timely fashion. Also, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer would not be required to have an audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed for any year in which the servicer administers less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than $250,000 under the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is proposing these Title IV, HEA program fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thresholds, for purposes of exceptions to the audit requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section, on the assumption that a large amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program funds are not at risk in the case of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer that administers less than $250,000 during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the audit period. Similarly, the Secretary believes that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer administering less than $1,000,000 in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs during the audit period or whose most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently submitted audit report revealed no abnormal practices or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material discrepancies in the servicer's administration of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds, provided that the audit report was submitted in a timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fashion, would not be likely to endanger those funds. By  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing these exceptions to the audit requirements of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, and thus limiting the scope of these provisions, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that the Department of Education will be able  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to concentrate on those third-party servicers that pose the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greatest financial risk to the Title IV, HEA programs; these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions also reduce the administrative burden on those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifying for the exemptions. The threshold amounts were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extrapolated from similar exemptions to audit submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for institutions under the Single Audit Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ($100,000 and $25,000) and increased by a factor of ten in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to cover third-party servicer activities because these entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally contract with multiple clients and thus would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administer greater amounts of Title IV, HEA program funds than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any single institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These provisions are intended to parallel similar audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for institutions (in proposed regulations to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published shortly after these). The intent is to minimize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden associated with these regulations, both to the servicing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry and to the Federal Government, as called for under E.O.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12866. The Secretary believes that these exceptions would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harm the integrity of the audit oversight that Congress intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 487(c)(1)) of the HEA. Under that section and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these regulations, the Secretary retains the authority to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any third-party servicer to have an audit performed on an annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis if the Secretary believes it is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section would be amended to provide that the servicer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first audit would cover the servicer's first full fiscal year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the effective date of these regulations and any period on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or after the effective date of these regulations up to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning of the servicer's first full fiscal year. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that initial audits will be more useful and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective if they encompass an entire fiscal year. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also believes that allowing servicers additional time to prepare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the implementation of these regulations would enable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers to comply more fully with these regulations as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defray the costs associated with an audit of a partial fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. Subsequent audits would, as required by statute, encompass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the entire period since the servicer's previous audit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A third-party servicer that is required to have an audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed would be required to submit that audit to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Education's Inspector General by the deadlines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established in the audit guide developed by the Department's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Inspector General. The Secretary also proposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply the statutory requirements of section 487(c) of the HEA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicers such that the results of these audits would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be made available to the appropriate authorities, as detailed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the discussion at the beginning of this section. (The Secretary intends to propose similar requirements for institutions required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to have an audit performed in proposed regulations to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published shortly after these).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 668.24&blank;Audit exceptions and repayments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary proposes to extend to a third-party servicer the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions governing audit exceptions and determinations of audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities that currently apply to institutions. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications would simply reflect the Secretary's current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice under this section as applied to a third-party servicer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, an institution or a third-party servicer would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an opportunity to demonstrate within 45 days (35 days is mandated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the current regulations) of the Secretary's notification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the expenditure or compliance was proper. The Secretary is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing 45 days to make the response period consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other reporting requirements in this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

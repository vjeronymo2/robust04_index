			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Mother of Battles President Saddam Hussein urged Iraqis yesterday to hold high the banners of the Mother of Battles - his term for the war over Kuwait, Reuter reports. Speaking before the latest UN confrontation was settled, he said Iraqis had to continue to mobilise because their enemies still wanted war.

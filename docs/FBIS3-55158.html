			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Third article in a series by Virginijus Gaivenis: "Who </F> Armed National Defense? (3)"]    [Excerpts]  <H3>  What Links "Celebrities" of Kaunas Mafia  With Former and Current National Defense Ministry Leadership </H3>   Last Tuesday [21 December], the Russian daily KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA reported that in early summer, the KGB division in  Smolensk prevented an operation whereby 10 military helicopters  MI-8MTB-1 had to be transferred to Lithuania through the Russian  air company "Vityaz" and the Kaunas association "Selma." The  newspaper claimed that the first two helicopters had to fly from  Yaroslavl to Kaunas, where their "duplicates" with the same  numbers were waiting. The latter would have flown to  Kaliningrad in order to return later to Lithuania legally. The  helicopters from Yaroslavl would have remained in Lithuania.  According to the newspaper, the operation failed in the first  stage, when its executors landed at the Vitebsk military airport  for refueling. This big shady deal, as the Moscow newspaper  reported, is linked with the Baltic Fleet leadership and other  officials.    V. Kravchenko, acting Russian Baltic Fleet commander, told a  BNS correspondent that the results of the investigation proved  that no one from the Baltic Fleet leadership or the fleet's air  force command had any link with this deal. The fleet does not  have any agreements with the Russian air company "Vityaz." In  addition, Vice Admiral V. Kravchenko confirmed to BNS that the  Baltic Fleet collaborates closely with the Kaunas association  "Selma" which is building military housing in Kaliningrad  Oblast. As V. Kravchenko stressed, however, "cooperation is  conducted according to the program drafted by the Russian  government." [passage omitted]    The National Defense Ministry [KAM] bought two frigates from  the Baltic Fleet through "Selma." V. Laurinavicius [the firm's  president] received 417 million rubles [R] in cash for them.  While law enforcement officials are investigating the  circumstances of the origin of these and other contracts between  KAM and "Selma," RESPUBLIKA is conducting its own investigation  into this scandal.    The ships which the KAM leadership chose (or which the  Baltic  Fleet leadership offered for sale) were assessed for the first  time in July of last year in Liepaja. A preliminary agreement  was reached with the Baltic Fleet command on the purchase of two  torpedo boats, one hydrographic ship, and one vessel of another  sort. Last summer, the meeting in Liepaja was attended by KAM  commanders Lieutenants E. Miliauskas, V. Mockus, and R.  Baltuska. An agreement was reached with the Baltic Fleet  leadership and stated in a special document that one frigate  will cost Lithuania R94 million. This price seemed acceptable  to the Lithuanian Fleet commanders, because prices for used  ships on the world market are higher. They felt happy that they  had found a common language with the Baltic Fleet command.  Shortly after this, about two weeks later, Lieutenant E.  Miliauskas was called to the office of Commander E. Nazelskis,  first deputy national defense minister. Arriving there, E.  Miliauskas also found "Selma" President V. Laurinavicius. E.  Nazelskis, who had previously received the document concluded in  Liepaja with the prices of the ships, ordered E. Miliauskas to  rewrite the first page bearing the prices. "I did this because  I could not ignore my chief's order," said E. Miliauskas to  RESPUBLIKA recalling those days. The KAM leaders began to  persuade their subordinates immediately that inflation forced  them to review the prices of ships. The subordinates found out  later that the ministry was already paying R240 million instead  of R94 million to "Selma." How? What does "Selma" have to do  with this? There were no mediators in the Liepaja talks. An  agreement on the sale of ships was reached. Was a mediator  necessary to "launder" millions from the state's pocket?    On 21 October 1992, while Baltic Fleet Commander Y. Yegorov  and Minister A. Butkevicius were confirming the statement of  transfer of the ships to Lithuania, a meeting was held in  Kaliningrad, which was attended by R. Baltuska, commander of the  coast guard unit, and the aforementioned V. Mockus and E.  Miliauskas. They discussed with the Baltic Fleet leadership  that the ships be sailed to the wharf in Klaipeda in 10 days.  Apart from the three KAM officials, the talks were also  attended by "Selma" President V. Laurinavicius and his  companions. [passage omitted]    Yesterday, we tried to talk to Mr. E. Nazelskis whom Prime  Minister A. Slezevicius is sending for training to the Czech  Republic. Sensing the topic of our conversation, E. Nazelskis  categorically refused to speak with us.    Who armed Lithuania's national defense and how? Why Minister  A. Butkevicius, who comes from Kaunas, chose "Selma" and its  convicted president as a partner in buying arms, ships, and  helicopters? What links Commander E. Nazelskis with the leaders  of the Kaunas Mafia?...</p>

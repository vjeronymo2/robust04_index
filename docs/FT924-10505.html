			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Estimate of world grain production increased THE INTERNATIONAL Wheat Council has increased its estimate of world wheat and coarse grain production in 1992-93, largely reflecting improved US crop prospects. In the latest issue of its Grain Market Report, the London-based agency puts 1992-93 wheat production at 550m tonnes, up from the 546m tonnes forecast in its October 1 report and 544m tonnes in the 1991-92 season. The coarse grains harvest is estimated at 836m tonnes, compared with 828m projected on October 1 and 799m tonnes in 1991-92. 'Better crops in the United States, China, Kazakhstan, Canada, the EEC and Australia contributed to the (wheat crop) increase,' the IWC says. The US crop is now put at 66.7m tonnes, up by 1.2m tonnes from the previous report and 12.8m tonnes from 1991-92. China's crop estimate is raised by 1.5m tonnes to 99m tonnes, compared with 96m tonnes in 1991-92, helped by 'favourable weather in major growing regions' and 'a significant increase in acreage in the provinces of Liaoning and Jilin in the north-east'. The former Soviet Union's wheat estimate is raised by 1m tonnes to 89.6m tonnes, up strongly from 1991-92's exceptionally low 73.5m tonnes. The IWC attributes the 8m-tonne increase in its world coarse grains estimate mainly to 'a further rise in the figure for the United States, where the maize crop could set a new record of 227m tonnes'. It also expects better results from former Soviet republics, India, South Africa and Australia to be only partly offset by smaller outturns in western and eastern Europe and China. The Russian grain crop has reached 107m tonnes, but early cold weather means the harvest has not yet been completed and crops from 700,000 hectares have not been brought in, Itar-Tass news agency said, reports Reuter from Moscow. 'Almost 107m tonnes of Russian grain has been threshed,' the agency said. But it added that state purchases of 23.1m tonnes were 6m tonnes less than required. Tass did not say if the latest figure was bunker weight or net weight after cleaning and drying. Last week the state statistics office said Russia's 1992 grain harvest was virtually complete at about 104m tonnes, bunker weight.</p>

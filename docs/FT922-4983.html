			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Iran shifts stance towards Lebanon MR Ali Akbar Velayati, the Iranian foreign minister, began his first official visit to Lebanon yesterday with a series of meetings with the government, demonstrating Iran's new willingness to deal directly with the Lebanese authorities - to the possible detriment of Iran's allies in the Shia Moslem Hizbollah movement. Hizbollah refused to participate in the government, formed last month, on the grounds that it was 'corrupt'. Although Mr Velayati told reporters that he was not discussing the liberation of two German hostages believed held by Mr Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, a prominent Hizbollah member, his visit encouraged speculation that the two Germans would soon be free. Germany and the European Community have frozen several hundred million dollars in reconstruction aid to Lebanon pending the liberation of Mr Heinrich Streubig, 50, and Mr Thomas Kemptner, 30. Both men have been held for three years and their kidnappers are demanding the freedom of Mr Hamadi's brothers Mohammed and Abbas, convicted in Germany of hijacking, kidnapping and murder. Mr Velayati is to visit Germany later this month. The Lebanese government, which was excluded from earlier hostage negotiations, this year established a special commission to work for the liberation of Mr Streubig and Mr Kemptner. A Lebanese delegation travelled to Tehran three months ago to ask Iran to use its influence over Hizbollah to seek their freedom. Mr Velayati said yesterday that it was his understanding that the Lebanese government, like Iran, supported 'popular resistance' against the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. But Mr Fares Boueiz, the Lebanese foreign minister, recently demanded that Hizbollah 'co-ordinate' its attacks with Lebanese diplomatic efforts in hopes of ending Israeli reprisals that killed 25 people and wounded 63 in the last two weeks of May. Mr Velayati will address a rally commemorating the third anniversary of the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in Beirut today. Israel shelled guerrilla-held villages in south Lebanon yesterday and sent reconnaissance aircraft over the area and the Bekaa valley in the east of the country where Hizbollah militants are active, agencies report. Security sources said that Israeli gunners and their South Lebanon Army allies opened fire on several villages near the Litani river. Meanwhile, the Israeli defence minister, Mr Moshe Arens, warned Lebanese civilians yesterday that they were at risk if they lived near leaders of Hizbollah.</p>

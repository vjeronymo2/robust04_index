If available, a copy of the rental agreement should be obtained. It is the responsibility of the loan underwriter to be aware of the condition of the local rental market. For instance, in areas where the rental market is very strong the absence of a lease should not automatically prohibit the offset of the mortgage by the proposed rental income. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other rental property. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If income from rental property will be used to qualify for the new loan, the documentation required of a self-employed applicant should be obtained together with evidence of cash reserves equaling 3 months PITI of the rental property. As for any self-employed earnings (see paragraph (f)(7) of this section), depreciation claimed may be added back in as income. In the case of a veteran who has no experience as a landlord, it is unlikely that the income from a rental property may be used to qualify for the new loan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ll)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Taxes and other deductions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Deductions to be applied for Federal income taxes ad Social Security may be obtained from the Employer's Tax Guide (Circular E) issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (For veterans receiving a mortgage credit certificate (MCC), see paragraph (f)(12) of this section.) Any State or local taxes should be estimated or obtained from charts similar to those provided by IRS which may be available in those States with withholding taxes. A determination of the amount paid or withheld for retirement purposes should be made and used when calculating deductions from gross income. In determining whether a veteran-applicant meets the income criteria for a loan, some consideration may be given to the potential tax benefits the veteran will realize if the loan is approved. This can be done by using the instructions and worksheet portion of IRS Form W&hyph;4, Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate, to compute the total number of permissible withholding allowances. That number can then be used when referring to IRS Circular E and any appropriate similar State withholding charts to arrive at the amount of Federal and State income tax to be deducted from gross income. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mortgage credit certificates. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) The Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1984, allows States and other political subdivisions to trade in all or part of their authority to issue mortgage revenue bonds for authority to issue MCCs. Veterans who are recipients of MCCs may realize a significant reduction in their income tax liability by receiving a Federal tax credit for a percentage of their mortgage interest payment on debt incurred on or after January 1, 1985. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Lenders must provide a copy of the MCC to VA with the home loan application. The MCC will specify the rate of credit allowed and the amount of certified indebtedness; i.e., the indebtedness incurred by the veteran to acquire a principal residence or as a qualified home improvement or rehabilitation loan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) For credit underwriting purposes, the amount of tax credit allowed to a veteran under an MCC will be treated as a reduction in the monthly Federal income tax. For example, a veteran having a $600 monthly interest payment and an MCC providing a 30-percent tax credit would receive a $180 (30%&times;$600) tax credit each month. However, because the annual tax credit, which amounts to $2,160 (12&times;$180), exceeds $2,000 and is based on a 30-percent credit rate, the maximum tax credit the veteran can receive is limited to $2,000 per year (Pub. L. 98&hyph;369) or $167 per month ($2,000 <!-- PJG 0001 unknown --> 12). As a consequence of the tax credit, the interest on which a deduction can be taken will be reduced by the amount of the tax credit to $433 ($600^$167). This reduction should also be reflected when calculating Federal income tax. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) For underwriting purposes, the amount of the tax credit is limited to the amount of the veteran's maximum tax liability. If, in the example in paragraph (f)(12)(iii), the veteran's tax liability for the year were only $1,500, the monthly tax credit would be limited to $125 ($1,500 <!-- PJG 0001 unknown --> 12). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Credit. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The conclusion reached as to whether or not the borrower and spouse are satisfactory credit risks must also be based on a careful analysis of the available credit data. Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity Act) requires that lenders include, in evaluating creditworthiness on a veteran's request, the credit history, when available, of any account reported in the name of the veteran's spouse or former spouse which the veteran can demonstrate reflects accurately the veteran's willingness or ability to repay. In other that community property States, if the spouse will not be contractually obligated on the loan, Regulation B, promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits any request for, or consideration of information about the spouse concerning income, employment, assets or liabilities. In community property States, information concerning a spouse may be requested and considered in the same manner as that for the applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adverse data. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the analysis develops any derogatory credit information and, despite such facts, it is determined that the borrower and spouse are satisfactory credit risks, the basis for the decision must be explained. If a borrower and spouse have debts outstanding which have not been paid timely, or which they have refused to pay, the fact that the outstanding debts are paid after the acceptability of the credit is questioned or in anticipation of applying for new credit does not, of course, alter the fact that the record for paying debts has been unsatisfactory. With respect to unpaid debts, lenders may take into consideration a veterans's claim of bona fide or legal defenses. This is not applicable when the debt has been reduced to judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

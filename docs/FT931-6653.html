			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Labour offers talks on terror law LABOUR OFFERED yesterday to discuss reform of the anti-terrorism laws with the government, Alison Smith writes. Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'It is time to build a new understanding between the parties.' The Tories have argued that Labour's refusal to support the existing prevention-of-terrorism measures shows that the party is not serious about fighting crime in general. The annual order renewing those measures - condemned by Labour as harsh and ineffectual - will soon go before the Commons. Mr McNamara said talks with the government should include ending orders which exclude people from Northern Ireland or Great Britain. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said it would be 'irresponsible' during an IRA mainland campaign to remove the power to issue exclusion orders.</p>

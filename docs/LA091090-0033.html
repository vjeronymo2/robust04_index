"Now we won't  have to listen to all that stuff. It won't be hanging over our heads any more."  </P> <P> Philadelphia had a 10-6 lead at halftime even though the Giants had more  scoring chances.  </P> <P> But Simms, who finished 15 for 27 for 149 yards, sandwiched scoring passes of  12 yards to rookie Rodney Hampton and 41 yards to Mark Ingram around Meggett's  dazzling punt return in the first 17 minutes of the half, giving the Giants a  27-10 lead.  </P> <P> Eagle quarterback Randall Cunningham, who was sacked four times and harassed  throughout the game, completed 25 of 42 passes for 226 yards and was  intercepted three times.  </P> <P> Lawrence Taylor sacked Cunningham three times and also forced a fumble.  </P> <P> "I was impressed with what I did, considering I just came into camp on  Wednesday," Taylor said. "My stamina wasn't good. If it was, I would have made  a couple more tackles."  </P> <P> The Giants were ahead, 13-10, when Hampton put the game away by taking a swing  pass from Simms and running the final 10 yards, entering the end zone with a  dive from the two-yard line.  </P> <P> Meggett's return began when he fielded Jeff Feagles' punt at the Giants' 32,  moved a couple of steps to his right and then cut through a tiny hole and  scored after eluding Feagles at the 20.  </P></p>

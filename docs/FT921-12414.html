			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / G7 will act to strengthen world economic growth: Possibility of interest rate cuts Lamont sees recovery 'delayed, not cancelled' THE WORLD'S leading industrial countries have agreed to intensify their efforts to strengthen world economic growth in response to a weakening of the global economy in the past three months. After meeting for more than seven hours on Saturday, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven nations said they were convinced that forces inhibiting economic activity in many countries were dissipating. Lower inflation in most countries, lower long-term interest rates and stable oil prices meant the conditions for improved growth existed. 'The clear view was that the recovery had been delayed, not cancelled,' said Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor. However, the G7 - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada  -agreed that the recovery needed reinforcing. The communique issued after the meeting raised the possibility of future interest rate cuts and fiscal measures to boost growth in some countries. But it left individual governments to determine the scope and timing of policy changes. The US was alone in making a public promise of fresh action. The statement said President George Bush's State of the Union address tomorrow would announce a comprehensive programme to strengthen growth and competitiveness. The US programme would include 'measures to improve consumer confidence, incentives for savings and investment, and increased research and development expenditures'. While the communique listed the efforts being made by the seven to boost output, it underlined that the lower inflation rates achieved by many countries over the past year should not be jeopardised. The statement was a carefully crafted compromise between the US, which wants greater growth, and Germany, which fears a return to stop-go policies. Consistent with a cautious policy approach, the G7 spoke of a 'reallocation' rather than an expansion of government spending in some countries, and warned that others such as Italy must focus on reducing their budget deficits. The statement took a similarly careful line on interest rates, advocating reductions in those countries which in future have lower inflation than expected. German officials made clear that an early cut in the Bundesbank's interest rates was not to be expected. However, the meeting marked a change of emphasis in favour of stronger growth by the G7. 'It is a strong political statement of a consensus to strengthen world economic growth,' said a senior US Treasury official, who predicted action by member countries of the group between now and the meetings of the International Monetary Fund in April. The weekend meeting also discussed the economic crisis in the former Soviet Union and developments on exchange markets. In a characteristicly opaque statement, the ministers agreed 'to continue to monitor market developments and to co-operate closely in exchange markets, thus contributing to favourable conditions for stable exchange markets and economic recovery'. The G7 made no mention of specific currencies. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, said the lack of mention of the yen, dollar or other currencies meant that current parities suited everybody at the meeting. He indicated that the G7 would keep rates stable 'at the levels that you have seen in recent days'. In Tokyo today the dollar opened at Y124.65 after closing at Y124.57 on Friday. 'The momentum for a higher yen has weakened,' a Tokyo banker said. The Nikkei average fell about 190 points in early trading.

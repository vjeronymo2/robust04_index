			<p>CSO     [Text] Western Bureau--Autopsies performed on three  Canadians who died in Montego Bay on Sunday, confirmed a report  in yesterday's GLEANER that the visitors had ingested cocaine.    A forensic pathologist found that the men had together,  swallowed 147 packets of cocaine weighing 553.5 grams.    The victims are: David Nast, 23, of Winnipeg; Sheldon  Figusson, 28, and Noland Delaronde of Oak Point on Lake  Manitoba, Canada.    This is what forensic pathologist Dr. Ademola Odunfa found:        -  Nast's stomach had in [it] 60 small packets of cocaine  weighing 215 grams. He died after 12 of the packets burst inside  his digestive system.        -  Figusson's had 38 packets weighing 157 grams in his  body, four of which had ruptured.        -  Delerande had 49 packets weighing 182 grams, and nine  of them had burst in his system.    The police said the men were booked on a flight scheduled to  leave the island at 5:30 p.m. on Sunday when they fell ill. They  were rushed to the Cornwall Regional Hospital where Nast was  pronounced dead on arrival. His friends were being taken to the  Doctor's Hospital in a chartered taxi, when Delaronde reportedly  said he feared dying also as he, like his friends, had swallowed  cocaine. They collapsed and died as hospital workers were taking  personal details in preparing them for admission.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> YOUTHS WITH DESIGNS ON TOMORROW'S CARS;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: STUDENTS AT A SMALL COLLEGE IN PASADENA GO ON TO NOTEWORTHY  SUCCESSES AS AUTOMOTIVE DESIGNERS.  </P> <P> In the sylvan hills of Pasadena, high above the smog and traffic that ensnarl  motorists, a group of young car designers is summoned for a briefing.  </P> <P> Their mission: Design a vehicle that will enhance the enjoyment of road travel  through the West. They christen it the Sunset Project.  </P> <P> Three months later, the designers reassemble. As Yasushi Kato gets up to speak,  all eyes turn to his model, made of sculpted clay and painted a lustrous red.  With its sharp contours that mix space-bubble design with a covered wagon look,  this vehicle looks ready to blast into orbit.  </P> <P> "When I first heard about the Sunset Project, it reminded me of the Western  frontier in the 1880s," Kato tells the other designers, some of whom wear  ponytails, cowboy boots and suits.  </P> <P> "But do Americans today have the frontier spirit?" he continued. "No. . . .  They are couch potatoes. So why not stop being couch potatoes with my car? It  has a wild image. It is a car for the neo-frontiersman. It will allow Americans  to regain their frontier spirit."  </P> <P> This isn't a New Age seminar for burned-out auto executives.  </P> <P> It's the Art Center College of Design, a modest institution of exceptional  caliber, which industry experts say is quietly turning out half of the car  designers working in the United States.  </P> <P> In a survey last July, the Art Center was ranked the top U.S. school in both  industrial and graphic design by Wefler &amp; Associates, a design and research  firm in Evanston, Ill. The Art Center also boasts one of the nation's top car  design departments, an honor it shares with Detroit's Center for Creative  Studies.  </P> <P> Today, as California car culture takes on almost mythic stature among auto  designers in search of new trends, the Art Center has become one of the  touchstones of the industry, where car companies go to jump-start the future.  </P> <P> "It's one of the few windows we can come through to see American life," said  Tom Matano, an Art Center alumnus and a vice president of Mazda who heads the  firm's California design studio. "The sheer energy and passion and power of the  students and the unrestricted creativity at the Art Center is something you  can't get in Japan."  </P> <P> Executives from Citroen to Toyota regularly make the pilgrimage to the Art  Center's glass and steel campus -- designed by Southern California architect  Craig Ellwood in the International style -- in search of new talent and  inspiration.  </P> <P> And increasingly, they sponsor "blue sky" projects, in which students are asked  to dream up new cars or update old ones. A year ago, Volvo flew out its top  three designers from Goteborg, Sweden, to brief students on a project to design  a "socially conscious" Volvo for the 1990s.  </P> <P> This fall, seniors designed a Mitsubishi Eclipse for the year 2000. Mitsubishi  wanted a car that would accommodate business and leisure activities and  navigate the clotted city streets of the future. Students were told that 60% of  the buyers would be women.  </P> <P> And the Sunset Project? It was sponsored by Sunset Magazine, a periodical  devoted to life in the American West. Juniors in advanced transportation design  competed for $4,500 in prize money.  </P> <P> The object of all this is not to produce viable market products, but to let  firms tap into ideas unfettered by corporate ideology, said Ron Hill, the  chairman of the Art Center's industrial design department and one of General  Motors' chief designers for 22 years.  </P> <P> Blue sky projects also give individual students a chance to impress future  employers.  </P> <P> "I'm up there every couple months either interviewing or visiting, and I find  it stimulating," said Thomas Tremont, an Art Center alumnus and chief designer  at Chrysler Pacifica, the car company's design studio in Carlsbad, Calif.  "Young student designers don't have the constraints that working for a company  can give you."  </P> <P> Students go from paper sketches to computer modeling and, finally, to clay  models built to one-fifth scale and painted with real automotive colors. They  even test the aerodynamic capabilities of their model cars in a wind tunnel.  Design projects run from $25,000 to $50,000 depending on their size and  complexity. But firms consider it a cheap investment.  </P> <P> The Art Center produced three of the five designers of the Mazda Miata -- one  of the most critically acclaimed car designs of the decade.  </P> <P> And the Art Center is where Japanese car companies, such as Nissan, Mazda and  Honda, send their promising young designers to percolate in unbridled freedom  and creativity -- the antithesis of corporate Japan.  </P> <P> "I'm a student now, not a designer. I can do anything I want and that is very  fun for me," said Kato, 34, one of the top designers for Toyota Motors of  Japan. He is studying transportation design at the Art Center for a year at the  behest of his employer.  </P> <P> The pollination goes both ways: Japanese firms are now hiring the Art Center's  best students to design in Japan.  </P> <P> The Art Center's links to Japan were forged in the early 1970s, when the  Japanese saw California as a safe oasis from the hostility generated by  large-scale automotive industry layoffs in Detroit, said Carl Olsen, chairman  of transportation design at the Center for Creative Studies.  </P> <P> Mazda's Matano, who came to the Art Center from Japan in the 1970s, said the  school taught him to translate his engineering ideas into drawings and 3-D  models. He said it was a rigorous process.  </P> <P> "The school was so hard; you're never going to face more than that," said  Matano, who along with the better-known designer Mark Jordan helped design the  Miata.  </P> <P> Indeed, the 90 students majoring in transportation design -- out of a total  student body at the Art Center of 1,150 -- are told to forget about their  social life for several years.  </P> <P> "The commitment is quite total," said Hill, an alumnus. "We don't have a  basketball team. We don't have fraternities or sororities. It's incredibly  difficult, but if you get through the program, it marks a student for life as  far as their design capabilities go."  </P> <P> Graduates don't walk out of the Art Center as superstars; they earn an average  starting salary of about $35,000 per year in the United States and up to  $45,000 in Europe, Hill said. But exceptional students are sometimes wooed by  several firms at once.  </P> <P> Right now, car companies "are just wailing for women," Hill said. Only three of  the Art Center's 90 transportation design students are female, but car  companies hope their numbers will increase because they think female designers  can dream up automotive styles that women like.  </P> <P> Art Center teaches a more international style of design than Detroit's Center  for Creative Studies, Hill said. The Japanese influence is very strong, and  students are encouraged to spend a term studying at the Art Center's other  campus in Vevey, Switzerland. Many also take a term off to work car company  internships.  </P> <P> Olsen, chairman of transportation design at the Detroit center, said his school  also maintains strong ties with European firms. He challenges the assumption  that the Center for Creative Studies teaches "a Detroit world view" and is  skeptical of the importance of California design.  </P> <P> "The California niche influence is rather peripheral," Olsen said.  </P> <P> Some Art Center students in turn speak disparagingly of Detroit. Many don't  want to work there.  </P> <P> Dave Triano, 24, who is attending the Art Center on a Ford Motor Co.  scholarship, calls U.S. car companies "large, obese animals that are moving  much too slowly." He adds that "it's very frustrating. Because we'd like to see  American companies succeed."  </P> <P> In between finals last year, several students hung around the classroom and  boasted good-naturedly that they soon would outshine even the designers of the  Miata.  </P> <P> Many had been up for several nights, putting finishing touches on their models.  After their presentations, several students lay like slabs of meat across  classroom tables, exhausted.  </P> <P> After Christmas break, they would be back for more, living out the fantasies of  every boy who ever doodled the outline of his favorite roadster on a PeeChee  folder.  </P> <P> Andy Ogden, who teaches advanced transportation design, gestures toward the  sleek models inspired by the Sunset Project. Some have soft, rounded edges.  Others are less contoured, more aggressive. They range in color from turquoise  to purple and red.  </P> <P> "Most of the pieces probably will not turn into usable designs," Ogden said.  "But from them may sprout the seed of an idea."  </P></p>

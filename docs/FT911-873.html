			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Trafalgar House urges road financing policy change TRAFALGAR HOUSE, which is bidding to build Britain's first toll motorway, yesterday called for a radical change of government policy on privately financed roads. Sir Eric Parker, the Trafalgar House chief executive, who has been a staunch supporter of plans to raise private money to build roads, said delays in getting projects approved by government were undermining investment plans. He said: 'Ministers need to have a good look at the system. It was easier to build private roads in the 80s when the economy was better. But the downturn has made it very difficult for companies to build private roads.' Sir Eric said bankers' fees had more than doubled during the past two years, increasing the cost of financing schemes. He recently met Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, to urge streamlined government procedures. The construction, property, shipping and hotels group is a member of one of three consortia bidding to build a 30-mile toll motorway north of Birmingham. Trafalgar interim, Page 21</p>

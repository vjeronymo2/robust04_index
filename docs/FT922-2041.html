			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Seven sugar groups face Brussels fine threat THE EUROPEAN Commission is threatening to fine seven sugar companies in the UK, Ireland, France and Denmark on suspicion that they have been illegally protecting their home markets from competition, and so forcing prices up. The Brussels competition directorate has sent five sugar producers - among them, British Sugar, Tate and Lisle, and Irish Sugar - and two sugar trading companies a formal 'statement of objections', alleging infringements of the anti-cartel Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome. The companies have the chance to present their case in a formal hearing in Brussels, before the Commission takes any final action. The latter could be some months off. The action, which came to light yesterday in a statement by Greencore, owner of Irish Sugar, to the Dublin Stock Exchange, follows a seven-month investigation from September 1990 to March 1991. The Commission alleges that from mid-1986 until the start of its investigation, the companies concerned took a variety of actions which insulated their national markets, particularly the UK, from any effective competition from abroad. Article 85 bars companies from pursuing practices which generally 'have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition' within the EC.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (4): People before bricks and mortar - Interview: Sir George Young, housing minister, says funding needs to be refocused The success of housing associations in providing affordable housing since 1988 has been built on two streams of government finance: housing association grant for building new homes; and housing benefit to help tenants pay rents which have been rising closer to market levels. The continuing success of associations as housing providers - and their attractiveness for private investors - rests to a large extent, therefore, on the goodwill of Whitehall. With pressure to reduce public sector borrowing over the coming years, both elements of financial support for housing associations offer tempting targets for the Treasury. That pressure has already manifested itself in the declining rate of grant to housing associations for providing new homes. It has fallen from an average of 75 per cent of the cost of each new home to 62 per cent in four years, and the government has set a target of 55 per cent for next year. There have also been leaks that the budget for housing benefit - the cost of which has almost doubled to more than Pounds 8bn in the last five years - has been under scrutiny. If housing benefit were to be cut, tenants might find their rents harder to pay. This could undermine the quality of the income stream earned by associations, making private investors less willing to lend to associations. Happily for associations, their achievements since 1988 are well-recognised by the government. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary who is spearheading the search for cuts in public expenditure, told a recent seminar for lenders that the government would do nothing to housing benefit that would compromise associations' position. The increase in the housing benefit is the result of a conscious decision to switch housing subsidy from bricks and mortar to people, according to Sir George Young, the long-serving housing minister. 'We believe that it's more effective to target resources on individuals in need,' he says, 'rather than indiscriminately on subsidies to housing associations.' Sir George has been involved with housing associations since the 1960s and has been an energetic promoter of their virtues among ministerial colleagues. 'What housing associations have achieved since 1988 has been a real success story,' he says. 'The mixed funding regime has brought Pounds 2.6bn of private funding into housing, providing an extra 55,000 homes that wouldn't have been built if we'd gone on providing 100 per cent of the finance for new homes. 'Associations have developed a good reputation with the lending institutions as viable, well-run organisations. And they've produced good quality homes at affordable rents.' In many ways, Sir George says, housing associations provide a model for the government's private finance initiative which seeks to raise more of the funds for public services from the private sector. 'We've taken wholly public sector funding for housing and geared it up by raising private finance,' he says. Scarcely a month goes by without Sir George launching another initiative involving housing associations. Urban regeneration schemes, getting rough sleepers off London's streets, managing property for private landlords, compulsory competitive tendering for local authority housing management - all have included a role for associations. 'Associations are a resource in terms of housing management skills which they have traditionally applied to their own stock,' he says. 'I want to encourage lateral expansion, so that they put these skills to wider use in managing others' stock. We need to revive the private rented sector and one way of doing that is by bringing in institutional funds. Housing associations could manage property on their behalf, so that ownership could be divorced from the management function.' Sir George has also encouraged local authorities to use the planning system to persuade private developers to include an element of social housing in new developments. These would then be sold to or managed by housing associations. 'Such mixed tenure is how most of our villages and towns grew,' he points out. 'Having all sorts of people living closely together is much more natural than the polarisation of housing between huge council estates and owner-occupier estates.' With falling grant rates, many of the smaller associations which cater for special needs are being squeezed out of the development programme. But Sir George remains enthusiastic about the role they can play, especially in rural areas and in serving tenants with special needs, such as ethnic minorities and the disabled. 'The larger associations will account for a bigger share of the grants for development,' he says, 'because they can drive the deals with builders and get the private finance. We have to take a hard-nosed approach to value for money and it makes sense to focus development skills in those associations. 'But once they have completed the developments, some of the stock can then be handed over to smaller associations. Many of the smaller specialist associations are building partnerships with larger associations. Fewer developers needn't mean fewer managers.' As for the future, Sir George believes that the emphasis is due to shift back from development to rehabilitation of older property, particularly in the inner cities. 'I have increased the Housing Corporation's target for the share of its budget which is to go on rehab this year,' he says. 'If the owner-occupied market takes off and builders regain confidence, the new homes that are being built will be for sale. Housing associations can then concentrate on those things that the private sector finds difficult such as rehab. 'Associations have an appetite and a capacity to do more,' he concludes. 'I have every confidence they can respond to the challenge of spending whatever grant they get and the lateral challenge of moving into related fields where their skills are used even where they don't own the underlying assets.'</p>

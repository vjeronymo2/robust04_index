			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Observer: Down but not out Standing for election to become a common councilman of the City of London recently, PR man Peter Jennings made the mistake of suggesting he might like to become Lord Mayor one day. The powers that be recoiled in horror at such a bald statement of ambition. But the obscure and oh-so-discreet system by which Lord Mayors have hitherto emerged is on the line, judging by current shenanigans within the Court of Aldermen. Change was in the air earlier this year when Neil Young resigned. The court had reviewed the batting order for mayoral office, and Young heard his name would not 'go forward'. So Malcolm Matson, a businessman who has made his money in cable networks, was voted in by the Bread Street ward as his successor, but he failed to secure the approval of the aldermen themselves. Incensed at the blackballing - for which no reasons are given - Matson last Friday obtained an injunction stopping another election being called. As a result, a system that was last considered in detail in 1834 will be subject to judicial review. Matson says he has the financial resources to 'see justice prevails'. It could well be that, 160 years on, the courts will be a good deal more sensitive to the exigencies of democracy. The proceedings promise a fascinating insight into the darker side of City politics. And there is also the embarrassing possibility that the aldermen will be forced in the end to accept Matson. At least he would provide some company for Tony Bull, who has been in a rather awkward position this year since he chose not to stand down, despite also being passed over as a future Lord Mayor.</p>

			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Current account surplus up 19.8% in first half JAPAN'S current account surplus in the six months to June rose by 19.8 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 67.5bn (Pounds 45.30bn). It is on course for a new record total this year in spite of appreciation of the yen and US attempts to improve market access. The current account surplus for the month of June was a record Dollars 10.7bn, compared to Dollars 9.4bn last year, and reflected the influence of a large trade surplus, Dollars 11.6bn, though the finance ministry expects the stronger yen to slow the expansion of that surplus in coming months. During the first half, Japan recorded an unusual Dollars 2bn surplus on its invisible trade, which is generally pushed into deficit by the influence of the tourist outflow. The ministry said an increase in receipts on investment abroad had turned the account around, although there was a deficit of Dollars 443m for June. Japanese investors' net sales of foreign bonds during the month were Dollars 3.04bn, compared to net purchases of Dollars 4.58bn in May, while they were net purchasers of Dollars 1.24bn in equities, up from Dollars 414m in May. Foreign investors net purchases of Japanese bonds in June were Dollars 2.3bn, while they sold Dollars 239m in stocks. Finance ministry officials fear that the immediate effect of the renewed strengthening of the yen in recent days will be to push the trade and current account sur-pluses higher, provoking further calls from Washing-ton for new market opening measures. Officials in the finance ministry and the ministry for international trade and industry are also concerned that a coalition government, expected to take office today, will be unable to agree on a response to US requests for a new spending package to stimulate the economy and, in theory, increase imports. Japan's current account surplus has grown year-on-year for 27 consecutive months, although the seasonally adjusted surplus for June fell 19.4 per cent from May, giving the government hope that the expansion, which began after the collapse of the finance bubble, is coming to an end.</p>

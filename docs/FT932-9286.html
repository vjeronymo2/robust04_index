			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Arts: Alexei Lubimov and Nathalie Stutzmann - Recitals at the Wigmore Hall Nobody should think that 'fortepiano' is a specific term; it used to mean the same thing as 'pianoforte', and nowadays suggests only that the instrument in question is fairly antique. The Wigmore Hall's May brochure billed Cyril Huve as playing an 1828 Pleyel piano last week (reviewed here by Max Loppert), and Alexei Lubimov a 'fortepiano'  - but on Tuesday the latter proved to be a sumptuous 1858 Broadwood. Lubimov is an ancient-and-modern specialist from Moscow, allowed to make western appearances only since 1987. That has been our loss: his programme was a joy to hear. It was hardly possible to distinguish the special period charms of the instrument from the genial musicianship of the pianist, though Glinka's variations on a Bellini tune (from I Capuleti ed i Montecchi) were surely enhanced by the twinkling sound. In familiar Liszt and Chopin, Lubimov offered more imaginative faithfulness than I have heard in some time, different in innumerable details from the 'standard' readings. But every time one thought, 'Now, there's something you couldn't do on a modern grand]' it was also something that perhaps only Lubimov would have thought of doing anyway. The sound never seemed miniaturised: the third and fourth Chopin Ballades rose to glorious climaxes, and the three members of the audience who left before the encores missed a magnificent Barcarolle. Perhaps Liszt's 'La Leggierezza' had a magical whisper that could never be drawn from the Wigmore's new Bosendorfer, but even there Lubimov was achieving pedal-effects of a rare, inspired order. (This Broadwood must have been reckoned a miraculous instrument in its day.) What characterises antique piano-sound is the relative audibility of the hammers against the slighter, less carrying resonance of the strings; with a musician like Lubimov, one was the more struck by his singing legato, expressive down to the least breath. It was somewhat shocking to realise that most so-called 'Chopin specialists' in fact hew to a tried-and-true party line. Were there more pianists with Lubimov's artful delicacy, sweetness and interpretative breadth, the party line might wilt away altogether. ***** This is a very special voice: low-lying, dark-toned, dense-textured, rich but not heavy, round but not loose or slack-muscled. Even if the species female contralto were not almost extinct  - as now seems to be the case internationally  - its owner, a young Parisian still only in her 20s, would probably have speeded her way through the ranks all the same. The reason is her captivatingly individual quality of tone and timbre, and the capacity she has shown for delivering fast-moving, highly ornate 18th-century vocal writing with exciting virtuosity and ease. Several recent Handel recordings, notably Erato's wonderful Amadigi and an RCA set of Handel arias, have already cast Nathalie Stutzmann as their primo uomo, to their greater glory; her first London recital, on Wednesday, was an opportunity to savour this voice in different musical conditions, and in the uniquely sympathetic acoustics and environment of the Wigmore Hall. The voice survived the test handsomely  - it is a remarkable instrument  - but the artistry was shown in a slightly less encouraging light. It was a 'straight' song recital, not a 'live' display of the Baroque vocal skills already demonstrated on record: Schubert and Schumann in the first half, Faure and Debussy in the second. That was plainly an error of judgment, for on this evidence Miss Stutzmann's singing of Lieder and melodies is tethered at the advanced-student level  - cautious, apt to favour slow tempos and solemn moods (and to make a meal of them), concerned to produce nice sounds rather than to frame alert verbal statements. Consonants were swallowed in almost every sentence  - surprisingly, this proved no less true in her native tongue than in German  - and rhythms allowed to go slack; impeccable legato was not a cherished aim. (The erratic pianist, Catherine Collard, provided little counterbalance.) Individual phrases may have made a pleasing impression, but the sum total was of well-intended un-clarity and immaturity. Miss Stutzmann should be encouraged to return here soon  - with a more suitable programme and a sharper artistic focus underlying it.</p>

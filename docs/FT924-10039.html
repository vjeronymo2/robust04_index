			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Anti-nuclear activists lobby officials Anti-nuclear activists lobby officials at Japan's Science and Technology Agency yesterday against the sailing of a plutonium carrier for France. They argue that the planned shipment next week of 1.7 tonnes of recycled commercial-grade plutonium is too dangerous to transport halfway around the world and is potential prey for pirates. Several countries have barred the ship, the Akatsuki Maru, from their waters and its route is being kept secret. Indonesia said yesterday it would prefer it to avoid the crowded Malacca Straits.</p>

Miracle Baby, or what?" asked Evelyn Page, 31, who  gave birth Saturday, 8 1/2 months into her pregnancy, after being shot with a  small-caliber firearm. Page, who also was in satisfactory condition, said she  was shot by a man who accosted her on the street and demanded that she get into  his car.  </P> <P> "I knew my baby had been shot, the way my baby started moving in me," Page  said. "My baby started moving real fast. She kicked the whole time."  </P> <P> The infant, delivered by Cesarean section, underwent surgery to remove the  bullet shortly after birth. The bullet broke a rib but did not damage internal  organs.  </P></p>

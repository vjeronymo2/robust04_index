			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in  Japanese at 2238 GMT on 5 February carries, during its weekly  "News 2001" program, a 74-minute interview with Shinseito  Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. The program, which is moderated  by Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama, includes regular guests  freelance commentator Kenichi Takemura and Keio University  Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi.    At 2239 GMT, regarding the process of proposing the national  welfare tax announced by Prime Minister Hosokawa, Ozawa says the  tax reform system has been discussed among the ruling coalition  parties for a long time, and the proposed tax did not crop up  suddenly. He notes the need for substantial discussion on the  tax system. Takemura, noting Social Democratic Party of Japan  (SDPJ) opposition to the Hosokawa-proposed national welfare tax,  says the media have reported that two or three people, including  Ozawa, decided on the tax without consulting with the SDPJ. In  reply, Ozawa says the proposed tax was announced after  discussion among the coalition parties. Asked about the timing  for deciding on ways to raise funds for the tax cuts, Ozawa  says: "I have no objection to spending several years in making  the decision. However, implementing tax cuts repeatedly until  then by issuing deficit-covering national bonds incontinently is  very bad for the future of Japan. This is like a drug. Issuing  deficit-covering national bonds is the easy way out."    At 2249 GMT, Kazuhide Uekusa, a laboratory man at the  Stanford University, in a satellite relay from Los Angeles,  gives his views on the U.S. stance with the 11 February  Japan-U.S. summit approaching. Asked how the current situation  concerning the tax debate will affect relations between Japan  and the United States in future, Ozawa says: "It is true that  this is of no benefit to Japan-U.S. relations. However, I  believe the United States is coolly considering whether it is  appropriate for it to attack Japan out of spite at the present.  Meanwhile, in Japan, serious discussion should be held among  the people on the tax system or funds for tax cuts." On the  policy-deciding system of the ruling coalition, he says: "There  is no problem with the system."    At 2255 GMT -- following a two-minute commercial break --  Ozawa discusses the national welfare tax, social welfare, the  tax system, and other general topics. He says the  Hosokawa-proposed national welfare tax is necessary to prepare  for the upcoming aging society. Explaining the current tax  system, Ozawa states the balance between direct and indirect  taxes has to be rectified, and stresses the need to improve the  pension and medical security systems. He casts doubt on the  effect of income tax reduction as an economic pump-priming  measure, saying: "Tax reduction for policy purposes, such as  tax cuts concerning housing and land, is more effective" in  revitalizing the economy. He then explains how the current  preferential taxation system has to be remedied.    Matsuyama asks about the possibility that Shinseito and  Komeito will merge as a prelude to reorganization of the  political world. Ozawa replies: "It is impossible. The mass  media are trying to emphasize the Shinseito-Komeito line. There  is no possibility that our party will ally with Komeito to take  the lead in doing something." Ozawa also denies the possibility  that the ruling coalition and the Liberal Democratic Party will  merge to form a large coalition.    On what Japanese society ought to be like, he states that a  society in which personal ability is displayed and personal  imagination is developed should be established.    At 2336 GMT, Ozawa comments on the threat of the DPRK's  nuclear programs and Japan's crisis control. He says: "I think  (North Korea) definitely has nuclear arms. Therefore, it has  delayed talks with the United States on one pretext or another.  There is no progress in the talks. It has been said that the  country is just playing for time. I do not think the country  will accept the IAEA's full-scale inspection of its nuclear  facilities. I think its nuclear arms have already been  completed." He predicts a power struggle after Kim Il-song  steps down, and notes the possibility that there might be  upheaval on the Korean peninsula. In this connection, Ozawa  says: "There is no crisis control system in Japanese society."  Reviewing Japan's diplomacy at the time of the Persian Gulf  war, Ozawa says Japan lacks the ability to make a quick decision  on diplomatic affairs. He questions what Japan would do if the  DPRK took military action and the United Nations, led by the  United States, tried to deal with it. Ozawa stresses that it is  important for politicians to make a quick decision and to act  responsibly.    At 2350 GMT -- following a two-minute commercial break -- In  reply to a question sent via fax by MAINICHI SHIMBUN special  editor Takao Iwami, Ozawa says the priority political task from  the medium- to-long term viewpoint is to change the current  political structure and to establish a political system that  prevents Japan from being isolated in the international  community. The interview winds up at 2352 GMT after Ozawa  stresses the need for all people to cooperate in carrying out  political reform.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG) -- Serbian Radical  Party [SRS] Chairman Vojislav Seselj said today that military  effects of the NATO air strikes were "completely insignificant"  and that they only caused civilian casualties. [passage omitted]    Seselj added that there were 180 Muslim casualties in the  air  strikes. "Nobody has won a war using air strikes. If the war  continues the Muslims will be completely defeated and will be  left without anything," he said.    The radical leader said that the SRS decided that for the  time being "there will be no retaliation against Italy,"  although NATO aircraft took off from air bases in that country.  He explained it by the fact that the Italian Government has not  yet been formed.    Seselj welcomed Silvio Berlusconi's election victory and  said  that it was an old wish of the radicals that the two countries  have a joint border in the western part of the Balkans.    He expects that Berlusconi, "as an Italian patriot," will  not  sacrifice the interests of his country, but will oppose the use  of Italian territory for NATO aircraft take-offs.    The leader of the Radicals explained that the SRS deputies  had walked out of the Yugoslav Assembly's session out of protest  that a parliamentary discussion would not be held about the text  of a declaration on the bombing of the Serb positions near  Gorazde.    He believes that it was the Serbian president who did not  want the session to be held, for it would prove, according to  Seselj, that "Slobodan Milosevic was most to blame for the  bombing -- he was yielding more and more as the Western powers  were setting increasingly unscrupulous demands."    As regards the withdrawing of CNN and AFP correspondents'  accreditations, Seselj said he wondered why this had not been  done earlier.</p>

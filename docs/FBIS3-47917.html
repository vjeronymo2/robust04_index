The article says:  This is well illustrated by the serious crisis the  imperialists now are undergoing.    Above all, socio-class antagonisms have grown worse in the  imperialist countries because of the reactionary and corrupt  nature of the capitalist system.    The capitalist political system is a political system and  order which was framed up by a handful of the capitalist class  to oppress and exploit the popular masses who account for an  overwhelming majority of the population. Hence, the class  antagonisms between the reactionary ruling class and the popular  masses are increasing day by day.    In 1992 alone violent protests of dissatisfied workers  against the reactionary policy of the government took place in  the United States on 111,000 occasions. This graphically shows  to what extent the socio-class antagonisms have gone in  imperialist countries.    With the money-is-everything tendency fully reflected in  politics, plutocracy is holding sway in capitalist society. In  Japan, the cabinet had to resign and the Diet was dissolved  before the expiry of its term repeatedly due to bribery cases  involving political circles including the "Lockheed scandal".    Economic crisis is deteriorating in imperialist countries.    The annual federal financial deficits of the United States  are more or less 300 billion dollars and the state debts far  exceed 4,000 billion dollars.    The economy in Britain, Japan, Germany, France and other  countries is also floundering like a ship in distress. Japan is  now in the grip of worst depression since World War II, which  gives a glimpse of the society of this country seized with  uncontrollable uncertainty for the future.    The serious crisis of the imperialists is also manifested in  all cases of corruption and social vices rife in these countries.    The United States called the "drug kingdom" has more than 30  million addicts.    Violent criminal cases like murder and robbery are getting  more uncontrollable in the imperialist countries.    The imperialists, with false propaganda about the "end of  socialism," are trying to divert elsewhere the public attention  from the serious crisis of destruction they are now undergoing,  cause ideological vacillation among the revolutionary people of  the world who aspire after independence, progress and socialism  and to break their faith in socialism so as to stem the tide of  history. But this is a foolish dream.</p>

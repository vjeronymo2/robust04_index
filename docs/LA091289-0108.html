			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> $370 GIVEN TO BRING INJURED BOY'S MOTHER FROM VIETNAM  </P> <P> Friends and teammates, aided by school administrators, raised $370 Monday in an  effort to bring the mother of a La Quinta High School football player from  Vietnam to the United States to see her critically injured son, possibly for  the last time.  </P> <P> Kiet Le, a 16-year-old sophomore at La Quinta, was rushed to UCI Medical Center  in Orange Friday after he collapsed during a junior varsity football game. Kiet  underwent brain surgery Friday night to remove a blood clot, and he has not  regained consciousness. He was on life support systems Monday in the intensive  care unit.  </P> <P> Kiet has not seen his mother in 11 years, according to La Quinta principal  Andrew McTaggart. Kiet has been living with his father and sister in  Westminster. It was not known Monday why his mother could not emigrate to the  United States with the rest of the family.  </P> <P> "We made posters and boxes and put them around the quad area at school," said  senior Wes Kollar, a close friend and teammate of Kiet. "We wanted to do  something for the family. People donated their lunch money and everything."  </P> <P> The $370 that students raised Monday will go to the family to help pay for an  airline ticket and other expenses for the mother, whose name was not  immediately known, Kollar said. "We're probably going to double that tomorrow,"  he said of the amount raised.  </P> <P> McTaggart, who was at the game Friday, said that Kiet took the field with the  punt return unit, but, before play began, he staggered across the line of  scrimmage and collapsed.  </P> <P> School officials have contacted U.S. government officials in an attempt to  expedite the process by which Kiet's mother would enter the country. According  to McTaggart, she is already on a waiting list and had been scheduled to  emigrate in November.  </P> <P> "They are trying to intervene through various channels to get her here now,"  McTaggart said. "It's still in channels, and we're waiting to see if we can  clear everything up."  </P> <P> Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who was asked to assist, has made  contact with the various agencies involved, McTaggart said.  </P> <P> Attempts also have been made to contact the Vietnamese mission to the United  Nations as well as the U.S. embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, McTaggart added.  </P> <P> "Congressman Dornan has been working extensively to communicate through  channels," McTaggart said, adding that Dornan said he has alerted the White  House in an effort to expedite the mother's arrival here.  </P> <P> Kollar said that Kiet is friendly to everyone and is always willing to lend a  hand, both on the field and off.  </P> <P> "Last summer during football practice, the coach said he needed someone to play  backup quarterback and Le volunteered," Kollar said, adding that Kiet did not  really have the throwing skills needed to play the position.  </P> <P> "He didn't have a clue what he was doing" as quarterback, Kollar said. "After a  couple of days, the coach finally got another guy who was better at it. Kiet  was sure happy about that; he'd had enough."  </P> <P> McTaggart met with team members Monday morning to tell them about Kiet's  condition and about the efforts to bring his mother to the United States.  </P> <P> His friends on the team stayed together after the meeting. "About 10 of us, his  closest friends, stayed through second period," Kollar said. "We said a little  prayer and talked about the good stuff Le has done."  </P></p>

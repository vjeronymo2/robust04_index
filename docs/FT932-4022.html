			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure mounts over oil tax PRESSURE yesterday mounted on the government to alter the changes in petroleum revenue tax announced in the April Budget. More than 20 MPs gathered at a meeting organised by Mr Cranley Onslow, former chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, to hear complaints from the oil industry that it was already losing contracts as a result of the government's decision. In the Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, announced an end to oil companies' rights to set their exploration costs against their total petroleum revenue tax bill. The effect will be to increase sharply the cost of exploration for companies which have been able to take advantage of the PRT offset.</p>

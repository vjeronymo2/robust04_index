			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Letter: Why company well-being is a priority for banks Sir, As you would expect I totally disagree with the letter from Jeremy Parker (April 15) suggesting the clearing banks were often too tardy in helping ailing companies. We currently have some 400,000 small business customers on our books and are deeply committed to ensuring that our customers' well-being is a top priority - it has to be in order to guarantee our own future as a viable company. Mr Parker chides us for not using our 'early warning systems' to detect the first signs of decline in the quality of security. In many respects we are largely in the hands of the companies themselves - in a recession the most ominous sign to a good bank manager can be the total lack of contact with a business customer. As one of my branch managers in central London put it recently: 'It's when I don't hear from customers that I start to worry.' That said, there are many forms of assistance we can and do give - and we constantly remind customers to come to their bank manager at the first signs of problems. Peremptory calling in of borrowing may only lose the bank both its investment and its customers. PH Nunnerley, assistant general manager, Lloyds Bank, Canons House, Canons Way, Bristol</p>

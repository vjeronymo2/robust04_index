			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Standards organisation finds itself on trial: The resignation of its chief executive and impending government scrutiny signal a shake-up for the BSI IN THE space of two weeks the British Standards Institution, which writes standards for industry, has lost its chief executive after a boardroom row and the government has ordered a review of the institution and its activities. BSI says the two events were unconnected. But for an organisation with a profile low to the point of invisibility, this sudden flurry of activity suggests that something is amiss. As well as having a monopoly in co-ordinating the writing of standards, BSI carries out product testing and certification in competition with dozens of independent laboratories and commercial certification companies. The combination of these activities  - BSI's German and French counterparts are responsible only for writing standards  - has turned BSI into a large and profitable business. It made an operating surplus of Pounds 7.5m last year on turnover of Pounds 74m and employs more than 2,000 people. Its new quality assurance standard, BS5750, adopted by about 20,000 British bussineses, has proved a money-spinner, contributing nearly half of turnover and two thirds of the surplus. There has been growing controversy over BS5750, however. Small businesses in particular say it is bureaucratic and inappropriate to their needs. They have forced BSI to set up a committee to review the issue. Meanwhile, there is increasing demand for Europe-wide standards. Countries which take the lead in writing European and international standards  - the UK, Germany and France each account for more than 20 per cent of international standards  - can gain considerable competitive advantage. Highly profitable though it is, BSI's transformation from a quasi Civil Service bureaucracy into a commercial organisation has been recent and has involved considerable  - as yet unfinished  - changes. Mr Michael Sanderson, formerly managing director of AWD Bedford Trucks, was brought in as BSI's first chief executive 18 months ago to spearhead its modernisation and 'lead a major programme of cultural change'. BSI's cumbersome committee structure was simplified to speed decision making. Mr Sanderson resigned on June 1 over what the company called 'a deep disagreement with the board on important matters of policy and management'. Neither side would comment further, although there is a suspicion among industry observers that Mr Sanderson was not pushing change at a fast enough rate. Barely had Mr Sanderson cleared his desk when Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced a government review of BSI, its funding and the issue of standards writing. He has called into question whether such a profitable organisation needs the Pounds 4.5m annual government subsidy it receives, whether the standards it writes are of sufficiently high quality and how industry's input should be organised. The government estimates that industry's contribution to standards writing amounts to Pounds 200m in the form of expert time provided to the standards drafting committees. The government wants to know if standards contribute to the competitiveness of British industry and what BSI's role should be now that European and international standards are becoming more important than national standards. Mr Derek Prior, communications manager, said BSI received much less government support than its Continental counterparts and 'could produce a plan for survival without a government grant.' He dismissed the suggestion that the move to European and international standards could threaten BSI  - instead it increased the need for strong national standards bodies to represent national interests, he said. BSI may have survived previous official reviews unscathed, but the present government is committed to privatisation and to saving money where it can, and BSI's mounting profitability may increase its chances of being privatised.</p>

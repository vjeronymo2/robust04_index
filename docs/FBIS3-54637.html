"We firmly believe that people need to follow our course  toward an economic union within the CIS framework, a single  ruble zone with Russia, and coordinated customs space as an  opportunity and necessity to live and work in a civilized way,"  he said today at a reception for diplomats accredited in Minsk.    The premier said: The basis of our foreign policy is giving  up force and a threat of force and giving up nuclear weapons.  "We were the first among the former USSR republics and among the  world's states in general, who, without putting forward any  preliminary conditions to the world community, began nuclear  disarmament. By doing this, we laid our own little brick in the  common foundation for European and international security. At  the same time, we are not expecting any gratitude from the world  community. The main thing for us is trust, mutual  understanding, and an opportunity for full-blooded international  cooperation," he said.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Rate reductions in ERM Leading currencies took a back seat yesterday as interest shifted to Spain and Belgium, which both announced rate cuts, writes Philip Gawith. The weakness of the D-Mark provided a favourable environment for other European countries to reduce borrowing costs. Both the Belgian franc and Spanish peseta appreciated against the D-Mark after announcing official rate cuts. Analysts yesterday agreed that the two rate cuts formed part of a continuing pattern for countries across Europe to chip away at interest rates without a Bundesbank lead. They lent further support to the view that currency movements, especially within the ERM, are now more a reflection of economic fundamentals than interest rate differentials. The Belgian franc ended against the D-Mark yesterday at BFr20.69, up from Monday's close of BFr20.81, as the market welcomed a 10 basis-point cut in the central rate to 7 per cent. Dealers said that last Friday's resignation of three socialist politicians following a corruption scandal, and the weekend cabinet reshuffle, had calmed the markets, giving the Belgian National Bank room for a rate cut. Currency and money market dealers said the central bank had room to reduce rates further, but were likely to act cautiously. Apart from lowering its key central rate, the bank cut its overnight lending rate to other banks to 8.6 per cent from 8.7 per cent. The rate changes - the second this month - took immediate effect. Analysts said Belgian short-term interest rates were still much higher than in neighbouring countries. The three-month short-term rate spread over Germany is currently at about 100 basis points compared with zero or even slightly below German rates before the near collapse of the ERM last summer. The performance of the peseta after the rate cut underlined the weak sentiment towards the D-Mark. The D-Mark traded at 81.4 pesetas before the cut, but fell to finish at 80.94 pesetas. The German currency lost ground across the board on the crosses in Europe, reflecting continuing speculation of a near-term cut in German rates, said traders. Inflation figures from Baden-Wuerttemburg of 3.6 per cent, down from 4.0 per cent, reinforced the view that overall German inflation figures, expected Friday, will provide the Bundesbank with enough reason to relax German monetary policy. Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, said the market was currently reflecting a shift in sentiment against the D-Mark rather than being driven by any hard news. 'The Bundesbank is not convincing anyone of its ability to underpin the currency.' Mr Parsons said the 'general disenchantment' with the Bundesbank was shown by the fact that the dollar was again approaching the DM1.7565 level, the high reached on January 18. The dollar closed in London at DM1.7528, up from DM1.7504. Mr Parsons added: 'The Bundesbank is fighting old battles. It should be fighting the growth battle, not the interest rate battle.' However, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank deputy president, yesterday underlined that the Bundesbank would cut its leading interest rates further only when key economic trends are in line with its goals. Speaking at Bochum University in Germany, he said: 'If the data position - and that means the money supply in particular - develops in conformity with our goals, we will undertake further interest rate cuts.' The US currency had another quiet day in Europe, dealers reporting minimal turnover and a marked lack of interest. The US Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose in January to 83.2 per cent, slightly lower than market expectations, but still stronger than any reading in 1993. Analysts said it augured well for consumer spending in the months ahead. The dollar opened slightly higher in New York against the D-Mark, but softer against the yen. The Japanese currency was under less pressure than during the past two trading sessions. Dealers said the yen had obtained support from reports that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had persuaded his opponents to discuss a compromise package of political reform measures. The yen closed in London at Y111.155 per dollar, up from Monday's Y111.825. New York trading ended with the dollar at DM1.7483 and Y110.93. Sterling had a quiet day, finishing slightly easier in London against the dollar at Dollars 1.494, from Dollars 1.496 on Monday. It rose fractionally against the D-Mark to DM2.6187 from a previous DM2.6185. The pound was still unaffected by the political row over higher taxes in Britain. Meanwhile, in a written parliamentary answer Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, ruled out sterling's return to the ERM during the current parliament. 'Sterling's re-entry to the ERM could not be considered until there is greater convergence between the monetary policies appropriate for all the community economies,' he said. The Bank of England provided the UK money market with around Pounds 40m sterling of unspecified late assistance, bringing total help for the day to Pounds 1.615bn. This compared with its forecast liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.7bn. In its early operations the Bank bought Pounds 1.3bn of bills at the established repo rate of 5 13/32 . It provided Pounds 275m in normal operations at 5 3/8 per cent.</p>

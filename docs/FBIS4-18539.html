			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader </F> of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, by correspondent  Liisa Linsioe in Helsinki; date not given; Recording of  Zhirinovskiy fading into report within quotation marks]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] "Our party has never had and  does not have territorial demands on Finland. Finland is and  always will be an independent country, but it is very unpleasant  if Finland wants to join NATO or some other military alliance  acting against Russia. Membership in NATO would only bring  corpses for Finland. As Russia and NATO would be brought into  war against each other, Finland would be the battlefield and  that is very regrettable. I know that efforts are now being  made to incorporate our neighboring countries Poland and the  Baltics into NATO. That is very regrettable from our point of  view."    Having arrived in Finland, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy denies his  earlier demands for Finland to be incorporated into Russia and  for the borders valid during the czar era to be restored. We do  not want to revive the western borders of the Russian empire, we  support the resolutions of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe held in Helsinki in 1975. Together with  other countries, Russia has ratified and signed the Helsinki  agreement.    A remark by Zhirinovskiy that the October Revolution was  illegal and that Russia must restore the prerevolution borders  nevertheless contradicts this statement. At his party congress  [words indistinct] Zhirinovskiy showed a map indicating that  Finland belongs to Russia and this was also included in the  resolutions of the Liberal Democratic Party. Having arrived in  Finland, Zhirinovskiy has not let lie the demands for a return  of Karelia.    "You have a successor who seeks to restore Karelia to  Finland, but Karelia belongs to Russia. As you know,  territorial demands only lead to war. You can see what is  happening in the Balkans, in Central Asia, the Middle East. We  must [word indistinct], be quiet and moderate."    Zhirinovskiy is voicing language policy demands to Finland.    "I think it would be a good thing if the Russian language  were to become the third official language in Finland. I said  that when I visited this country three years ago. Why do you  have Swedish as the second language? At the least, write street  names in Russian, and restaurant menus. Open a Russian school.  Three years ago I asked for the Russian sixth form college to be  reopened and why do you keep the Russian church as a storeroom,  Zhirinovskiy asks. He does not even listen; although, it is  explained to him that Helsinki does have both a Russian school  and an Orthodox church, which are doing quite well."    Zhirinovskiy is boasting about his relations with the  Finno-Ugric nations living in Russia. In the elections, he  received quite a lot of votes from our distant relatives,  because Zhirinovskiy promised to retain the kolkhozes, knowing  that the Ugrians of Russia fear the privatization of agriculture.    "I am a member of the cultural society of Udmurtia, and we  are well disposed towards your kindred nations the Udmurts, the  Khants, Manses, and Maris, but you Finns do not care about your  relatives. You only distance yourselves from them. Following on  this, Zhirinovskiy reiterates his previous suggestion to be  allowed to send Russian children from St. Petersburg to Lapland  to celebrate New Year. Let us jointly develop trade and sports,  he suggests. But if some general in your country demands that  Karelia shall be reincorporated into Finland, the result will be  only corpses, Zhirinovskiy threatens."    Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, who has been granted  dictatorial powers by his own party for the next 10 years, is  already preparing at full speed for the next presidential  elections, but nevertheless he does not show his cards for  Yeltsin to see. Zhirinovskiy denies rumors that Yeltsin is sick  and is no longer capable of discharging his duties. This is  what Zhirinovskiy has to say about Yeltsin:    "Boris Nikolayevich is feeling fine, do not nurse any hopes  that he would leave his post somehow. He will last until the  end of term. After 12 June, there will be another president in  the country. Our president, our nation, and our Army too are  feeling fine. Hopefully, your president too is feeling fine and  will live long. President Yeltsin is only cunning and now and  again he plays a sick man, Zhirinovskiy claims. It is rumored  that he is after all a good friend of Boris Yeltsin."    In Zhirinovskiy's view, France's ban on Zhirinovskiy is  linked to Russia's internal political struggle for power.  France is defending tooth and nail the democrats in Russia,  Zhirinovskiy claims:    "[words indistinct] They understand it is impossible to stop  me in my country. They are trying to thwart my support in my own  country, but they will not succeed. They cannot stop me. They  do not order what the Russians should think and whom they should  support. It is better for me to be at home in Russia among my  own voters, because that is where I am doing political work."    Zhirinovskiy boasts that he represents the views of the  majority in the Russian parliament, the Duma. In voting, we  receive a majority with the support of the communists, farmers,  and small groups, he says. This is indeed true when one follows  voting in the Russian Duma.    The democratic members of the delegation say that they  disagree completely with Zhirinovskiy for example on NATO, the  Council of Europe, and Finland, but the big-mouthed chairman of  the Liberal Democratic Party interrupts their talk, claiming  that they got into the Russian Duma by fraudulent means. In  this way Vladimir Zhirinovskiy floors his opponents:    "We received 50, as much as 70 percent of all votes in the  elections. They, my opponents, stole my votes and for that  reason they are now in the Duma quite illegally. There are  groups who should not be in the Duma at all, but after the next  elections they will no longer be there, claims Mr. Zhirinovskiy.  Then the Liberal Democrats' number of representatives in the  Duma will total 300 out of 450 seats. There will no longer be  any democrats in the next Duma, we will see to that,  Zhirinovskiy boasts."    He declares that he is a convinced opponent of western  democracy.    "Russia does not have any model countries, we go our own  way.  I did not come here to Finland to learn from you, I have  nothing to learn. I am ready to teach you if you so wish. We in  Russia do not need the Council of Europe or NATO, but if they  need Russia, then let them learn from us. Recently in Moscow we  set up a pan-Slav parliament that unites Eastern Europe.  Finland could join that too, Zhirinovskiy suggests."    It is vain to explain to him that the Finns are not a Slav  nation.    The Finnish unemployment problem brings out the  schadenfreude  in Zhirinovskiy.    "You now have half a million unemployed, soon they will be 1  million, unless you want economic cooperation with us. We will  then have cooperation with Sweden if our cooperation is not good  enough for Finland."    In breach of all agreements signed by Russia, Zhirinovskiy  demands that the Baltics be reincorporated into Russia. He  swears that the Russian troops will remain in the Baltics as  Russia's outpost picket. He claims that the states that have  separated from Russia are all the time rejoining. That is what  Tajikistan, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and so forth are now  doing.    To Mr. Zhirinovskiy, NATO's Partnership for Peace is mere  bluffing by which small states are deceived. It is only the  porch into NATO, he claims. Russia was deceived when the Warsaw  Treaty was wound up, because NATO was not wound up at the same  time, but NATO will fall, Zhirinovskiy forecasts. When the  Liberal Democratic Party gains power in Russia, Russia will  leave the United Nations and the center of Europe will be in  Russia.    The intervention of the other parliamentary deputies in the  talking makes Zhirinovskiy angry. He leaves the news conference  very angry.    Zhirinovskiy leaves angrily when the reporters began to  interview other members of the delegation. To them Zhirinovskiy  is quite an embarrassing representative in the Russian  parliament.

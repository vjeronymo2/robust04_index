			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Unison members to strike NEARLY 200 nurses at University College Hospital in London are to strike today in protest against closure plans. The nurses, members of Unison, the public services union, said they expected to be supported in their action by ancillary workers and administrative staff. Nurses who are members of the Royal College of Nursing will not be taking action. The action follows a proposal by the Camden and Islington Health Authority to withdraw its service contract from UCH and from the Middlesex Hospital, where Unison is balloting its members on a one-day stoppage on Thursday. Unison said the authority move would in effect close both hospitals.</p>

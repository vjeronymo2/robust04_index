			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAILING  </P> <P> Just in time for Mother's Day, Tiffany &amp; Co. at South Coast Plaza has begun  carrying its new perfumed bath collection.  </P> <P> The collection -- which includes five new products -- marks the Fifth Avenue  jeweler's entree into bath products and extends Tiffany's fragrance line that  was launched in 1987.  </P> <P> "The fragrance market hasn't grown in terms of consumer-unit sales over the  last 5 years," said Susan Sussman, Tiffany's vice president of fragrance. "It's  a very tough, competitive environment. . . . The only way to be successful is  by being better."  </P> <P> Of course, new products can also bring new customers.  </P> <P> Introducing a collection of bath products also makes sense, considering that  the bath business is more than 25% of the lucrative fragrance industry.  </P> <P> Tiffany's bath-collection line includes scented body creme, body lotion, bath  and shower gel and dusting powder that comes with a swan's down puff. All of  them come in square containers that mimic the shape of the Art Deco facade of  Tiffany's flagship store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.  </P> <P> Prices for those "luxury accessories" -- as Tiffany has dubbed them -- range  from $40 to $75 for 5 ounces.  </P></p>

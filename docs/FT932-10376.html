			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Special Report on Clocks, Watches and Jewellery: Classics still dominate - Antique Clocks and Watches THE PAST year started as a frustrating one in the market for second-hand clocks and watches, governed as it by a long wait for an upturn. More recently there have been traces of a silver lining - in the shape of an overhaul of international exchange rates following Black (or White?) Wednesday. Since then the mood has been distinctly more upbeat for the first time since the dizzy heights of late 1989/early 1990. The big names - Patek Philippe, Rolex, Vacheron &amp; Constantin, Audemars Piguet, Lange, Breguet and Cartier - still dominate the field, with the most sought-after models being the complicated and technical models. Cartier watches were feared to have peaked a year ago but this has proved not to be the case. A pre-war Driver watch, curved to the wrist for easier reading at the wheel, sold for Pounds 52,000 at Sotheby's Geneva in November, and a very rare eight-day watch sold for SFr170,000 (Pounds 75,000) as against a previous high of Dollars 98,000 (Pounds 63,630) Patek Philippe, commonly seen as the most 'blue chip' brand, has suffered recently from choosy collectors and its performance at auction remains patchy. Rectangular models are now back in fashion while square ones are still difficult to sell, but round models of particular complexity are making big prices. Standard Patek perpetual calendars in gold cases currently sell for about Pounds 18,000 compared with Pounds 20,000 in 1989/90. Their Officer's watch, brought out in 1989 to celebrate their 150th anniversary, was sold in one instance in January 1990 for Pounds 19,800; now it commonly makes Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 10,000 but this is still way above the original retail price of Pounds 4,700. Such premiums are a much rarer thing than they were although the Rolex Daytona Cosmograph Chronograph models and older, Rolex chronographs and vintage bubble-backs continue to be sought after. The Swatch, the ugly duckling of the collector's wristwatch market, is no longer a swan and indeed is now flying lower than before. No one has or is planning to hold a specialised sale or even a themed section in a sale this year. Only those in absolutely 'as new' condition and early 1983/4 prototypes seem sought-after. Ruth Zandberg of Christie's Geneva says new collectors are looking for 'early (pre 1700) watches' and Antiquorum has had some good results in this field. Sotheby's London enthuses about an exceptionally small clock watch of c1620 that automatically strikes the hours in passing; estimated at Pounds 80,000 in their forthcoming Harcourt sale. Prettily enamelled, it also has that essential extra ingredient - a bit of history - as it was given by Elizabeth of Bohemia, Charles I's tragic daughter better known as the Winter Queen. The antique clock market seems to have been playing a waiting game at the top end, while seemingly recession proof and quite active in lower ranges. Rumours are that some high-flying clocks should sell well this summer and if so this could flush more out on to the market. More and more activity these days takes place at antique fairs, which has enabled the public to look and buy at leisure and introduced new customers to individual dealers. London's well-established Grosvenor House (June 9-19) and Olympia Fine Art and Antique Fair (June 3-13) now in its 20th anniversary year, as well as the new British Antique Dealers Fair at the Duke of York's Headquarters (May 5-11) will have good horological showings. Clocks and watches can be a particularly fraught subject for the amateur sales-room hunter as goods at auction are sold 'as found'. Buying from a reputable dealer offers the reassurance of properly restored and overhauled pieces guaranteed under the Trades Descriptions Act.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, 12 Jun -- His Royal Highness Prince Sa'ud  al-Faysal, the minister of foreign affairs, said that he  conveyed a message from Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King  Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz to President Hafiz al-Asad of the Syrian  Arab Republic.    His Highness said: "President al-Asad gave me a message in  reply within the framework of the continuous coordination,  consultation and assessment of the situation in the region."  His highness the foreign minister said this in an exclusive  statement to the Syrian news agency after his meeting with the  Syrian president today.    He described his talks with President Hafiz al-Asad as  excellent. He stressed the need to end the fighting in Yemen,  and his highness said that "war cannot be an instrument for  cooperation between Arab societies." Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal  expressed the hope that the mission of Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN  special envoy to Yemen, would be successful, because it proceeds  from a general international concern to halt the fighting and  end the current bloody struggle between the two Yemens.    His highness stressed that all the disputed issues could be  settled peacefully on the basis of affection and brotherliness,  not fighting. He said: "War cannot be an instrument in  cooperation and cohesion between Arab societies. Proceeding  from this, we are all concerned with the need to end the  fighting as soon as possible. I have also noticed this concern  from our brothers in Syria".    His Royal Highness Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal left Damascus this  evening after a short visit to Syria.</p>

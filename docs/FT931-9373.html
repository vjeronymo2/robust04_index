			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / International Company News: Pinault in talks over disposal of retail arm PINAULT, the heavily-indebted French retail group run by Mr Francois Pinault, is in negotiations to sell Discol, one of its wholesale businesses, to Promodes, the French hypermarket chain. The disposal of Discol forms part of the divestment programme at Pinault, which has been selling assets in an attempt to reduce the FFr19bn (Dollars 3.5bn) net debt it incurred in its controversial bid for the Au Printemps department store chain. Discol is a substantial wholesaling business with 13 depots across France and annual sales of FFr2.7bn. However, it is a loss-making company with heavy debt of about FFr100m. The acquisition of Discol would turn Promodes into the largest wholesaler in France ahead of Metro, the German group. Promodes has substantial wholesaling interests through its Prodirest subsidiary which has 21 depots and annual sales of FFr1.5bn. Pinault hopes to raise FFr100m from the sale, according to an unconfirmed report in yesterday's edition of L'Agefi, the French financial newspaper, and wipe out Discol's FFr100m borrowings. The group yesterday disclosed a marginal fall in sales to FFr70.69bn last year from FFr70.83bn in 1991. Casino, another leading French hypermarket group, yesterday disclosed a 46.3 per cent increase in sales to FFr61.6bn in 1992 fuelled by last summer's acquisition of the Rallye hypermarket chain. Au Bon Marche, the department store group, produced sales of FFr25.16bn last year, although this can not be compared to 1991's FFr4.65bn sales because the company has been expanded by adding part of Mr Bernard Arnault's luxury goods interests. Credit Lyonnais, the French state-controlled bank, has signed an agreement with Vseobecna Uverova Banka, Slovakia's biggest bank, to set up a joint venture based in Bratislava, Reuter reports from Paris. Credit Lyonnais will have a 90 per cent stake in the new bank, to be called Credit Lyonnais Bank Slovakia, which will have initial capital of Dollars 10m.</p>

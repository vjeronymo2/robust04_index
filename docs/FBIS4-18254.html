			<p>BFN     [Text] Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special  coordinator on the Cyprus issue, said the United States will  continue to work hard toward both sides in Cyprus accepting the  confidence-building measures. In a statement made this morning  before leaving for Athens and Ankara, Lamb said significant  progress has been made. He added that just a few problems  remain, but he believes they can be resolved.    Asked whether responsibilities will be attributed for the  deadlock, Lamb said the problem is not responsibility or which  side will receive more advantages over the other. He said: The  issue is to break the deadlock and find a solution.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Foreign Office taps reserves for peacekeeping bill The Foreign Office is set to contribute Pounds 200m more than it budgeted for to United Nations peacekeeping operations this year, forcing it to draw on the government's Pounds 3.5bn contingency reserve. Mr Alastair Goodlad, Foreign Office minister, said in a Commons written answer that the Foreign Office diplomatic-wing cash limit on 'other external relations' for 1994-95 would be almost doubled from Pounds 211.4m to Pounds 415.5m. This was mainly to take account of contributions to UN peacekeeping operations. More than half the increase is attributable to the UN protection force in the former Yugoslavia. But contributions to UN operations as far afield as Haiti, Rwanda and Nagorno-Karabakh are also taken into account. The increase will spark concern among Tory right-wingers anxious to see public spending reduced in order to make room for early tax cuts. Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, said yesterday that he did not see why British taxpayers should foot the bill. 'We are involved in peacekeeping on behalf of the UN because our armed forces are arguably the most efficient in the world,' he said. 'Other wealthy countries with no troops in the region - for example Germany and Japan - should pay.' Mr Townend has long argued that the government should make deep cuts in Britain's foreign aid budget as part of a drive to rein in spend-ing. Foreign Office spending on peacekeeping has risen rapidly in recent years, multiplying seven-fold from Pounds 32m to Pounds 225m between 1990-91 and 1993-94. The Foreign Office used this year's departmental report to comment on the 'significant increase' in international peacekeeping activities which has been undertaken by the UN and other international bodies. It noted that such operations 'cannot be planned for in advance'.</p>

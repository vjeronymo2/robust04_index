			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Faysal Makram, Iqbal 'Abdallah, Shafiq al-Asadi, </F> and Muhammad 'Allam: "Sanaa Confirms Advance Toward Aden;  Southerners Repel Attacks"]    [Excerpts] Sanaa, Aden, Abu Dhabi, Cairo -- The fighting  between northern and southern forces in Yemen -- which has  entered its third week -- expanded and became fiercer yesterday.  Sanaa confirmed yesterday that its forces were advancing toward  Aden to tighten the siege around it from three directions. It  said that the forces have now moved beyond the al-'Anad base.  While Aden said that southern forces "have dealt crushing  blows" to northern forces, "compelling them to retreat toward  Kirsh" (45 km northwest of Aden). [passage omitted]    At the security level, a high-level military official in  Sanaa has told AL-HAYAH that government forces (northern) are  advancing toward Aden to tighten the military siege around the  city from three directions: north, east, and west. Government  forces "have now moved beyond the al-'Anad base having seized it  and extinguished the fires caused by the rockets fired on the  base from a 20-km distance until Wednesday night/Thursday  morning by Socialist Party sources (southern). After combing  al-'Anad base, government forces have begun to advance toward  al-Hawtah, capital of Lahij Governorate, where they will join  other forces which have advanced through al-Habilayn after  crossing the Socialist forces' fortifications in the southern  areas of al-Dali' Directorate, which they seized about 10 days  ago. Meanwhile other forces advanced on this axis yesterday  toward Aden."    The military official added that "government forces on the  eastern axis are engaged in fierce fighting with Socialist  forces in the al-'Alam area between Abyan and Aden Governorates.  They had arrived from Zanjibar (capital of Abyan Governorate)  from al-'Amaliqah units and other government forces backing them  on this axis." He pointed out that "a land and air attack on  government forces in the southeastern fringes of Abyan  Governorate was repelled when government forces shelled Aden  airport with rockets in the early hours of yesterday morning.  The government (northern) Air Force launched air strikes  against naval ships belonging to the Socialist Party, providing  a cover for the al-'Amaliqah forces' land attack toward the  al-'Alam area."    On the southeastern axis, the same source confirmed that  northern forces "are engaged in fighting with the Socialist  Salah-al-Din Brigade some 25 km from al-'Irqah port." Socialist  forces on this front "have suffered heavy losses in military  equipment, and are moving toward Aden."    He added that "government forces have since dawn yesterday  been engaged in fierce fighting with the 'Abbas and Taysir  Brigade at the approaches to 'Anaq in Shabwah Governorate." He  confirmed that the city "is about to be captured by government  forces."    Meanwhile, sources close to President Salih have confirmed  his demand that eight Socialist Party Political Bureau leaders  be handed over as a condition for a cease-fire, or that they  leave the country quickly. They are 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Haydar  al-'Attas, Salih Bin-Husaynun, Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, Haytham Qasim  Tahir, Salih 'Ubayd Ahmad, Qasim Yahya, Salih Munsir al-Sayli,  and Muthanna 'Askar. The president excluded from this condition  Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant secretary general of the  Socialist Party, and 14 other Socialist Party Political Bureau  members, most notably Jarallah 'Umar, culture minister; Anis  Hasan Yahya, head of the Socialist Party parliamentary bloc;  Fadl Muhsin, fish resources minister; Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah,  housing minister; and Ahmad 'Ali al-Salami, electricity minister.    The sources said that President Salih briefed the Arab  League  secretary general's two envoys when he met with them before they  left Sanaa for Cairo three days ago. [passage omitted]</p>

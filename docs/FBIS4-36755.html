			<p>BFN     [Text] The Interior Ministry's security agencies have  arrested 47 terrorists of a military wing linked with the  deceased terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam. Thus, the number of  suspects from the so- called al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [the  Islamic group] has risen to 145 terrorists, who represent the  basic echelon from which terrorists are assigned tasks in  assassinations and explosions in greater Cairo and the Upper  Egypt governorates.    The State Security Detective Agency conducted a series of  significant security operations, storming terrorist hideouts in  the governorates over the past days.    This group, whose members had participated in numerous  terrorist attacks, primarily the assassination of the secretary  of the State Security Detective Agency, Major General Ra'uf  Khayrat, was tracked down in complete secrecy. All the suspects  were arrested alive and the security authorities obtained  important confessions from them on the circumstances of the  crime and the monitoring and financing operations for which  terrorist Tal'at Hammam and many of his partners, both in and  outside the country, were responsible.    At the hideouts they raided in the governorates, which  number  more than 20, the authorities found automatic rifles, pistols,  explosive charges, and other equipment, plus many organizational  documents indicating foreign funding sources and the  organization's planned targets. About half a million pounds and  $80,000 were seized in the operation.</p>

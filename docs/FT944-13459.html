			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: DuPont chemical division jumps 97% in third term DuPont of the US, the world's largest chemical company, confirmed the strength of the cyclical upswing in its industry with a 97 per cent jump in third-quarter net earnings from its chemical operations overall. This was partly offset by a 5 per cent drop in earnings from its Conoco oil subsidiary. However, net earnings before extraordinary items were up 86 per cent at Dollars 680m. The rise in chemical profits was driven by higher volumes and by reduced fixed costs, the company said, with the two factors contributing equally. However, selling prices had remained flat in spite of sharp volume increases. The rise in group earnings was helped by a sharp turnround in DuPont's diversified businesses division, where profits jumped to Dollars 135m from Dollars 6m. The company said this was due to the recovery in its coal mining business, hit by strikes last year, and to better profits in agrochemicals and medical products. In DuPont's own narrowly defined chemicals division, earnings were up 126 per cent at Dollars 104m. Volume was up 9 per cent, made up of a 4 per cent rise in the US and a 27 per cent rise in the rest of the world. Prices were up 2 per cent. In the polymers division, earnings were up 149 per cent at Dollars 177m. Volume was up 15 per cent, made up of 11 per cent in the US and 21 per cent elsewhere. Prices were 1 per cent lower. Earnings in the fibres division were up 50 per cent at Dollars 164m. Volume was 6 per cent higher and prices were static. Oil earnings were down 5 per cent overall at Dollars 172m, made up of a 23 per cent drop in upstream earnings and a 22 per cent rise in downstream. Upstream operations were hit by lower gas volume, lower crude oil volume in the US and higher exploration costs. Downstream earnings were helped by higher US margins in refined products and more turnover at refineries. DuPont said that while chemicals prices were flat year on year, they were up modestly from their low point in the second quarter.</p>

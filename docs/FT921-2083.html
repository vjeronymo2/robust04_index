			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Cost of new curriculum is estimated at Pounds 1.5bn FULL introduction of the national curriculum will cost secondary schools more than Pounds 1.5bn with additional annual costs of almost Pounds 500m, according to a report yesterday from consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. That amounts to a first-year cost of about Pounds 224,000 for a typical secondary school, and Pounds 175,000 in the second year. Extra demands on staff account for most of those amounts, though none of the schools surveyed achieved those levels of expenditure. The report stresses that expenditure tends to lag significantly behind implementation - so that many of the costs will bear heavily on schools this year and next. The National Union of Teachers, which commissioned the report, said: 'The government has failed to fund its own reforms. It ensures there is nothing national about the national curriculum if all schools are resourced at different levels.' The national curriculum has been introduced during the past two years. An earlier report by Coopers said primary schools needed an extra Pounds 4.7bn over five years to fund implementation of the curriculum adequately.</p>

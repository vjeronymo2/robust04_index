			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / UK Gilts: Yields fall on strong institutional buying YIELDS continued to tumble on the back of strong buying by overseas and domestic institutions as expectations improved about the UK inflation outlook. Several big institutions were reported to be switching out of French government bonds into gilts, on the grounds that the UK securities look relatively cheap. Even with this Wednesday's biggest-ever gilt auction looming, the omens for more gilt-yield reductions in the coming months look reasonably good. That is assuming signs of price pressures in the economy remain thin on the ground. During the past week, many classes of gilts saw a yield reduction of about 10 basis points, with the moves being especially pronounced at the long end of the gilt curve. Comments at the end of the week by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that he was unlikely to cut base rates in the near future cut the momentum of the uptrend for short-dated securities. While French 10-year government bonds have seen yields drop nearly 50 basis points in the past month, gilts have almost matched this movement, with a yield fall of about 35 basis points. With 10-year gilt yields now about 7.7 per cent, compared with about 6.7 per cent for comparable French bonds, many investors can be excused for switching into the UK instruments. The difference between 10-year gilt yields and the comparable figure for German bonds has come down to about 1 percentage point from about 1.3 percentage points a month ago. Indications last week that the pace of the UK recovery has become more muted in recent months only added to the enthusiasm for gilt purchases, on the basis that a weak upturn is less likely to spark inflation. At the same time, there is little evidence that the UK is moving into a second leg of recession. This would be bad for the gilt market, which wants modest growth to erode the Pounds 50bn gap between government spending and revenues. The latest Confederation of British Industry survey of manufacturers, issued on Friday, was music to the ears of gilts practitioners. It showed that, after strong first-quarter growth, many companies have in the past two months become less confident about increasing sales volumes. The survey also indicated that inflationary pressures were subdued, with only few companies thinking they will increase prices over the next few months. Mr Leslie Gunde, chief economist at engineering company GKN and a member of the Treasury's industrial prospects committee, said: 'The recovery is going to be slower than previous upturns, but it is definitely happening.' Mr Ian Shepherdson, a bond specialist at brokers Greenwell Montagu, said the gilt market was generally cheered by Mr Clarke's approach in his first month as chancellor. 'He seems to be a growth man, but not so much that he's going to be irresponsible (by cutting interest rates quickly and sparking inflation)'. A sign of the interest in gilts last week was that, out of a tranche of Pounds 850m of bonds provided to the market by the Bank of England, the long-dated securities sold out within hours. While the market snapped up the Pounds 400m worth of 8 per cent stock maturing in 2013, there were fewer buyers for Pounds 300m of five-year bonds and Pounds 150m of long-dated index-linked securities. Only on Friday did the market appear fully to wake up to the implications of this week's gilt auction, when the Bank will be selling Pounds 3.25bn of 8 per cent bonds due in 2003. The small subsequent rise in yields along the curve - except for securities above the 15-year mark - was probably partly in anticipation of the price-reducing effects of such a large stock coming on to the market. Even with the effects of the Pounds 3bn or so a month of gilts likely to be sold over the next year, Mr Steven Bell of Deutsche Bank believes 10-year gilt yields will continue to fall to 7.3 per cent by next summer. He reckons five-year yields will also come down over this period, from 7.05 per cent to 6.4 per cent.</p>

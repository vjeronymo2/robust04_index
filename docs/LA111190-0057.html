			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH AND ECONOMY  </P> <P> I cannot let this moment slip by. I must repond to Roberts statement " . . .  the Democrats are hoping to engineer a crushing recession that the liberal  media will blame on Reagan, Bush and the rich."  </P> <P> Why doesn't Roberts put the blame where it fits? The Republicans, including  Neil Bush, made their mark on bringing about the recession.  </P> <P> Please, Prof. Roberts, don't give all of the credit to the Democrats for the  robbery tactics within the savings and loans and other dastardly rip-offs  perpetrated during the Reagan Administration and continuing during the Bush  "toss and putt" Administration.  </P> <P> Let's address our problems as a nation and not look for a scapegoat and deny  that the problems exist.  </P> <P> BILLYE LIGHTNER-HERNANDEZ  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

"Nearly 100,000 foreign workers are suffering from long  working hours and low wages, but most of them are here illegally  so their basic human rights are not properly protected by the  law," a CCEJ spokesman said.    Almost 100 CCEJ members joined a march to demand protection  for the human rights of foreign workers.</p>

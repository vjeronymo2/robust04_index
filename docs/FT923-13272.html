			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow stages recovery from early decline Wall Street AMID conflicting pressures, US share prices posted modest gains in thin trading yesterday as markets staged a recovery from early losses linked to weakness in bond prices and the dollar, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was ahead 6.75 at 3,337.31, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was slightly firmer on balance at 414.87, up 0.25. The Nasdaq composite put in the day's best performance, rising 2.42 to 570.22. Turnover on the New York SE was a meagre 149m shares, while rises outpaced declines by 978 to 738. Overnight losses on foreign markets combined with continued weakness in the dollar, linked to speculation that the Bundesbank may raise German interest rates; and these two with declining bond prices as the 30-year benchmark bond fell  1/2 point, pushing the yield back up to 7.67 per cent. All of this undermined early sentiment but some positive quarterly earnings reports helped prices recover by mid-morning. Bank stocks were a feature amid a string of well-received figures, although most of the early gains were erased later in the session by profit-taking. JP Morgan, after advancing more than Dollars 1 on news of a sharp rise in second-quarter profits from Dollars 231m a year ago to Dollars 385m, settled back to end unchanged at Dollars 61 5/8 . Chase Manhattan had an early rise but fell later to finish down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 27 7/8 in active trading, after the bank reported a net profit of Dollars 152m in the quarter, up from Dollars 132m at the same stage of 1991. First Chicago moved in a similar pattern, gaining ground before closing a net Dollars  5/8 off at Dollars 35 7/8 , having reported second-quarter profits of Dollars 68.2m, up 17 per cent from a year earlier. Also in financials, Federal National Mortgage Associ ation (Fannie Mae) rose early on, but ended down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 63 3/4 in turnover of more than  1/2 m shares, after news of record three-month profits of Dollars 402m, compared to Dollars 382m in the previous quarter. Alcoa firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 73 1/2 after the company reported a second-quarter loss of Dollars 30.6m after taking charges of Dollars 104.7m related, among other things, to employment reductions. IBM put on Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 97 7/8 on news that the computer group had entered an alliance with Siemens, of Germany, and Toshiba, of Japan, for the joint development of advanced semiconductor products. On the Nasdaq market, Spartan Motors plummeted Dollars 6 7/8 to Dollars 13 5/8 in heavy trading after the company warned that second-quarter earnings would come in between 28 and 34 cents a share, well below market expectations. Century Medicorp jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 19 after stating that it was negotiating the terms of a stock swap acquisition by another, as yet unnamed but larger, healthcare company. Canada TORONTO stocks closed steady after a day of light trading activity. The TSE 300 index edged up 1.7 to 3,449.2 and advancing issues led declines by just 272 to 244. Volume came to 18.9m shares. The real estate group posted the day's biggest decline, 1.91 per cent. One of the sub-group's most heavily weighted stocks, Cambridge Shopping Centres, fell CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 15 1/2.</p>

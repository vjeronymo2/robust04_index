			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria said on Monday  that the National Police [PN] will continue to function until  the territorial and functional deployment of the PNC [National  Civilian Police] is completed; the process, he said, could last  into 1995.    According to the peace agreements, the PN must be dismantled  by October. Nevertheless, Santamaria pointed out that a total  demobilization may be delayed until December, depending on the  PNC deployment process. He gave assurances that the FMLN  [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] had agreed to this,  but former guerrilla member Leonel Gonzalez denied the assertion.    [Begin recording] [Gonzalez] To extend the PN's existence is  to lend institutional support to the crime problem.    [Unidentified reporter] Is there a pact between the  government and FMLN to postpone the PN's demise, yes or no?    [Gonzalez] Such a pact does not exist. There is no pact.  [end recording]    The FMLN leader said this matter is among the issues most  widely debated by both sides, but no specific agreement has been  reached thus far.    The FMLN does not intend to reschedule the PN's  demobilization and is thus requesting that the PNC be deployed  more rapidly.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] What we have agreed upon so far  is  that the deployment must conclude by September. By September,  approximately 5,700 troops must be trained and deployed. The  deployment must conclude at latest in September or October and  the PN must disappear. [end recording]    Gonzalez said the PN issue will be discussed in depth with  UN  mediation because the government intends to transfer  approximately 1,300 PN members to the PNC in addition to the  quota established in the peace agreements.</p>

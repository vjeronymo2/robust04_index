			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RTD MAY OFFER 2 WEEKS OF FREE RIDES ON BLUE  LINE  </P> <P> Transit officials, eager to attract customers to try the Blue Line light-rail  system, are considering offering two weeks of free rides when the new trains  start running Saturday between Long Beach and downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> RTD Board President Nick Patsaouras, who will present the proposal to the  11-member board today, said suspending the $1.10 fare will encourage ridership.  </P> <P> He said that while the Blue Line could lose up to $100,000 by offering free  rides for two weeks, it was well worth the investment to promote the rail  system.  </P> <P> "We have billions riding on this line," Patsaouras said. "We must take extra  steps to make it safe, keep it graffiti-clean and . . . get people hooked into  it."  </P> <P> Originally, the board had planned to offer free rides for the first two days of  the Blue Line's operation. Officials have projected between 5,000 and 7,000  people a day will ride the Blue Line in its initial weeks.  </P></p>

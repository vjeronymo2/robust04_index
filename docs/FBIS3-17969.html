He said that his commission has demanded the resignation  of Deputy Prime Ministers Mikalay Kostsikaw and Stanislaw Bryl;  Uladzimir Radkevich, head of the State Committee for Foreign  Economic Relations; chairman of the Board of the Belarusian  National Bank [Stanislaw Bahdankevich]; and Defense Minister  Pavel Kazlowski. However, A. Lukashenka did not present  specific facts, except in the case of Deputy Prime Minister  Stanislav Bryl. According to Lukashenka, S. Bryl pulled some  strings so that his son could receive a plot of land on which to  build a house. Deputy Prime Minister Mikalay Kostsikaw was one  of the people on Lukashenka's list that took advantage of  services rendered by the governments's renovation and  construction administration, and failed to pay the entire amount  of money charged by the administration. In addition, A.  Lukashenka said that his commission sent a letter to Belarusian  Prosecutor General Vasiliy Shaladonov with the request to see  that individuals mentioned earlier in the commission's report be  persecuted. There are 54 officials, including Foreign Minister  Pyotr Krawchanka, named in the report.</p>

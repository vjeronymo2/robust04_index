			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER;  </P> <P> NEWPORT PRODUCTION OF ORTON'S 'LOOT' FAILS TO DELIVER THE GOODS  </P> <P> Joe Orton's "Loot," a deliciously mordant farce revolving around an embalmed  corpse and a bank robbery, died on arrival over the weekend at the Newport  Theatre Arts Center.  </P> <P> This production needs an autopsy, not a review. Please consider the following a  coroner's report:  </P> <P> * The deceased was well-dressed and appeared to be in reasonable health at  first glance, a misapprehension quickly revealed at the onset of the dialogue.  </P> <P> * Despite actors who put on passable imitations of British accents, the lines  were almost invariably starved of their caustic wit through a fatal lack of  timing. Only the most obvious wisecracks survived.  </P> <P> * On opening night Friday, asphyxiation occurred by the end of the first act. A  shorter, faster-paced second act -- during which Orton explodes his lethal  package -- provided a few bracing twitches of momentary life before it, too,  expired.  </P> <P> * The ultimate cause of death was an all-too-common form of theatrical  strangulation, resulting from a combination of static direction, misread  characterizations and awkward casting.  </P> <P> Was there anything right with this production?  </P> <P> Not much. The players remembered their lines and were more than willing. The  set was serviceable, the costumes better than that, the lighting sufficient.  But a production made less resonant on the stage than the play is on the page  is not worth the ticket.  </P> <P> Orton's biting indictment of a totally corrupt and hypocritical society depends  on absurdities taken to extremes. The diabolical inner logic must be  underscored by stiletto-sharp execution or it culminates in little more than  the mannered trappings of a drawing-room comedy, albeit one with a maniacal  cast of characters.  </P> <P> "Loot" is not an easy farce to stage correctly even in England, where the  satire ought to be clearest. The 1965 world premiere in Cambridge flopped.  Trying to explain that, Orton biographer John Lahr has pointed to the premiere  production's cartoonish sets and campy acting.  </P> <P> The playwright himself believed "Loot" should be played absolutely straight, so  as to emphasize the contradictions among what the characters say, what they do  and who they are. " 'Loot' is a serious play," he wrote. "Unless (it) is  directed and acted seriously, the play will fail. As it failed in its original  touring version. A director who imagines that the only object is to get a laugh  is not for me."  </P> <P> Given the roles in "Loot" -- subversive caricatures really -- and the utterly  unrealistic plot, Orton's prescription for comic success would test the limits  of a professional company, to say nothing of a troupe of amateurs.  </P> <P> Besides the late Mrs. McLeavy -- played by a dummy that gets dumped out of its  coffin to make room for money stolen in a bank robbery -- there is McLeavy  (David MacArthur), a Catholic widower in late middle age whose devotion to the  church is perhaps exceeded only by his devotion to his rose garden.  </P> <P> Fay (Kathryn Byrd) is the imperious young nurse recently hired to care for  McLeavy's dear departed wife. With her patient departed and her job at an end,  Fay doesn't take long to let McLeavy know where she stands. ("You've been a  widower for three days. Have you considered a second marriage?") When it comes  to widowhood, Fay knows whereof she speaks. A serial killer, she has seven dead  husbands to her credit.  </P> <P> Then there's McLeavy's gay son, Hal (Reed Boyer), an unemployed layabout whose  chief fault is his inconvenient habit of blurting out the truth. Hal's  homosexuality is scarcely hinted at here, let alone explored, except for a  brief (and stereotypical) bit of narcissistic primping. Why the omission, which  is crucial to the trademark Orton tone of the play?  </P> <P> The rake in this peculiar menage is Hal's bisexual lover, Dennis (Tom Orr).  Having already bedded Fay, he has proposed marriage to her and is devastated by  her refusal -- if only because it casts doubt on his sexual prowess. Dennis  also happens to be the local undertaker and the mastermind of the bank robbery  that he and Hal have committed.  </P> <P> Finally, there is Truscott of Scotland Yard, a very bribable veteran detective  with a streak of violence. He resembles an evil-minded Sherlock Holmes in his  determination to solve the robbery. Lacking a search warrant, Truscott gains  entry to the McLeavy house by posing rather ludicrously as an inspector from  the Metropolitan Water Board. He commonly flouts the law, in fact, and whether  he catches the real bank robbers or frames an innocent party makes no  difference to him.  </P> <P> Of all the players, MacArthur comes closest to portraying his role without  damage to the playwright's intentions. His McLeavy is a bumbling mourner,  fastidious in keeping up appearances and conventional to the point of idiocy.  The monotonous tone that eventually overtakes MacArthur's performance, although  tedious and annoying, actually enhances it.  </P> <P> Byrd's depiction of Fay betrays more unfulfilled promise than the other  characterizations, because the actress seems capable of growth in the role. She  is well-spoken in her effort to be the commanding, rapacious nurse, but she  puts too much emphasis on the prim sound of her lines and too little on their  meaning.  </P> <P> Orr brings a lot of energy to his performance. As game as he is, though, and  despite a certain comic flair for suggesting a small-time hoodlum, the role of  Dennis somehow eludes him.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Boyer doesn't show much as Hal. And Kevin Knill, who looks entirely  too young for Truscott, is simply miscast. He also needs to slow down and stop  swallowing his words.  </P> <P>  "Loot" continues through Sept. 2 at the Newport Theatre Arts Center, 2501  Cliff Drive, Newport Beach. Performances are Thursdays through Saturdays at 8  p.m., Sundays at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $10.

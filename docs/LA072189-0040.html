			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUGGY CONDITIONS TO STICK AROUND THROUGH WEEKEND  </P> <P> The age-old saying, "You can't have it both ways," does not apply to this  weekend's weather forecast. From alternating cloudy and sunny skies to  above-seasonal humidity, to thunderstorms in the mountains, the weather will do  whatever it wants.  </P> <P> Most of the county will experience night and morning low clouds through the  weekend, National Weather Service forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said. Muggy  conditions "more humid than in Texas" and hazy skies will follow the  early-morning burn-off, but straggling high clouds will help keep temperatures  from soaring, he said.  </P> <P> "A strong high pressure system is bringing in the clouds, and these clouds will  hold down temperatures by 5 to 8 degrees," Shigehara said.  </P> <P> "For the past two weeks, San Diego has been getting a heaping dose of humidity  from moist air wafting in from Mexico. This air flow has raised the normal  humidity level for July by about 10%."  </P> <P> Highs today at the beaches will range between 68 and 74, nudging up one or two  degrees by Sunday, Shigehara said. The ocean water temperature is 68 and the  surf is at 2 to 4 feet.  </P> <P> Coastal highs will range from 75 to 84 degrees and the lows tonight and  Saturday night will be between 63 to 70 "at a minimum," Shigehara said.  </P> <P> Skies over the coast will be hazy with occasional high clouds, he said.  </P> <P> Daytime highs in the inland areas will be a muggy 84 to 94 degrees through the  weekend. Overnight lows will be between 62 and 68 degrees tonight and between  60 and 65 Saturday. More sunshine will show through the clouds by Sunday  afternoon, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> Afternoon and evening thunderstorms are possible this weekend for the mountains  and deserts, Shigehara said. Daytime highs in the mountains will range from 88  to 94. Overnight lows will be from 60 to 65.  </P> <P> Highs in the deserts of 109 to 116 are expected today and Saturday, dropping a  few degrees on Sunday. Lows of 80 to 90 degrees are forecast tonight, 75 to 85  Saturday night.  </P></p>

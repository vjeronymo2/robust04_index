			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BAe attacks GEC's export record British Aerospace, which is fighting GEC for control of VSEL, the submarine maker, yesterday attacked its competitor's record as a military exporter. In a document sent to shareholders alongside its revised offer for VSEL, BAe points out that its export sales have grown from an annual Pounds 1bn to about Pounds 3bn over the past decade, while GEC's military exports have only grown from Pounds 400m to Pounds 700m. The document also highlights that GEC has only won one export order for two warships to Malaysia in the past 10 years while Vosper Thornycroft, a competitor in small warships, has increased its export business from Pounds 40m a year to Pounds 140m in the same period. The UK lags behind French and German warship yards for exports to countries such as Australia, Greece, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and Turkey, according to the document. As well as attacking GEC's export record, BAe continues to argue that GEC's bid for VSEL unnecessarily eliminates competition between warship makers, and runs counter to the Ministry of Defence's competition policy. It quotes the ministry as saying that 'competition is the cornerstone of our procurement policy'. The Office of Fair Trading is considering the competition merits of both bids. It is not thought that the MoD has raised significant objections to GEC's bid with the OFT. GEC has argued that little real competition will exist in UK shipbuilding whoever owns VSEL. GEC declined to comment on the allegations made in the document. However, the MoD is thought to be disturbed by the prospect of a full-scale war of words breaking out between Britain's two largest defence contractors. BAe also claims that GEC's abilities as a prime contractor are unproven while it has a strong track record, and attacks GEC's record on the Nimrod radar contract. However, GEC was not the prime contractor on this contract which was run by the MoD. The formal document also confirmed that BAe's cash offer had been increased to match GEC's at Pounds 14, and is offering 3.3 BAe shares for one VSEL share, up from 2.747 shares in its original offer. VSEL's articles of association have been amended to allow BAe to buy the company provided it wins the support of a majority of shareholders. A similar meeting of VSEL shareholders to allow GEC's bid to go through is scheduled for tomorrow.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ertugrul Ozkok: "Two Important but Unpublicized </F> Decisions"]    [Text] Turkey is preparing for an interesting waltz with  the two superpowers, Russia and the United States. The waltz  will probably be the most striking in the domain of quiet  diplomacy in the next few days. The developments that are  expected to take place will be important enough to have a  bearing on Turkey's relations with Russia and the United States.  The first is the implementation of Turkey's new rules on the  [Dardenelles] Straits and the second is the resumption of the  truck traffic across the Habur Bridge on Turkey's border with  Iraq.    Turkey is determined to implement the new rules and to  resume  traffic on the Habur bridge. So determined is Ankara on the new  rules for the straits that Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin reacted  to Russia's memorandum in early May as follows: "Let's step up  the procedure that is necessary to implement the new rules that  will apply for the passage through the straits."  <H5>  Implementation of the New Rules Being Stepped Up </H5>   Far from abandoning the new rules, Turkey is moving to step  up the procedure that is necessary to put them into action. The  government is taking a determined approach on the matter.  However, the new rules will be applied without publicity.  Meanwhile, Ankara has made initiatives to Russia to explain  Turkey's decision. In short, Turkey will implement the new  national rules on the passage through the straits on 1 July.  <H5>  Open the Habur Bridge Without Publicity </H5>   The second development is related to the resumption of  traffic on the Habur Bridge. The bridge is not officially  closed, but there has been almost no traffic on it since 1992.  There is no heavy truck traffic between Turkey and Iraq at the  present time. Consequently, Turkey is preparing to set the  trucks rolling between the two countries again. But how will it  achieve that? Several countries regard the resumption of  traffic between the two countries as a violation of the embargo  on Iraq. There was congested traffic on the Habur Bridge in the  immediate aftermath of the Gulf War. Trucks carried to Iraq  commodities that were not covered by the embargo, such as  foodstuffs, pharmaceutical drugs, and cigarettes. They brought  back fuel oil in large containers. The truck traffic on the  bridge was suspended because the PKK was reported to have  received a significant share from the business done by the truck  owners in 1992.  <H5>  Extraordinary Figures </H5>   The decision to suspend the traffic on that bridge caused  significant economic stagnation in the region. Some 400,000  people earned their living from the trade across the border.  The filling stations provided additional jobs to 20-25 persons  in the region. Other economic benefits existed as well. Fuel  oil costs 1,000 Turkish lira per liter in Iraq. It is sold for  12,000 Turkish lira per liter in Turkey. It has been  ascertained that Turkey acquired 3.5 million tonnes of fuel oil  across the Habur Bridge in 1992. The refineries in Turkey meet  70 percent of the demand for fuel oil; consequently, Turkey has  to import the remaining 30 percent. Importing fuel oil over the  Habur Bridge is the cheapest way Turkey can get what it needs.  The amount of foreign currency Turkey saved at the time also  has to be considered.    Some 180,000 trucks crossed the Habur Bridge in 1992. The  number of trucks that cross that bridge has fallen to  20,000-30,000 at the present time.  <H5>  Karayalcin's File </H5>   Considering all that, Turkey is determined to resume the  truck traffic on the Habur Bridge. The government's decision  would have been put into effect at the end of 1993. However, it  was postponed as a result of intensive Western pressure, which  was prompted by the extensive publicity ministers gave the  matter at the time. The government's decision will be put into  effect without publicity. It was to have been implemented  during the past few days. The clashes between the supporters of  Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud Barzani and  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani forced the  officials to postpone it. Ankara is waiting for an appropriate  time.    Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin has studied the  matter  in detail. The outcome of his research has been or is about to  be submitted to the Council of Ministers. The government's  decision will then be put into effect without publicity.</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy Yesterday's economic data leave the debate about UK inflation as confused as ever. Input prices are growing faster than output prices, although an annual rate of 2.9 per cent hardly amounts to hyper-inflation. Consumer borrowing is up sharply on a net basis, though a large part of the jump seems to reflect a slowdown in repayments. Gross lending in June scarcely rose at all and gross lending on credit cards actually fell. Taken together the figures can thus be construed as offering comfort both to those who argue that inflationary pressures are building up in the economy and to those who claim that price pressures are likely to remain muted. Yet it would be naive to assume that the economy can continue growing as fast as it is without inflation eventually accelerating again. For the time being higher volumes will continue to offset the impact of raw material price increases on unit costs. The slowdown in credit repayment could be a sign that April's tax rises are hurting consumers. While wage rises remain restrained, they are likely to remain price conscious. But if the authorities wait till wage pressure returns, it will be too late for a pre-emptive strike.</p>

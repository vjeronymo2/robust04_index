			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SAY INVESTIGATION OF SERIAL KILLINGS IS AT A STANDSTILL  </P> <P> San Diego police have received more than 2,200 leads in connection with the  serial stabbing deaths of five women in Clairemont and University City, but  with no arrest in sight and tips tapering off, the case is at a standstill,  officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Asked at a press briefing whether an arrest was imminent, or if a piece was  still missing, Capt. Dick Toneck said investigators are stuck.  </P> <P> "A piece is still missing," he said. "If I had something to bring forth in the  way of an arrest, I would relish that. But, as it stands, we're sifting through  all the clues and all the tips people have phoned in. We're just hoping one  will lead to an arrest."  </P> <P> Toneck said the Police Department's 33 investigators working the case full time  have called back almost everyone who phoned in with information.  </P> <P> The case has received widespread media coverage in San Diego, where Police  Chief Bob Burgreen has labeled the search for the killer the largest manhunt in  the city's history and the department's No. 1 priority.  </P> <P> Since Jan. 12, four women between the ages of 18 and 21 were murdered inside  their homes in the middle of the day, after the killer entered through an  unlocked or open door, police say. The fifth victim, 42-year-old Pamela Gail  Clark, was the mother of one of the victims, 18-year-old Amber Clark. Both were  stabbed inside their home in University City on Sept. 13. The three other women  lived within two blocks of one another in a row of apartment houses in  Clairemont.  </P> <P> The manhunt and subsequent publicity led to a run on locks and security devices  at local stores. Police have held twice-weekly press briefings, at which they  often have nothing new to report. The briefings are to be reduced to once a  week later this week.  </P> <P> On Monday, Toneck, one of seven ranking officers assigned to the case full  time, said investigators don't have a clear idea of the killer's possible  whereabouts or whether he has left the area.  </P> <P> "We don't have anything to indicate (the suspect) is still here," Toneck said.  "God forbid he's still here. We don't have any leads to tell us where he may  be."  </P> <P> Toneck said the leads had given police a range of possible suspects "who fit  the description to a T. And yet, those are not the people. Their backgrounds,  their whereabouts, just don't fit."  </P> <P> Toneck has said police are eyeing a number of possible suspects but have no one  under "classic surveillance." He declined to say what that means.  </P> <P> The department made a controversial arrest shortly after the third killing in  early April when a native-born Puerto Rican -- and a decorated ex-Marine -- was  followed for weeks and finally detained because he closely resembled a  composite drawing of the suspect.  </P> <P> The man later said he phoned police and told them he committed the crime in the  hope he could then convince them he was innocent. He was cleared shortly after  his arrest.  </P> <P> Just last week, police ruled out any link between the serial slayings and a man  arrested on suspicion of rape in Escondido.  </P> <P> The Clairemont-University City suspect is said to be a light-skinned black  male, 5-foot-7 to 5-foot-10, with medium build and short, dark, kinky hair. He  was briefly seen by a painter as he ran from the Clairemont apartment where  18-year-old Holly Suzanne Tarr was killed April 3.  </P> <P> It is that one sighting upon which the widely distributed composite of the  suspect is based.  </P> <P> Toneck said that, based on a psychological profile prepared for the Police  Department by the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., the killer is thought to be a  loner and "disorganized" in his methods of operation.  </P> <P> Police believe the weapon used in each of the killings was obtained at the  scene; in every case but the first, investigators later found knives believed  to have been the killer's weapon.  </P> <P> Although he appears to be a loner, "there's no doubt that somebody -- a loved  one, a neighbor, a close friend -- knows this guy," Toneck said. "We just don't  know why this person hasn't called in and said, 'I know this guy.' We're hoping  that will happen."  </P> <P> But police have declined to say what, if any, reason they have to believe  someone knows the suspect. They also decline to discuss almost any question  relating to evidence.  </P> <P> Toneck said the number of investigators working the case was recently scaled  back from 34 to 33, and that $145,000 has been spent investigating the  slayings. He said the number of detectives working the case "may be scaled back  further at the point where the leads start to diminish."  </P> <P> Police are concerned that unsuspecting residents may soon grow complacent and  stop taking the precautions that many in the area instituted after the fourth  and fifth killings in University City on Sept. 13, Toneck said.  </P> <P> "People are going to get complacent. But as we've said to them, don't get  complacent. This person is still around, still out and about, so please lock  your doors in the daytime, be aware of your surroundings, get to know your  neighbors and have your neighbors know you. Know the routines of one another at  all times."  </P></p>

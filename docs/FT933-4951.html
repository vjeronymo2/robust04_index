			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Israel and Arab states to meet on aid: Rabin envoy says peace could lead to independent Palestine ISRAEL and its Arab neighbours are this month to discuss setting up a central fund to channel hundreds of millions of dollars in international aid money to the Middle East. Officials from Middle Eastern protagonists including Israel, Jordan, Egypt, the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Gulf states are to meet at the World Bank in Washington on September 20 to discuss a detailed plan for regional economic and infrastructural development. It comes as the peace diplomacy in the region continues to gather pace. Mr Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the US, said yesterday an accord with the PLO could lead to an independent Palestinian state. The Washington meeting will examine reports produced by the World Bank on regional development and on development in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where it has already estimated there is a need for a Dollars 4.3bn (Pounds 2.8bn) development programme over 10 years. Preliminary talks will be held on the possible establishment of a 'Middle East fund' which would oversee and set priorities for development projects together with the donor countries, according to Mr Oded Eran, a senior official at the foreign ministry in Jerusalem. He said yesterday that this clearing house might operate under the auspices of the World Bank, though donors might prefer to give aid bilaterally and project-by-project. The prospect of a fund bringing together Arab oil money and western assistance to finance a programme for improving the quality of life in the occupied territories and for regional economic integration has been often spoken of in the past by Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, who initialled an historic peace deal with the PLO in Oslo 10 days ago. But the quickening tempo of peace moves - with the Gulf states yesterday proclaiming their support for the Israeli-PLO deal on Palestinian self-rule, and Israel under Mr Yitzhak Rabin's government apparently on the brink of mutual recognition with the PLO - suggests such a plan may be moving closer to reality. The US administration is already trying to muster Dollars 590m from Arab states and others to finance the transition from Israeli military occupation to Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza. These plans would open up the prospect of lucrative contracts for European and other companies. Several European countries have been signed up as 'shepherds' to conduct project studies in particular sectors: Britain in financial services and banking systems; Germany in the dismantling of regional trade barriers; Spain in agriculture; and Italy in waste disposal and ground water. Outside the EC, Japan has also agreed to lead a study of the huge potential for tourism in the Middle East. The French government is working on a feasibility study on regional transport which, if implemented, could involve road and rail-building projects linking countries which have been in a state of war for 45 years. A team from the French commerce ministry is in Israel this week studying the possibility of a road between Alexandria in Egypt, Israel, Syria and Turkey, which would enable trucks to carry goods overland from the Middle East to Europe. 'Projects that once seemed utopian now seem realistic and increasingly feasible,' said Mr Dan Gillerman, chairman of the Israeli Chamber of Commerce, who has been discussing potential projects with European and US companies and with an array of leading Arab businessmen. Mr Gillerman said he expected total investment in the region from foreign aid and business capital to exceed Dollars 5bn in the first five years of peace.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Appeal of the Concord Republic Society of Solidarity of </F> the Peoples of Azerbaijan to Deputies of the State Duma of the  Russian Federation"]    [Text] Esteemed Ivan Petrovich Rybkin, chairman of the Duma!    We have been prompted to appeal to you and the deputies of  the Russian State Duma by the recent visit by Lysenko and  Pavlov, members of the State Duma, to Nagornyy Karabakh. They  visited this region of Azerbaijan, bypassing Baku and meeting  with no representatives of Azerbaijan.    You know that an undeclared war imposed on us by Armenian  extremist circles because of the so-called Karabakh issue has  been under way for more than six years in Azerbaijan. Many  states, Russia included, are exerting considerable efforts for a  peaceful resolution of this conflict.    At this time Lysenko and Pavlov, leaders of the National  Republican Party of Russia, having visited only Armenia and  having thence made for Nagornyy Karabakh, taking no account of  the position of Azerbaijan and not having made an objective  study of the entire history of the conflict that has arisen,  appealed openly on 8 April 1994 on Radio Mayak's "The World"  program for a new surge in the incitement of interethnic strife.  They are manifestly proposing a recarving of the current borders  and the allotment to Armenia of Nagornyy Karabakh, which is, in  fact, occupied, promising the extremist forces that created the  Karabakh problem the utmost support, and attempting by any  methods to impose their position on the State Duma.    This openly inflammatory performance of the deputies of the  State Duma evoked the just anger of the Azerbaijani and all  other peoples who live in the republic and is doing tremendous  damage to the peacemaking activity of Russia, which has  repeatedly declared its interest in a peaceful resolution of the  Karabakh conflict and the impossibility of a revision of the  existing borders.    As you know, Armenia has long been a mono-ethnic republic,  and Azerbaijan is, as before, international. More than 500,000  Russian and Russian-speaking people, to whom also the fate of  Azerbaijan, which has become their homeland, is not a matter of  indifference, live here together with the Azerbaijani people.    A peaceful solution of the current problem, which had  emerged  as of late, was once again recently disrupted by the Armenian  side. Evidence of this is the large-scale offensive of Armenian  armed formations the length of the front, which has once again  caused numerous casualties on both sides. Unfortunately, all  this is happening in a period when a meeting of the heads of  state of the CIS had been scheduled in Moscow and agreements had  been reached on a meeting of the speakers of Azerbaijan and  Armenia in Bishkek.    We Azerbaijanis, Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Lezgin,  Tatars, Jews, and representatives of other nations,  nationalities, and ethnic groups have lived together on  Azerbaijani soil for centuries. Our society was formed in the  wake of "bloody January," when, at the call of their hearts, a  group of Russian-speaking Baku inhabitants went to Moscow to  tell the truth about the events of 20 January 1990, when the  Soviet Army was committed to Baku and many totally innocent  people died. It was necessary then, as it is now, to combat a  news blockade and well-conceived disinformation concerning  events occurring in Azerbaijan.    We are counting on you, as the leader of the parliament of  Russia, endeavoring to contribute to a peaceful settlement of  interethnic conflicts.    Nagornyy Karabakh, over which the undeclared war that has  been foisted on us began, is primordial land of Azerbaijan,  where the Armenian and Azerbaijani peoples had for several  centuries lived in peace and harmony. The responsibility for the  instigation of the war lies wholly with a small group of people  in Armenia and outside, who have single-mindedly set the two  peoples against each other for the purpose of annexing to  Armenia primordially Azerbaijani land.    This war has already borne away thousands of lives in both  republics. More than 200,000 Azerbaijanis living in Armenia have  been driven out of their native parts and have become refugees.  Over 20 percent of the territory of the republic, far beyond  Nagornyy Karabakh included, has now been captured. Many villages  and towns, cultural monuments, and industrial and agricultural  enterprises have been destroyed, and more than 1 million  Azerbaijanis have become refugees. It is six years now that the  war has been fought on the territory of our republic.    The United Nations, the Security Council, and the CSCE Minsk  Group have repeatedly adopted objective decisions pertaining to  a peaceful settlement of the conflict, but the long-awaited  peace has yet to ensue. On the contrary, combat operations on  the part of the Armenian armed formations have been resumed time  and again, blood has been shed once again, and increasingly new  areas of Azerbaijan have been captured.    G.A. Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, appealed recently on  republic television to the people of Nagornyy Karabakh, the  people of Armenia, and to the world community, calling for an  end to the totally needless war, the liberation of the captured  territories, and the return of the refugees to their homes, and  asked Russia and other states to contribute to the establishment  of peace.    Addressing the deputies of the State Duma of the Russian  Federation, we are firmly convinced that the highest authority  of democratic Russia will analyze the situation in depth and  study the roots of the conflict, aspiring to a wise and  objective examination of the Karabakh problem, and prevent  damage to the legitimate interests of the Azerbaijani people.    Adopted at an enlarged session of the board of the Concord  Republic Society for Solidarity With the Peoples of Azerbaijan    Baku, 13 April 1994</p>

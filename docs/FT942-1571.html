			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Warm reception for Fannie Mae global debut Fannie Mae, one of the world's biggest issuers of long-term debt, could become a regular borrower in the international bond market following its successful debut yesterday. With extensive pre-marketing, the triple-A rated US mortgage agency's Dollars 1.5bn offering of 10-year global bonds was received favourably by investors. The warm reception enabled the bonds to be priced to yield 25 basis points over US Treasuries, in line with market expectations. Joint lead manager Merrill Lynch said strong demand from European investors, and the fact that the bonds were not callable, had allowed Fannie Mae to achieve better funding rates than in the domestic US market, where its bonds traded at a yield spread of around 29 basis points over Treasuries. Many of Fannie Mae's domestic bonds are callable. Ms Linda Knight, Fannie Mae's treasurer, said the agency had delayed its entry into the international bond market to await the fruits of its efforts to build up a domestic market in callable bonds. This market was now a powerful funding tool for the agency, which last year issued Dollars 46.4bn worth of long-term debt. It is likely to raise similar amounts this year. However, Ms Knight said the change in the interest rate climate this year had prompted Fannie Mae to increase its issuance of non-callable debt. She said she had opted for the global bond market, where spreads were tighter than at home and where the lack of high-quality borrowers worked in Fannie Mae's favour. 'Now that we have developed the capability in the global bond market, we could well come back,' she said. J. P. Morgan, the other joint lead manager, said at least 60 per cent of the offering had been placed with European and Asian investors. However, other syndicate managers said only time would tell whether or not such a large proportion would stay outside the US in the long run. Fannie Mae's smooth entry bodes well for Freddie Mac, the other US mortgage agency scheduled to launch its first global bond offering early next month. This deal is likely to raise at least Dollars 1bn, but have a shorter maturity. The market was less enthusiastic about Austria's Pounds 200m offering of 10-year eurobonds, which several syndicate managers said was hampered by continuing fragility in the UK government bond market. They also thought the pricing, to yield 22 basis points over comparable gilts, was at least five basis points too tight. Standard &amp; Poor's, the international rating agency, has lowered the long-term senior rating of Credit Lyonnais, to A-minus from single-A, to reflect the severe asset quality pressures which have affected the French bank. The outlook on the rating is negative.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / The drawbacks of shock therapy: America In the dark ages of psychiatry, doctors believed that electric shocks could cure depression. The bigger the convulsion the better: the patient would recover that much quicker. The professionals keenest on electrodes today are economists. In Russia and eastern Europe, western advisers are experimenting with an economic form of shock therapy. This consists of austere fiscal and monetary policies to curb demand coupled with the most rapid possible freeing of prices and markets to raise efficiency. The fashionable view is that capitalism can best be reached in a single 'Big Bang'. In Washington last week, the merits of shock therapy were expounded with messianic zeal by Mr Anders Aslund, a Swedish member of Professor Jeffrey Sachs's stable of advisers to Russia. Economic shock therapy has certainly produced impressive convulsions. In eastern Europe, it has led to falls in production of a third or more, huge increases in unemployment and severe distress for the weakest groups in society such as pensioners. Wealth and income inequalities have soared. Shock therapists like Mr Aslund are unfazed. The big falls in output - which they did not anticipate  - are dismissed as 'inevitable'. Indeed, in true Panglossian style every negative indicator is construed as a sign of progress: the collapse of state enterprises, for example, simply increases the scope for private business to flourish. The goals of shock therapy are not in question: we all want to see strong, market economies emerge in eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics. But some experienced economists are beginning to wonder whether different tactics would be more effective. The most obvious danger is that economic dislocation will undermine progress by provoking a political backlash. This has already happened in Poland, which has backed away from the IMF's adjustment programme. Czechoslovakia is restive. The future of young radical reformers in Moscow is in doubt. Professor Milan Matejka, of the Prague School of Economics, is bitterly critical of Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czechoslovak finance minister and a home-grown shock therapist. He says Mr Klaus deepened the slump with unnecessarily tight macro policies (Czechoslovakia, unlike Poland, never faced a hyperinflation). And he complains that western journalists convey far too flattering a picture of progress in eastern Europe because they rely too heavily on parti pris sources - government officials and their western advisers. Mr Edward Bernstein, a participant at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference and the IMF's first research director, says the shock therapists have done a 'miserable job' in eastern Europe because they have forgotten 'the lessons of the post-war reconstruction of western Europe'. The most important was that liberalisation had to occur in measured steps. Full exchange rate convertibility, for example, was not achieved until the late 1950s. This reflected the need to rebuild industrial capacity before opening the floodgates to consumer imports. Just imagine how Britain would have faired if it had swept away all rationing and controls in the late 1940s in an attempt, immediately, to achieve US-style economic freedoms. Mr Eugenio Lari, until recently head of World Bank operations in eastern Europe, agrees that 'the pace of certain reforms was over-ambitious'. He says reformers have tended to be 'overly purist' in advocating 'total free-market liberal capitalism'. Coming from Italy, he understands that subsidies, budget deficits and a big state sector - while regrettable - do not rule out rapid growth. Long development experience makes him uneasy with the glibness of the youthful reformers: 'we should confess to doubts and ignorance . . . nobody understands these transitions,' he says. Shock therapists reject comparisons with the rebuilding of western Europe, on the grounds that former communist countries lack the basic framework of a market economy. The point of rapid trade liberalisation is to import a price and incentive structure. But this argument cuts both ways. The fact that centrally planned economies lack the institutions, skills and legal framework of capitalism surely enhances the case for step-by-step reforms. So does the experience of Hungary, which has opted for gradual economic reform, eschewing shock therapy even after communism collapsed. It continues to nurture the state sector, privatises judiciously and maintains currency controls. The result: less of a drop in living standards than elsewhere and stronger foreign investment. Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics can surely also learn a lesson from economic development in east Asia. South Korea and the others were desperately poor and also lacked the infrastructure of an advanced market economy. Did they opt for shock therapy? Of course not. Policy was dedicated to gradually building up real-world business skills and the strength of particular manufacturing sectors, partly by providing explicit incentives for export. Imports, domestic consumption and finance were closely controlled for decades. There is a world of difference between this kind of planned development, making careful use of markets, and a rush towards the idealised world of free market textbooks. The formerly communist economies have to plough their own furrow, but they should realise that shock therapy is far from a proven remedy. A little humility on the part of the therapists would be welcome.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Super Strategy for the SAP"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, the South African Police Force [SAP]  announced a new strategy which it will henceforth use to fight  violence and crime in the country. The foundation of this new  strategy is community policing. The SAP will strive to make the  nature of its policing in all respects community oriented. This  is a report from our political editors.    The police force's new strategic plan includes seven focal  points: Safety of the community; legitimacy of the police;  training of the police; state of mind of the police; the optimal  use of resources; adjustment to the new national allocation; and  management skills-leadership of the SAP's management cadres.    As far as the safety of the community is concerned, the  intent is to bring crime and violence to more acceptable levels  and to restore a feeling of safety within the community through  continuous presence, countrywide consultation forums between  police and community, and optimal cooperation.    To this end, all available resources will be effectively  activated in consultation with the community. Official  structures will be expanded to ensure consultation and community  involvement. Crime prevention and solutions to deeper problems  of law and order will be given greater attention. And the  overall policing authority of the police will be expanded.    The SAP's goal is to be an impartial, representative, and  accepted community police service.    Therefore they want to establish a streamlined and community  friendly policing style, to promote openness, to ensure the  provision of equal services to all communities and the equal  treatment of all individuals, to live up to a value system based  on the principles of the police behavior code as included in the  national peace agreement, to enhance the language skills and  cultural sensitivity of its members, to maintain a sound and  easily accessible complaint procedure, to not allow itself to be  politically abused, and to be made up as representatively as  possible.    The SAP's training must aim at being coordinated and in  agreement with internationally accepted principles. This  training must be geared toward competency, ability, professional  and community need.    In order to improve the state of mind of the police, fear  and  political uncertainty will be tackled through better internal  communication. Better and tougher discipline will also be  implemented. The selection in hiring personnel will become more  strict. Training will focus on positive attitude and human  rights. And each member of the SAP will have to live up to the  behavior code.    In order to achieve the best possible distribution and use  of  all available human, logistic and information resources to meet  to the extent possible the policing needs of the community, a  good computerized management information system will be  implemented. The subjects of management courses will be adapted.    The SAP will also ensure that it will be efficiently and  fully included in the new national model and that its policing  will function effectively and acceptably within such a new  national model.    To this effect a continuous restructuring and positioning of  the SAP in accordance with national changes, and a review and  adjustment of laws, regulations and prescriptions in accordance  with these changes will be necessary.    The strategy is also aimed at the professional training of  all police officers so that they will have the necessary skills  and abilities to ensure that they will provide an acceptable  communi ty oriented service.    In order to achieve this, a representative management body  must be entrusted with the maintenance of standards. Skills will  be developed through transitional programs. All members of the  SAP, but especially management personnel, will be encouraged to  better equip themselves academically.    In order to create a favorable climate for the development  of  this strategy, the SAP has committed itself to:     -  Recognize the basic rights of all people;    -  Protect/secure the community by providing quality service;    -  The principle of responsibility toward the community;    -  Impartiality and credibility;    -  Provide speedy, simple and professional services;    -  Proactive action and maintenance of initiative;    -  Consultation with the community, negotiation and a  participatory style of managment;  $And to respect the needs of the community.    This strategy was developed by the governing board of the  SAP  in consultation with the Police Council following a  determination of the needs of the broader community.    This will be available to the public for perusal at all  police stations.    The Police Council functions under the leadership of Mr.  Johan van Vuuren, former head of ARMSCOR. A variety of groups  from the broader comunity is represented in it.</p>

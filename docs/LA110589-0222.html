			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING  </P> <P> William McCloskey's column ("Fishing Rights and Wrongs," Opinion, Oct. 29) on  controversies surrounding the delayed reauthorization of the Magnuson Act  concerning the U.S. fishing industry was a valuable report -- with one  omission.  </P> <P> Granted it is much harder to watch those intent on pillaging the seas than it  is to catch those who devastate the land. But a start might be made simply in  identifying the owners of the "fleet of large, Seattle-based U.S. fishing  ships" whose greed impoverished 2,000 Alaskans.  </P> <P> Does McCloskey not know who these corporate marauders are, or the names of  those responsible for giving the order to dump back into the ocean 60,000 tons  of wasted fish carcasses? These acts were committed by people, and there is  some faint possibility that publicity, and brand names, might induce restraint,  if not anything resembling shame.  </P> <P> JANE WILSON  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

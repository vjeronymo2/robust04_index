			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Reorganization, Standard Submission, and Float-Funded Activities in the Statement of Community Development Objectives (Final Statement)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This portion of the rule proposes several changes at &sect;570.301 to the requirements for the statement of community development objectives, generally known as the final statement, that grantees are required to submit to HUD in order to receive their grants. On March 28, 1990, HUD published a proposed regulation to implement certain statutory changes to the CDBG program made in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;242, approved February 5, 1988) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development_Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;404, approved August 19, 1988). A final rule implementing these 1987 changes has not yet been issued. Section 570.301 is among the sections of the CDBG rule that will be altered from the rule presently in effect in the forthcoming final rule. This proposed rule deals with and clarifies matters that were not addressed by the previous proposed rule. Readers should note that the text proposed here for &sect;570.301(c) was developed on the premise that the basic requirements of &sect;570.301 (a) and (b), as published in the previous proposed rule, will be similar to those expected to be published in the final rule. The Department recently published consolidated submission requirements, in another proposed rule. Differences between this program-specific rule and that more broad-based rule will be resolved before final regulations are issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this rule, first, for clarity, the rule would be reorganized into sections on sources and uses of funds, content of the statement, citizen participation, and float-funded activities. Second, the final statement would be required to be submitted in a manner prescribed by HUD. Third, the details concerning required content and citizen participation would be more clearly specified. Fourth, the rule would permit final statement amendments to be submitted to HUD in consolidated form at the end of the program year. Finally, float-funded activities and the circumstances under which they would be authorized would be defined and a procedure described for identifying such activities in the statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second and third changes, which would require the final statement to contain certain specific details and to be submitted in a manner prescribed by HUD, are intended to serve four purposes. First, citizens would be better able to follow CDBG activities through the entire program cycle because the prescribed submission would share many common elements with the grantee performance report (GPR). Second, a standard submission would ensure that all citizens receive a comparable basic level of information on all proposed activities. Third, standard submissions would improve the efficiency of HUD's processing of the final statement, and its ability to train grantee and HUD staff on final statement requirements. Finally, making the final statement submission standard for all grantees would facilitate automation of the statement, linking that automation to an automated GPR. Ultimately, this automation could save grantees and HUD much time and effort, while preserving grantee flexibility in deciding how funds will be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fourth change, allowing consolidation of amendment submissions, is being proposed for the sake of increased efficiency for grantees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final change is being proposed because of difficulties experienced by HUD with management of ``float'' activities, including those identified in the Inspector General's audit of CDBG interim financing. For purposes of this section, an activity that uses undisbursed funds in the line of credit or program account that have been previously budgeted in a final statement for one or more activities that do not need the funds immediately would be called a ``float-funded activity.'' HUD has long held that a float-funded activity must meet all of the same requirements that apply to CDBG-assisted activities generally. However, the regulations have been silent on managing these activities. After review, the Department has determined that the primary risks to the CDBG program inherent in the float funding process are, first, that the float-funded activity will not generate sufficient program income in a timely manner to allow for timely undertaking of previously budgeted activities. Second, if proposed float-funded activities and the possible consequences of their default are not disclosed to citizens in sufficient detail, they will not be afforded sufficient information to fully understand how they may be affected by each activity, and thus not have the opportunity to object to such a use of the funds. Third, in undertaking a float-funded activity that exceeds a certain size or duration, grantees apparently assume that they will receive sufficient additional CDBG funds in future years to continue funding previously budgeted activities until the float-funded activity generates program income. However, grantees are only authorized to use such a funding technique (e.g. banking on future CDBG funds as assurance to backstop a large loan for a particular activity in the present) under the section 108 Loan Guarantee program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would either eliminate the first risk by requiring one of two forms of guarantee for the float funds, or limit it by requiring a commitment for timely identification of specific previously budgeted activities that would be deleted. The second risk would be limited by requiring more detailed information to be provided to citizens on each float-funded activity. The third factor would be minimized by limiting CDBG float-funded activities to those that are expected to generate program income within a period of time defined in the regulation. The proposed time limit was selected keeping the standards at &sect;570.902(a) in mind. Sixty days prior to the end of any program year, the amount of CDBG funds in the line of credit should be no more than 1.5 times the amount of the current grant amount. Then, at the beginning of any program year, with the new grant in the line of credit, the maximum amount in the line of credit could be as much as 2.5 times the annual grant amount. Therefore, 2.5 years was selected as the maximum duration of any float-funded activity, since this is the maximum time period that a grantee could be reasonably certain of having CDBG funds available absent additional appropriations. The Department requests comment on these provisions and also whether the rule should additionally specify a limit on the proportion of a grantee's funds that it could use for float-funded activities at any one period in time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

In 1970 he graduated from Bratislava's School of Economics  and in 1975 became a scientific worker. Up to 1990 he worked in  the Economy and Construction Institute in Bratislava. In  November 1989 he was elected chairman of a strike committee and  shortly afterwards chairman of the Public Against Violence (VPN)  organisation in the institute where he worked. Later he became  a member of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH).    From September 1990 till November 1990 he was deputy  director  of the department for the protection of the constitution and  democracy in the Federal Interior Ministry. In April 1991 he  was named a colonel.    In the 1992 elections Pittner was elected a Slovak  parliament  deputy for the KDH. At the 27th parliamentary session he  proposed a confidence vote in Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar's  government.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIBSON, CLAIRE SHOUT BEFORE DODGER LOSS  </P> <P> Who says there is no fight left in these Dodgers?  </P> <P> Shortly before the start of a 7-2 loss to Pittsburgh Sunday, outfielder Kirk  Gibson engaged in a heated shouting match with Vice President Fred Claire in  Manager Tom Lasorda's office.  </P> <P> Lasorda's door was closed, but the shouting was loud enough to be heard  throughout the clubhouse. Although neither Claire nor Lasorda would comment on  the nature of the dispute, it was apparently a culmination of frustration over  Gibson's situation on the team.  </P> <P> Coming on the final day before the All-Star break, it provided a fitting end to  a fitful first half in which the Dodgers finished with 10 losses in their last  16 games and a 39-43 record.  </P> <P> "This team is going to have to get a lot more together, that's for sure,"  Claire said.  </P> <P> Sources close to the team said the meeting, which occurred about 11:30 a.m.,  began with Gibson asking about his status with the team. Two weeks ago, sources  said he requested a trade because he wants to return to his Detroit-area roots  and because he had not been offered a new contract, a report which the Dodgers  would not deny but which Gibson claimed was "wrong."  </P> <P> While discussing Gibson's status with him Sunday, Claire reportedly became  upset and began scolding Gibson. He reportedly told Gibson that he should think  less about himself and more about the team. He accused Gibson of having a bad  attitude.  </P> <P> Gibson, who has played out of position in center field this season without  complaint, became incensed with the remarks and began shouting. The two men  reportedly began stalking each other around the room with Lasorda serving as  referee.  </P> <P> When the meeting ended, Gibson left the office to the stares of hushed  teammates.  </P> <P> "What happened in there was my business," Gibson later said.  </P> <P> Said Lasorda: "Was there yelling in there? I don't think there was yelling. It  all depends on what you think is yelling.  </P> <P> "My voice comes through that door all the time when I'm talking to (coach) Bill  Russell and I love Bill Russell. Whoever was in that meeting has a lot of love  and respect for each other."  </P> <P> The sounds on Sunday would indicate otherwise. It appears the emotional meeting  could mark the beginning of the end of Gibson's successful tenure with the  Dodgers, during which he led them to a World Series championship in 1988 as the  National League's Most Valuable Player.  </P> <P> "It would not surprise me if he is traded during the All-Star break. . . . Or I  wouldn't be surprised if it takes until August," one source said.  </P> <P> Problems may have started last winter when Gibson, rehabilitating from knee  surgery, casually asked Claire if he would discuss a new contract. Claire  refused, even though Gibson's contract expires at the end of this season.  </P> <P> Since returning to the lineup June 2, Gibson has hit .253 with three homers and  17 RBIs in 24 games. Although his eight-game hitting streak was broken Sunday,  he has hit in 16 of his last 21 games at a .297 pace.  </P> <P> Sunday's meeting between Gibson and Claire was not their first encounter since  the reported trade request, but it probably was their loudest.  </P> <P> "There was no great resolution, but everybody had a chance to say what they  wanted to say," Claire said of the meeting.  </P> <P> Although Claire said he was not talking about any specific players -- or even  Dodgers -- he then criticized players who complain about their situations.  </P> <P> "We're using the wrong players for examples," he said. "We are looking to the  wrong guys for admiration.  </P> <P> "Instead of everybody writing about some guy who is hitting .330, people should  write about a guy like Juan Samuel, who goes out and does his job and doesn't  make excuses and doesn't pop off.  </P> <P> "We aren't going to turn this team around unless everyone stops looking for  excuses and looking to blame somebody, and instead looks in the mirror. I'll  take the blame for my part in our problems. . . . I wish everyone else would  also look in the mirror."  </P> <P> Claire's mention of Samuel was interesting considering Sunday's game ended with  Samuel standing near second base after running on a one-out fly to left field  by Alfredo Griffin. The ball was caught by Barry Bonds, but Samuel made no  attempt to return to first base to avoid the double play. Bonds' throw to Sid  Bream was high and off the base, but Bream had the rest of the afternoon to  grab the ball and touch the base and end the game.  </P> <P> "It was a typical way for the first half of this season to end," one Dodger  said.  </P> <P> The loss, which kept the Dodgers at a season-high 12 1/2 games behind the  Cincinnati Reds, was also typical in that another fifth starter candidate  struggled. Terry Wells, in his second start since being recalled from triple-A  Albuquerque, gave up seven runs -- four earned -- in four innings that were  marred by poor fielding.  </P> <P> "We've got to get our act together," Lasorda said. "This losing, I can't take  it."  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Manager Tom Lasorda canceled Tuesday's scheduled workout. The Dodgers will  travel to Chicago Wednesday for a weekend series with the Cubs. "We've been  playing a lot and, with a night game in Chicago Thursday, we can work out early  there," Lasorda said. . . . Tim Belcher received a cortisone injection in his  right shoulder Sunday, a procedure he had been considering for several weeks  because of shoulder inflammation. Although he had a 4-2 complete-game victory  over Pittsburgh Saturday, he said his shoulder is still not feeling 100%. He is  scheduled to pitch Saturday in Chicago.  </P> <P> The Dodgers are considering beginning the season's second half with Ramon  Martinez facing the Cubs Thursday, Fernando Valenzuela pitching Friday, Belcher  pitching Saturday, Mike Morgan working Sunday, and No. 5 starter candidate  Terry Wells pitching Monday in St. Louis. Wells will probably receive at least  one more start before the Dodgers make a decision on his future. So far, they  are viewing him as a potential relief pitcher.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DODGER ATTENDANCE  </P> <P> Sunday: 37,271  </P> <P> 1990 (46 dates): 1,679,102  </P> <P> 1989 (46 dates): 1,790,975  </P> <P> Decrease: 111,873  </P> <P> Average: 36,502  </P></p>

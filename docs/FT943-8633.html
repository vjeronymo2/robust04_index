			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Epwin rises 41% Epwin, a manufacturer of PVC-u windows and doors, made substantially higher profits in the six months to July 2. On turnover up 18 per cent to Pounds 29m, pre-tax profits rose 41 per cent, from Pounds 1.75m to Pounds 2.47m. Mr Jim Rawson, chairman, said the group, which moved into North America with the purchase of 50 per cent of Canadian Berlinex Polymers in April, was 'broadening its spread of activities'. The acquisition in June of Permadoor, a manufacturer of composite doors, was the first step in this process. The group financed both purchases, which cost Pounds 6.75m, from reserves and with a Pounds 4.3m placing. Earnings per share were 7.54p (5.68p), and an interim dividend of 2.7p (2.3p) is declared.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) A profit and loss statement for the prior fiscal year (12-month accounting cycle), plus the period year to date since the end of the last fiscal year (or for whatever shorter period records may be available), and a current balance sheet showing all assets and liabilities. The profit and loss statement and balance sheet will be compiled by an accountant based on the financial records. In some cases the nature of the business or the content of the financial statement may necessitate an independent audit by the accountant. Depending on the situation, this data may be on the veteran and/or the business; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Copies of signed individual income tax returns, plus all applicable schedules for the previous 2 years, or for whatever additional period is deemed necessary to properly demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record, must be obtained. If the business is a corporation or partnership, copies of signed federal business income tax returns for the previous two years plus all applicable schedules for the corporation or partnership must be obtained; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If the business is a corporation or partnership, a list of all stockholders or partners showing the interest each holds in the business will be required. Some cases may justify a written credit report on the business as well as the applicant. When the business is of an unusual type and it is difficult to determine the probability of its continued operation, explanation as to the function and purpose of the business may be needed from the applicant and/or any other qualified party with the acknowledged expertise to express a valid opinion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recently discharged veterans. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Loan applications received from recently discharged veterans who have little or no employment experience other than their military occupation and from veterans seeking VA guaranteed loans who have retired after 20 years of active military duty require special attention. The retirement income of the latter veterans in may cases may not be sufficient to meet the statutory income requirements for the loan amount sought. Many have obtained full-time employment and have been employed in their new jobs for a very short time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) It is essential in determining whether veterans in these categories qualify from the income standpoint for the amount of the loan sought, that the facts in respect to their present employment and retirement income be fully developed, and that each case be considered on its individual merits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) In most cases the veteran's current income or current income plus his or her retirement income is sufficient. The problem lies in determining whether it can be properly concluded that such income level will continue for the foreseeable future. If the veteran's employment status is that of a trainee or apprentice, this will, of course, be a factor. In cases of the self-employed, the question to be resolved is whether there are reasonable prospects that the business enterprise will be successful and produce the required income. Unless a favorable conclusion can be made, the income from such source should not be considered in the loan analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If a recently discharged veteran has no prior employment history and the veteran's verification of employment shows he or she has not been on the job a sufficient time in which to become established, consideration should be given to the duties the veteran performed in the military service. When it can be determined that the duties a veteran performed in the service are similar or are in direct relation to the duties of the applicant's present position, such duties may be construed as adding weight to his or her present employment experience and the income from the veteran's present employment thus may be considered available for qualifying the loan, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant has been on the present job only a short time. This same principle may be applied to veterans recently retired from the service. In addition, when the veteran's income from retirement, in relation to the total of the estimated shelter expense, long-term debts and amount available for family support, is such that only minimal income from employment is necessary to qualify from the income standpoint, it would be proper to resolve the doubt in favor of the veteran. It would be erroneous, however, to give consideration to a veteran's income from employment for a short duration in a job requiring skills for which the applicant has had no training or experience. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) To illustrate the provisions of paragraph (f), it would be proper to use short-term employment income in qualifying a veteran who had experience as an airplane mechanic in the military service and the individual's employment after discharge or retirement from the service is in the same or allied field; e.g., auto mechanic or machinist. This presumes, however, that the verification of employment included a statement that the veteran was performing the duties of the job satisfactorily, the possibility of continued employment was favorable and that the loan application is eligible in all other respects. An example of nonqualifying experience is that of a veteran who was an Air Force pilot and has been employed in insurance sales on commission for a short time. Most cases, of course, fall somewhere between those extremes. It is for this reason that the facts of each case must be fully developed prior to closing the loan automatically or submitting the case to VA for prior approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Employment of short duration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The provisions of paragraph (f)(7) of this section are similarly applicable to applicants whose employment is of short duration. Such cases will entail careful consideration of the employer's confirmation of employment, probability of permanency, past employment record, the applicant's qualifications for the position, and previous training, including that received in the military service. In the event that such considerations do not enable a determination that the income from the veteran's current position has a reasonable likelihood of continuance, such income should not be considered in the analysis. Applications received from persons employed in the building trades, or in other occupations affected by climatic conditions, should be supported by documentation evidencing the applicant's total earnings to date and covering a period of not less than 1 year as well as signed and dated copies of complete income tax returns, including all schedules for the past 2 years or for whatever additional period is deemed necessary to properly demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record. If the applicant works out of a union, evidence of the previous year's earnings should be obtained together with a verification of employment from the current employer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rental-income. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Multi-unit subject property. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  When the loan pertains to a structure with more than a one-family dwelling unit, the prospective rental income will not be considered unless the veteran can demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of success as a landlord, and sufficient cash reserves are verified to enable the veteran to carry the mortgage loan payments (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) without assistance from the rental income for a period of at least 6 months. The determination of the veteran's likelihood of success as a landlord will be based on documentation of any prior experience in managing rental units, or other collection activities. The amount of rental income to be used in the loan analysis will be based on the prior rental history of the units as verified by the seller's financial records (e.g., prior years' tax returns) for existing structures or, for proposed construction, the appraiser's opinion of the property's fair monthly rental. Adjustments will be applied to reduce estimated gross rental income by proper allowances for operating expenses and vacancy losses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PBS' 'WREATH' CAPTURES THE HEART OF LONELINESS  </P> <P> The desperation of isolated, lonely people for an emotional connection to ease  the bruising of their souls is a potent force for self-deception and  victimization. The aching fragility of such people, particularly women, is the  theme of an exceptional "Masterpiece Theatre" offering, "A Wreath of Roses" by  Elizabeth Taylor (no, not the actress), which airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on Channels  50 and 24 and at 9 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15.  </P> <P> Well-directed by John Madden from a superb dramatization by Peter Prince, the  film begins when two strangers -- Camilla (Joanna McCallum), a rigidly  constrained single woman approaching middle-age, and Richard (Trevor Eve), a  handsome, ex-RAF pilot -- witness a ghastly suicide at a train station. The  year is 1949.  </P> <P> The incident prompts an intimate undercurrent between the two that Camilla  grasps with timid determination as a last chance for salvation from dreary  spinsterhood.  </P> <P> They are staying in the same quiet English village -- Richard at the local inn,  Camilla with her best friend Liz (Elizabeth Richardson) at the home of Frances  (Fabia Drake), a painter in her 70s.  </P> <P> It is not just Camilla who is emotionally battered. Liz, a new mother, is  treated as a child by her egocentric clergyman-husband. She chafes against it,  but her dependent girlishness and her perceived superiority of the role of wife  and mother are too deeply ingrained for any real change.  </P> <P> Frances, a gifted artist, is forsaking her "beautiful" paintings of nature,  women and children. She has come to regard them as lies in a world full of  darkness and pain.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Camilla quickly sees a disturbing, unsavory side to Richard's  personality, but she is helpless in the face of her own need.  </P> <P> All the actors share scenes rich in substance; their eloquence is as much  unspoken as spoken. Each flawlessly portrays the delicate vulnerability of  Taylor's lost souls caught up in an inexorable human tragedy that unfolds  against a backdrop of ordinariness -- waiting for a train, picnicking on a  balmy day, getting caught in the rain -- and that serves as a mirror for uneasy  contemplation.

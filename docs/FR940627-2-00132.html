Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The purpose of this rule change is to mandate market maker utilization of the facilities of a registered clearing agency to ensure efficient clearance and settlement of securities transactions. For securities listed on Nasdaq, this will be accomplished by eliminating the ``25 mile exception''' from Section 7(a) in Part V of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws. (Part V articulates the basic requirements applicable to Nasdaq market makers.) Even today, this exception is quite limited in that it is only available to market makers who are located more than 25 miles from a clearing facility, limit their Nasdaq market making activity to Nasdaq SmallCap <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> SM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  securities, and do not participate in the Small Order Execution System (``SOES''). <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  With respect to equity securities quoted in the OTCBB, a new requirement is being proposed to mandate market maker participation in a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement of transactions in OTCBB securities that are clearing eligible. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  As a result, parallel requirements will exist for the two largest equity market segments in which NASD members function as market makers and utilize the Automated Confirmation Transaction Service (``ACT'') for trade reporting and comparison purposes. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although registered market makers in Nasdaq National Market securities must be SOES participants, SOES participation is voluntary with respect to market makers in SmallCap issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As of April 30, 1994, approximately 87% of all securities quoted in the OTCBB were clearing eligible. Clearing eligible status is noted in the OTCBB symbol directory and in the electronic directory accessible via Nasdaq Workstation PCs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD estimates that fewer than 10 member firms that function as market makers would be required to establish clearing arrangements as a result of this rule proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ACT is the primary facility for collecting, processing, and disseminating transaction reports on Nasdaq securities as well as equity issues quoted in the OTCBB. ACT also facilitates the clearance and settlement of inter-member transactions by locking-in trade details for transmission to the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC''). The generation of locked-in trades by ACT enhances the overall efficiency of the clearance and settlement process and virtually eliminates a members risk exposure respecting uncompared trades. These benefits cannot be realized, however, unless the broker-dealers on both sides of the trade have some form of participation in a registered clearing agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule proposal is believed to be consistent with the provisions of Sections 11A(a)(1), 15A(b)(6), and 17A(a)(1) of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1) contains the Congressional findings that have guided development of the National Market System. These findings include a directive to apply state-of-the-art data processing and communications techniques to achieve more efficient and effective market operations and to ensure the economical execution of securities orders. Similarly, Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and processing information with respect to and facilitating transactions in securities. Finally, Section 17A(a)(1) reflects the statutory goals of a national system for clearance and settlement of securities transactions. These goals include the application of new data processing and communications techniques to create the opportunity for more efficient, effective, and safe procedures for clearance and settlement. The NASD believes that this proposed rule change is fully consistent with these statutory requirements. In sum, the primary objectives of this rule change are to minimize risk exposure from uncompared trades and foster optimal usage of ACT to lock-in the details of individual trades prior to their submission to a registered clearing agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD believes that the rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the NASD consents, the Commission will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.

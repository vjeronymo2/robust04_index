			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HUNGARY'S CHALLENGE'  </P> <P> The June 16 commentary ("Hungary's Challenge for the West," Op-Ed Page, June  16) by Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) contained factual errors and  misrepresentations. The congressman stated that Imre Nagy, the prime minister  of the Hungarian government formed during the 1956 Revolution, "was secretly  executed by Soviet troops."  </P> <P> Nagy was tried and sentenced to death by a court of the People's Republic of  Hungary. This court was constituted under the aegis of the government lead by  Janos Kadar, the man who betrayed Nagy and Hungary the entire nation. He was  put in power by the Soviets after the Revolution was crushed on Nov. 4, 1956.  Nagy was executed by a Hungarian hangman.  </P> <P> Lantos also implies that Nagy was rehabilitated. True, the Hungarian chief  prosecutor -- aiming at legal rehabilitation -- scheduled the retrial of Nagy  and his associates beginning on July 6 of this year and the Central Committee  of the Hungarian Communist Party on May 30, 1989, announced: "Although the  relevant documents need to be carefully studied, it can already be concluded  that (Nagy's trial) was a political show trial, Imre Nagy's execution was it  seems, certainly judicially unlawful."  </P> <P> On the same day, however, the general secretary of the party, Karoly Grosz, in  a television address to the Hungarian nation said on Nagy's rehabilitation: "On  the basis of the information available today I can still say that we have no  knowledge on the basis of which the previous decision (of denying  rehabilitation) must be changed."  </P> <P> The ambiguity, the contradictions in the statements by party and government  officials concerning the Nagy case should provide ample reasons for Lantos to  refrain from definitive statements, and to elaborate on the significance of the  difference between the possible judicial and the categorically denied political  rehabilitation.  </P> <P> Lantos' accolades directed at the government in Hungary are premature. The  hailed new laws regulating taxes, investments are favoring foreign investors  and discriminating against Hungarian entrepreneurs. These laws are the cause of  the mass withdrawal of scarce native private capital from the economy. The  newly drafted constitution contains major provisions which are strongly opposed  by the forces of democracy in Hungary.  </P> <P> I wish that Lantos would have been more explicit in his definition of what  Washington could or should do to aid not the "reform-minded regime to overcome  its difficulties," but the Hungarian people who day by day express their  aspirations for genuine freedom and democracy and their distaste for the  "reform-minded regime" and the political, economic system it represents.  </P> <P> ISTVAN B.

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: Matsushita backs film image for its future - Steven Butler and Emiko Terazono assess the Japanese group's takeover of MCA SCENES from popular US movies such as ET and Back to the Future have begun to enliven advertisements in Japan for electronic goods made by Matsushita Electric Industrial, one of the world's biggest consumer electronics companies, whose brands include Panasonic, Technics, and Quasar. Matsushita owns rights to the images following its controversial Dollars 6.1bn acquisition nearly two years ago of MCA, the US film, music and publishing group that owns Universal Studios. Yet Matsushita's expensive plunge into the US entertainment business does not appear to be yielding - or even promising - much in the way of benefits besides the glittering images. Indeed, Matsushita's long-term plans for MCA, and how entertainment fits strategically with its electronics business, are as murky as they were on the day of the acquisition. Perhaps worse, the acquisition has become an expensive financial drain as Matsushita's traditional electronic equipment or hardware business is in trouble. Matsushita said pre-tax profits in the six months to the end of September were likely to fall 53 per cent to Y50bn (Dollars 402m), a meagre 2.2 per cent return on sales of Y2,250bn. This is not how Matsushita sees the acquisition officially, although privately some Matsushita employees question the wisdom of owning MCA. Mr Mamoru Furuichi, a director with responsibility for MCA since February, last week gave one of Matsushita's most extensive explanations to date of how it sees its entertainment business. He said: 'We think that our efforts will bear fruit in the future. What these will be, we can't tell yet. We are thinking in a span of 10 years.' It is characteristic of Japanese corporate management that Mr Furuichi prefers not to talk about the short-term, but the short-term results of the acquisition have been dismal. Last year, Matsushita's operating profits from entertainment were only Y20.6bn, roughly a 2.7 per cent return on the investment. Mr Furuichi says this year MCA profits are expected to climb by double digits, yet to make short-term financial sense, growth in triple digits would be required. The cost of the acquisition has weighed heavily on Matsushita's balance sheet. The company went from a net cash position of Y354bn in March 1990 to hold a net debt of Y1,220bn, or 35 per cent of equity, in March this year. Matsushita is a strong company and this level of debt puts no serious strains on it. Yet the question is whether Matsushita used its cash wisely. Matsushita bought a company that was in good health. It went to pains to retain the MCA management, including the successful team of Mr Lew Wasserman and Mr Sidney Sheinberg. And after the acquisition, it adopted a hands-off policy. 'The first year was to get to know each other,' said Mr Furuichi. Just after the acquisition Matsushita set up an executive committee composed of Matsushita and MCA executives whose aim was to advise the MCA board of directors. This March, the executive committee set up three sub-committees, one to take a broad look at the future of the industry, one to explore the possibility of co-operative development projects between Matsushita and MCA, and one to look at financial issues. Matsushita hopes to broaden the use of high definition video equipment in the entertainment industry. It is brainstorming with MCA in the multi-media field - an as-yet vaguely defined class of future electronics products that will combine video, digital sound, telecommunications, and computing. Mr Furuichi says Matsushita has a lot to learn from MCA, and is hoping some of the creative tradition at Universal Studios will rub off on the company. At Universal City, the Hollywood theme park, Steven Spielberg is to design a Panasonic Pavilion as a showcase for Matsushita's electronic hardware. Very broadly, Matsushita sees room for MCA to expand its business in Europe and Asia. All these activities are no doubt sound, and in spite of some reports of unhappiness at MCA, Matsushita cannot be accused of mismanaging its subsidiary. Even so, it is striking that two years after spending Dollars 6.1bn, plans for MCA's development still appear to be at the formative stage at best. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that Matsushita, in spite of much talk at the time about synergy, never had a concrete vision about how Matsushita's hardware and MCA's software businesses would fit together. Rather, the acquisition may well have been a defensive move out of fears that Matsushita would be out in the cold should Sony, its domestic rival, make a success of its Dollars 3.4bn acquisition of Columbia Pictures a year earlier. In contrast to Matsushita, Sony bought a studio that was in trouble, and may have in the end invested as much as Dollars 8bn in acquiring a range of film and music interests, including Columbia Records. Matsushita was widely seen as having done the better deal. In the end, though, Sony managed to turn Columbia into the leading US film studio last year, with 20 per cent of the US box office take. Sony's entertainment profits grew to Y53.2bn, a barely acceptable (for a Japanese company) financial return of roughly 5.3 per cent, at least for one year. It is difficult to see how Matsushita will match this sort of performance on a sustained basis, although Mr Furuichi's vision might turn out to be right and all that is needed is patience. Perhaps the more realistic financial measure of the investment would be Matsushita's entertainment profits as a ratio to what MCA would sell for today, which may be reasonably high after all.</p>

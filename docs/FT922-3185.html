			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Fears grow over UK recovery: CBI says retail sales have failed to sustain post-election strength FEARS grew yesterday that the UK's recovery from recession will be slow and uninspiring after a Confederation of British Industry survey showed that retail sales had failed to sustain their post-election strength. The CBI's distributive trades survey for May showed that retail sales increased compared with May last year, but the gain was modest and less than expected. Wholesale turnover was more buoyant, but increased optimism in this sector was offset by gloom among motor traders. The picture of a lacklustre economy was reinforced by news of a 5.95 per cent annual decline in UK car output last month because of a sharp fall in export production. The reports helped depress share prices in London, where the FT-SE 100 index closed down 22 points at 2,614.1. Mr Nigel Whittaker, the chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said retail sales volumes had risen on a year-by-year basis in nine out of the past 10 monthly surveys. But the recovery was slow and gradual. 'It looks as if the improvement in trade is more moderate than that seen at the start of the year.' Among economists, the survey increased concern that UK economic growth this year will fall short of the 1 per cent gain forecast by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in his March Budget. Independent economists have been revising down their forecasts since last month's first-quarter provisional gross domestic product figures showed the UK was still in recession. They have warned that the economy could shrink for the second year running or show growth close to zero unless consumption revives strongly this year. The CBI found that 45 per cent of retailers polled reported an increase in sales last month against 31 per cent who experienced a decline. The resulting positive balance - which indicates the trend - was 14 per cent compared with 20 per cent in April and lower than expected by retailers. CBI economists said the survey's results suggested that retail sales were currently growing at an annual rate of only 1 per cent in volume terms. While sales of clothing, footwear and chemists' goods rose in May, the survey suggested that Britain's weak housing market was continuing to depress demand. Sales of furniture, carpets and electrical and other household goods fell last month compared with the previous year. MFI, the furnishing group, reported that trading had been flat since April. The CBI survey, however, contained some good news: Shop prices are rising more slowly than at any time since the survey started in 1983. Retailers are more optimistic about future trading than at any time since August 1988. Distributors as a whole intend to spend more on investment over the next 12 months for the first time since August 1989, reflecting plans among wholesalers in particular to increase capital spending significantly. The rate of job losses in retailing slowed in May, while wholesalers increased employment. compared with a year ago. Gradual recovery, Page 9 Lex, Page 20 MFI prospectus, Page 21</p>

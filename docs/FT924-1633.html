			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Retail sales fail to lift RETAIL SALES declined slightly in volume terms last month, suggesting that lower interest rates since Black Wednesday have failed to stimulate a rapid economic recovery. The Central Statistical Office said volume sales fell 0.1 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis in November compared with October after a 0.2 per cent increase in October compared with September. Sales in the latest three months, which the CSO regards as a more dependable measure of trends, were up 0.7 per cent compared with the previous three months and 1.4 per cent higher than in September to November last year. The latest figures came as a slight disappointment to the City, where the average of forecasts had pointed to a 0.2 per cent increase in volume sales last month. The Treasury said the figures were consistent with a modest upward trend in recent months that had brought retail sales back to record levels last seen at the start of 1990. November's sales performance has left retailers hoping for a late rush of sales before Christmas. Mr Hugh Clarke, trade policy director at the British Retail Consortium, which says it represents more than 90 per cent of British retailing companies, said sales in December were already showing a better trend. Mr James May, the consortium's director-general, said retailers were 'cautiously optimistic for a reasonable Christmas', but warned that any significant improvement in retail sales was not expected until 'well into the new year'. The consortium said sales of traditional Christmas gifts started slowly last month with the average sale value lower than a year ago. It reported relatively strong demand for food and drink, healthcare products and do-it-yourself goods. Sales of electrical and electronic goods and furniture and carpets were strong, but clothing and footwear sales weakened last month. There also appears to be a considerable regional variation in sales. The Retail Consortium said department stores in London were experiencing difficult trading conditions. The Meadowhall shopping centre near Sheffield reported 14 per cent more visitors since the beginning of September compared with the same period of 1991. Broad CSO figures also showed a considerable variation among the retail sec-tors. Food retailers reported 1.1 per cent growth in volume sales in the latest three months compared with the June-to-August period, while sales of mixed retail businesses were 2.5 per cent higher. Sales of non-food retailers were down by 0.1 per cent in the same period. In yesterday's table of retail sector performance, the top line should have read 'total distribution' and not 'retail total' as published.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Brewery pressures With Whitbread yesterday going unconditional on its offer for the remainder of the Whitbread Investment Company (WIC), made last month, attention once again focused on the brewing group's investment intentions. The latest talk in the market suggests that Whitbread has already been in discussions with the brewing groups it holds stakes in with a view to selling back its holdings. Such a move would be in line with WIC's passive role and save Whitbread the trouble of unloading its substantial stakes into a weak drinks market, according to dealers. One analyst also suggested that Whitbread was likely to use its talks with the various regional brewers to strengthen existing marketing arrangements and to explore new liaisons. However, Whitbread is only under pressure to reduce its stakes in two groups  -Boddington and Marston - to comply with the government's Beer Orders and could yet drip its stakes back into the market at its leisure. Whitbread's 14.9 per cent stake in Morland would be of great interest to Greene King, which it failed to buy last year and in which it still holds a 29.3 per cent holding. Intriguingly, Greene King raised Pounds 15m at the weekend through the PubCo debenture vehicle. Share prices in the drinks sector trod water yesterday. Whitbread hardened a penny to 483p, Marston slipped the same amount to 282p, as did Morland to 518p and Boddington to 255p. Greene King steadied at 569p.</p>

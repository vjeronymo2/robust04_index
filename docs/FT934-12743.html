			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (6): Tense new world - Bonn's foreign policy dilemmas WHEN a phalanx of steelworkers descended on Bonn to demonstrate against plant closures, they painted their hardhats blue. It was a joke of some sophistication. As blue is the colour of United Nations military headgear, the workers were making a sarcastic comment on the obsessive, and sometimes arcane, debate in the capital concerning German participation in UN peacekeeping operations. Only if they wore blue helmets, they were saying, would Bonn heed them. That small incident illustrates a wider problem for German politicians as they struggle to define a foreign policy for their newly unified country. With the ending of the division of Europe, Germany is having to contemplate assuming a political role in the world and in Europe more commensurate with its economic might. But its own citizens are more concerned with the bread and butter issues of recession, job losses and immigration. The result, rather than a clarification of foreign policy issues in the public mind, has been continuing confusion. The good news is that the German political establishment has begun for the first time since the second world war to articulate clear arguments concerning the country's national interests - itself a taboo phrase until recently. The difficulty lies in putting these principles coherently into practice. The UN is an important symbol both of the country's need to find a world role beyond the somewhat passive one it was assigned by the victorious allies after the second world war, and of its difficulty in doing so: even as the government pursues its low-key campaign for a permanent seat on the Security Council, it remains politically - some say constitutionally - hamstrung in doing more than taking a small part in peacekeeping in Somalia and Bosnia. To have sent a contingent of German troops to Africa for the first time since Rommel and to have provided German personnel for Awacs reconnaissance flights over the former Yugoslavia are already big steps in the direction demanded by Germany's allies. But even those 'out of area' gestures remain the subject of a tedious tussle between the coalition partners, the opposition SPD and the constitutional court that illustrates how much further Germany has to go before it will feel comfortable in its new guise. 'Given where we started from, it's quite astonishing how far we've got,' says Mr Karl Lamers, foreign affairs spokesman of Chancellor Kohl's CDU who last summer produced a thoughtful paper on German foreign policy interests. 'But measured against what we need to do and against our own demands for a common foreign and security policy in the European Community, it's still much too little.' For a variety of reasons, similar ambiguities apply in Germany's approach to other multilateral organisations that are arguably of greater national interest. In Nato, German politicians have to weigh their Angst over developments to the east and their desire to maintain and strengthen the transatlantic alliance - a complex balancing act that reflects Germany's pivotal position on the fault line between eastern and western Europe. Instability in the east affects Germany more directly than any other western country: one fruit of that are the hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers that have flocked across its eastern border since 1989. The imperative identified by all mainstream politicians as a result is to integrate the eastern countries into western political and economic structures as fast as possible: in Mr Lamers's catchy phrase, 'our future does not lie in the east; the future of the east lies in the west'. That means principally holding out the prospect of eventual EC membership to Germany's central European neighbours - though until the violent events in Moscow earlier this month prompted some careful backtracking, there were also voices (notably that of Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister) suggesting these countries should also be brought rapidly under the Nato security umbrella. In the European Community - cornerstone and central pillar of German policy since the 1950s - the balancing act is becoming harder and more sensitive still. On the one hand, as the Community's strongest member Germany is discovering that it bears heavy political and economic responsibilities towards its neighbours; on the other, its ability to fulfil them is seemingly undercut by the domestic problems which have followed unification. This is a thorny dilemma - not least for a man of instinctive pro-European convictions such as Mr Kohl - and it is linked to the debate over Standort Deutschland. Unless and until it sorts out its own economy, Germany will not be able to play its full part as the engine of European integration; but if German institutions accord priority to domestic problems - as has the Bundesbank in repeatedly refusing to accelerate interest rate cuts this year  -Germany stands accused by its partners of wrecking the game. Prof Karl Kaiser, head of a leading Bonn foreign policy think tank, says Germany's current difficulties are hampering its effort to come to terms with the international consequences of unification: 'We are in the midst of redefining our political role as the leading economy and currency of Europe. But the structural and temporary weaknesses of the economy potentially undercut such an effort.' For Mr Kohl - who warns constantly of the dangers of a 'renationalisation' of policy-making - and for his foreign minister, the Free Democrat leader Mr Klaus Kinkel, the answer can only be more Europe, not less - a relaunch of the EC now that Germany has been allowed by the constitutional court to ratify the Maastricht treaty, a continuing push for economic and monetary union, an eventual streamlining of EC institutions. But in striving for all that, he faces formidable problems. First, there is the relationship with France, which has in the past year suffered greater stress than at any time in the past two decades. From monetary and exchange rate policy to the future of the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations, significant differences of emphasis have emerged between Paris and Bonn. While these have not fundamentally impaired the Franco-German axis at the heart of the Community, they mean that co-operation has been tinged with mistrust and potential misunderstanding, and Mr Kohl is having to work hard to prevent this from developing into something worse. On the Gatt trade talks in particular, a damaging row among Community leaders later this year cannot be ruled out - and Mr Kohl will be torn between a desire to accommodate French concern over farm exports and Germany's overwhelming interest as Europe's top trading power in seeing the Uruguay Round completed. Second, the prospects for Emu itself remain deeply murky. Behind the exchange rate turbulence of the past year lies a deeper uncertainty as to whether it will ultimately be possible to reconcile Germany's instinctive attachment to monetary stability - and the Bundesbank's statutory duty to uphold it - with its European partners' desire for genuine co-determination in monetary matters. If as the 1999 deadline for phase three of monetary union moves closer that uncertainty is not resolved, the whole project could collapse. Third, and no less important, Mr Kohl will have to contend with an insistent, and growing, mood of popular scepticism towards aspects of European integration in Germany itself - especially towards the replacement of the D-Mark with a common currency. He badly miscalculated the degree to which Emu would prove acceptable to his own people in the first place, and accepts that the Bundestag will have the final say on whether phase three will proceed. With important voices to his right calling for a slowdown in the process, the Chancellor will have to play his cards carefully to prevent the EC, and foreign policy in general, from becoming an electoral issue.</p>

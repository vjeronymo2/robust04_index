			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Motoring: A BMW to tempt Golf and Escort drivers BMW stresses that its new 3-door Compact is not a hot hatchback but a smaller, more affordable version of the 3-Series saloon. Although 9ins (22.5cm) shorter, it has the same wheelbase and interior. What you lose in luggage room - and it is not very much - you gain in accessibility by having a tailgate instead of a boot lid, plus split folding rear seats. Prices of the eight-model range start at a remarkably low Pounds 13,350 for the 316i and go up to Pounds 18,020 for a 318ti Lux automatic. A 318 tds turbo-diesel, priced around Pounds 14,500, is due early next year. The two Compacts I sampled were the cheapest 316i and 318ti (Pounds 15,290). They were typical BMWs in every way: rear-wheel driven, solidly built, well mannered and refined, with a suppressed eagerness. Of the two, I preferred the 316i (pictured). Its 1.6-litre, 8-valve, 102 horsepower engine sounded sweeter than the more vigorous (140 horsepower) 16-valve 1.8-litre. I felt I could live with its less urgent - though still more than adequate - acceleration and lower theoretical maximum speed because it was a car with which one struck an instant rapport. Sensible drivers could expect average fuel consumptions of 38.2mpg (7.4 l/100km) for the 1.6-litre and 34mpg (8.3 l/100km) for the 1.8-litre. The turbo-diesel should return 47.9mpg (5.9 l/100km). Standard equipment includes ABS brakes, driver's side airbag, power steering and central locking with immobiliser - but you must buy your own radio. BMW GB says the Compact is designed to attract former owners of the lapsed, old-shape two-door 3-Series. No doubt it will. But I can see it making plenty of VW Golf, Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra owners contemplate buying their first BMW.</p>

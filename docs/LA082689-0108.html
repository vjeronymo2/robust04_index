			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HURST TO MISS SUNDAY START  </P> <P> Bruce Hurst was examined Friday by the Padres' medical staff at Scripps Clinic,  and their diagnosis matched that of Dr. Arthur Pappas, the Boston team doctor  who examined Hurst Thursday: Hurst might have a slight tear in his groin area.  </P> <P> Hurst missed seven weeks with a groin injury when he was with the Red Sox in  1986, but said his current injury isn't as bad as the old one.  </P> <P> "It's already a lot better than it was a couple of days ago," Hurst said.  </P> <P> Regardless, Manager Jack McKeon said, Hurst will miss his scheduled start  Sunday.  </P> <P> Said Hurst: "We'll shoot for Saturday (his next scheduled start) and see how it  goes."  </P> <P> Don Schulze will replace Hurst in the starting rotation Sunday, opposing Bob  Ojeda of the Mets.

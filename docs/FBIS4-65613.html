			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel; place and </F> date not given: "An Important Partner"]    [Text] [SPIEGEL] Mr. Kinkel, the Federal Government  resolved last Wednesday [4 May] to lift the four-week ban on the  sale of arms to Turkey. Can you accept the responsibility for  the Turkish military continuing to use German weapons against  the Kurdish population in its own country?    [Kinkel] Of course not. But there is no definite proof to  support this accusation. I have had all the photographic  evidence examined by the Defense Ministry. No conclusive  evidence was found that would indicate that weapons supplied by  Germany had been used in internal altercations in Turkey in a  manner contrary to our agreement. Had we had any proof of this,  the sales would have been banned for good.    [SPIEGEL] Independent observers have seen with their own  eyes  Turkish military unimogs made by Mercedes, small arms made by  Heckler and Koch, and Kalashnikovs and armored personnel  carriers from former NVA [National People's Army] stocks, in the  Kurdish region. Has all of this just been faked?    [Kinkel] I would not want to say that. At any rate, I have  seen no convincing evidence. We really did not act rashly,  instead we deliberately suspended the sale of arms following the  most recent accusations and have carefully examined the  photographic material we were given, with the known results.    [SPIEGEL] Only the conclusion differs completely from  statements made by independent arms experts and former NVA  officers, who positively identified eight-wheeled BTR-60 armored  personnel carriers as former NVA vehicles based upon their  special design features for German roads.    [Kinkel] According to the Defense Ministry, these features,  like outside mirrors or white crosses on the backs of the  vehicles, are not proof of German origin. They could also, quite  obviously, have been put on vehicles that were sold to Turkey  from other, for example Russian, stocks. Or the Turks may have  put them on themselves. In addition, not one of the photographs  we were presented with indicates that it was taken during a  military deployment.    [SPIEGEL] German representatives attest to the fact that  they  detected poorly overpainted GDR symbols on some armored vehicles.    [Kinkel] Again: The Defense Ministry has said that this  proves nothing regarding German sales. I cannot enter into  criminal investigations and assessments at this time.  [SPIEGEL] Is it not politically naive to sell 256,000  Kalashnikovs and 5,000 machine guns to a government that has  been criticized for its human rights policies, trusting that  they really will not be used in the civil war?    [Kinkel] The Federal Government has always made it  clear--most recently in a policy statement I presented--that  human rights violations are occurring in Turkey, now as before.  We are constantly pointing this out to Turkish politicians and  are doing everything we can on this issue. That is why I do not  allow myself to be saddled with it personally. But you must also  see that we have been on friendly terms with Turkey for decades,  and it is a politically, economically, and culturally important  partner. It is a partner in NATO and since the abandonment of  the East-West conflict has taken on an important new function as  a bridge to the Islamic, to the Asian world. In addition to  this, Turkey has its problem with the Kurds--and it is not the  only one--and, since the most recent municipal elections, it is  also facing a fundamentalist threat. All of this must enter into  a well-balanced German policy on Turkey.    [SPIEGEL] Taking into account the danger that Bonn will  become jointly responsible for the civil war in Turkey?    [Kinkel] Such criticism is unwarranted. The issue of the  Kurds is a very difficult one for Turkey. Unfortunately there is  little that can be done to help them with it. They must handle  it themselves, but in conformity with the rule of the law. We  Germans cannot solve Turkey's problems from here. But during  difficult times our friends and partners also deserve our  support.    [SPIEGEL] You are the one who propagates the idea of NATO  being a community of values that should defend freedom and  democracy.    [Kinkel] Yes, I do. Unfortunately a pluralist stance, such  as  you represent for ethical-moral reasons--and on that point we  are in complete agreement--is not possible in the area of  foreign policy. For example, we have NATO commitments with  respect to Turkey. It simply is not possible to say we no longer  want Turkey as a NATO partner. That would be a fatal decision  given the current political situation.    [SPIEGEL] Now you are making German influence less than it  is.    [Kinkel] I do not think so. It is becoming increasingly  difficult for me as foreign minister to remind others of human  rights violations when we ourselves are not able to maintain  order in our country. More and more often I am reminded by  foreign countries of how things were prior to 1945 with the  unlawful German state and the holocaust. I am asked how things  were until 1989 in the other part of Germany; was that not an  unlawful state? And how are things now with the violence and  murderous acts perpetrated by the radical right in Moelln and  Solingen? I know of what I speak because in Turkey I stood at  the open graves of those who had been murdered in Germany. That  is why we should be a little more careful and hesitant to point  a finger.</p>

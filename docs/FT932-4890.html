			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / UN acts after Somalia killings: Call for arrest of warlord after ambush of Pakistani troops THE United Nations Security Council last night decided to take action against a Somali warlord, after at least 22 Pakistani peacekeeping troops were killed in an ambush on the outskirts of Mogadishu. It also called on member states to bring the peacekeeping force in Somalia up to full strength and to send heavy weaponry, including tanks and attack helicopters. US helicopters were already reported to have responded to the ambush by bombarding three arms dumps belonging to the warlord, General Mohammed Farah Aideed. Without naming the warlord, the 15-nation Security Council decided that after an investigation, those responsible for the killings - and for inciting them - should be arrested, put on trial and punished. Gen Aideed's faction is blamed for the ambush, the bloodiest single calamity to befall UN peacekeepers since the Congo conflict in 1961. The UN said the Pakistani units were caught in a carefully prepared ambush on Saturday. Casualties included at least 50 wounded and up to 10 missing, assumed captured. The clash came in a chaotic day of shootings and demonstrations sparked off by UN inspection of Somali arms dumps. At least 23 Somalis died in the fighting. Italian troops sent a column of tanks and armoured cars with helicopter cover to rescue 80 Pakistanis and 10 Americans trapped in a disused factory. Outraged diplomats at the UN held day-long consultations, before authorising 'all necessary measures' to arrest the killers and those inciting them, though it was not clear how this could be achieved. They also called for the 'rapid and accelerated deployment' of military contingents to bring the UN force in Somalia up to its authorised strength of 28,000 troops. At present there are 16,700 UN troops in Somalia as well as a 1,000-strong UN rapid-deployment force. A US-led multinational force arrived in Mogadishu last December to ensure relief supplies got through to victims of civil war and famine. But the US handed control of the operation to the UN last month and has withdrawn most of its troops. A report to the Security Council by a senior UN official said it appeared that Gen Aideed had sought confrontation with the UN 'in order to take control of the political reconciliation and judicial processes'. An obstacle in bringing him to trial is the lack of any effective judicial system in Somalia. The Security Council resolution re-emphasised the need to disarm all feuding Somali factions and to neutralise radio broadcasting that contributed to violence and attacks on the UN force. The council resolution called on member states 'to contribute, on an emergency basis, military support and transportation, including armoured personnel carriers, tanks and attack helicopters' to give the force a capability to confront and deter future armed attacks.</p>

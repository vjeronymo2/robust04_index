			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): Araskog leaves ITT succession still open Travis Engen may have emerged as the front-runner to take over the top job at ITT, the giant US manufacturing, financial serivices and hotels conglomerate, but the race is still far from over, writes Richard Waters. The 50-year old Engen, who has been on the fast track since joining ITT as head of one of its defence electronics businesses nine years ago, was last week given operating responsibility for ITT's insurance and communications businesses. On top of his previous responsibilities, this leaves him in charge of businesses which generate Dollars 17.4bn of the group's Dollars 22.8bn in sales. Engen takes over his new responsibities from Dale Comey, 52, himself considered a potential successor to ITT boss Rand Araskog, until he unexpectedly announced his retirement last month. A lot could still happen before Araskog reaches the company's compulsory retirement age of 65 in October 1996, though. It was notable, according to one ITT insider, that Araskog did not take the opportunity last week to anoint Engen clearly as his heir apparent by naming him president and chief operating officer. That could still leave the door to the chairman's office ajar for Robert Bowman, 39, the chief financial officer. Though considered a long shot for the job, Bowman has wowed Wall Street in his two years with the company and has been talked about as a future ITT boss. Meanwhile, there seems little chance of Araskog going before his two years are up. 'We'll have to drag him out of here screaming as it is,' says the insider.</p>

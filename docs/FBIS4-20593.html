			<p>Boron-Carbon   Semiconductor   <F P=102> 43070061X Tokyo ISBB'93 in English Aug 93 p 105--FOR  OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 43070061X </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo ISBB'93 </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Masatoshi Takeda, Akira </F> Hori, Hideaki Yamashita, Kaoru Kimura, and Hiromitsu Ino,  Department of Materials Science, University of Tokyo]    [Text] In the crystallography, it is assumed that an ideal  crystal is constructed by the infinite repetition of identical  structural units in space. Therefore, a five-fold axis of  symmetry cannot exist in a periodic lattice because it is not  possible to fill all space with a connected array of pentagons.  However, in 1984, Scechtman, et al.[.sup]1[/] found a  material with icosahedral point symmetry in a rapidly solidified  Al-Mn alloy. This is the first discovery of ``Quasicrystal.''  Since the discovery, quasicrystals have been found in many  kinds, but only metallic alloy systems.[.sup]2[/] It is  interesting to inquire whether a quasicrystalline structure can  be stable in a covalent bonding system. Boron-rich solids with  B[.sub]12[/] icosahedral clusters are great candidates for a  semiconducting quasicrystal. This is because the icosahedral  point symmetry is typical for quasicrystalline structure.    We analyzed the crystalline structure of the  _a_-rhombohedral  boron as a 0/1-2/0 rhombohedral approximant structure of the  icosahedral quasicrystal, and then constructed the _a_-boron  type quasicrystal. The cohesive energy of the _a_-,  _b_-rhombohedral boron and the _a_-boron type quasicrystal  was  estimated using a molecular orbital total energy calculation.  According to the calculation, realization of the _a_-boron type  quasicrystal is expected.    Experimental search for semiconducting quasicrystal has been  done in the B-C system. The distortion of B[.sub]12[/] is  smallest in the B-C system. If the B[.sub]12[/] cluster is  distorted spontaneously, there is no reason why the icosahedral  symmetry grows. This is why we chose the B-C system. Amorphous  films of B[.sub]100-x[/]C[.sub]x[/] (x=3,5 and 7) were  prepared by an electron-beam evaporation technique. Then they  were examined for the transformation by heat treatment. This is  because most of the metallic quasicrystals have been found as a  metastable phase in a nonequilibrium process. We found a new  phase in the annealing process. The electron and X-ray  diffraction patterns from the phase are identified to be that of  the 1/0-1/0-0/1 orthorhombic crystalline approximant of the  icosahedral quasicrystal. In many cases, the crystalline  approximants have been found near the composition or temperature  range in which the quasicrystal is formed. Therefore, it is  possible to realize the semiconducting quasicrystal in  boron-rich solids.  References    1. D. Shechtman, I. Blech, D. Gratias, and J.W. Cahn, PHYS.  REV.

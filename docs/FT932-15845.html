			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Bonds: Innovative Pounds 200m Barclays Bank issue attracts investor interest BARCLAYS Bank's Pounds 200m issue of 9 7/8 per cent subordinated undated bonds provided a focus of attention yesterday, as dealers and investors examined the latest innovative capital structure created by a UK financial institution. The deal, priced to yield 140 basis points over the 9 per cent gilt due 2006, is callable after 15 years; if the call option is not exercised, interest is reset at the higher of either the current coupon or a margin of 240 basis points above the five-year gilt yield. The issue, arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, was mainly placed with UK institutions. In effect, the structure means that the investor is selling the issuer an option to extend the debt, but many investors may view the deal as 15-year paper, on the assumption that Barclays will exercise the call option. But it is hard to predict the shape of the undated debt market, or even Barclays credit, in 15 years. Meanwhile, for the first 15 years, Barclays is paying substantially less than it would have to pay for undated debt. For example, permanent interest bearing shares (Pibs) issued by many building societies mostly yield about 250 basis points over the long gilt. According to investment bankers' estimates, Barclays would probably have to pay about 95 basis points over 15-year gilts for 15-year subordinated debt. This means investors are effectively valuing the call option they have sold to the issuer at 45 basis points. For this, Barclays is gaining upper tier 2, rather than lower tier 2 capital, which suits its balance sheet needs. At the same time, the bank does not have to lock into an interest rate forever, as in preference share or Pibs issues, which count as tier 1 capital under international guidelines. Despite the attractions of the structure, UK banks have recently been active issuers of subordinated debt, and may not need to raise further capital in the immediate future. The deal met firm demand from UK institutions and could well flow through to retail accounts. The coupon of 9 7/8 per cent for a familiar name appeared attractive in the current low interest rate environment and UK institutions, such as insurance companies, lack higher-yielding longer-dated paper. Pibs have proved a surprising hit with UK retail investors keen to improve their returns now that deposit rates have fallen, and the Barclays deal could also catch on, with a minimum denomination of Pounds 1,000 designed to allow retail investors to participate. Also in the sterling sector, Leeds Permanent Building Society launched a Pounds 100m five-year deal, priced to yield 75 basis points over the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998. Unlike many recent five-year deals, the maturity date of the bond issue and the gilt over which it is priced falls in the first half of 1998. Many recent five-year issues were structured with maturity dates at the end of 1998, taking advantage of the shape of the yield curve to make yield spreads appear more generous. Elsewhere, Citibank launched an unusual issue of collared floating rate notes, through a special purpose vehicle, backed by Federal National Mortgage Association debentures. Bayerische Landesbank added Dollars 50m to its collared FRN launched earlier this week. Collared floating-rate notes incorporate minimum and maximum coupon levels, known as floors and caps, and provide investors with an up-front premium to current short-term interest rates. In the Samurai bond market, the Republic of Finland launched a Y150bn issue of 10-year bonds via Nomura Securities. Finland has now completed about two-thirds of its FM80bn funding programme for 1993, which is to be split between the domestic and international bond market. The Samurai market - the Japanese bond market for foreign borrowers - offered cheaper funding than the Euroyen market, particularly for an issue of this size, even though fees are higher than in the Eurobond market. The deal was the second largest launched in the Samurai bond market, following a Y200bn issue by Sweden last year.</p>

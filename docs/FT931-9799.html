			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Bosnia lays down terms for talks THE BOSNIAN Moslem foreign minister, Mr Haris Silajdzic, yesterday said his government could not continue to negotiate a peace settlement for Bosnia-Hercegovina 'with a gun at our head'. Speaking at the United Nations shortly before the US was due to announce its own peace proposals, Mr Silajdzic said he believed Washington's involvement would secure an international settlement based on democratic principles. He made clear that the Bosnian government would rejoin the negotiations, which it has virtually boycotted since they were moved from Geneva to New York at the beginning of last week, only if certain conditions were fulfilled. These were that the 'genocide' of the Bosnian Moslem population be halted and that the heavy weapons of all sides in the conflict be placed under effective international control. 'If any side does not comply with the placing of heavy weapons under the physical control of the UN, then force should be used.' A particular effort had to be made to help the Moslem population of eastern Bosnia, which was currently the victim of intensive 'ethnic cleansing' policies undertaken by Bosnian Serb militia and had become 'the most endangered species in the world'. Aid convoys have been unable to reach this region. Mr Silajdzic said it was astonishing that the Bosnian government was being blamed by international negotiators for blocking a peace agreement, when UN security council resolutions on the supervision of heavy weapons and the delivery of humanitarian aid were not being implemented. If the latest security council resolution on the delivery of humanitarian aid remains unenforced, then other 'more creative options' should be exercised in getting aid to the needy, he said. The security council could authorise air drops of food, as well as opening Tuzla airport for incoming aid. Reuter adds from Geneva: UN special investigator Tadeusz Mazowiecki yesterday said he was prepared to resign if concrete measures were not taken to prevent human rights abuses in former Yugoslavia,</p>

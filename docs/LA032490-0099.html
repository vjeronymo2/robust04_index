			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HOCH SHOOTS 68 TO LEAD AT BAY HILL  </P> <P> Scott Hoch, playing despite tendinitis in his left hand, shot a four-under-par  68 Friday to take the second-round lead in the Bay Hill Invitational at  Orlando, Fla.  </P> <P> Hoch had five birdies and a bogey despite "mis-hitting the ball all over the  place" and was at seven-under-par 137 after two trips around the 7,114-yard  course. That was a shot better than Jay Don Blake, Larry Nelson, Corey Pavin  and Billy Andrade.  </P> <P> Blake, in his fourth year on the PGA Tour, had the day's best score, a 66 that  included eight birdies -- including five in a row starting on the 10th hole.  </P> <P> Tom Watson, Curtis Strange, Billy Mayfair and Craig Parry were two shots back  at 139. Mark McCumber, Paul Azinger, Robert Gamez, Nick Price and Kenny Knox  were at 140.  </P> <P> "The way I'm hitting, I should have missed the cut," said Hoch, a 10-year tour  veteran with four victories. "I haven't hit a solid long iron yet. . . . I was  lucky."  </P> <P> Hoch, who suffered a torn ligament earlier this year, said his hand hurts after  every swing "but I'm playing through it. My doctor said to stop if the pain  gets too bad."  </P> <P> Hoch lives at Bay Hill but said he doesn't play the course often.  </P> <P> Nelson shot a 71 to go with his first-round 67. Pavin shot his second  consecutive 69 and Andrade, a third-year pro, had a 70.  </P> <P> "Things just went right for me today," said Blake, whose best finish was a tie  for third in last year's Atlanta Classic.  </P> <P> Nelson, starting his 17th year on the tour, was so disgusted with his putting  that he gave his putter to a small boy behind the 18th green and went shopping  for another one.  </P> <P> Tom Byrum, the first-round leader with a 64, fell apart on Friday, bogeying  nine holes on the way to an 81.  </P> <P> "I've got nothing to say," Byrum said after finishing the disastrous round that  tied the high score of the opening round by Mike Nicolette.  </P> <P> Rosie Jones sank a 17-foot birdie putt at the 18th hole to cap a  three-under-par 70 and take a one-shot lead over Donna White and Kristi Albers  after the second round of the LPGA Turquoise Classic at Phoenix.  </P> <P> Jones, who was tied for second place after an opening-round 69, started on the  back nine and went to six-under with birdies on the par-four 12th and par-five  13th holes.  </P> <P> After bogeying Nos. 16 and 18, she birdied Nos. 2 and 4 before her decisive  putt off the fringe at No. 9 for a seven-under 139 total at the halfway mark.  </P> <P> Albers, a non-winner in five years on the tour, shot a bogey-free 70 to take  the early second-round lead. She started the day in a five-way tie for ninth  place.  </P> <P> White, who was a stroke off the lead after an opening-round 69, shot a 71 for a  six-under 140 total on the 6,514-yard Moon Valley Country Club course.  </P> <P> First-round co-leader Cindy Figg-Currier and Janet Coles were both at  four-under 142 through 36 holes. Figg-Currier had a 74 and Coles shot 69.  </P> <P> Larry Mowry shot a six-under-par 66 and grabbed a one-stroke lead after the  first round of the Grandslam Championship at Kurimotomachi, Japan.  </P> <P> Chi San-hsu of Taiwan was a shot behind at 67.  </P> <P> Lee Trevino, the leading money winner on the Seniors Tour, Don January, Dave  Hill and Japan's Hideo Jibiki shot 69s and were tied for third.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VOTERS OK FUNDS TO REPAIR SCHOOLS, REJECT GYM MEASURE  </P> <P> Simi Valley voters Tuesday approved a $35-million bond issue to renovate aging  schools and narrowly rejected an $8-million measure that would have provided  funds to build gymnasiums and an auditorium.  </P> <P> Measures A and B had to be approved by more than two-thirds of the voters to  gain passage. Measure A, which will provide $35 million for new heating and  air-conditioning systems for the district's 27 schools, passed with 7,096  votes, or 70.4%.  </P> <P> But Measure B, which would have provided $8 million for new construction, only  garnered 6,630 votes, or 65.9%, just short of the two-thirds majority.  </P> <P> Voter turnout was a light 21.3% in the special election. There were 48,467  people eligible to vote, but only 10,309 ballots were cast.  </P> <P> Supt. John Duncan said school officials will decide today whether to ask for a  recount.  </P> <P> "It is just too close to rely on the machines correctly counting the ballots,"  Duncan said. "What this means is we'll be able to fix our schools and get a tax  break, but not be able to build anything."  </P> <P> In April, Simi Valley voters rejected a $35-million bond issue by 147 votes.  </P> <P> This time, the district campaigned aggressively for the bond issues. A citizens  committee supporting the measures recruited more than 200 volunteers, and  raised more than $6,000 to hire a political consultant and pay for other  campaign expenses.  </P> <P> Property taxes will decrease with passage of Measure A, Duncan said.  Legislation sponsored by Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and signed  into law last month extends the district's repayment of its existing state  loans.  </P> <P> As a result, even with payments for the new bonds, the annual school taxes on a  $100,000 home will drop from $113 per year to $88 per year. Tax rates will drop  again after 1994 when the existing state loan is repaid.  </P></p>

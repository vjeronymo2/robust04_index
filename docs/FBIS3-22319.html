So can United  States. Even though national observations may be giving the  issue low billing, diplomats say the next battle between the  North and the South will revolve around linkages between  environment and trade.    The next GATT round which will be flagged off when Uruguay  Round deal is signed in April is already being termed the `green  round'. Since India and Brazii are standard-bearers of the  South's concerns, both countries can be expected to be on a  collision course with the West, led by the United States.    Two questions need immediate attention -- How does the South  convert its concerns into a negotiating strategy in GATT ? How  much store can countries place in GATT's professed claim to  multilateralism when the United States maintains all its  unilateral options to strike trade partners thus violating  everything GATT stands for?    At a recent consultation on environment and trade in Geneva,  Kamal Nath said that developing countries were apprehensive of  the nexus between trade and environment and feared that the  latter would be used as a protectionist instrument by high-cost  economies against exports from the developing world. The North  received social and environmental subsidies from the South which  made the former's developments patterns unsustainable, he stated.    "It makes a mockery of free trade and if we have to set  things right then the subsidy has to be recognised and accounted  for," he said adding that what the debate needed was more  science and less scare.    Brazilian Minister for Environment Rubens Ricupero said that  countries need to "strengthen a multilateral approach of  building a consensus rather that resort to unilateral measures  that could be used under the guise of environment protection."  There were over a 150 international agreements that could guide  the world on how to deal with trade and environment issues, he  stated.    India and Brazil have formidable and rich foes, beginning  with Washington. Timothy Wirth from the office of U.S. Secretary  of State has fired the first salvo. Reports say he told U.S.  Congress that his country would use trade measures to support  its environment objectives, listing the following tour as  primary tasks:    -- Trade measures required by an international environmental  agreement to which the United States is a party and assuring  non-discriminatory treatment of those nations that are not party  to it;    -- When the environmental effect of an activity is partially  within U.S. jurisdiction and there is reasonable scientific  basis for U.S. concern;    -- When a plant or animal species is endangered or  threatened  or where a particular practice is likely to cause a species to  become endangered or threatened assuming there was reasonable  scientific basis for U.S. concern; and,    -- Where the effectiveness of a scientifically-based  international environment or conservation standard is being  diminished, provided the standard was specific enough to judge  that it was being diminished and could be made objectively.    In other words, what Washington wants is what India calls  'economically driven regulation packed in green paper', an  insidious way to keep competition from developing countries at  bay. "One way of doing this is to specify standards for either  manufactured items or worse still the processes by which the  items are manufactured, which developing countries do not have  the capacity to meet," Nath said.    For instance, some eco-labelling schemes in western  countries  give value only to environmentally friendly chemical dyes and  ignore natural dyes completely, even though they are equally if  not more ecologically sound. "Thus, Asian countries which are  major manufacturers, and exporters of textiles cannot earn  `Ecolabels' which should rightfully be theirs," he said.    What India wants is that guidelines should recognise  national  environmental and economic policies of developing countries and  that certification procedures should be based on internationally  approved criteria that would outline guidelines for such  certification.    That would leave the formulation of specific standards,  testing and monitoring of the application of procedures to local  standardisation bodies.    What the West wants is a free run for its multinationals,  propelled by their limited environmental concerns.    The problem is not just the West as Kamal Nath laments,  "nobody in India takes these issues seriously." Remember the  Uruguay Round ?</p>

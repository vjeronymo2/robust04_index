			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Speech of the President of the Republic Sali Berisha on </F> the Inauguration of the Factory of Coca-Cola" in Tirana on 19  May]    [Excerpt] Tirana, May 19 (ATA) -- [passage omitted] Two  years ago Albania was freed through deep convulsions from one of  the most brutal dictatorships Europe has known. Communism, with  its "scorches earth policy" left us the consequences of the  bunker type isolation as inheritance, an economy in collapse, a  totally paralysed production, almost complete unemployment,  outdated technology, the long queues, hunger, a budget 60 per  cent of which was covered by the donation and humanitarian aid,  a galloping inflation of 400 per cent a year.    In two years the Albanian Government was engaged in a course  of radical and difficult reforms. On a retrospective analysis,  we could say that in two years Albania managed to reduce  inflation from 400 per cent to 30 per cent, to have a stable and  practically convertible currency, to forget the long queues, to  privatize the land, the flats, services, trade, transport and  thousands of enterprises.    Exports increased 50 per cent in 1993, whereas imports rose  only 7 per cent and the production increased 11 per cent, which  is the highest growth rate in Europe. It is significant that  even this year we are walking with such rapid strides, only the  volume of construction increased 150 per cent without  calculating individual construction. Albania until yesterday  the country of forbidden cars, has imported during 1993, 50  thousand vehicles, in the country of total television jamming  about 30 thousand satellite dishes have been installed during  one year alone. All these changes are accompanied by deep  transformations in psychology of the Albanians who, according to  recent studies, 79 per cent support the market economy; so they  feel free from the state, have complete faith in the free  initiative. We have quite another situation today as regards  foreign investments. They have increased from 60 million  dollars in 1992 to 290 million in 1993 and they are surely  expected to be doubled in 1994 as a response to the stable  finance conditions, free exchange, and trade operation.    Albania in its course of compensation for the lost time and  integration into Europe has not a road covered with flowers. On  the contrary, sacrifices, obstacles and difficulties lie ahead.  But the case of Albania clearly testifies that the shock  therapy, in spite of the pains it inflicts, is the safe road and  the most successful for the transformation of a centralized  economy into market economy. It is painful, but its marrow is  freedom; that is why it must be accepted. Its fruit at the  beginning is bitter, but when it is ripe, it is delicious as the  freedom itself.    On the occasion of inauguration day of Coca-Cola, I would  like to avail myself of this opportunity to say some words about  the really favourable climate of investments that foreign  friends now find in our country. It is true that Albania is a  small country, but I would say that it displays serious real  possibilities for foreign investors. The geographic position,  the young age of the population, good qualification and  education of the people, the very favouable labour market, the  great natural resources in minerals such as chromium, copper,  nickel, energy sources, water reserves and petroleum, the highly  fertile land full of water and sunlight, its natural beauties  and clear environment which also constitutes a great touristic  potential, the political and economic stability, the policy of  peace and prevention of the conflict, of the noble spirit and  the hospitality of the Albanian make Albania, according to my  opinion, a country really attractive to foreign investors.    But I think that more than all of these, importance is to be  laid on the economic and liberal trade policy of the Albanian  Government which aims, without doubt, at creating a much more  attractive climate and the most favourable conditions for the  free initiative and foreign investments which we consider to be  an essential element of economic progress. The government and  the parliament have established today an institutional framework  and a legislation to ensure foreign investments and free  initiative which reduce very much the so called country risk.    The Civil Code is sent to the parliament today, it completes  the package of laws compatible on the banking system, fiscal  management, the legislation of the companies, accounting and the  like. The Law on Foreign Investment which has a special place  in this package is in accordance with international standards  for the protection of investors. The essential feature of this  law is its liberal character and the freedom of action for  foreign investors. It is intended also at eliminating  bureaucratic procedures, it allows the transfer of the capital  and profit, land-lease for 99 years at modest rates and in some  cases even buying it. It provides guarantees for foreign  investors against nationalization, expropriation, or other  actions with similar effects. It is in compliance with  generally recognized principles of international law and it is  accompanied by a number of changes in easing the customs  regulations.    I would like to recall here that today about 45 per cent of  the values entering Albania are exempted from the customs. In  order to stimulate foreign investments, the government has  programmed the privatization of medium and large-scale  enterprises which will facilitate the wide participation of  foreign investors in these prices. In the same way, taking into  consideration the role of infrastructure and its lacking, the  government has decided 37 per cent of public investment for  1993-1996 to go for infrastructure. The analysis of foreign  investments in Albania indicates the real investments and  commitments of the Albanian Government to do everything in its  power to help foreign investors. We invite them to come to  Albania, they are welcome.</p>

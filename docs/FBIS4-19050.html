			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "FAZ Indicator: Broad-Based </F> Recovery"]    [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 11 Apr -- The recovery of the FAZ  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG] economic development indicator  continued with unchanged speed in February. With a value of  108.0, the previous month's level was exceeded by 1.2 percent;  compared to the corresponding month last year, the growth  amounted to 8 percent. With the exception of the FAZ share  index, which again went down slightly following the speedy  increase at the end of 1993, all individual elements included in  the indicator were clearly pointing upward. Thus, the economic  recovery, which has been noted by the FAZ indicator for almost a  year now, is spreading further. The opportunities for economic  recovery in the course of this year have thus improved further.  The increase confidence is particularly obvious in industry;  the Ifo business climate index once again improved tangibly.  After a temporary period of weakness at the turn of the year,  orders received are clearly pointing upward, too. Particularly  gratifying is the fact that domestic orders have, for the first  time, clearly increased again. The positive development of  foreign demand has continued. In addition to the economic  improvement in important trading partner countries, the real  external value of the German mark has declined further. A  positive effect on the economic development is also exerted by  the fact that the interest structure, which has been largely  inverse since the turn of the year, has meanwhile disappeared  almost completely. In total, the prospects are good that the  Bundesbank will continue its policy of a cautious reduction of  short-term interests over the next few months. The number of  FAZ job offers seems to have overcome its low point, even though  recovery is still very moderate in this field.</p>

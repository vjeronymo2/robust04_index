			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 4 (TANJUG) -- The Croat side in the  ex-Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina (BIH) renounces a  Moslem demand that Moslems should hold the offices of president  and prime minister of a future Moslem-Croat federation, it was  stated Wednesday by Kresimir Zubak, leader of the Croatian  community in the BIH. Zubak, in a statement to the Croatian  radio which calls him "president of the presidential council of  the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna (HRHB)," asserts that the  "process of establishing a federation has been delayed by the  Bosnian Moslem side which even tries to accuse Croat  representatives for buying time."    Said Zubak, "the Bosnian Moslem representatives now seek  that  Moslems should be both president and prime minister of the  federation, for what there are no grounds in the constitution,  and this demand would not be accepted by the Croatian side."    An agreement on a Croat-Moslem federation in the BIH, and on  the later entry of this joint state into a confederal union with  the neighbouring Croatia, was signed, under strong U.S.  pressure, in Washington early March. It ended fierce clashes  between Bosnian Moslems and Croats for territories which had  lasted since the beginning of last year. Zubak said he did not  know when the talks on a Moslem-Croat federation would continue  because no invitations were as yet coming in from Sarajevo. He  recalled that Bosnian Croat representatives had so far gone to  Sarajevo three times for talks, never reaching accord on leaders  of a future federation.    The Moslem Radio Sarajevo reported that opposition parties  in  the Republic of Croatia had begun to wonder why Croatian  President Franjo Tudjman was now shelving off for a second time  his official visit to Sarajevo. The Radio quoted Dobrosav  Paraga, leader of the extreme rightist "Croatian Party of Right"  (HSP), as telling a news conference in Zagreb Wednesday that  Tudjman was delaying his visit to Sarajevo "simply because he  does not want the Washington agreement on a Moslem-Croat  federation to be implemented." Paraga asserted that Tudjman  "does not want either the enforcement of the Washington accord  or the renouncement of Herzeg-Bosna as it is termed." Paraga  did not believe in any technical problems around Tudjman's  visit. He did not accept an assertion that "the U.N. Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) does not want to secure the Croatian  president's travel to Sarajevo," the Moslem radio said. The  radio added that what Paraga said was the first public statement  on the Croatian political scene concerning Tudjman's deliberate  delay of his visit to Sarajevo because of being insincere to the  Washington agreement.    Unlike Tudjman, Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic was quoted  by  the HSP as sincerely wanting the implementation of the  agreement, and this was why he invited Tudjman to Sarajevo again  -- said the Moslem Radio Sarajevo in its report from Zagreb.</p>

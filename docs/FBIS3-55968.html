An official part of the visit begins today, ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI  writes. It will be the continuation of the dialogue on a summit  level, started in Vancluver, Canada, last April. The newspaper  points out with reference to Russian experts that "the  discussion of the programme of partnership and cooperation  between Russia and the United States for the late 90s and the  beginning of the 21st century will be the feature event of the  meeting of leaders of the two countries."    An article by Dr.Anatoliy Prokhorovsky, deputy director of  the Institute of U.S. and Canadian Studies under the Russian  Academy of Sciences, published by the same newspaper, says that  the U.S. is doing its utmost for "promoting rapprochement with  Russia."    IZVESTIYA stresses in the headline to the article, dealing  with the visit of the American president, that "Clinton will not  have much spare time in Moscow." Touching upon the meeting at  the Spaso- House (the residence of the U.S. Ambassador) between  Clinton and Russian politicians and business people, planned to  be held today in the evening, the newspaper points to the  absence of V.Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic  Party, among those invited to the meeting. Quoting American  sources, IZVESTIYA writes that "he is evoking apprehension in  the Washington circles, and not only because of his political  views, but also because of his manner of behaviour. They are  afraid that his eccentricity will put Clinton in a very  embarrassing position."    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries articles about the visit of the  honoured American guest under the headlines "Russian President  -- Best Friend of American President" and "Importance of Talks  To Begin in Moscow is Enhanced by Compromise, Reached by Moscow,  Washington and Kiev." As was reported, representatives of  Russia, the United States and Ukraine agreed in principle about  a possibility of signing an accord on the dismantling of  Ukrainian nuclear missiles. The newspaper calls in question the  correctness of this step made by Ukraine. In its opinion,  Ukraine "could imposed its terms on others for a long time to  come, showing a nuclear fist from under the table."    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA writes about President Clinton's visit  to Moscow: "It is expected from the Russian president that he  will share with the U.S. guest his personal observations over  the progress of the economic reform in the country, especially  after the parliamentary elections. They are sure to bring up  the question about the role of international financial  institutions in the building of capitalism in Russia and in  giving a 'human touch' to it."    According to PRAVDA, the Russian part of clinton's visit to  Europe is described by local observers more and more often as  the demonstration of support for Yeltsin.    Commenting on the U.S. plan "Partnership for Peace,"  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA writes that "it was drawn up and adopted with  due account for Russia's lawful interests in the sphere of  security." It is quite probable that Moscow will express the  desire to take part in it, the newspaper points out.    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, TRUD and other newspapers give wide  coverage to the work of the Federal Assembly (the Russian  parliament). It is pointed out that a more constructive stand  assumed by members of the Federation Council enabled them to  make a far greater progress than that of the State Duma.  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA compares the first days of the work of the  State Duma and the first congress of the former Russian people's  deputies. According to the newspaper, they were characterised  by "verbal attacks on Georgiy Lukava, a pilot and the doyen of  the State Duma, representing the Liberal Democratic Party, and  an ordinary adjustment to each other. The behaviour of many  members of parliament showed that they have no idea of the ABC's  of the parliamentary work."    TRUD carries a full text of the interview with Professor  Aleksandr Stoyan, chairman of the Ukrainian Trade Union  Federation. He recognised that Ukrainian trade unions were not  ready to take effective action in defence of working people in  conditions of market-based relations.</p>

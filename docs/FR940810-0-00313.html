Tape or other adhesive used to attach plastic sheeting should be of sufficient adhesive strength to support the weight of the material plus all stresses encountered during the entire duration of the project without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> becoming detached from the surface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other equipment and materials which should be available at the beginning of each project are:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=4 --> _HEPA Filtered Vacuum is essential for cleaning the work area after the asbestos has been removed. It should have a long hose capable of reaching out-of-the-way places, such as areas above ceiling tiles, behind pipes, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Portable air ventilation systems installed to provide the negative air pressure and air removal from the enclosure must be equipped with a HEPA filter. The number and capacity of units required to ventilate an enclosure depend on the size of the area to be ventilated. The filters for these systems should be designed in such a manner that they can be replaced when the air flow volume is reduced by the build-up of dust in the filtration material. Pressure monitoring devices with alarms and strip chart recorders attached  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to each system to indicate the pressure differential and the loss due to dust buildup on the filter are recommended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Water sprayers should be used to keep the asbestos material as saturated as possible during removal; the sprayers will provide a fine mist that minimizes the impact of the spray on the material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Water used to saturate the asbestos containing material can be amended by adding at least 15 milliliters (1/4 ounce) of wetting agent in 1 liter (1 pint) of water. An example of a wetting agent is a 50/50 mixture of polyoxyethylene ether and polyoxyethylene polyglycol ester.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

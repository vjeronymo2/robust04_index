			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Restructuring charge dampens party spirit - Other Companies Another hefty restructuring charge will depress pre-tax profits at Grand Metropolitan, the drinks and foods group, by Pounds 280m to around Pounds 650m for the year ended September. A similar charge a year earlier cut profits to Pounds 630m. It might have managed a few percentage points of underlying profit growth in the latest year. The City hopes GrandMet will spell out on Thursday what the charge, announced in October, will entail. The other key area is the performance of IDV, its spirits business, particularly in the US.</p>

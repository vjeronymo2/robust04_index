			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Aluminium talks run into trouble Talks aimed at an unprecedented international agreement to cut global aluminium output ran into unexpected problems yesterday. Delegates from the main producing countries ended three days of talks with a marathon 26-hour session, which broke up yesterday without agreement. The indications were that the talks had been prolonged by US lawyers combing through an outline agreement to ensure it did not breach US anti-trust laws. The delegates went into the negotiations, scheduled to last for only Tuesday and Wednesday this week, with the aim of cutting world annual aluminium production by 1.5m-2m tonnes for up to two years so as to restore the market to balance. It has been badly disturbed by the collapse of demand in the former Soviet Union, where more than half the metal produced went to the military. As the military no longer requires it and Russia, the world's second largest producer, is in desperate need of foreign currency, the aluminium has been exported in ever-increasing quantities, driving up stocks and sending prices plummeting by half. The talks this week are aimed at deciding how output cuts might be between the main producers. Taking part with Russia and the US, the world's biggest producer, are Canada, the European Union, Norway and Australia.</p>

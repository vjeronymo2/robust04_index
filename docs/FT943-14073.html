			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / BBC boosts Asia reception The BBC said yesterday it would spend Pounds 30m on a new relay station in Thailand to improve reception of its World Service radio programmes in Asia. The relay station, comprising four 250-kilowatt transmitters, will carry broadcasts in up to ten languages and improve reception for more than 45 per cent of the world's population, the BBC said. BBC radio signals are weak in parts of Asia, and a growing number of Asians get news from television. Mr Prasong Soonsiri, Thai foreign minister, signed an agreement for the relay station with British diplomats in Bangkok yesterday. The transmitters should start broadcasting before the end of 1996 and be fully operational by mid-1997.</p>

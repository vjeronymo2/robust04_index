			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Producers Near CBS Deal: Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, the producers of  television's top three programs -- NBC's "The Cosby Show" and "A Different  World" and ABC's "Roseanne" -- were negotiating the final points of a deal with  CBS on Thursday evening that would bring the executives to the network. CBS  apparently will buy the pair's production company and name Carsey president of  the entertainment division, informed sources said. An announcement could come  today. Some TV industry sources said an agreement already has been reached, but  neither side would confirm the reports. If such a deal is completed, last-place  CBS could end up producing the biggest shows on TV -- for their rivals.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ARTISTS  </P> <P> I am convinced that the National Endowment for the Arts should be completely  dismantled.  </P> <P> Many artists are in an uproar because the government wants to tell them what to  do -- and what not to do.  </P> <P> If artists cannot make a living without government help, they should find some  other work. A capitalist government has no business funding any art projects.  But let's face it folks, with our tax dollars funding art projects, we are like  any other socialist government.  </P> <P> Our tax dollars are going toward such "works" as a nude woman smearing food on  her body, a portrait of Jesus Christ hanging on the cross while immersed in  urine, and other very offensive things. This is totally unacceptable to me.  </P> <P> So I have one thing to say to these so called "artists": If you cannot make a  living without government help, go find some other work where you can make a  living! Quit your moaning and complaining!  </P> <P> JENNIFER THIEME  </P> <P> Escondido  </P></p>

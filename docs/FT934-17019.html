			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: Present day fairy tales - Video FAIRY tales in this century have chosen cinema as their natural domain. Finding enchantment-mileage in Moviedom's facilities for fantasy - trick photography, animation, modelwork, music - they have also broadened the very definition of what they are. 'Fairy tales' for filmgoers are not just fables about princesses, frogs and witches. They can be almost any romance which raises the 'real' to the fantastical by exploiting the tropes of the medium. Stars; exotic scenery; hi-fi moral lessons; ritualised, music-washed happy endings. Disney's Beauty And The Beast (Buena Vista) is October's field-leader in the Traditional Fairy Tale stakes. But the new video month also boasts Scent Of A Woman (CIC), Forever Young (Warner), Accidental Hero (Columbia) and a dozen other runners and riders competing for the Romantic Fable Trophy (sometimes incorporating the High-Class Schmaltz Medallion). The Disney film is delight at 24 frames-a-second. The studio recaptures its finest touch, scattering stardust over every component. Music; comedy; artwork (wind-wracked castles, wolf-prowled snowy forests); romance (who will resist a sob at the Beast's final love declaration?) But Hollywood's live-action fables today are scarcely less artfully choreographed for enchantment and moral parable. What is Scent Of A Woman if not a buddy-buddy 'Beauty And The Beast'? Al Pacino plays the heavy-breathing ogre, a suicide-prone blind Colonel going to New York for a last night on the tiles; and young Chris O'Donnell is the innocent who strays into his orbit, an ingenu schoolboy escort who first hates but finally comes to love the old curmudgeon. If your handkerchief is still dry after that film, how about the cryogenics weepie Forever Young? This has love-bereaved airman Mel Gibson deep-freezing himself so that he can wake up 50 years on, far from the pain of loss. Of course he finds a New Love - or is it the Old Love disguised? - on a scenic, violin-washed headland. Then there is Accidental Hero, with Dustin Hoffman as the pauper who saves a wrecked plane and becomes a media prince; and Boomerang (CIC), with Eddie Murphy as the go-getting yuppie who finds true love; and Sister Act (Buena Vista), with Whoopi Goldberg as the gangster's moll who hides in a nunnery and becomes a Warm, Loving Person. Transformation; moral uplift; celestial intervention. Hollywood knows when there are fairies at the bottom of its in-tray. But so - let us be evenhanded - does art cinema. In today's art cinema especially, storytelling is back with a vengeance. We start out watching Sven Nykvist's The Ox (Artificial Eye) or Agnieska Holland's Olivier Olivier (Tartan) or Claude Sautet's Un Coeur En Hiver (Artificial Eye) expecting dour, deconstructive works from European Cinema. But lo] Nykvist's film, based on traditional folk yarn, is a fantasy-touched fable about a man who rediscovers joy after a jail term for slaying an ox to feed his starving family. Holland's story of a missing boy who magically returns to his family - or is it a double? - is a bewitching kiddywink variant on The Return Of Martin Guerre. And in Sautet's film we sense the fairy-tale capitalised characters and upper-case emotions as Coldhearted Violin-maker Daniel Auteuil warms the heart of Beautiful Violinist Emmanuelle Beart. (But will Cruel Fate intervene?) Some movies, of course, stretch fairy-tale traditions in a different direction: away from romance towards farce. When you have had enough of uplift or high emotion, you should try two cracking comedies that turn social satire into pantomimic fantasy. Peter Jackson's Braindead (Polygram) is a New Zealand 'splatter' comedy about the beastly things that happen in suburbia once flesh-eating zombies are loose. And Paul Bartel's Scenes From The Class Struggle In Beverly Hills (MGM/UA) does much the same for the land of the movie stars: though for zombies read film producers, primadonna actresses and other well known society carnivores.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities soar on interest rate hopes LONDON equity dealers sensed yesterday that sterling's effective devaluation and suspension from the ERM may signal a shift in UK government policies in the direction of lower interest rates, and the stock market soared in one of the most heavily traded sessions on record. The day's surge of 105.6 points on the FT-SE Index represented the largest daily gain since the session which followed re-election of the Conservative government in April this year. The closing level of 2,483.9 returns the Footsie to its position of mid-July. Overseas institutions, for which the effective 10 per cent sterling devaluation presented golden purchasing opportunities among UK stocks, had telexed their buying lists to London brokers overnight. Domes-tic institutions soon took up the running as the government's cancellation of Wednesday's two percentage-point rise in base rates turned attention to interest-related stocks. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK investment bank, predicted that base rates could fall to 8 per cent this year. The final Footsie reading was only about four points below the day's high and one point under the level recorded within seconds of the official opening. Share prices fell back to show just a 25.8 gain on the Footsie in the first hour of trading, but the advance was resumed when base rates were returned to 10 per cent, whetting appetites for further reductions soon. For most of the session the market jousted around a 100-point Footsie rise, with brief periods of profit-taking soon replaced by further institutional demand. At the close, Seaq trading volume totalled 1.4bn shares, exceeding even that recorded on the day following the UK general election. Amid the enthusiasm - one well-known dealer called for his famous water-cooled fountain pen - there were a few notes of caution, especially after government bonds began to reflect fears that inflation will be rekindled by lower sterling and interest rates. At Panmure Gordon, the London broker, Mr Robin Aspinall noted that the Bundesbank, which disappointed some investors by leaving rates unchanged yesterday, might not cut rates for some time. At BZW, Mr Richard Kersley suggested caution towards some of the domestic interest-related stocks, such as those in the building and contracting sector, which have been unwilling to respond to reduc-tions in domestic interest rates so far this year. Gains in the overseas earning stocks, including some of the smaller oil issues which have lagged the market, often outpaced the advance of 4.4 per cent in the Footsie. There were substantial rises in bank shares on expectation that lower UK interest rates will ease some of the crippling burden of bad debts overhanging from the domestic manufacturing, property and building sectors. But there was a reaction from the defensive stocks, including utilities. This morning brings the expiry, just after 10am, of the September contract on the FT-SE Index, an event likely to inspire tumultuous activity in blue chip stocks.</p>

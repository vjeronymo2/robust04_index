			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Books: Israel feels the chill THE UNITED STATES AND THE STATE OF ISRAEL by David Schoenbaum Oxford Pounds 30, 418 pages AMERICANS, in one of their periodic moods of navel-gazing, have lost interest in abroad. With the end of the cold war, the US has lost a role and feels encumbered with an empire. The mood of inattention has America's clients worried. Israel, which since 1967 has slipped (against its better judgment) into an unhealthy degree of diplomatic, economic and technological dependence on the US, suddenly feels a disturbingly cool breeze from Washington. Once, the Israelis used to worry about US diplomatic hostility; now, they notice something even more menacing  -lack of interest. David Schoenbaum's is by no means the first history of the American-Israeli relationship, and yet another requires some special, saving grace. He has read scores of memoirs, interviewed participants, and dug out diplomatic documents. He does not, however, use Hebrew sources - a strange deficiency in a book on such a topic published by a respectable university press. As a result, many central issues are skirted or ignored. Then, too, the book mentions only fleetingly one of the main engines of American support for Israel, the Israeli lobbying organisation in Washingon. Called the America-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), it rivals the National Rifle Association with its skill in mobilising support in Congress and the bureaucracy. Why should America continue to support Israel? Until a few years ago, the Israelis could present themselves, plausibly, as formidable regional allies. Now, though, the spectre of the evil empire has been laid and the US is no longer in the market for local exorcists. The Gulf war - in which the Israelis were told, humiliatingly, to put up and shut up, provided a vivid illustration of the transformation of their position in official Washington eyes. Digging deeper into their arsenal of used-up arguments, Israeli spokesmen boast of the 'shared values' of the two countries. But the whole world now loves democracy, chicken McNuggets and apple pie, and it is by no means obvious to the American taxpayer that Israel has a premium over other supplicants at the table. Then, of course, there is the real reason for US involvement: the American Jewish community. The British Foreign Office has long regarded it as perverse and unnatural that US foreign policy should pay attention to the views of this large and influential internal constituency. Ernest Bevin, Labour's foreign secretary after the second world war, ascribed his personal failure at the end of the Palestine mandate to the unwarranted interference of the American Jews in a matter he regarded, with an almost perverse unrealism, as none of their business. Like it or not, though, the bond between the Diaspora and Israel was and is a political fact, one that Bevin and many since discounted at their peril. From time to time over the years, the US State Department, like the Foreign Office, has read American interests differently and sought to steer policy away from support for Israel. But, since 1967, such deviations have always been rectified by the elected elements of US government. American bureaucrats, like their British colleagues, used to regard such presidential or congressional busy-bodying as unconscionable interference in the diplomatic process, but they have by now learnt to live with it. So long as 6m American citizens continue, unfashionably, to maintain interest in a foreign cause, and so long as they are influential in political life, the US commitment to Israel is likely to remain unbreakable. The pathways that lead from this ethnic solidarity to a strange alliance (that is not formalised in any treaty) require further exploration - and never more so than now as the present Arab-Israeli peace talks enter their most critical phase. Unfortunately, this book adds little by way of new information or new ideas to what has been said and written on the subject already. It more or less grinds to a halt around 1987, so that the reader looking for fresh insights into the present 'peace process' will be left unsatisfied. On many key issues, Schoenbaum refrains from disclosing his own views. Was Israel a 'strategic asset' to the US during the cold war, as was often claimed, or was it a millstone round America's neck? Could the US be a friend to Israel and, at the same time, an honest broker in negotiations with the Arabs? Schoenbaum raises a lot of questions like these and throws a mass of semi-digested data at the reader from various angles but he declines, coyly, to provide intelligible answers. Indeed, his only conclusion appears to be that the American-Israeli relationship is 'more special than most.' This is not news.</p>

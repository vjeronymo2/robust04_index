			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Letter: Misleading retail sales behind inaccurate Treasury forecasts Sir, Prof Wynne Godley rightly draws attention to the inaccuracy of the Treasury forecasts (Letters, September 21). Could not a significant factor be the misleading retail sales figures during the period in question? Some retailers believe that the non-food retail sales figures have been as much as 6 per cent greater than actual sales during the March 1990 to November 1991 period shown in the graph. Since the summer of 1989, when retail sales started to show a decline, retailers have regularly drawn ministers' attention to the inaccuracy of the published retail sales. In addition, major multiples, including House of Fraser, have been sending to the Treasury their own sales figures via Price Waterhouse which have shown a significant difference from Central Statistical Office figures. This information seems to have been ignored. The British Retail Consortium is now providing more comprehensive statistics to the CSO, whose own sample has been doubled in size. I trust that these activities will go some way to improving future forecasts. Paul Livesey, House of Fraser, 1 Howick Place, London SW1P 1BH</p>

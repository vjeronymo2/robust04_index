			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> A NEW GENERATION LEARNS WHAT COLD WAR WAS ABOUT  </P> <P> In Hungary, they are correcting history. In Beijing, they are falsifying it.  </P> <P> In Budapest, the government and people are liberating themselves from  repression and lies. In China, the government is repressing the people and  lying about it as it stamps out spring.  </P> <P> In 1956, Soviet tanks and troops already in Hungary crushed the Budapest Spring  as brutally as the Chinese dictators cleared Tian An Men Square. Prime Minister  Imre Nagy, Jan Peleter and their colleagues were arrested, tried and executed  as "traitors" and "counterrevolutionaries."  </P> <P> Of course, the recent rehabilitation of Nagy indicts his executioners and the  regime built on those executed. But that regime has already been supplanted by  reform.  </P> <P> We know now that Orwell was wrong about certain details. It isn't true that  "who controls the present controls the past." Perfect truth and objectivity are  not possible in history.  </P> <P> All the details of the deal between Hitler and Stalin may never be known, but  too much is known about how Stalin conquered and incorporated Latvia, Lithuania  and Estonia for the truth to be ultimately suppressed. Too much is known about  how the Soviet army murdered Polish officers in the Katyn Forest. Too much is  known about what Nagy and Peleter did for Hungary for the official lies to have  been maintained indefinitely.  </P> <P> The truth will out -- about Stalin's great show trials, about the gulag, about  the Nazi-Soviet pact and its victims, about the Katyn massacres and about the  "premature" democrats in Hungary who sought to lead their people toward  democracy and independence before leaders in the Kremlin were ready.  </P> <P> One day, as the future is claimed, the past will be reclaimed.  </P></p>

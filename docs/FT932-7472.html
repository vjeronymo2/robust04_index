			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Stop-gap agreement on Bosnia: Deal mends rift between allies but does little for permanent settlement THE main achievement of the agreement reached at the weekend by the US with its European allies and Russia is that it momentarily heals the rift between them over what to do next in Bosnia. Yet it is clear that the joint plan of action is no more than a stop-gap measure which, while it might damp down the fighting and protect Moslem communities in a number of UN 'safe areas', does very little to provide the basis for a permanent political settlement. No more than lip-service is paid in the final communique to the Vance-Owen plan for a division of Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 semi-autonomous provinces based largely on ethnic criteria. The Bosnian Serbs' total rejection of the plan, and the less than lukewarm support it has won from Washington, has virtually relegated the plan to the already overflowing archives of unsuccessful Balkan peace projects. It can, as the communique from the Washington talks emphasises, still form a building block for a negotiated 'durable' peace settlement, which remains the objective of the countries attempting to find a solution to the Bosnian conflict. But the prospect of anything more than a partial implementation of the Vance-Owen proposals has become very slim indeed. Communiques usually try to put the most optimistic gloss on the outcome of the meetings which they describe. But the Washington communique merely states that 'to the extent that the parties decide to implement promptly mutually agreed provisions of the Vance-Owen plan, this is to be encouraged.' It has recently been conclusively demonstrated that the main provisions of the plan cannot be mutually agreed. Though the ultimate objective of the Washington participants remains 'the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb troops from territories occupied by force', there is no mention in the communique of the precise area to be given up, as there is in the Vance-Owen plan. The phraseology employed is reminiscent of UN Security Council resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflict, which have remained largely a dead letter for more than two decades. Nor are any radical new measures proposed to achieve such a withdrawal. US President Bill Clinton has been unable to persuade his allies to accept either the lifting of the UN arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia in favour of the Bosnian Moslems or 'surgical' air strikes against Bosnian Serb military targets. The emphasis will remain on a tightening of UN economic sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro and the sealing of their borders with Bosnia, which, it is hoped, will eventually force the Bosnian Serbs to adopt a more reasonable position. However, it is not even certain that the proposal to place international monitors on the Serbian-Bosnian border - reiterated by the participants in the Washington meeting - will be accepted by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. According to some reports from Belgrade, Mr Milosevic, while promising to seal the border with Bosnia, has rejected the idea of international monitors. Nor does he appear to be making good his promise to block military and other strategic supplies across the Bosnian border. One of the most positive aspects of the new plan is the formal endorsement by the main powers of the concept of 'safe areas' in Bosnia-Hercegovina to protect the Moslem population from further expulsions and atrocities. But even this idea has been seriously weakened by the refusal of the US, which remains sceptical about the whole concept because of the danger that havens could become no more than huge 'refugee camps', to commit ground troops for their protection. Washington's promise to protect UN forces in safe areas - though, significantly, not Moslem civilians - from attack only by the use of air power falls far short of what its European allies would have liked. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, has openly expressed his 'disappointment' at the refusal of the US to commit any ground troops to the UN's operations in Bosnia, while Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, has said the UK is not prepared to increase the number of troops  -some 2,500 - it already has in Bosnia. Though the Russians have promised to provide an unspecified number of ground troops for the Bosnian operation, it may prove difficult to make up the required number, given the small number of countries with forces qualified for such a task. More important, the refusal by the US to contribute ground troops to the UN Protection Force in Bosnia, coupled with the European nations' rejection of any kind of military intervention, will undoubtedly remain a bone of contention between the western allies. The net result of this can only be a weakening of the political message which they are trying to send the Bosnian Serbs.</p>

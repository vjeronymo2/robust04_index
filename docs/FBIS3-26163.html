In what way can we maintain better management over this special  commodity of grain under the present market economic conditions?  This staff reporter interviewed Lin Yifu, research fellow of  the State Council Development Research Center, on this issue.    [Reporter] People usually foresee a drop in grain prices  after grain harvests, so the recent rise was quite unexpected.  Can you explain this phenomenon for us?    [Lin Yifu] Yes, in today's rural areas, control over the  prices of grain and cooking oil have been lifted, the state  monopoly for purchase and marketing abolished, and market  regulations put into effect. In order to gain the initiative in  management of the grain market, relevant government departments  should learn to act according to the law of the market economy  when they deal with relations between demand and supply in the  market and with changes in such relations. For instance,  increasing the income of peasants in grain-producing areas has  long been a knotty problem, and also one of the major causes for  the recent fluctuation in grain prices. It seems the best  solution at the present stage would be for coastal provinces  with a relatively low comparative advantage in grain production  to reduce their grain-growing areas appropriately and give away  a part of their grain market so they will have a greater demand  for grain produced by grain-producing areas and can help  increase the income of peasants in grain-producing areas through  higher market prices. This may be an effective solution. The  situation in the grain market last year exactly proved that the  abolition of the policy of unified purchase and marketing of  grain has helped us attain the goal of rationalizing the market  setup in accordance with comparative superiority and the goal of  enhancing the interests of grain-growers on the basis of market  strength. This means that using the marketing concept to observe  and analyze the rise in grain prices in grain-producing areas is  a normal phenomenon that accompanies the structural readjustment  of grain-producing areas.    Of course, we should not overlook the fact that the recent  drastic fluctuation in grain prices is also attributable to a  number of abnormal factors. As it is known to all, ever since  the reform of the purchase and marketing system began in 1992,  the basic state policy has been to "relax price controls and  ensure grain quantity"; in other words, the purchasing price is  to be set by the market while the state will guarantee the  fulfillment of a fixed grain purchasing quota of 100 billion  jin. This policy meets with no difficulties when prices in the  grain market are relatively low. However, when grain prices go  up, local governments always find it hard to raise the selling  price in urban areas on the basis of the purchase price. This  is because, on the one hand, the grain- producing areas are  plagued by a relatively backward economic development and urban  dwellers in those areas have relatively lower personal incomes;  on the other hand, local financial departments find themselves  in difficulties and are unable to give urban residents any  further allowance on grain prices. Under such circumstances,  with a view to fulfilling their purchase quotas at a relatively  low price, grain-producing areas adopted the method of  forbidding any outflow of grain from the local market before  they can fulfill their purchase quotas during a time when grain  prices are going up as a result of coastal provinces' increased  demand for grain. It is true that this measure can help check  the rise of grain prices in grain-producing areas, yet it also  has added to the already tight situation in the grain market of  coastal provinces, thus pushing grain prices up to such an  irrationally high level that they are unsuited to the readjusted  production setup. The market price will remain stable if people  can change their way of thinking, act in accordance with the  rule of the market, and eliminate those man-made factors that  can cause fluctuations in grain prices.    [Reporter] Grain is a special commodity. How can we ensure  stable growth in the country's grain production, prevent  excessive fluctuations in market prices, and realize the goal of  increasing grain production and the yield of grain-producing  areas under socialist market economy conditions?    [Lin] In my opinion, the most fundamental way to do this is  to establish a country-wide unified general market. With this  country-wide unified market, areas with a low comparative  advantage in grain production naturally will get out of grain  production and will have a greater demand for grain produced by  grain-producing areas having a high comparative advantage. The  increase in the market demand will push up grain prices; as a  result, the peasants in grain-producing areas can benefit from  increased production and yield, and consequently will display  greater enthusiasm in grain production, thus achieving the goal  of increasing and stabilizing the grain output. This point has  been proved correct by the grain production in 1993, and also by  the practice of relaxing price controls on vegetables, fruits,  and fresh aquatic products over previous years. Theories and  both domestic and overseas practices all have proved that the  larger the market coverage, the greater is the possibility for  different localities to supplement each other and fewer are the  fluctuations in the market price. The establishment of a  country-wide unified general market does not mean on any account  that the government will keep no control over the country's  grain production and marketing. It is necessary for the  government to retain the policy of "relaxing price controls and  ensuring grain quantity," while abolishing the system of unified  purchase and marketing. Relaxing price control is a natural  demand of the market economy, and the key issue is how we are  going to "ensure grain quantity" in order to suit the principle  of the market economy while simultaneously maintaining the  stability of the grain market. At present, China's annual  demand for grain totals around 900 billion jin, of which 600  billion jin is for peasants own use, while 300 billion jin is  commodity grain. "Ensuring grain quantity" should mean ensuring  a total supply quantity of 900 billion jin. In case the total  grain output is lower than 900 billion jin, the state should  draw on stocks or increase imports to make up the deficiency.  Conversely, if the total output is higher than 900 billion jin,  the state should reserve more grain or reduce imports so that  there will not be excessive surplus grain. By so doing, the  supply and demand will be in a well-balanced state, peasants'  expectations on prices will not fluctuate following the increase  or reduction of grain output, and the 300 billion jin of  commodity grain will be guaranteed. Under the prerequisite of  the socialist market economy, "ensuring grain quantity" should  mean ensuring the total quantity supplied instead of the total  quantity purchased. The task of ensuring grain quantity should  be shouldered by grain departments at the central level, not by  individual local governments. As a matter of fact, it is much  easier to ensure a total supply of 900 billion jin than to  fulfill a purchase quota of 100 billion jin. This is because  over the past 40 years or more -- except for the years 1959 and  1960 -- the country's total grain output has never dropped for  two consecutive years, while the annual reduction rate never  exceeded 5 percent except in a few years. Therefore, an annual  turnover volume in state grain reserves of no more than 50  billion jin can help maintain a stable grain price and a stable  supply of commodity grain in the national grain market.    [Reporter] Can we say that the recent fluctuation in grain  prices has showed once again that strengthening and improving  macroeconomic control and regulation is an indispensable link in  building up a market economy structure?    [Lin] Yes, and this is especially true with the management  of  grain as a special commodity, for macroeconomic control and  regulation are essential with this commodity. Grain has a great  bearing on the state planning and the livelihood of our people.  Any abnormal fluctuations in the market price of grain which  fail to be brought under effective control may possibly endanger  social stability and tarnish the overall situation of reform.  This time, because the government acted instantly and took  resolute measures, the market price of grain returned to normal  in less than 10 days. The measures taken by the government were  highly prompt, necessary, and correct, which gives full  expression to the great importance of the state's macroeconomic  control and regulation, the position of state-owned grain  enterprises as a major channel, and the role of state grain  reserves in stabilizing supply and demand in the market.    To us, the recent fluctuation in grain prices served as a  concrete lesson in market economics, and the measures aimed at  stabilizing grain prices were a valuable experience for us to  use in our future grain work.</p>

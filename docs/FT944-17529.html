			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Schroders and News Corp avoid High Court battle A High Court battle between News Corporation, the media group owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch, and J Henry Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank, has been averted after both sides agreed to drop the proceedings. News Corp said in a statement it had been advised by the bank's solicitors that Schroders did not wish to defend the writ issued by News. 'Schroders have now agreed to abandon any claim it might have had against News on the basis that News will not pursue any claim for legal costs against Schroders,' it stated. A dispute arose over announcements made last December by three News Corp subsidiaries. The announcements, which related to conversion of those companies' preference shares into Royal Doulton shares, were subsequently stated to have been made in error. Schroders incurred losses arising from the announcements. It recently proposed that the dispute be brought before the City Disputes Panel for resolution. However, News Corp issued court proceedings seeking a comprehensive court ruling that it was not liable for Schroders' claim. Schroders, however, said in a statement it was 'not prepared to be involved in High Court proceedings, where the costs would have been substantial and could, in view of the amount at stake, have rendered any sum that it might have recovered nugatory'. The settlement with Schroders does not resolve the complaints raised by other investors who suffered losses in connection with the announcements. However, News Corp said it believed its agreement with Schroders substantiated News' position. Accordingly, News does not plan to issue court proceedings against other claimants. Should other claimants issue proceedings against News, it vowed to 'defend its position vigorously'.</p>

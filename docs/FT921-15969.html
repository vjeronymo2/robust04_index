			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Tokyo may set targets for car imports As dealers (above) tried to sell US cars in Tokyo showrooms yesterday on the eve of President Bush's visit, Mr Kozo Watanabe, international trade and industry minister, said Japan would probably have to set import targets for US cars and car parts to satisfy American demands, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The minister was due to appeal to Japan's car industry to boost purchases of US cars and components. 'I must ask for your co-operation to make (Mr Bush's) visit a suc-cess,' he told industry officials. Car trade friction and Japan's trade surplus with the US will be high on Mr Bush's agenda. Japan's big carmakers plan to boost purchases of foreign-made cars, but some say there are limits to what they can do. Toyota and Nissan said yesterday they might boost imports further. Sales of US-made vehicles in Japan for January-November 1991 totalled 27,754, out of 180,852 imported vehicles sold there in the same 11 months.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandar Milosevic: "Boban"] </F>   [Text] A change of policy or a change of players? This  question has been asked by many people after information reached  us from Livno that Mate Boban had laid down the presidential  mandate of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna. There had  been rumors about Boban's resignation for a long time, but no  one expected that it would happen that dramatically. Boban  publicly announced his resignation at the end of his speech in  the extraordinary session of the chamber of counties of the  parliament of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna. His  decision was neither voted for nor was it discussed very much.  The information that the duties of the president will be  performed by a collective body -- the presidential council --  confirms that Mate Boban is not the first man in Herceg-Bosna  any longer.    The fact that the chamber of representatives of the  parliament of Herceg-Bosna adopted in its session in Livno the  declaration that confirmed the present politics and the attitude  that a sovereign Croatian state in the future union of  Bosnia-Herzegovina would be the optimal solution to the Croatian  national problem in this area made the confusion caused by  Boban's resignation even worse.    Boban's resignation can also be discussed in the light of  the  meeting held in Sarajevo, in which -- regardless of the  legitimacy of its participants -- the idea about Herceg-Bosna as  the only possible solution to the Croatian problem in  Bosnia-Herzegovina was rejected. Most of the participants in  the Livno meeting denied the Sarajevo meeting participants the  right to speak on behalf of the Croats who live both in Bosnia  and in Herzegovina, but nothing more than that was done.    That is why many people are ready to conclude that Boban's  resignation is a sign of a certain turn in the politics of those  Croats who have so far supported the idea of Herceg-Bosna as the  only possible option. The basic elements of this option will  probably not be changed, but it is obvious that other proposals  might also be accepted. We have to see Boban's resignation in  that light. The space for new ideas has been created, although  it is obvious that the two Croatian options -- the one in Bosnia  and the other in Herzegovina -- cannot come closer soon.    We have to wait for the international political factors to  act and see how they will assess the resignation of the Croatian  leader of the republic of Herceg-Bosna. If we can judge by the  contacts Mile Akmadzic has had so far on behalf of Herceg-Bosna,  there are good prospects for future negotiations.</p>

It is buying the business and certain assets of the mobility products division, trading as Vessa, from BTR Industries. Some Pounds 600,000 of the consideration will be raised by the placing of 2.54m shares at 24 1/2 p each, underwritten by Allied Provincial Securities. Group turnover rose 16 per cent to Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 20.1m), operating profit was up 69 per cent at Pounds 1.22m (Pounds 720,000), and the pre-tax balance worked through at Pounds 806,000, compared with Pounds 1.24m in 1991 which included gains on disposals and reorganisation of Pounds 1.3m. The acquisitions - MCM in January and Cargo Controls in June - performed up to expectations. Earnings per share were 1.42p (losses 0.22p pre-exceptionals). The dividend is 0.5p and is the first since 1989. The improved trading of the latter part of the year has continued into 1993 and orders in most businesses were at higher levels. Improved performance from existing divisions was expected.</p>

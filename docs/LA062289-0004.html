			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: IN TRUTH, SHAMIR'S LIE GAVE HIM ENTRY TO NEW HOME  </P> <P> It was a case, argued Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, where the end  justified the means, as the Jewish leader confessed that he lied extensively to  gain entrance to Palestine from Poland as a young man of 20. In 1935,  restrictions for living in Palestine, which the British ruled under a League of  Nations mandate, were such that Shamir judged the only way he could get in  would be to apply to study at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In the  application, Shamir fibbed that he had studied law for a year at Warsaw  University to please his parents but that Hebrew literature was his true love.  The letter "wasn't too accurate a description of my feelings," Shamir conceded  in a speech to 600 Israelis who were able to escape the Nazi Holocaust by  gaining acceptance to the university. Once there, "I wanted to study," Shamir  said, but "I got involved in other things." In 1940, he became a founder and  leader of the Stern Gang, which carried out a campaign of political  assassinations and bombings to force an end to British rule in Palestine.  </P> <P>  -- Working full time is no excuse not to get involved, declared the new  national director of the PTA, who becomes the first woman to head the  organization while also maintaining a full-time career. Ann Lynch, 64, the  public relations director at Humana Hospital Sunrise in Las Vegas, vowed to  overhaul the image of the 6.6-million-member group. "The PTA is not an  organization for homemakers," she said. "It is for parents and others who care  about young people. . . . You can work full time and be involved. Just because  you work is no excuse."  </P> <P>  -- An infant boy with severe burns was the first beneficiary of an Illinois  man's decision to donate four square feet of his excess skin to a hospital burn  unit. Through dieting, Dennis Genz had shed 170 pounds but was left with a  large flap of skin on his abdomen, which was removed surgically Monday. Some of  the 19 1/2 pounds of skin and adjoining tissue went to Dexter Moore, a  3-month-old Indiana fire victim. "There have been rare cases where parents have  donated skin for their children," said Betty Perls, education director for the  Regional Organ Bank of Illinois. "But none of us have ever heard of a case like  this." ANN CONNORS  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] President Lissouba of the Congo has been a busy man.  Yesterday, he had two separate meetings with his own supporters  to give them a ticking off and with the opposition to float some  radical ideas. The opposition has been giving the government a  hard time since last year's controversial elections. There was  a virtual civil war in Brazzaville between government and  opposition militias for many months. On what President Lissouba  had to say, Antoine Mouyambala telexed this report from  Brazzaville.    President Lissouba proposed that some form of power sharing  agreement could be made based on the example of South Africa.  He said: If blacks and whites can share power in South Africa,  we too should be able to surmount our ethnic differences.  President Lissouba has recently suggested that Congo could  follow the example of South Africa by giving the main opposition  leader the post of vice president.    Lissouba said he thought the Congolese Constitution, which  is  based on the French one, was unsuitable. He said this  constitution, which gives everything to the winner of elections  and nothing to the loser, runs against the Congolese spirit of  negotiation and dialogue. The president asked his supporters in  parliament to speed up the process of administrative  decentralization, which would allow for some degree of power  sharing with the opposition.    Lissouba criticized his supporters, saying they were wasting  time with administrative details. He said they should just get  on with decentralization.    Both opposition leaders and the president's supporters have  responded favorably to his ideas on power sharing. Opposition  leader Bernard Kolelas said Lissouba's proposals were extremely  interesting.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Telford and Shropshire (4): Town loyalty is what counts - Large companies help stabilise the economy Muller, the German dairy foods group, this year will produce Pounds 125m worth of yoghurt at its new custom-built plant at Market Drayton. Shropshire would like to have a few more companies like it. Indeed, the county council made abortive bids to attract Toyota, the Japanese motor manufacturer, and Fortex, the New Zealand, meat processing company. The reason is not far to seek. Shropshire is a county of small towns. Loyalties lie with the towns rather than the districts of which they are a part. Large companies help to stabilise the local economy of particular areas. If they close, then the immediate effects can be far reaching on relatively small communities, pushing them into a spiral of decline. Outside Telford, the largest concentration of people and economic activity is Shrewsbury, the county town. It is not only a modest manufacturing centre in its own right with companies such as Perkins Engines and Vickers Precision Components, but also a significant retailing and financial services centre, drawing in business from both the county and mid-Wales. Its diversity and size meant that Shrewsbury survived the recession in better shape than the industrial centres. Analysis of unemployment on a district basis by the West Midlands Enterprise Board showed that, at the end of the summer, unemployment in Shrewsbury was 8.3 per cent compared with 10.6 per cent in The Wrekin, of which Telford is a part, and 10.3 per cent in Oswestry in the north of the county. Where there is less diversity, local unemployment rates have been higher. When JP Woods closed its poultry processing plant in Craven Arms, south Shropshire, with the direct loss of 500 jobs, it threw out of work 6.5 per cent of the local labour force. New investment to compensate for that shock to the local economic system has not been forthcoming. The combination of national recession and the relative decline of agriculture led to a chain of plant closures. At Ellesmere, in the far north of the county, closures and or reductions in plant size at companies like Dairy Crest, Swan Hill Engineering and Ellesemere Electronics caused 600 jobs to disappear. At Express Dairies in north west Shropshire, cheese making stopped and 140 jobs were lost. When Farmgas, producing energy from farm waste in Bishops Castle on the south west side of the county, transferred operations to Derbyshire, 100 jobs went. St Ivel's decision to close a yoghurt plant in Whitchurch, north Shropshire, led to the loss of 180 jobs. Whitchurch has become of concern to the county council whose economic officials noted that 'there has been a chain of redundancies over the last 10 years. The town has lost its manufacturing heart. There is no longer a major manufacturer. The biggest employer is Tesco (the supermarket group). Market Drayton was going the same way'. The difficulties of Whitchurch point up the more general problem of a contracting rural economy as lower demands feeds through to the food processing plants and the individual farms. Herein is the significance of Muller's decision to build a Pounds 30m plant in Shropshire. According to the county council, 70 local dairy farms are supplying milk exclusively to Muller. The plant itself is now employing 460 people. Its presence has helped to rebuild local business confidence which, in turn, it is hoped, will generate more employment out of its own momentum. But investments on the scale of Muller are rare, although, in co-operation with the West Midlands Development Agency, the regional inward investment organisation, the county council is approaching 550 French companies in the hope that some might wish to set up in Shropshire. For the most part, however, the small market towns of the county will have to seek salvation elsewhere from the declining rural economy. In the absence of interest from the private sector, local authorities are trying to provide the infrastructure for the development of small scale industry. Thus, the county council has completed serviced land schemes in Bishop's Castle and Craven Arms. Local authorities are co-operating with the Rural Development Commission and, where the public sector partners can spark an interest, with the private sector to provide industrial space in, for example, Oswestry, Ellesmere, Cleobury Mortimer and Clun. In the case of Shrewsbury, property development is extensive, with the county council involved in four schemes for industrial and office use. One site has been sold to Mercury Telecommunications for a new fibre optic centre; three acres of an 18-acre project have been sold to Massey Ferguson, the agricultural machinery group for a sales and service centre. Alongside infrastructural developments, there is a programme of environmental improvement in market towns such as Ludlow and Oswestry, the better to encourage tourism and to exploit the alluring county landscape. Shropshire's slogan for tourists is 'Staying Off the Beaten Track'. But the county would prefer industry to get on to it.</p>

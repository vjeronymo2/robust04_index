MP Aloyzas Sakalas, chairman of both the party and the  faction, told reporters Tuesday that the social democrats will  ask other political forces to back their initiative because six  members of the LSDP in the parliament will be unable to start  the process alone. Sakalas said the parliament will consider  their demand only if it is supported by at least 27 lawmakers.    In a statement released last weekend, the social democrats  mainly criticize the government's refusal to set a more  favorable exchange proportion for people's savings during the  introduction of national currency, as well as to draw a distinct  line between legally and illegally acquired money.    The LSDP said the Cabinet does not observe the government  program that was approved by the parliament, has not worked out  a program for industry reconstruction and failed to draft an  investment program.</p>

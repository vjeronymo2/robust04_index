			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Spanish in Palestinian venture BANESTO, the big Spanish commercial bank, said yesterday it had formed a Dollars 60m (Pounds 39.7m) joint venture with Israeli, Palestinian and Moroccan groups to fund development in Jericho and in the Gaza strip. The venture, called Salam 2000, brings the Spanish bank together with Koor, the Israeli industrial and financial group, as well as Morocco's powerful Omnium Nord Africain (ONA) holding and with Palestinian investors lead by Mr Jawid Ghossein, the head of the Palestine National Fund, a para-governmental body that acts as the finance ministry of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Banesto, which did not disclose details of the shareholding in the joint venture, said Salam 2000's initial project would be to finance a cement factory in an unamed location. The bank said it intended to tap the US markets for a further Dollars 150m for more investments in the area. It described the move as a pioneering investment in the Israeli-occupied territories where the Palestinians are being granted self-rule. Earlier this year Banesto established close relations with JP Morgan, the US investment bank which is helping the Spanish group to raise its capital base through rights issues aimed at US institutions.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Bonn-Paris action on naval patrol GERMANY AND France will establish a joint naval squadron next month, expanding bilateral co-operation as a model for a wider European defence force, Bonn's defence ministry said yesterday, Reuter reports. Patrol ships from both countries will form a joint sea surveillance squadron which will train by annual rotation in French or German waters under local command, a ministry statement said. The squadron, which will assemble for the first time on May 14, is part of a joint defence initiative started last year by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Francois Mitterrand of France. Mr Kohl and Mr Mitterrand announced last October plans for a 35,000-strong Franco-German corps to be set up by 1995 which they hoped would be the nucleus of a more broadly based European force. The two advocates of greater unity in the European Community set up a Franco-German brigade of some 5,000 men in 1990. A Bonn ministry spokesman said the navy element would bring together a German squadron of eight ships and 612 men with French counterparts in the Mediterranean port of Toulon for three weeks of manoeuvres under French command.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 6 (AFP) -- Four hardline deputies who  recently visited the Serb enclave of Krajina, in Croatia, and  Serbia called Wednesday [6 April] for a military alliance with  the Serbs and said Moscow should set up a naval base off the  Adriatic coast.    "We must recognise on a diplomatic level the republic of  Serb  Krajina and establish a military and political union with that  state," said Deputy Speaker Vladimir Vengerovskiy, a member of  the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party.    "Russia's traditional interests in the region lie with the  Serbs and we must join them in a political and military union,"  Communist Deputy Vitaly Sevastionov told a news conference.    The call for a closer alliance with the Serbs came as  Russian  diplomats were attempting to broker a peace agreement between  Croatian officials and Serbs in Krajina.    The delegation said that Serb leaders in Krajina and  Belgrade  were prepared to offer land on the Adriatic coast to Russia for  a naval base and said that up to 200,000 Russians would be  welcome to live there.    "They could be refugees from ethnic conflicts in the former  Soviet Union or military leaders who lost their posts because of  the pull-outs", Sevastionov said.    The deputies said the Serb leaders would make an official  proposal on establishing a naval base in the near future.    They also said that the State Duma would discuss in the near  future lifting UN sanctions against the former Yugoslavia,  stating that the measure amounted to the "genocide of the  Serbian people" in the Balkans.    The news conference was held hours before a rival  parliamentary delegation led by reformist Deputy Viktor Sheinis  was to meet journalists to discuss its separate visit to the  former Yugoslavia.</p>

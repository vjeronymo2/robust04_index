			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAMPRAS LOSES TO BERGER IN HIS FIRST MATCH SINCE WINNING THE U.S. OPEN  </P> <P> Pete Sampras, who won the U.S. Open Sunday, was defeated by Jay Berger Thursday  at the All American Tennis Championships.  </P> <P> Sampras, who lost, 6-0, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5), had trouble on the clay courts.  </P> <P> The tournament was played on clay because one competitor, Michael Chang, will  be on clay next week during U.S. Davis Cup play in Austria, officials said.  </P> <P> "Jay's a very good competitor, especially on clay," Sampras said. "I started  off real slow. I had absolutely no timing."  </P> <P> In other first-round action in the $210,000 tournament, Chang defeated Tim  Mayotte, 6-1, 6-4, and Aaron Krickstein beat Richey Reneberg, 6-2, 6-1.  </P> <P> The event , which is now in its ninth year, only has American contestants. The  field consists of eight men and four women.  </P> <P> Berger, the defending tournament champion, said of Sampras: "Clay is not his  best surface." Berger also said: "Pete has been through a couple of tough weeks  and I've had a week off. And although he's the U.S. Open champion, it was nice  to see he hasn't changed. There's no aura around him like Lendl, mainly because  I've known Pete for a long time."  </P> <P> Women's competition starts today, with U.S. Open quarter-finalist Mary Joe  Fernandez taking on Amy Frazier and Ann Grossman meeting defending tournament  champion Kathy Rinaldi, the Amelia Island touring pro.  </P></p>

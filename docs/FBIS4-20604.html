			<p>Convection   and Diffusive Transport   <F P=102> 43070038D Tokyo NASDA REPORT in English Summer 1993 p 18 --  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 43070038D </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NASDA REPORT </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Principal Investigator Hisao Azuma, leader, 10th </F> Group, Space Research Group, National Aerospace Laboratory]    [Text] Perfect zero gravity conditions do not exist in the  Space Shuttle or Space Station. Some steady-state gravity  (residual gravity) caused by air resistance and shifting from  the gravitational center remains. There is also some vibration  (g-jitter) caused by human activities and the operation of  various machines. The residual microgravity is deemed to  generate new flow or influence flow however minute it might be.  To learn these effects, therefore, is very important in the  field of fluid handling and material processing.    The residual gravity is estimated to be 10-5 to 10-6 g and  causes a slight flow in one direction. G-jitter is a vibration  with various frequencies at levels of 10-3 to 10-4 g. Lower  frequencies are expected to influence flow, and higher  frequencies, to exert a strong influence on the dispersion.  Computer-simulated flow in residual gravity and g-jitter is  shown in Figure 1. In this case, the flow is disturbed by low  frequency.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-59B>      Figure 3. Ground Simulation Test of Electrolytic Color </FIG>     In the experiment, an experiment vessel as shown in Figure 2  is used for actually observing and quantitatively measuring such  phenomena. The rectangular solid vessel (7 by 8 by 2  centimeters) is filled with water, salt, and pigment  (phenolphthalein). A temperature gradient is then induced in the  liquid by heating (70C) the upper surface of the vessel.  The temperature gradient causes a flow when gravitational  acceleration exists. The flow is observed by the electrolytic  color development method. The solution of salt is electrolyzed  by installing the anode (silver plate) and the cathode  (palladium wire) in the vessel and turning on electricity. The  pigment is discolored by the hydrogen ion concentration (pH)  change near the cathode. The flow can be detected by the moving  pattern of the discolored portion. Actual discoloration on the  ground is shown in Figure 3. The transparent liquid becomes  reddish purple. In electrolyzing the solution of salt, chlorine  gas is generated at the anode and hydrogen gas at the cathode.  In this experiment, those gases are absorbed by the silver and  the palladium respectively and the generation of bubbles which  hinder the experiment is prevented.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-59C>      Figure 1. Light Response of Goldfish </FIG>  A heater is embedded in the upper surface of the vessel  and thermocouples for temperature measurement on the left and  right faces. A bellows is attached on the left face of the  vessel to allow sample solution expansion due to heating. As too  much discoloration of the pigment hinders flow pattern  observation, the cathode (palladium wire) is painted red in  places to prevent discoloration of the pigment at these  places.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-60A>      Figure 2. Change of Light Response of Goldfish </FIG>     In space, the Convection Diffusion Unit (CDU) with the above  vessel installed will be housed in VIBES, and experiments will  be conducted with isolation on and off to determine whether the  Shuttle vibration is mitigated or not. The effects of the  g-jitter will be better understood by comparing the results of  the two cases.</p>

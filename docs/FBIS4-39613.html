			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov, Nikita </F> Yermakov, and Igor Shchegolev]    [Text] Paris, 8 Jun -- Russia proposes the holding of  another foreign ministers' meeting on a settlement in  Bosnia-Herzegovina should be moved up. This was stated today by  Andrey Kozyrev, head of the Russian foreign policy department,  speaking to journalists at the Russian Embassy in France.    Today's exchange of opinion with French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe and other colleagues on the efforts of the "contact  group" on Bosnia convinces one that the difficulties in its work  should not serve as pretext for postponing the meeting of  ministers, he pointed out. On the contrary, "in the next week  or two" a second meeting of ministers on the Bosnian problem  should be held. "It is clear that a political level is needed,  first of ministers, and then also of the leaders of the  countries in keeping with the initiative of President Boris  Yeltsin, in order to bring forward a political resolution of the  conflict," the head of Russian diplomacy stressed. "The `contact  group' was able to do some important preparatory work, but it  cannot replace the ministers." So, in his opinion, a ministerial  meeting should not be postponed.    The first such meeting was held in Geneva on 13 May with the  foreign ministers of Russia, the USA, and five countries of the  European Union participating.</p>

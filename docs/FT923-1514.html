			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Observer: Eccentric It's a funny old world inhabited by Britain's top mandarins, at least in their off-duty hours. Their recreations vary from 'eccentricities' (Robin Birch, Social Security department) to 'collecting domestic anachronisms' (Robert Venables, Charity Commission), according to the first edition of Dod's Whitehall Companion, the new Who's Who for Whitehall. The prime minister's principal private secretary Alex Allan is a 'deadhead' (or follower of the US rock group Grateful Dead). Professor Anthony Hawkins, director of fisheries research at the Scottish Office, is into whippet racing. And Ian Burns, head of the Home Office Police Department, likes 'adventurous gardening' - whatever that is. There are at least two couples in the book. Rosalind Gilmore, who is chairman of the Building Societies Commission, fortunately shares the same recreations as her husband Brian (a big shot at the social security department): music and Greece. John Rimington, director-general of the Health and Safety Executive, likes walking, gardening and watching cricket. Stella Rimington, meanwhile, does not disclose her recreations, or much else apart from a brief career history: Security Service 1969-, director-general 1992-. As chief spook hunter, she'll have whiled her days away as a lamplighter, pavement artist and scalp-hunter.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Councils attack urban agency plan THE CREATION of the Urban Regeneration Agency to take responsibility for bringing derelict land into use reflects 'a continued stagnation in government thinking on urban policy', according to a local authority report. The study, by the Docklands Consultative Committee, an association of east London local authorities, criticises the agency's emphasis on property development schemes and its reliance on the 'trickle down' of benefits to the community. The report says the agency's potential is limited by the government's unwillingness to link it to a wider economic or industrial strategy, while its limited resources will prevent it from making much impact. The report was largely based on responses to the Department of the Environment's consultation paper on the agency. The Urban Regeneration Agency: Property or Partnership-led?

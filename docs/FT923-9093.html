			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Arts: La Bayadere - Ballet ALTYNAI Asylmuratova has been bringing her radiance to the last weeks of the Royal Ballet season, making her debut as MacMillan's Juliet, and, in La Bayadere, reasserting her absolute command over this fascinating work. Bayadere is about many things, implicit and explicit: about sexual passion and dance training, about religious belief and belief in an old theatrical style. It is the intoxicating beauty of Nikiya, the temple dancer heroine, which precipitates the drama, and Asylmuratova's loveliness - that of a Helen from the East - calmly, gloriously justifies the action. (When the High Brahmin removes the veil from her face at her first entrance, we understand everything that is to follow). But Bayadere is also about the Petersburg, and Russian, dance-style, about the grandeur of its scale and the fullness of its emotional and physical tone. Step and gesture from Asylmuratova, and from Irek Mukhamedov, her Solor on Tuesday night, have a largeness of dimension, a sense of expanding tremendously into space and establishing great shapes that are emotional as well as actual, so that every movement is resonant. The following evening, Viviana Durante and Tetsuya Kumakawa took these same roles. Their interpretations were accomplished, technically polished, but wore a cloak of modesty - unnecessary in view of their gifts - that muted the ballet's opulent colours. For Bayadere is also about its artists' belief in what they do. Asylmuratova, by education as by divine right, knows how to command the choreography. She phrases movement, varies the speed of a step, with a sensitivity that is both technical and dramatic. An extension is allowed to flower and hang on the air. A pose is held, as a singer holds a note, because of its beauty. The bewitching artifices - and rewards - of rubato are shown with rare skill, and not a little sense of her own mastery. And they give the choreography such grace that the ballet lives and holds us in its thrall - as does Asylmuratova. Mukhamedov's Solor is the ideal foil for this Nikiya. He tells us everything of the haunted lover who is also a warrior hero: it is a superb study in Romantic theatre. And as the Chief Brahmin, Stephen Jefferies gives an interpretation worthy of the best Petersburg traditions. From his first entrance we sense the tensions and lusts that drive the character, and Jefferies turns the mimetic rodomontade of the role into truest feeling through the dignity of his every action. In Wednesday's performance, Viviana Durante offered an eminently sure account of Nikiya. The dramatics of the role flared; the dancing was no less bright in skill and clarity. Tetsuya Kumakawa, in an unexpected debut, was making only a first sketch of Solor's emotions but his dancing was of exhilarating power. High-soaring, magnificently clean in execution, unstrained even at its most prodigious moments, it gave Solor thrilling, if temporary, life. Two other performances were exceptional: Matthew Hart's eagerly danced and acted Fakir, and Rosalyn Whitten's enchanting appearance in the Pas d'action, her dancing so pretty and so rich in its harmonies of torso and arms that her companions looked as if they had been lightly starched. The Royal Ballet season continues at Covent Garden until August 8.</p>

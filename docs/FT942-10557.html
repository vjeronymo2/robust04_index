			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / AB Foods plans big share reorganisation: Minorities to get stock plus 10p dividend as Weston family seeks better financial planning Minority shareholders of Asso- ciated British Foods are to be offered equivalent shares in a newly quoted company and a 10p a share special dividend as part of the reorganisation of the group's ownership. The milling, baking, sugar and other food products group is controlled by a hierarchy of private companies and trusts and a charitable foundation. The reorganisation is part of the Weston family's desire for better long-term financial planning. Much of the family's substantial wealth is tied up in two unquoted companies, Wittington Investments and George Weston Holdings, the latter having Pounds 230m in cash which cannot be passed to family members in a tax-efficient manner. The plan will release Pounds 130m to the family and give its members some shares in the new quoted company which will replace AB Foods. They have promised not to sell shares for two years, except in special circumstances. The Garfield Weston Foundation, a charity which is the ultimate controller of AB Foods, will increase its indirect stake in the company from 36 to 40 per cent. AB Foods was founded after the First World War by Mr Garfield Weston, son of Mr George Weston, a Canadian businessman. Mr Garfield Weston had nine children, all of whom are still alive. The fourth of these is Mr Garry Weston, chairman of AB Foods, and himself the father of six children, three of whom work for AB Foods. About 40 family members are involved. Mr Garry Weston has just turned 67. His younger brother, Mr Galen Weston, 53, heads George Weston Foods, a separate Canadian company. Apart from Mr Garry Weston and his children, virtually all the family is resident in Canada or the US. The increasing ages of the nine siblings have made the need for financial planning more urgent. Mr Garry Weston said yesterday the family intended always to retain control of AB Foods. Analysts expect him to remain chairman of the company for at least another four years, by which time he will have served 50 years with the company and 31 as chairman. They believe he will be succeeded by Mr Guy Weston, his eldest son and currently managing director of Ryvita, the job Mr Garry Weston held when he was 23. The plan did not meet a warm reception in the stock market and AB Foods shares fell 15p to 584p. Some ascribed this to disappointment that AB Foods was not announcing a large takeover deal to use its substantial cash holdings. Mr Garry Weston said the business had largely grown internally, rather than by acquisition, and would not be forced into doing a deal. He admitted the group was looking at an acquisition in the US, and 'other things in other places'. He said one of the advantages of being a family controlled company was that 'you can take decisions based on your timing not somebody else's'. Lex, Page 18; Details, Page 20</p>

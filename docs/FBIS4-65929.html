			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Necker Calls For New Japanese </F> Strategy"]    [Text] In a talk with German newsmen in Tokyo on 20 May,  German Industry Federation [BDI] President Tyll Necker said it  would be in Japan's well-understood own interest to "change its  strategies." The opening of the Japanese market would be the  appropriate way for a change of trend in the yen price increase.  If Tokyo were unable to reduce surpluses through deregulation,  the "only option left" would be "another revaluation of the yen  as the price for the preservation of restrictive market  structures," warned Necker.    The BDI president acknowledged that the opening process  initiated in Japan was attributable to the pressure exerted by  the United States, but said he was opposed to Tokyo giving  preference to the U.S. partner. "We Europeans want to have the  same opportunities in Japan as the United States," stressed  Necker, adding that "Japan's political security interests no  longer justify giving the United States privileges."    Necker, who is in Tokyo for talks with Prime Minister Hata  and other government members as well as leading Japanese  business and industry associations, also appealed to the German  economic sector to see "Japan as an organizational center for  the whole Far Eastern region." He said that, in this respect,  more persuasive work had to be done in Germany.    Medium-sized industry in particular had to develop a  strategy  for Japan, said Necker. A number of such firms had already  successfully established themselves on the Japanese market. The  Asia-Pacific Committee of German business and industry and Bonn  should face the challenge of the Asian market, but in so doing,  should not only consider China, but should make use of the  incipient liberalization of the Japanese market.</p>

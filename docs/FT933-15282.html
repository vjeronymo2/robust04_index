			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Letter: More package holidaymakers covered by security Sir, I was astonished to read the statement by Michael Skapinker ('Travel: Hanging on to your holiday', July 3) that the EC Package Travel Directive has proved useless. On the contrary, the Package Travel Regulations 1992 (which implement the directive in UK law), require for the first time that all organisers of packages should have security for customer pre-payments in the event of insolvency. As a result, more holidaymakers are covered by such security than ever before. This is a big step forward in consumer protection. I do not understand why Michael Skapinker should say trading standards officers have neither the time nor the experience to enforce the regulations. Trading standards officers are highly trained experts who enforce a very wide variety of consumer protection legislation, and I have been impressed by the speed and thoroughness with which they have got to grips with the requirements of the package travel regulations. Nor would I agree that no one knows the legal definition of a package holiday. Part of the definition of a package is that it must be prearranged. This is sensible: a holiday whose elements are specified in detail by the customer himself is not a package as we would normally understand it. As with all legal definitions, there will be cases where there is room for debate on which side of the line a particular holiday falls, but such cases should be rare. It is a requirement of the package travel regulations that organisers should indicate both in any brochure they issue and in their contracts with individual holidaymakers how they have chosen to meet the provisions of the regulations regarding security in the event of insolvency. The customers are thus readily able to check that their travel company is complying with the regulations. Our aim in implementing the directive was to ensure that costs were kept to a minimum and choice of holiday to a maximum. It would be more helpful if, instead of writing off the extended protection, your correspondent advised holidaymakers to ensure that they check that they are dealing with a company offering security. We have given them the means to do so. Baroness Denton, parliamentary under-secretary of state for consumer affairs and small firms, DTI, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6RB</p>

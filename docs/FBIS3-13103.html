			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F> Razi Barqay on 8 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Barqay] You are experiencing hard times.    [Rabin] Times are not easy, but that is the way it is, and  we have to deal with the problems and solve them.    [Barqay] Do you fear acts of retaliation? Do you have  information regarding expected acts of revenge for the Hebron  massacre?    [Rabin] Look, terror groups which were active before may  have greater motivation to exacerbate their acts following the  massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs. Had they been able to  carry out murderous terror acts even before the events in  Hebron, they would have done so, because this is their way, this  is their aim. They want to kill Israelis and the peace process.  The murder in the Cave of the Patriarchs may have increased  their motivation. That is why we imposed a closure banning  entry into the territory of sovereign Israel, including united  Jerusalem.    [Barqay] My question, sir, was whether you have information  on preparations, new squads, something that....    [Rabin, interrupting] We have reports that there is growing  motivation for retaliation. Terror organizations have announced  that they intend to take revenge. In view of this, we are  getting ready.    [Barqay] How long will you keep the residents under closure?    [Rabin] We reconsider the closure on a daily basis or every  few days, in order to determine whether the territory has calmed  down and the threat diminished. Furthermore, we will not lift  it all at the same time. The most important factor in our  considerations is security.    [Barqay] The uneasy security situation has led you to try to  expand the coalition, among other things. Will Tzomet's joining  the government give the government legitimacy in terms of the  right wing?    [Rabin] I sought to expand the basis of the coalition even  before the tragic event in Hebron took place. We started  initial contacts with Tzomet before the Hebron massacre. I  initiated them, and I will not discuss how they were conducted.  They did not follow the incident. The same holds true for SHAS  [Torah Observing Sephardim].    [Barqay] What are the chances of Refa'el Eytan's joining the  coalition, in view of the opposition from Meretz?    [Rabin] I will not deal with speculation. The Labor Bureau  and caucus approved negotiations with factions that accept the  government's guidelines and will not dispute agreements we have  made with the PLO. This opens the door to negotiations with  SHAS, as well as with Tzomet.    [Barqay] Will you summon Eytan and others from Tzomet...?    [Rabin, interrupting] He will know when I decide, and not  from you.    [Barqay] Over the past few days, Eytan has made some remarks  that contradict the government guidelines.    [Rabin] That may be. I also heard some cabinet ministers  making remarks that I do not believe to always be in accordance  with the government policies. I distinguish remarks from....  [pauses] Tzomet and its leader are not in the coalition today;  therefore, there is no reason for him not to say whatever he  wants. If and when he joins the coalition, it will be a  different story.    [Barqay] You say that ministers made remarks contradicting  the government platform and guidelines. Do you mean remarks  favoring the evacuation of settlers from Hebron?    [Rabin] I will not elaborate on this. I would rather speak  personally to any such minister. In general, I can tell you  that such things happen.    [Barqay] Let me ask you directly: Are you in favor of  evacuating the settlers from Hebron?    [Rabin] I will not answer this. According to the  Declaration of Principles [DOP], all settlements remain in  place. On the basis of the negotiations with the PLO, I do not  have to do this. Hence, this is currently not on the agenda.    [Barqay] Personally, do you not think that their being there  is a provocation?    [Rabin] Look, the last time I was prime minister, I  supported settlement in Qiryat Arba' and opposed settlement in  the heart of Hebron. The previous government did many things --  not only in Hebron but also in other settlements in areas  densely populated by Palestinians -- to which I opposed. Today,  we are facing a reality, and our problem is to deal with it.  The important thing today is to resume the negotiations with  the PLO as soon as possible. I believe this would be the best  answer to those who oppose the Cairo agreement and the DOP.    [Barqay] We hear that 'Arafat wants to bring in armed  observers as a precondition for resuming the negotiations.    [Rabin] I do not conduct negotiations with him through you.    [Barqay] Do you accept this demand?    [Rabin] I do not conduct negotiations with him through you.    [Barqay] Can you estimate when the parties will return to  the negotiating table? Days, weeks, months?    [Rabin] I would not like to engage in estimates when I do  not have data that would justify making such estimates. There  has been no agreement by the PLO and the Palestinians to resume  negotiations.    [Barqay] Newspaper columnists these days describe you as  someone who is very uncertain, wavering between the dovish  attitude of Yosi Sarid and Meretz and the hawkish stands of  Refa'el Eytan. Do have any second thoughts regarding the  agreement you made with the PLO?    [Rabin] I have no second thoughts. The government and I  determined stands and the path we will follow. I adhere to  them. I also want to expand the basis of the coalition in order  to make their implementation possible. Naturally, in a  coalition, there is a broad spectrum of stands and attitudes. I  believe that the government policy -- as expressed in the way  the peace talks have been conducted -- expresses the line to  which I adhere. I feel the pain of terror acts. I condemn  every act of terror, and I hurt twice as much when a loathsome  Jewish murderer carries out a despicable act.    [Barqay] As we speak, the Shamgar inquiry commission is  beginning its deliberations. We know that you had some  reservations about setting it up....    [Rabin, interrupting] A commission of inquiry was set up. I  respect it, and I believe it will shed light on the truth.    [Barqay] In view of this, do you not believe the time has  come for you to appoint a full-time defense minister?    [Rabin] Two previous commissions of inquiry -- one set up  after the Yom Kippur War and one after the war of Lebanon --  were established when there was a full-time defense minister.  Such events take place regardless of whether the post of  defense minister was separate from that of the prime minister.  I neither believe this is necessary nor am I in any way  considering it.    [Barqay] You will stay on as defense minister and prime  minister?    [Rabin] Yes.    [Barqay] And you have full confidence in Chief of Staff Ehud  Baraq?    [Rabin] I have full confidence in the defense establishment,  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and its commanders, the security  services, and the Border Police. This does not mean that a  mishap can never happen here or there. I have full confidence  in the IDF high command, from the chief of staff down, and in  the Shin Bet men. Regrettably, the public does not know enough  about the burden the IDF, Shin Bet, the Border Police, and the  Israel Police are shouldering; neither does it know how many  terrible things were prevented thanks to their efficient  activity. I wish to state here: The IDF and the security  services deserve our every praise.    [Barqay] Despite some mishaps here and there?    [Rabin] I made my point clear.    [Barqay] Mr. Rabin, how will your coalition look in two  weeks?    [Rabin] I will not engage in nor do I have need of  prophecies. You may need to interview me, but this does not  compel me to answer every question, especially when things are  not yet finalized. I will only say definite things when I am  able to bring them before the Knesset, and then you will know  them anyway.</p>

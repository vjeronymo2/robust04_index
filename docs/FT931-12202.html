			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Building a new bonfire of inanities  -Philip Stephens asks Neil Hamilton about the latest Tory crusade against bureaucracy WHEN politicians cast around for newsworthy initiatives to slip into otherwise dull speeches, they sooner or later alight on the idea of a drive to cut red tape. Lord Wilson, never one to miss a good headline, saw the potential as long ago as 1948 when as president of the board of trade he lit a bonfire of war-time controls. Successive prime ministers - Lady Thatcher among them - have followed his example, promising (and sometimes delivering) to lighten the grip of the state bureaucracy on the nation's wealth-producers. In the meantime, their governments have gone on legislating and regulating. Now it is Mr John Major's turn. Next Tuesday cabinet ministers and permanent secretaries will be ushered into No 10 Downing Street to provide tinder for the latest bonfire. Mr Neil Hamilton, the minister at the Department of Trade and Industry charged with de-regulation, has been appointed guardian of the pyre. He is an eminently suitable choice. A rightwinger with a libertarian streak and an instinctive contempt for the bureaucrats of Brussels, Mr Hamilton is refreshingly candid about the risks. He is ready to admit that after 14 years in power the government cannot absolve itself of responsibility: 'This is an exercise in in self-criticism if you like. Regulation grows like mould. Until recently we have not had a system in place for evaluating the costs'. There are no illusions about the strength of Whitehall inertia. 'Obviously permanent secretaries are not going to be impressed by a pipsqueak undersecretary like myself.' But he is assured of Downing Street's backing. The purpose of the seminar is 'to stamp on this initiative the prime minister's personal commitment and to require each department to produce results'. He chooses a canine metaphor: 'The prime minister has appointed me his personal rottweiler to charge up and down Whitehall yapping and biting people.' He intends to enjoy the exercise. The starting point is the 6,000-odd government regulations turned up by a Whitehall census of red-tape. Many are necessary, but many others impose no special burden on business. But Mr Hamilton is convinced that many others are too complicated, and some totally unnecessary. He admits that a good proportion - more than 1,000 - were issued by his own department. Among those which he is keen to scrutinise closely are company law - particularly the audit requirements for small companies - and the rulebooks which govern the City's self-regulatory agencies. The employment, social security, environment and agriculture departments and the Home Office are among the other main targets across Whitehall. So too are the Treasury's tax-collecting agencies. Planning rules, health and safety requirements, environmental health regulations and consumer protection measures will be rigorously examined. Mr Hamilton cites recent Home Office draft fire regulations - with a price tag for industry estimated variously at between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 7bn  -as an example of the old culture. Before it was caught in a new system designed to ensure a 'cost-compliance' evaluation, the Home Office wanted entrepreneurs working from home to reverse all doors and install illuminated fire-exit signs over each of them. That was an example of over-implementation of decisions made in Brussels. Mr Hamilton is engaged on a census of all EC regulations which Britain has implemented since joining the community nearly 20 years ago. But he is acutely aware that 'we normally find a 10-page EC directive becomes an 85-page statutory instrument'. Then there is the knee-jerk response to well-publicised tragedies. Mr Hamilton cites the reaction a few years ago to the salmonella-in-eggs scare when it 'threatened to destroy an entire industry' with new hygiene rules. In future the government - and the media - should make rational judgments on the degree of safety sensible relative to the cost. Otherwise cars would be banned from the roads to improve safety. Cabinet ministers have been given until April to bring forward regulations which can be scrapped or simplified. Mr Hamilton expects to light his bonfire in the parliamentary session which begins in October. He wants to import from the US the idea of 'sunset' provisions in new regulations which provide for the automatic expiry of some regulations unless they are re-introduced. Cost-compliance assessments should also be the norm. Ministers should be ready to measure also the costs against the risks - to the public and their own political careers. Mr Hamilton sounds determined, a round peg in a round hole whose task coincides with his instincts. Whether he will convince his colleagues is another matter. He recently lost a Whitehall battle against a regulation requiring manufacturers to fit plugs on electrical appliances. The new rule will be enforced by the DTI.</p>

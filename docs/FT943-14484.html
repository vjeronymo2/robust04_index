			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Personal View: Dear rural dweller, you must pay more The UK government's favoured option for the future of the Post Office - to sell 51 per cent of the Royal Mail to the private sector - is to be welcomed. It will give the Post Office management the freedom it needs to compete in the international communications market. At present the business is shackled by political restrictions, particularly access to new capital. However, the proposal does not go far enough. For ministers have declared that the uniform charge for letter delivery will stay, whatever the outcome of the government's current review. Undoubtedly it would be highly controversial if the common charge went. But it is difficult to see how competition can develop fully unless competitive pricing is allowed. At present the Royal Mail cross-subsidises within the letters business, a practice that is not compatible with big geographical differences in delivery costs in an unregulated competitive market. The argument for cost-based charging is straightforward. At present, when services are priced below the true cost of supply, the value which marginal customers place on the service - as represented by the price they are willing to pay - is lower than the cost of the service in terms of the resources used to provide it. The opposite applies where services are priced above marginal cost. There is a case for reducing the supply and raising the price where prices are currently below marginal cost; and for raising supply and cutting charges where prices are higher. As costs of letter collection and delivery are much lower in urban areas than in remote, rural regions, this would cause prices to fall for town dwellers and rise in parts of the countryside. The argument for a uniform price is concerned with what some see as the 'unfairness' of charging different consumers differently. Yet it is not obvious why it should be applied to postal services and not to other goods and services seemingly just as vital to rural existence. Rural areas suffer less frequent bus services; they have far fewer supermarkets and hence higher food prices - arguably food is much more of a necessity than a letter. Yet no one seriously argues that there should be uniform bus fares and food prices. The extent to which those in rural areas gain from uniform charging is, of course, unclear. The present pricing system conceals the *something in here (HP) * amount of cross-subsidisation. There is no evidence, though, that cross-subsidy goes from the 'rich' to the 'poor'. In any case, postal charges exist to pay for a service, not provide a means to redistribute income. This is the function of the tax and benefits system. A cost-based charging system would open up the possibility of a more varied service. At present, the uniform charge allows little variety in postal services. Even those who would prefer a better service are given no opportunity to pay for it, unless they resort to expensive premium services such as Datapost. Local authorities could seek to subsidise services to retain or improve the quality of service (such as more daily deliveries) or reduce the postal charge. Those in rural areas facing a higher tariff might prefer less frequent deliveries and collections, say every other day, to keep the charge down. Alternatively, they might prefer to collect their mail from the village shop or garage, or have the mail delivered along with the daily milk or newspaper. Already the milkman and the newsagent provide doorstep deliveries. Is it necessary for the postman to visit, too? The main benefit of previous privatisations came in reducing costs. This has taken two forms: doing more efficiently what is already done; and doing new things in new ways. The latter are what economists call 'dynamic' efficiency gains. The government's privatisation proposal for the Royal Mail is a bold first step, but many of the potential dynamic efficiencies will come only if price signals are introduced into the market for letter deliveries. By retaining a uniform postal charge, the potential gains from privatisation are restricted. When Rowland Hill introduced the 'penny post' in 1840, his aim was to achieve political acceptability. Hill initially recommended a flat charge between 'post towns' only, where he calculated that the costs of provision were roughly uniform. It seems once again that the future of the Royal Mail is to be determined by political necessity rather than sober economics.

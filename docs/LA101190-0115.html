			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH JANICE;  </P> <P> THE REMATCH  </P> <P> I was saved from myself on Wednesday when I offered a $10 exacta box on a race  in which there was no exacta wagering. I thought only computers made those  kinds of mistakes.  </P> <P> Anyway, I still lost $16 when Queen Emissary finished second paying $3.20 to  place. Today's selection is $50 to win and $100 to place on Mysterious Pirate  in the sixth.  </P> <P> Janice Goldinger's Wed. Bankroll: $1,965  </P> <P> Wednesday's Loss: $16  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $1,949  </P> <P> SURELOCK lost $60 Wednesday when his exacta horses Port Washington and  Intelligently failed to finish one-two. Today's selections are $100 to win on  Past Remembered and a $10 exacta box, Past Remembered-Bequest-Girl of France,  in the eighth race.  </P> <P> SURELOCK's Wed. Bankroll: $1,580  </P> <P> Wednesday's Loss: $60  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $1,520  </P> <P> Note: Janice Goldinger, a horse owner, does not bet on races her horses run in.  SURELOCK does not own horses.  </P> <P> Both players started with a $2,000 bankroll.  </P></p>

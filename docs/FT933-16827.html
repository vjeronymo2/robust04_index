			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt gives up ground on position-squaring THERE was much discussion, and not a little optimism about German interest rate prospects, although Frankfurt itself was not obviously bullish, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT squared its positions at the end of the second quarter and ahead of today's Bundesbank meeting. The DAX index fell 10.70 to 1,697.63, cyclicals leading the way down, as turnover fell from DM7bn to DM6.6bn. Yesterday's trend was technical, and a note from Merck Finck in Dusseldorf bore this out. The second quarter's individual leaders were all cyclicals, Volkswagen coming top again with three and six-month gains of 18.5, and 49.7 per cent respectively. The losers were all banks, Bayernverein, Bayernhypo and Dresdner shedding 7.8, 6.3 and 5.9 per cent. Volkswagen managed its gains in spite of a DM7.70 fall to DM362.50 after its Audi subsidiary announced a first-half loss and a 29 per cent decline in sales. MAN and Daimler followed suit in the automotive sector with falls of DM5 to DM281.80, and DM7.90 to DM613.80. The banking sector was only slightly lower on the day. PARIS eased slightly on the expiry of options and futures, the CAC-40 index losing 5.63 to 1,971.87, as turnover rose to FFr4bn. Kleinwort Benson, in its latest monthly research paper on France, forecast that fresh interest rate cuts will both sustain and then buoy up the equity market. 'Lower rates might add three points to the market's p/e ratio,' it said; company profits are more resilient than they may appear; and a change in the structure of domestic savings will release funds into the market'. St Gobain, a cyclical used as an economic indicator, eased FFr5 to FFr508 as James Capel sharply downgraded its profit forecasts for 1993 and 1994. Eridania Beghin-Say, a component of the Italian debt-laded Ferruzzi group, denied comment that it might be sold, but the shares nevertheless gained FFr60 or 8.3 per cent to FFr779. AMSTERDAM saw strength in Philips, which closed 90 cents higher at a 12-month high of Fl 30.10. Investors were encouraged by news that the group expected a Fl 1.1bn extraordinary gain from the sale of its stake in Matsushita Electronics. The CBS Tendency index finished 0.3 ahead at 112.5. ZURICH ended slightly firmer as dealers speculated about the outcome of today's Bundesbank meeting. The discussion seemed to ignore a television interview by Mr Markus Lusser, president of the Swiss National Bank, which included the statement that high Swiss money supply growth limits the immediate latitude for another interest rate cut. In the banking sector, bearers in UBS, SFr5 higher at an all-time high of SFr1,100, topped the active list. MILAN was buffetted by some disappointing news from Fiat at its annual meeting, continued nervousness over the outcome of talks on reaching a wage accord, and the possibility of delay in the passage of the crucial electoral reform bill through parliament. The Comit index edged 0.74 higher at 536.15. Mr Michele Pacitti, an Italian analyst at NatWest Securities in London, commented that the likelihood of elections this autumn had been receding because of opposition to certain aspects of the reform bill. However, after the close of trading yesterday the bill was finally approved by the chamber of deputies. Support for the market again came from the telecommunications sector with an indication that the government aims to accelerate its reorganisation. Stet rose L140 to L3,590 and Sip, likely to be merged with Italcable, gained L17 to L2,580. The market had already discounted most of the Fiat data revealed at the annual meeting, concentrating instead on Mr Giovanni Agnelli's statement that losses would be offset by sales of 'non-strategic assets'. Most analysts believe this to refer to Rinascente, Toro and Cogefar. Fiat shares, which had advanced L158 to L6,490 at the fix, slipped back to L6,350 on the kerb. MADRID was convinced that the Bundesbank would cut rates said one trader, as the general index closed 1.80 higher at 259.84. Banks were the most obvious beneficiaries with Argentaria up Pta115 to Pta4,725, and Santander Pta140 better at Pta5,800. BRUSSELS saw the Bel-20 index close at an all-time high, 10.48 higher at 1,279.53, pushed up by hopes of a German rate cut and a climb in Petrofina after the oil company's shares breached resistance at BFr9,000. Petrofina jumped by BFr340, or 3.8 per cent to BFr9,200, up by more than 8 per cent since last Friday. One trader linked the gains to a plan for the upgrading of the Ekofisk North Sea field, due to be unveiled today. VIENNA drifted lower late in the day, the ATX index falling 6.29 to 851.7 with dips in two recently strong stocks, OMV and Creditanstalt preferred. OMV fell Sch16 to Sch711 after the nationalised industries minister, Mr Viktor Klima, said that he would want the government to retain a veto on key decisions even after the company is fully privatised. Creditanstalt preferred lost Sch14 to Sch596. ISTANBUL'S market index fell 330.9, or 2.9 per cent to 10,778.6 on heavy selling amid reports of political rows over a confidence vote for the new cabinet.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- June 30                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open      10.30       11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1208.42    1207.92     1207.76    1206.59 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1263.92    1265.06     1263.68    1263.57  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00      14.00       15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1207.62    1206.81     1208.44    1208.99 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1265.35    1265.42     1266.87    1266.14  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jun 29    Jun 28    Jun 25    Jun 24    Jun 23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1207.97   1210.15   1202.12   1199.58   1197.17 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1263.58   1265.02   1254.67   1251.56   1249.23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1208.99; 200 - 1270.86 Low/day: 100 - 1206.09 200 - 1262.69  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

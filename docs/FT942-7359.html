			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / HK group markets Burma fund A Hong-Kong based securities company controlled by Mr Robert Kuok, the Malaysian-Chinese entrepreneur, is marketing the first listed investment fund targeted at Burma. The fund, intended to attract Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.2m) from institutional investors, is the latest indication of the ending of the isolation of Burma's repressive military regime. South-east Asian countries have recently adopted a policy of 'constructive engagement' with Burma. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore, one of the main foreign investors, visited in March with a group of businessmen. Thailand has invited Burma to attend July's ministerial meeting of the Association of South East Asian Nations. The Myanmar Fund, using the name given to Burma by its government, will be listed in Dublin. It is being established by Kerry Securities and managed by Kerry Investment Management, both Hong Kong-based arms of the Kuok group. Mr Jeremy Eakin, a London-based assistant director of Kerry Securities, said: 'It's really a venture capital fund. Burma is a blank sheet: there's nothing there in the way of industry'. Since Burma has no stock exchange, the fund will invest in joint ventures and unquoted companies. It may also buy old Burmese debt issues and shares in non-Burmese companies with direct exposure to Burma. Mr Kuok has a wide range of Asian interests. He made his fortune in sugar and other commodities, then expanded into hotels (including the Shangri-La group), property and other sectors, especially in China, where his ventures include Beijing's World Trade Centre, and in Hong Kong where he controls the South China Morning Post. The investments to be made by the fund are expected to reflect the interests of the Kuok group. The fund is likely to put Dollars 20m into a business park in a venture with the Burmese-Chinese Ho family, based in Thailand. Mr Halpin Ho is a director of the fund and of a company advising its managers. It will also invest in hotels and plantations. Tourism, telecommunications, a deep-sea port and banks are other possible investment opportunities. Mr John Jackson, campaigns director for the Burma Action Group, said it was hard to invest in Burma without bolstering the military regime. 'The vast majority of the economy is controlled by the military or their families. We think it is very difficult to invest ethically.' The junta, called the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), has been seeking to open the country to foreign investment and has introduced some reforms. But Mr Jackson said it had not loosened control sufficiently to attract significant investment. Slorc ignored the results of a 1990 general election won by the National League for Democracy. It has held Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, NLD leader, under house arrest since July 1989.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / People: FKI reshuffle Bob Beeston, new chief executive at engineering group FKI, has reorganised the management structure and brought in two of his former colleagues from BTR, the industrial conglomerate. At the same time, Alan Baxter, a main board director primarily responsible for the UK operation, has announced his resignation. A reorganisation into five main divisions centred around products and markets, rather than geography, meant Baxter could not be offered a job of the same status, the company said. His departure represents a weakening of ex-GEC links at the top of FKI. Both Baxter and Norman Scoular, the previous chief executive of FKI, came from GEC. The new divisional heads, none of whom joins the main board, include two of Beeston's former colleagues from BTR valves. Robert Sook will head material handling and Bill McClure comes in as group controller under the finance director. They will bring 'some of the discipline on profit planning that we had at BTR', Beeston said yesterday. The other new divisional heads are: Joe Withers, hardware; Richard Jones, automotive; James Beckett, engineering; Barry Jameson, process control. Steven Jones is director of corporate planning.</p>

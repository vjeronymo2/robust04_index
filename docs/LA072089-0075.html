			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEAVER FANS SPECULATION IN VENTURA  </P> <P> Professional boxing returned to the Ventura Theatre on July 12 and the presence  of Mike Weaver led to speculation that the former World Boxing Assn.  heavyweight champion might be featured on a future card.  </P> <P> Weaver, 38, now residing in Diamond Bar, was on hand first and foremost to  watch his 25-year-old brother Lloyd box in a middleweight bout. But he did  express interest in returning in the near future.  </P> <P> "I'll be happy to fight here or anywhere, it makes no difference to me," Weaver  said.  </P> <P> Weaver holds the World Boxing Assn. Americas heavyweight title by virtue of a  first-round knockout of Lionel Washington at the Forum in May.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-2, 212-pound champion, who trains at the Jet Center in Van Nuys,  said that he is working harder than ever and hopes to be back in contention for  a major title fight.  </P> <P> In the interim, Weaver will focus his energies on a July 27 WBAA title defense  against Phil Brown at the Felt Forum in New York City. But he is definitely  looking ahead to bigger game.  </P> <P> "George Foreman has turned me down two times already and as I work my way back  to a world title I would like to get another shot at Michael Dokes on the way  back up," Weaver said.  </P> <P> LBA Associates promoter Buddy Bereal, however, said it was premature to project  Weaver boxing in Ventura.  </P> <P> "I can't say anything right now," said Bereal. "Mike already has some fights  scheduled, including a possible fight against Trevor Berbick, but we have  talked about it and Mike told me he would fight anytime, anywhere for me,  including Ventura."  </P> <P> Despite his renewed career interests, Mike Weaver was more than a casual  spectator as Lloyd continued his progression through the middleweight ranks.  </P> <P> "I'm here to watch my brother fight tonight," Weaver said. "I get more nervous  when they fight -- now I know how my mother felt. I'm concerned about their  future and mine too."  </P> <P> Weaver speaks collectively of his brothers -- they are triplets. Lloyd, also  residing in Diamond Bar, improved his record to 8-1 with a unanimous decision  over Pedro Riveron of Las Vegas in a preliminary fight on the four-bout card.  </P> <P> The remainder of the Weaver stable boasts similarly impressive numbers. Floyd,  a junior middlewweight, is 9-2 and Troy, a light heavyweight, is 7-2.  </P> <P> In other fights on the Ventura card, Art Lizarraga of Bakersfield won a  unanimous decision over Stewart Baines of Pasadena in a welterweight bout, and  George Rodriguez of Highland Park scored a unanimous decision over Vinnie  Falzone of Las Vegas in a light heavyweight match.  </P> <P> In the main event, featherweight Johnnie Chavez of Azusa improved to 6-0, with  a close, eight-round unanimous decision over Angel "Peewee" Garcia of Las  Vegas. The card attracted an audience of 500.  </P></p>

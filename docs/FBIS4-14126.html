			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo--Damascus--AL-ITTIHAD, News Agencies--Arab  sources in Cairo have told AL-ITTIHAD that a reconciliatory  meeting will be held soon between PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and  officials of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, which has  recently proposed a truce with Israel if the latter withdraws  from territories occupied in 1967 and removes the settlements.    The sources welcomed 'Arafat's planned urgent visit to  Jordan  next week to meet for the first time with Hamas leaders,  foremost of whom are Muhammad Nazzal and Ibrahim Ghawshah and to  clear the way for a complete reconciliation between the PLO and  the movement.    Hamas yesterday reiterated its denial of reports that it  recognizes Israel's right to exist, but stressed its readiness  to conclude a truce with Israel if it agrees to withdraw from  the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem; remove the  settlements; evacuate the settlers; and hold general elections  for the Palestinian people to elect their leaders and  representatives.

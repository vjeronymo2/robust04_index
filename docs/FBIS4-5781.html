			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 14 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has  purchased no "April 15 gifts" for its people from other  countries this year, the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) and  business sources said Thursday.    The North used to buy consumer goods from the South and  other  countries to give to its citizens on Kim Il-song's birthday  until last year, KOTRA officials said.    Pyongyang ordered cloth for student uniforms from South  Korean businesses late last year but then canceled the order as  tension on the peninsula mounted because of the nuclear row,  sources said.    A KOTRA official said, "we collected reports from trade  offices in many countries and found out that even Thailand,  Germany and china, whose trade volumes with North Korea are  relatively large, have not sold any `April 15 gifts.'"    He added that North Korea has purchased few consumer  products  this year other than some Chinese apples.    "At this time of year in the past, North Korea used to buy a  lot of canned pork, cloth and sugar."    An official at the National Unification Board confirmed that  no consumer goods have been sold to the North this year.    The official said, "North Korea seems to have decided that  it  will reduce the program for Kim Il-song's birthday this year due  to its economic difficulties."    South Korean businesses sold several million dollars worth  of  consumer goods to North Korea in 1992 when Kim Il-song  celebrated his 80th birthday.</p>

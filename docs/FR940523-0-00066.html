			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon approval of each plan submitted by a licensee, and subject to the availability of appropriated funds and the requirements of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341), the Department will designate amounts deposited in the Fund at the United States Department of Treasury, established pursuant to section 1801 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2297g), to reimburse a licensee for estimated costs of remedial action in implementing a Department-approved plan for subsequent remedial action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Section 765.32&blank;Reimbursement of Excess Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1001(b)(2)(E)(i) of the Act (42 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2296a(b)(2)(B)(i)) authorizes the Department to determine, as of July 31, 2005, whether the aggregate amount authorized to be appropriated by section 1003 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a&hyph;2) when considered with the $5.50 per dry short ton limit on reimbursement, as adjusted for inflation, for active uranium processing site licensees, exceeds the amount reimbursable to licensees under section 1001(b)(2) of the Act (42 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2296a(b)(2)). If any active uranium processing site licensee incurs reimbursable costs in excess of $5.50 per dry short ton limit on reimbursement, and the Department has determined that excess funds exist as of July 31, 2005, section 1001(b)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(2)(E)(ii)) authorizes the Department to provide reimbursement of those costs on a prorated basis to the extent funds are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 765.32 outlines the procedures that would govern any additional reimbursement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Review Under Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was not subject to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that a regulatory flexibility analysis be performed for all rules that are likely to have ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' This rule involves reimbursement for costs of remedial action at active uranium and thorium processing sites. The number of potentially eligible applicants is very limited. Because this rule provides for reimbursement of funds authorized by Title X, it does not pose any adverse effect on the private sector economy or small entities, and in fact may provide a benefit to small entities located near active processing sites. The Department, therefore, certifies that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and have been assigned OMB control number 1910&hyph;1400.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule establishes procedures for the reimbursement of eligible remedial action costs incurred by licensees at active uranium or thorium processing sites. Implementation of this rule will result in cost reimbursement payments to eligible licensees, but will not affect the legally required cleanup of the sites or result in any other environmental impacts. The Department has therefore determined that this rule is covered under the Categorical Exclusion found at paragraph A6. of Appendix A to subpart D, 10 CFR part 1021, which applies to the establishment of procedural rulemakings such as procedures for the review and approval of applications for grants and cooperative agreements. Accordingly, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Review Under Executive Order 12612  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule does not have a substantial direct effect on the States, the relationship between the States and the Federal Government, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. Therefore, no federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612 is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Review Under Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs agencies to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b), include eliminating drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the rule clearly specifies any preemptive effect, effect on existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings available prior to judicial review; any provisions for the exhaustion of administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. The Department certifies that today's rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b) of Executive Order 12778.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 765  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Radioactive materials, Reclamation, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Uranium.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on this 10th day of May 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Thomas P.

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Economy at heart of conflict IT WAS no accident that Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister who approved earlier this month a package of emergency measures to cut budget expenditure, stipulated the bulk of remaining funds should go to the army. But although Mr Yeltsin now bids for the army's support, his conflict with parliament had in recent weeks crystallised over the more mundane issue of the country's budget deficit. Last night he cited parliament's 'so-called economic policy' - led by its demands for increased budget expenditure without a corresponding increase in revenues - as a glaring example of 'political games played at the expense of the people'. His suspension of parliament cancels at least one appointment he had been anxious to avoid; parliament was due on Friday to consider the government's request to borrow just Rbs4,700bn from the Russian central bank to finance the deficit. Deputies were intending to force the government to borrow Rbs15,000bn, to make parliament appear the kinder side in the conflict. The government has sought to keep such loans down to avoid the financial system's collapse. The money would simply have been printed by the central bank, thereby fuelling inflation. Mr Sergei Alexashenko, the deputy finance minister responsible for the budget, said in an interview last week: 'I am afraid that if it does this, parliament will say the government has this money and must therefore spend it.' The government's strategy has been to keep down the deficit and raise revenues with a package of emergency measures, including stiff tax increases and sales of up to 100 tonnes of government gold stocks to Russian commercial banks. The government's main challenge now, should parliament stay dissolved, is to pursue unpopular policies. If, in addition to the various measures being undertaken by the Finance Ministry, central bank loans were kept to Rbs5,000bn, the deficit could fall to 8 per cent of GDP by the end of the year. This would put it within the 10 per cent limit agreed by the government with the International Monetary Fund as a condition for at least Dollars 1.5bn in additional financial assistance by the end of the year. Sales of these dollars within Russia would help keep inflation down by absorbing surplus roubles held in the economy, and relieve pressure on the government to apply the tough tax increases it probably does want to impose in the months leading up to parliamentary elections. Another big challenge facing the central government - especially if some regions rebel against Mr Yeltsin's announcement - is to get all the regions and republics to pay their taxes. Speaking before Mr Yeltsin's announcement, Mr Alexashenko said the government had options to bring rebel republics and regions into line over taxation by, for instance, withholding deliveries of cash, or confiscating valuable exports bound for the west. But again, Mr Yeltsin will be relying on republican and regional leaders to stay on his side. Although it has been held up as a key justification for Mr Yeltsin's dramatic action, economic policy is likely once again to take a back seat until the political dust settles.</p>

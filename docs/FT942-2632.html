			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Talks on rail dispute planned Both sides in the rail signalling dispute are due to meet today for joint negotiations at the conciliation service Acas in an attempt to prevent a further 24-hour shutdown of the network on Wednesday, Robert Taylor writes. The RMT union said last night that it hoped to resolve the dispute over the weekend but added: 'There is still a wide gulf between us.' The union wants an interim pay offer for the signalling staff before entering job restructuring talks with Railtrack. Its claim is for an 11 per cent pay rise. It has been offered a 2.5 per cent basic rate increase for all employees in line with the government's public-sector pay policy. Railtrack said it was willing to negotiate a self-financing package for the signalling staff in return for higher productivity but refuses to concede any 'up-front' payment for past improvements in efficiency. It said: 'The process of discussion is now obviously back on the tracks.' MPs back CrossRail, Page 6 Men in the news, Page 8</p>

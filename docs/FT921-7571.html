			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Cambodia to get 16,000 UN troops The massive UN operation proposed for Cambodia under the Paris peace accords will require 15,900 troops and 1,000 foreign civilian administrators at a cost close to Dollars 2bn, according to an official plan released last night, reports Michael Littlejohns from New York. Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the operation, called it the most ambitious project of its kind. He voiced his belief that the Security Council would approve a detailed blueprint prepared by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general, by the end of next week. If so, the troop build-up will begin next month, with full deployment due by the end of May. The Cambodian operation would be the UN's biggest peacekeeping mission since the Congo in the 1960s.</p>

Approximately $200,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund this award. It is expected that the award will begin on or about September 30, 1994, and will be for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 5 years. This funding estimate may vary and is subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to assist ASTCDPD to periodically determine the status of State and local chronic disease programs and provide appropriate professional expertise to implement informational and programmatic activities to enhance the delivery of comprehensive chronic disease prevention and control services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CDC will collaborate in designing survey techniques, analyzing data, and developing informational, educational, and programmatic approaches to enhance national, State, and local comprehensive chronic disease programming; designing profiles of ASTCDPD membership and organizational resources available to assist health care agencies and organizations; developing communications systems; and providing scientific and operational updates in the areas of categorical and comprehensive chronic disease prevention and control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life.

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BLYLEVEN CHOOSES TITANS OVER PRO CONTRACT  </P> <P> Bert Blyleven hasn't given up his dream of having his son Todd as an Angel  teammate, but the Angel pitcher happily postponed it when Todd decided to  accept a scholarship to Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> Todd Blyleven, 18, pitched for Villa Park High School and was selected by the  Angels in the 39th round of last month's free agent amateur draft.  </P> <P> He opted to take a college scholarship instead of turning professional, and he  did it with his father's blessings.  </P> <P> "Being around the game, seeing guys going up and coming down and not making it  to the big leagues affected him," Bert Blyleven said. "I'm very proud of him  for making this decision. He's going to a great program. Vern Ruhle is the  pitching coach and I played with Vern (in Cleveland in 1985). Vern's a very  highly qualified pitching coach.  </P> <P> "(Todd) got a very nice offer from the Angels. They did offer him schooling and  a nice signing bonus, but he decided he wanted schooling. I think he's going to  get just as much out of school."  </P> <P> Blyleven, who has signed a contract extension through next season with options  for 1992 and '93, still wants to play in the big leagues with his son even  though he's 39 and Todd may be five years from making it.  </P> <P> "I'm upset I signed for three years," he said, jokingly. "This gives me more  incentive to play 10 more years."  </P></p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Relaunch paying off at upbeat First Choice Shares in First Choice Holidays, the former Owners Abroad group which re-launched itself in August in an attempt to regain market share, rose 2p to 121p yesterday following an upbeat statement from the company. In an announcement issued prior to an analysts' visit to its key operational centres at Gatwick and Manchester today, Mr Francis Baron, chief executive, said: 'We are very encouraged with the performance of the group since the launch of our new brand structure.' First Choice estimated that its market share in the period since the relaunch had been more than 15 per cent. 'We are comfortably on track to meeting our stated objective of a minimum 1 per cent increase in market share for the year,' Mr Baron commented. The group's share of the summer market had fallen from 16 per cent in 1992 to an estimated 12 per cent this year prior to the relaunch. Mr Baron said yesterday that summer 1995 bookings had remained strong in a weak market. The group had now sold 275,000 holidays for next summer, representing a 30 per cent increase over last year, while market share was currently exceeding target. Mr Baron said that after a slow start, winter bookings for the UK market had picked up well and the group had sold 245,000 holidays - a 4 per cent increase. This programme, launched in May, is still under the old brand structure. The summer 1994 programme ended in line with expectations, with total passengers 1 per cent lower at 1.6m.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Sport: A sleeping giant stirs - Tennis TIME FOR a trivia question: what do Hove and Newcastle have in common? Not much, you might think. But these two important population centres, at opposite ends of England, have recently joined 18 other UK towns and cities where inhabitants can enjoy a relatively inexpensive game of indoor tennis in comfortable surroundings. In the past five years, the Indoor Tennis Initiative (ITI), a joint venture in which grants from the Lawn Tennis Association, the Sports Council and the All England Lawn Tennis Club have initiated an investment of Pounds 22m in new facilities by local councils, has created 88 new tennis courts. This brings to approximately 500 the number of public and private indoor courts available to the UK's 57m inhabitants, an encouraging figure at first sight. But when you discover that, by the end of 1990, there were more than 6,000 covered courts in France (population 57m), 3,265 in Germany (79m), 3,300 in Holland (15m) and 1,500 in Sweden (8.5m), you see how far behind Britain is. You start to understand why there are currently nine Frenchmen among the top 100 ranked men in the world as well as six Germans, six Dutchmen, seven Swedes . . . and no Britons. Ian Peacock, the LTA's executive director, has no doubt there is a correlation between international success and opportunity. 'It is a numbers' game. If tennis is to become a truly national sport in Britain, as it is throughout most of Europe, then we must provide sufficient indoor facilities so that every boy or girl with the talent and the ambition to succeed has somewhere to play close to home.' The really encouraging thing about Phase I of ITI is that all the centres report extremely high court usage. The appointment of a development officer at each pay-as-you-play centre, funded 50 per cent each by the LTA and the local council, has introduced a whole new stratum of the population to the game's joys. Thanks to an additional injection of Pounds 500,000 from the Foundation for Sport and the Arts (FSA) in 1992, Phase II will get off to a flying start. If their support continues, grants totalling Pounds 10m over the next five years will generate an investment of Pounds 30m in new facilities. Despite their lack of cash, local authorities seem to have become aware of the benefits of providing cost-effective centres that are both popular and self-financing. There are seven more active schemes in the pipeline, says Peacock. Admirable as this is, it is pitifully inadequate by comparison with what has been going on in Europe and North America these past 30 years. This would not be so bad if the UK had a healthy club structure. But the 2,500 private clubs affiliated to the LTA are the weakest part of the British game. Too many are small local clubs with too few courts where facilities are rudimentary and juniors considered a nuisance - the sort of place where Joan Hunter Dunn would have enjoyed a social set or two. Of the larger clubs, too few have invested in covered courts. Traditionally, the members have always concentrated on doubles, not singles. That is why the country-wide support for the new National Club League, based on the successful European model with emphasis on singles, is so heartening. More than 2,500 men (in 600 teams) and 1,500 women (360 teams) will be competing this year, and numbers may double within three years. The British Tour - 22 tournaments over a 12-month period offering crucial competition for young Britons - has been another imaginative enterprise. The brighter home players are responding well to the challenge. No one has grasped his opportunities better than Chris Wilkinson. This persistent 22-year-old from Southampton reached three finals on the recent British Satellite circuit to lift his ranking from 365 a year ago to a present career-high of 168. Coming on top of Jamie Delgardo's victory in the Orange Bowl 14's, (the first success by any British player in these unofficial world junior championships), there is the unmistakable impression that a sleeping giant is beginning to awaken. There is a new spirit abroad, thanks to an injection of confidence from the likes of Tony Pickard (who put the backbone into Stefan Edberg), Billy Knight (was there ever a more courageous fighter?) and Ian Barclay (who taught Pat how to Cash-in). Ann Jones, Olga Morozova, and now Sharon Walsh, are having the same effect on the girls. The structure at grass roots has never been better and is improving all the time although Gilly Crump, new director of schools tennis for the LTA Trust, is under no illusions about the difficulty of changing people's attitudes to a game that still has an aura of snobbishness about it. 'There are some very good people out there, but it's a bit like being a missionary, trying to persuade people that tennis is a game for life,' she says. 'We are busy building the base of the pyramid.' Undoubtedly, this is the right approach. How long it will be, though, before tennis rivals football in popularity, as it does now in Germany and France, is anyone's guess. The thing that would accelerate the process magically would be the emergence of a British Borg or Becker to hold aloft the Wimbledon singles trophy.</p>

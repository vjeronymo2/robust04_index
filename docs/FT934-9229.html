			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Analysts peer into the crystal ball - Pearson's demerger of Royal Doulton SOBER-suited men and women have been caught peering under the edges of their lunch-laden china plates in recent weeks. As analysts and fund managers, they have been researching the demerger of Royal Doulton from its media parent Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times. It is expected that their remaining questions will be answered today when the listing particulars are published. These are widely expected to offer investors one Royal Doulton share for every 10 of Pearson's, and are likely to include a Royal Doulton dividend payment to sweeten the deal in addition to Pearson's forecast of a maintained 12p for the year. The City is awaiting the other details, having so far lacked information in a poorly researched sector. Brokers are expecting heavy trading in the stock immediately after demerger. Shareholders who bought Pearson for its media potential may not want to hold stock in a much smaller company operating in what is perceived to be a slow moving, luxury goods market. The question is, just how anxious will they be to sell? Such decisions are likely to hinge in part on whether Pearson and Royal Doulton are able to answer questions over the decision to demerge. 'If it was such a good company, it would have been floated, or the management would have got together to do a management buy-out,' said one analyst. Pearson would argue that it is giving the benefits of Royal Doulton to shareholders who will have the choice of staying with a recovery stock or selling it to realise the value. Analysts are also questioning the timing of the demerger. Pearson says the demerger is part of its decision to focus on media, and any postponement would mean at least a four-month delay. Although less than two months away from Doulton's year-end, the particulars will not include a profits forecast, partly due to the importance and uncertainty of the Christmas trading period. The offer document, however, is likely to include details of a notional full-year dividend pay-out, which will make the shares attractive on a yield basis. That attraction will be crucial in light of the group's three-year trading record. Since 1990, operating profits have halved to Pounds 10.9m last year, on virtually steady turnover of Pounds 201m, while pre-tax profits have collapsed from Pounds 17.6m to Pounds 3.9m. For the six months to June 30, Doulton incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.9m, after Pounds 3.2m of exceptional charges, against a Pounds 1.1m loss last year. Royal Doulton's rivals have suffered similar fates. The global fine china market - of which Royal Doulton claims 10 per cent - is estimated to have declined by 20 per cent in the last three years, as both recession and a shift in consumer tastes towards more informal dinnerware take their toll. This decline has left the other six global players - Wedgwood of the UK, Villeroy &amp; Boch, Rosenthal and Hutschenreuther of Germany, Noritake of Japan, and Lenox of the US, fighting for ever shrinking shares. However, Mr Stuart Lyons, Royal Doulton's chief executive, is optimistic about the group's quoted future. 'We will have the flexibility to determine our own strategy,' he says. Until now, Royal Doulton's strategy has been heavily backed by investment from Pearson. Over the last three years, Pearson has invested significantly more than the Pounds 15.3m depreciation charges. The result has been great strides in automating what has always been a labour intensive industry. This has allowed Royal Doulton to decrease its dependence on the more expensive, traditional china sector and expand into new markets such as selling less expensive bone china to chain stores such as Marks and Spencer and Safeway. Technology is even being applied to the traditional figurine business. The time to produce a figurine has fallen from 18 days to 12. Royal Doulton has also carved itself a niche in supplying china to the airline and hotel market. But perhaps the best guide to Royal Doulton's future strategy is the development of its crystal business. Since the 1980s Royal Doulton has formed partnerships with crystal manufacturers abroad who make products according to its specifications. Now more than half of Royal Doulton's crystal is supplied from outside the group. The implications are obvious for the china business, although it will have the tricky task of balancing some external sourcing with upholding its premium brands. Observers also speculate that Royal Doulton will find growth by exploiting its brand in the wider home furnishings market. Other china manufacturers such as Wedgwood have begun to introduce products such as tablecloths and napkins co-ordinated with their china patterns. There is a danger, however, that such moves could take the shine off what is considered a premium brand. 'Royal Doulton will have to be careful they do not bite the hand that feeds them,' one analyst says. Even though many of the questions over Royal Doulton's financial structure should be answered today, analysts are expecting heavy initial selling as media investors reshape portfolios. Thus, says one, logic dictates that to sell immediately would be ill-advised: 'It may be worth taking the final dividend and then having another look.'</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Tories unite with Labour to attack EC budget plan: Hurd says Delors is bidding for a larger rise than is justified THE Conservative and Labour parties were yesterday united in their criticism of European Commission plans to raise European Community budget revenue by a third over the next five years. The determined opposition in Westminster arose even though Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, said the plan was 'the minimum necessary' to make a success of the Maastricht treaty on political and monetary union. Mr Delors made a strenuous effort to head off a row over the UK's rebate on its budget payments, and to pre-empt criticism of Commission plans to help industry restructure. But in London, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said he did not believe there was a case for raising the resources' ceiling available to the EC over the next five years, because there was room for growth within the existing ceiling. 'Mr Delors is bidding for more than is justified. We will go into a whole range of Community meetings lasting several months, and at the end of the day all of this has to be agreed by all of us,' he said on BBC radio. For Labour, Mr Chris Smith, an opposition Treasury spokesman, said reform of the Common Agricultural Policy would he negotiations, and he emphasised the need for reform of the regional and structural funds, to benefit British regions. Brussels wants the budget to rise from Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 47.4bn) this year to Ecu87.5bn (at 1992 prices) in 1997 to accommodate greater spending on regional aid, foreign policy, farm reform and a strengthened research effort to sharpen industrial competitiveness. Mr Delors, presenting the 1993-97 plan to the European Parliament, recalled that the first five year plan, agreed in 1988, had made possible the achievements of the single market, more even EC development through regional spending, and financial stability. At least equal effort was now needed for European union to succeed, he said. 'We must implement the agreement of Maastricht.' Anticipating resistance to the size of the increase, Mr Delors pointedly reminded the 12 heads of government that 'half of the rise comes about because of political commitments you undertook, and the other half you would have to spend anyway' if the EC did not exist. At Maastricht in December, the 12 agreed to increase substantially fiscal transfers to the four poorest member states - Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece. This accounts for half the proposed Ecu21bn increase. The other three priorities share the rest, but if member states were acting individually, the cost of helping eastern Europe, agriculture and industrial restructuring 'would still have to be met', Mr Delors argued. Downing Street officials yesterday stressed, however, that although Mr John Major, the prime minister, had agreed at the Maastricht summit to the cohesion fund to help poorer EC countries, he had not signed up to spending on this scale. The UK is a net contributor to the budget despite the 1985 rebate arrangement which Germany - by far the biggest net contributor - is now questioning. Mr Delors confirmed that the UK rebate would not be re-examined until after the British general election, due at the latest by July. 'The Commission does not intend to upset that (election) process through its proposals.' UK officials stressed that any change in the rebate arrangement would require the unanimity of the 12, so that Britain could veto it. Mr Delors strongly defended his controversial industrial restructuring plans, vehemently insisting that 'we are not talking about French interventionism'. There would be 'equality of access' to the new 'bottom-up' attempt to make research more responsive to industrial innovation, and an independent scientific committee would decide where the EC should spend 'competitiveness' funds which would rise to Ecu3.5bn in 1997 at today's prices.

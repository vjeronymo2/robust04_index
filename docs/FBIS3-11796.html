			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz] </F>   [Text] Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo McGregor said at  noon today that Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination must not,  indeed cannot, inhibit the Mexican people's resolve to express  their sovereign will in the upcoming elections. He gave  assurances that the electoral process will continue under the  guiding principles of legality, impartiality, security, and  objectivity. This important statement to the news media,  especially after the tragic events we have experienced, means  that the people who are in charge of domestic policy are  ensuring stability and that the conditions are given to continue  the electoral process leading up to the election of the  Republic's next president and congress.    Dr. Carpizo urged the political parties to assume the pledge  the moment demands. He said that according to the law problems  should not lead to undesirable confrontations, the results of  which affect everyone. Differences should be settled through  dialogue and reason and within the framework of the law. Dr.  Carpizo explained that the Mexican people are opposed to  impunity and are demanding justice and security.    [Begin Carpizo recording] Let us close a tragic page of our  history and cling to the hope of a better fatherland, one that  is firm in its convictions and zealous about its pledge of  loyalty to the most noble human ideals. The time has come to  prove that Mexico's values are firm, that it possesses the  necessary maturity to function cohesively and with absolute  respect for the law, and that it can behave in a manner that is  consistent with its convictions concerning the preservation of  peace and the democratic institutions that guarantee our social  coexistence. All of this, of course, within the de jure state  that governs us. [end recording]    Mexico, Dr. Carpizo added, is a strong country and will  unquestionably emerge from this tragedy as a stronger country.    I also spoke with Federal District Attorney General Diego  Valades, who held a private meeting with Government Secretary  Carpizo. During an interview this afternoon, Valades told us  that the authorities will take all the time that is necessary to  resolve Colosio's assassination. He added that there is no  threat of instability in Mexico.    [Begin Valades recording] The country is lining up and ought  to line up behind a progressive awareness of unity. Moreover,  and this is very important, we Mexicans should have confidence  in ourselves. The tragic and regrettable events you referred to  have certainly been a source of worry for the community, but we  Mexicans should not lose our self-esteem. That would be the  worst thing for us to lose. [end recording]    Valades concluded that at 1700 this afternoon the Attorney  General's Office will release a statement on the progress that  has been made in the investigation of the assassination.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Macdonald Martin up 22% to Pounds 2.63m as output rises Higher distillery output and bulk whisky sales helped Macdonald Martin Distilleries achieve a 22 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.16m to Pounds 2.63m in the six months to September 30. Turnover was up 25 per cent at Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 13.1m). Sales of Glenmorangie, the company's leading malt, rose 15 per cent in volume terms and 19 per cent in value because of strong overseas demand, particularly in the US and France. Shipments in the UK were flat, but retail sales increased. In blended whisky, sales were up 7 per cent in volume, but down 7 per cent in value terms. Bulk sales of blended whisky increased, but bottled sales were down 10 per cent overall. The downturn was marked in the UK, where volume sales of bottled blends fell by 25 per cent. The group lost a large own-label order from a supermarket chain after it declined to lower its price. Distillery production doubled in the first half, mainly to increase the group's stocks. Mr James Fyfe, deputy managing director, estimated that capacity utilisation would average 69 per cent this year, against 43 per cent previously. Sales of Crabbie's Green Ginger Wine, acquired a year ago, were in line with forecasts and its market share had increased, but the profit contribution 'was modest.' The exceptional item of Pounds 440,000 included just over Pounds 300,000 in compensation to Mr Neil McKerrow who resigned as managing director in June. The balance was start up costs of an Indian joint venture, which will begin bottling Highland Queen next month. The board declared a 10 per cent rise in the interim dividend to 2.5p (2.266p) on the A shares and to 1.25p (1.133p) on the B shares. Earnings per share were 12.73p (10.46p) and 6.36p (5.23p) on the respective classes.</p>

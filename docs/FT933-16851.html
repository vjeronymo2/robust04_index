			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gillette product launch GILLETTE, the Boston-based consumer products company, yesterday unveiled a new shaving system. It is hoping to follow up the success of its Sensor razor with the new product which, it claims, offers further technological advances. Gillette said the new system - SensorExcel - should sell at a 15 per cent premium to Sensor. It will be launched in European markets in September. This is the first time it has launched a new 'wet shaving' product outside the US. When news of the launch surfaced last week, the company's shares moved higher, although some analysts suggested it was too soon after Sensor's 1989 launch to bring a new 'wet-shaving' product to market. Sensor has been hugely successful, helping to rebuild Gillette's image after the tumultuous 1980s, when the company was subject to two takeover threats.</p>

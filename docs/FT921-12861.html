			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: ASM to buy M Plant companies MALAYSIAN Plantations (M Plant) has agreed to sell its five plantation companies domiciled in England, and some Malaysian estates for MDollars 185m (USDollars 69m) to Amalgamated Steel Mills (ASM), one of Malaysia's largest industrial groups. The sale, approved by ASM shareholders, marks one of the last chapters in the unravelling of the acquisition in 1989 for MDollars 592m of the then financially troubled Multi-Purpose conglomerate by Kamunting, a tiny, public-listed toll road operator. Kamunting and M Plant each has a 32.5 per cent shareholding in the other, the latter acquiring it with a MDollars 167m loan but partially settled by a subsequent MDollars 120m rights. Kamunting's successful effort in enlisting M Plant's support for the Multi-Purpose bid left the plantation group with MDollars 358m in loans, needed mostly to meet obligations it held on MDollars 249m in Kamunting loan notes. Debts within Kamunting and Multi-Purpose led, during the past two years, to a stream of asset-sales. M Plant's outstanding bank debts stand at MDollars 200m. The cash deal with ASM was partially discounted from the MDollars 203m market value, said Mr Lim Thian Keong, managing director, because it was a block offer which attracted few bids. The UK-based estate rubber and oil palm companies, are, in order of size: Brooklands, Henrietta, Chembong, Kuala Pahi and Kampong Kuantan. KL Land is locally incorporated. ASM, controlled by Mr William Cheng and his holding company, Lion, is an aggressive group involved in steel products, property, cars and components, finance, retail and food. It is planning a MDollars 8.6bn steel production complex in joint venture with the Taiwanese state-owned China Steel. ASM turnover for the year to June 1991 was MDollars 1.8bn against MDollars 1.3bn a year earlier.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Photo-Me wins support for Pounds 38m French buy Shareholders at Photo-Me International have approved the picture booth manufacturer and operator's move into France with the Pounds 38m purchase of KIS. The proposal to acquire KIS, which has developed a booth using digital electronic technology, was passed by a unanimous show of hands at yesterday's extraordinary general meeting held in Surrey. About 35 investors attended the meeting. Mr David Miller, managing director, said the acquisition was expected to be dilutive in the current year as it would be included for just three or four months. KIS would, however, be earnings enhancing next year. A dispute over the intellectual copyright to the technology used by KIS 'was not material', said Mr Miller, and had not been put to shareholders at the meeting. Round Point Trading has claimed that it would be able to hinder the use of the KIS photo booth for up to two years after exercising options in a third company. Mr Miller said Photo-Me had taken advice from solicitors and Round Point's claims were considered to be without foundation.</p>

Self-Regulatory Organizations Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange requests that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication of the notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . PSE believes it appropriate to approve the proposed rule change so that its authority to list municipal securities does not lapse. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change extending the PSE pilot program is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the PSE and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6, and the rules and regulations thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of the notice of filing thereof in that the pilot program will expire on November 2, 1994, without reauthorization. The Commission believes that extension of the pilot is desirable in that it will permit the exchange to evaluate its program prior to filing a request for permanent approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stavros Angelidhis] </F>   [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis is avoiding calling  a meeting of the National Council to discuss the substance of  the confidence-building measures so that the cards of the Greek  Cypriot side are not revealed before the Turkish side responds.  Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis made the above  statement, arguing that nothing at the National Council meetings  remains secret. However, in an attempt to lessen the pressure  from AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] and EDEK  [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] for an immediate convening  of the National Council -- a view shared by DIKO [Democratic  Party] Parliamentary Representative Tasos Papadhopoulos -- the  president has decided to call the leaders of the four parties  participating in the National Council to hold separate meetings  for a "discussion of the latest developments in the Cyprus  issue." Yesterday, the president met DIKO Chairman Spiros  Kiprianou and today will meet Democratic Rally Chairman Ioannis  Matsis, AKEL General Secretary Dhimitrios Khristofias and EDEK  Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis.    DIKO Chairman Kiprianou told O FILELEVTHEROS that during the  meeting they had a general discussion of the latest developments  concerning the Cyprus issue with special reference to the  confidence-building measures and the reports of the UN experts  on these measures. Kiprianou stressed that DIKO categorically  rejects the proposed confidence-building measures and added that  the reports of the UN experts give another, clearer picture of  how dangerous these measures are.    Kiprianou added that the president had told him that he is  not committed by the reports of the UN experts, and that he will  wait for the response of the Turkish side on the three documents  of the UN secretary general on the confidence-building measures.    For its part, EDEK followed the call of AKEL's General  Secretary Khristofias Monday and repeated its demand for the  immediate convening of the National Council, "so that the  institution does not become obsolete" and questioned whether we  can reach a solution without discussing the issue. EDEK claims  that the confidence-building measures constitute a solution much  worse than the current situation because they provide for two  separate states, and have our own signature on it.    EDEK's statement notes that the UN experts' report gives a  vivid picture of how destructive the confidence-building  measures are. It also notes that: "Instead of realizing the  decline that our national issue has undergone, the government  continues to declare that it is ready to accept the  confidence-building measures and that the only remaining issue  in order to begin the dialogue is the Turkish side's acceptance.  How can the government follow this line despite the opposite  position being taken by all parties?" [passage omitted]</p>

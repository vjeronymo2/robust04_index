			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Earnings at Valeo fall 10% to FFr545m VALEO, the French maker of car components, yesterday reported a 10 per cent decline in 1991 net profits. Net income after minority interests fell to FFr545m (Dollars 96m) last year from FFr603m in 1990, on turnover down 1.6 per cent to FFr19.87bn from FFr20.18bn. Earnings fell to FFr44.2 per share from FFr49.3 over the same period. Valeo, headed by Noel Goutard, warned that the automotive market remained weak and said it would continue to concentrate on increasing sales, cutting production costs and reducing borrowings. Net debt fell to FFr2.95bn by the end of last year, from FFr3.5bn at the end of 1990. Valeo's operating income rose by 30 per cent to FFr878m from FFr676m last year, but the gain was wiped out at the net level by the fact that Valeo had no capital gains from asset sales last year, as against FFr154m of capital gains from divestments in 1990. Including the income due to Valeo before the asset sales took place, Valeo had FFr193m of total revenues from divested operations in 1990. Turnover started to recover in the second half, by 3.9 per cent over the comparable period in the previous year, after having slipped 6.1 per cent in the first six months of 1991.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / N Korea invites IAEA inspection North Korea yesterday offered the outside world a look at key evidence in a row over its alleged secret atomic bomb project, inviting United Nations experts to watch while its main nuclear reactor is refuelled, Reuter reports from Vienna. Mr David Kyd, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) spokesman, said inspection of the Yongbyon reactor's exhausted fuel core was vital to try to clear up allegations that Pyongyang was developing nuclear weapons. He said the UN agency responded positively to the new North Korean offer and, provided other elements of a fresh IAEA inspection could be agreed, an expert mission would leave for Yongbyon next week. The presence of inspectors was necessary 'in order to verify that there has been no diversion of nuclear materials,' he added. Mr Kim Il-sung, the North Korean leader, earlier this week strongly denied that his country possessed, was producing or planned to make nuclear weapons. But Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said yesterday before leaving Seoul for Tokyo that Washington was certain a secret nuclear arms project was under way, adding that inspection of the spent reactor core was imperative. In its response to the new offer, the IAEA set out the measures it would require to take during the removal of the spent fuel and additional steps at nuclear facilities in order to verify that no uranium had been spirited away. The uranium fuel rods in the Yongbyon reactor, which was started up in 1986, are almost exhausted and must be replaced in the next few weeks.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPO SHOWS A NEW WAVE OF ACTIVEWEAR  </P> <P> Although most people have never heard of it, the Action Sports Retailer Trade  Expo is the world's best indoor beach party. Twice each year for three days,  surf, beach volleyball, skateboarding, rollerskating and windsailing stars,  manufacturers and retailers pack the Long Beach Convention Center, preview the  upcoming season's wares and generally have a fine old time.  </P> <P> This year, however, retail activist Peter Glen's opening seminar undercut the  party atmosphere. In it, he warned the industry of the dangers of complacency  and a failure to assume social responsibility in the face of environmental  destruction, AIDS, homelessness and corporate takeovers.  </P> <P> Even the success of the industry poses a problem, he said. Surf shops are now  fixtures throughout the Midwest, Japan and Europe. New York department stores,  such as Macy's, have profitable beach boutiques, and mainstream trade  magazines, such as Women's Wear Daily, photograph neon activewear.  </P> <P> These big boys have so much money, Glen continued, that they no longer need  California to "do California." The only way the homegrown companies can  survive, he concluded, is to become more authentic, more visionary and more  creative.  </P> <P> A walk through the exhibition hall validated his message. On the one hand, rows  of manufacturers hawked essentially interchangeable lines of T-shirts, bathing  suits and shorts with little flair or originality. But there were also a  handful of companies that displayed the imagination, enthusiasm and sense of  purpose that Glen believes the times demand.  </P> <P> The Powell Corp., a leading skateboard company, for instance, cleverly  satirized the entire proceedings by taking their orders inside a makeshift  World War II bunker. They brought in a real tank, built a fence covered with  artificial dried brown "leaves," shot photographs of models in '40s pinup style  and offered visitors cold mineral waters. Just as Glen had predicted, their  salespeople, clad in military khaki, were beseiged by hordes of buyers, friends  and curiousity-seekers responding to the witty presentation.  </P> <P> Jimmy'Z took an entirely different approach. Unlike most of the other leading  activewear companies, it makes no bones about bypassing the hardcore surfer and  skater for the hip Barney's or Fred Segal customer.  </P> <P> "Our clothes are contemporary street sportswear that blend California life  style and art, and that just happen to have beach origins," Sepp Donahower, the  company's co-founder, says.  </P> <P> Their booth reflected that difference. To get even a glimpse of their clothes,  one had to pass through a wall of hanging black rubber Jimmy'Z banners into a  dark, cavelike room. Inside were tables, a series of stark black platforms for  the fashion show and a disc jockey who spun eclectic, intelligent dance music.  </P> <P> The clothing was equally distinctive. In the midst of an exhibition hall full  of bright colors, Jimmy'Z featured blacks, whites, grays and blues, frequently  in solids or free-form prints, sometimes on or with denim. The neon that was  used was done so sparingly and to best effect in a unique neon plaid short.  </P> <P> While Jimmy'Z describes itself as "real clothes for real people," Body Glove  actively pursues the hard-core market. "We made our name for the past 35 years  with wet suits," Greg Licht, national sales manager, says "and we have no  intention of abandoning them now."  </P> <P> Two years ago, they broadened that appeal considerably by introducing the first  woman's neoprene bathing suits accented by the then-unfamiliar hot pinks,  greens and yellows. Judging from this season's progressive collection and  fever-pitched fashion show, their position is even stronger this year.  </P> <P> With an unmatched flair for mixing fabrics, they brought out volley shorts made  of Tactel, a fast-drying fabric, with neoprene at the waist; women's one-piece  bathing suits with strategically located clear plastic squares; tie-dyed Lycra  and lace tops, and hot pink or green high heels with the black-and-yellow Body  Glove logo stamped on the shoe. It is as haute as beach couture gets and was  greeted with a frenzy by buyers at the booth.  </P> <P> It was not just these companies but the organizers of the expo itself who rose  to Glen's challenge. On the first night of the show, they hosted a fund-raiser  for the Surfrider Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to beach  preservation, and presented them with a $5,000 donation.  </P> <P> "We realized that the industry needs only two conditions to thrive: a clean  environment and access to good beaches," Brad Bonhall, editor of Action Sports  Retailer magazine, says. "The Surfrider Foundation has been working for exactly  these goals for a number of years, and we thought we should help.  </P> <P> "In retrospect," he continues, "we also were inspired by working with Peter  Glen. His philosophy is to 'just do it.' So we did."  </P></p>

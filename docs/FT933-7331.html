			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Time to strike camp MY observation, last week, that some people regarded Country Life magazine as antediluvian, mimsy mamsy, camp and affected has drawn hundreds of protesting letters from every inglenook and burrow in rural Britain. The writers did not object to 'antediluvian.' 'Mimsy mamsy' wasn't mentioned. 'Affected' they ignored. But 'camp' drove them wild. Typical was Maj-Gen Sir Richard Walter Brian Colin Mark Heathcote-Chubb, who wrote from Cornwall: 'You are an abomination, Sir. I expect you are a young person, wet behind the ears, but you are obviously a communist and probably a pervert if you believe that Country Life is 'camp.' It is not in the least wit 'camp.' It describes traditional pursuits and values - hunting, shooting, steeplechasing, pottery, thatching and rural cooking - that must be meaningless to a degenerate like you from an inner-city sewer like Notting Hill. It's a pity they abolished conscription. A poseur like you would be whistling a different tune if you found yourself in the vanguard of the relief of Sarajevo . . . ' Ordinarily, I would have dealt with the major-general by sending him a nice postcard - a scene by Caravaggio, say - with an enigmatic message, and left it at that. But camp is such an interesting word that I have looked into it more closely. My dictionary says: camp adj. informal. 1 homosexual 2 exaggeratedly effeminate 3 being so outrageously artificial, affected, inappropriate or exaggerated as to be considered amusing (origin unknown) - campness n. Yet there is more to it than that. Here are seven witty/perceptive things you could say about camp adj: Camp depends on where you pitch it. Camp is not necessarily homosexual. Anyone or anything can be camp. But it takes one to know one. Camp is a disguise that fails. Camp is laughing at The Importance of Being Earnest without knowing why. Camp is laughing at The Importance of Being Earnest AND knowing why. Camp is anti-art in the same way physical desire is anti-creative. Camp is a lie which tells the truth. That is not my own list. I have extracted it from a longer list that appears at the start of Camp, by Philip Core - a Who's Who and a What's What of the subject published by Plexus in 1984. Says Core in his introduction: 'Ronald Firbank, the frivolous English author from the world of literary camp, once wrote: 'I must admit that somewhere deep down inside of me there is a field with cows browsing.' From a fop who kept pet goldfish and fed them real pearls (artificial ones, he claimed, they spat out), such a confidence, set in the context of grand hotels and Edwardian society, is just one brilliant example of the stance of concealed normalcy essential to the camp psyche.' Most of the entries in Core's lexicon of camp cause no surprise: Garbo, Dali, Warhol, Wilde, Sitwell (Edith, Osbert, Sacheverell), Caravaggio, Cartland (Dame Barbara), Brideshead Revisited, Bronzino, Jagger, Isherwood, Humphries (Barry), Hockney, Heath (Sir Edward), Gielgud, Garland, Fellini, Erte, Dietrich, Dallesandro (Joe), d'Annunzio (Gabriele), The Damned, Vidal (Gore), Valentino (Rudolph), Strachey, Proust, Mishima (Yukio), opera ('the campest of all high culture') and Waugh (Evelyn: 'tweediness, snobbery . . . consistently combined awe and reverence for a spoilt and arrogant upper class with an irrepressible mockery of the same attributes which more than pinpointed his own anomalies'). Disappointingly, the author's investigation cleaves mainly to the arts. He could have broadened it to include industrial camp, financial camp, political and scientific camp. Politics is especially fertile. Consider the British government. Kenneth Clarke? Michael Heseltine? Michael Portillo? Michael Howard? Malcolm Rifkind? Virginia Bottomley? Peter Brooke? John Gummer? Sir Patrick Mayhew? Peter Lilley? John Redwood? William Waldegrave? Douglas Hurd? Each of these ministers is as camp as a row of tents. Perhaps John Major's biggest problem is that he is not remotely camp. All in all, I am convinced that Country Life is an example of camp. But I am starting to wonder about 'mimsy mamsy.'</p>

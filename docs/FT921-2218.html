			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Arts: Caligula - Comedie Francaise, Paris 'Le theatre n'est pas un jeu, c'est la conviction', Camus once said. It has taken the conservative Comedie Francaise over 50 years to risk Camus' drama of existentialist conviction, but now amends have been made. The theatre's first Caligula (to June 24) is a stunning production. Camus' drama follows the facts of Suetonius' history, but his hero is an existentialist philosophe housed in the body of a Roman dictator: the mad logic of nihilism drives this Caligula to tyranny. The play was written in 1938 but war delayed performance until 1945, when it was seized on as a prophetic wonder which had anticipated Hitler. 'Our century is the century of fear', wrote Camus, but he always denied the precise political analogy, and time has proved 'Caligula' a broader statement of the themes of fear, despair, nihilism. Youssef Chahine revives it as a vision of contemporary horror: urban violence, terrorism, mass media as both a creator of dangerous orthodoxies and a force for banalising our responses to them. Inserts of films and other non-conventional staging - Chahine is a film-maker - underline the interpretation. The result is chic, radical and, to foreign eyes at least, typically Parisian in its mix of philosophy, politics and stylish aesthetics. Sandwiched between crumbling classical columns and stone walls, a huge steel and glass office block rises to the roof of the Comedie Francaise stage. Sometimes, it reflects a cityscape painted on panels in the wings; sometimes it is a screen projecting rabble-rousing crowd scenes or Caligula's face, many times enlarged, as it booms out to the audience while the dictator stands dwarfed beneath it. A forum at the front also merges old and new: ruined arches and pillars, flights of stone steps, a yellow moped, flashing roadwork lights, cordons, signposts. The ancient/modern mix suggests Rome, but Chahine widens the image to any city. Drills whirr, workmen in helmets alternate with wailing veiled women at an Islamic funeral, an old pinstriped banker shuffles round the rubble; kids lounge on the steps, cameramen from 'Satellite TV' pop up from each corner. As on television, the exotic cuts into the everyday: Chahine shares Camus' North African background and recalls it through an Arab bazaar, and in the drums and tambourines of Mohamed Nouh's specially composed music. By contrast the Roman patricians are the western, chattering classes: puffed up in gold togas, they sample grapes, prattle, giggle and massage one another - a smoke-filled box in the auditorium is converted to a Roman bath for the evening. This sort of decadence needs a Caligula, suggests Chahine: Jean-Ives Dubois, lean and long in black tracksuit, swivels round in an office chair, cool, efficient, deliberate in movement, calm in his dissection of their false values: 'Les hommes meurent, et ils ne sont pas heureux'. The drama is that he loses his sanity as the patrician-puppets, and especially Cherea (Michel Favory), grow through fear and bereavement into warm, vulnerable characters. Backed by screen and microphone, Dubois becomes an automaton of terror, only human - and comic - in his crazy obsession that his slave will fetch him the moon, symbol of impossible attainment (according to history, Caligula had a moon fetish.) Black humour hints at rather than wallows in violence: the menace of Caligula got up like Botticelli's Venus, emerging from below the stage and demanding obeisance; corpses wheeled across Caligula's diner party and ignored; a speeded-up poetry competition where each poet is allowed a few seconds to speak, and the last one only to part his lips, before black hoods are thrust over them and they are lead off to execution. Fights are stylised into acrobatics. Caligula and the poet Scipio (Lilah Dadi, a touching blend of worldliness and naivety) joust while turning somersaults on a trampoline; there are jugglers, knife-throwers, a danse macabre of punks and soldiers slicing into one another. To reveal the dynamics of the climax would be to play spoilsport; but in a mix of old-fashioned theatrical chill and clever cinematic tricks Chahine pulls his themes together and has Caligula, tragic hero in spite of all, literally reaching for the moon. But every scene is dramatically inventive, different, and acted and choreographed with consummate skill and apparent ease. Cumulatively they question everyday assumptions, moral tabs, political involvement (Favory's Cherea, reluctantly bloodstained, points a dripping hand at the audience), our own distancing of terror as it is 'stylised' by repetition on the small screen. This is the most exciting theatre in Paris since Peter Brook's multi-cultural Tempest here two years ago.</p>

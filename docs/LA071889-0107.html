			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOLICITED DONATIONS FROM FIRM CHIEF, CRANSTON SAYS  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Cranston, already under fire for aiding Phoenix businessman Charles  H. Keating in his battles with savings and loan regulators, said Monday that he  solicited a $400,000 donation from Keating for a voter registration group  formed by the senator's son.  </P> <P> The California Democrat said he also asked Keating in 1987 and 1988 to donate a  total of $450,000 to two other nonprofit, nonpartisan voter registration groups  "because of my determination to do what I can to increase voter participation."  </P> <P> Keating is the chairman of American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, which owns  Lincoln Savings and Loan. The Irvine thrift was seized by regulators in April,  one day after American Continental filed for bankruptcy. Regulators claimed  that the company was operating Lincoln unsafely and dissipating the S&amp;L's  $5.3 billion in assets.  </P> <P> In February, 1988, American Continental gave $400,000 to the Center for  Participation in Democracy Inc., a Los Angeles organization formed by  Cranston's son, Kim, to train organizers and carry out nonpartisan voter  registration drives.  </P> <P> Cranston said Monday in a written statement that none of the funds he solicited  went to him "personally or politically."  </P> <P> Since the bankruptcy of American Continental and seizure of Lincoln, Cranston's  relationship to Keating has come under scrutiny, particularly by investors who  bought $200 million worth of American Continental debt securities through the  Lincoln branches. Those bondholders claim they were falsely led to believe that  the bonds were federally insured, and have filed lawsuits claiming they were  defrauded by Keating and other American Continental executives and professional  advisers for the company.  </P> <P> The lawsuits contend that Keating and his associates made large campaign  contributions to numerous politicians, who in turn helped Keating keep his  business afloat by representing his cause before regulators. Keating donated  $39,000 to Cranston's 1986 reelection campaign.  </P> <P> At Keating's behest, Cranston joined other senators in two meetings with  regulators in April, 1987. A week later, Cranston and four other senators  talked with federal regulators from the board's San Francisco office.  </P> <P> In March and early April of this year, Cranston talked with two bank board  members to urge them to consider approving Keating's effort to sell Lincoln.  Regulators had refused to approve the sale, saying the proposed buyers simply  did not have enough cash to complete the deal.  </P> <P> Cranston said Monday that he "did do a pretty stupid thing, politically" in  giving the appearance that he had interceded to win favorable treatment of  Keating. But he said he did nothing improper in trying to get "fair play" for a  California firm.  </P> <P> The senator also denied doing anything improper in soliciting money for worthy  causes, such as his son's voter-registration group.  </P> <P> Kim Cranston, 37, founded the Center for Participation in Democracy, a  nonprofit organization that trains organizers and carries out nonpartisan voter  education and registration drives.  </P> <P> Kim Cranston, who now works in Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy's office in Sacramento,  could not be reached for comment Monday. State records show that American  Continental gave the money to the center in February, 1988. The amount  represented 29% of the center's $1.4-million budget for its fiscal year, which  ended May 31, 1988.  </P></p>

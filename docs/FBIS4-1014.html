			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K. Swart] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- Hundreds of West Rand  hostel residents would be transported to the East Rand to  reinforce hostels "under attack" by the National Peacekeeping  Force [NPKF], the National Hostel Residents Association [NHRA]  said on Tuesday.    NHRA spokesman Thulani Mlothshwa said: "Let the world know  more militants will be deployed on the East Rand and they will  be told to take no nonsense from the NPKF who, with township  residents, attacked our hostel yesterday (Monday)."    He was referring to a gunfight between NPKF and Thokoza  hostel residents on Monday which resulted in the death of news  photographer Ken Oostebroek.    Mr Mlotshwa said the deployment of the NPKF had given a  boost  to the enemies of hostel residents. "They thought it would now  be easier to attack the hostels. This was proved yesterday  (Monday) when township residents came in large numbers,  accompanied by NPKF members, to attack the Thokoza hostel. As a  result the hostel inmates were forced to defend themselves."    Hostel residents were protected by their own "military" and  500 reinforcements from West Rand hostels would be brought in to  protect East Rand hostels from attack. "We would like to warn  all those who are still prepared to attack the hostels that if  they think they are militant, they will find us more militant,"  Mr Mlotshwa said.</p>

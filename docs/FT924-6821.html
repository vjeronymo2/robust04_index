			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / A change in policy pays off: The turnround by insurers has surprised analysts THE UK insurance industry may have reached a turning point after it suffered record losses in 1990 and 1991. Furthermore, the turnround has been quicker than many expected. Although modest, the Pounds 19.6m third quarter pre-tax profit reported yesterday by Commercial Union, the most successful composite insurer, comes hard on the heels of improved figures at General Accident and Royal Insurance. Mr David Hudson, analyst with Credit Laing Lyonnaise, describes the third quarter results achieved by CU, Royal and General Accident as 'almost unbelievable. It is very much a UK story. It is coming through more rapidly than anyone would have expected earlier this year.' Mr Youseff Ziai, who follows the UK insurers for Morgan Stanley, adds: 'The magnitude of the recovery, especially in the UK, is truly surprising.' The recovery is centred on a turnround in the domestic UK market, where companies were hit by a combination of weather and recession-related losses, and a seemingly inexorable rise in crime. During 1990 and 1991 claims from subsidence and storm damage soared to record levels. In autumn 1991 insurers found themselves on the end of huge claims stemming from the problems of the housing market. Insurers were hit by claims on mortgage indemnity policies, by which they had insured banks and building societies for losses arising on sales of repossessed properties. Claims and provisions on mortgage indemnity business are still at high levels, and are undermining the pace of recovery of companies most heavily exposed. Together Royal Insurance, Sun Alliance, Eagle Star and Legal &amp; General, which have a market share of some 70 per cent of mortgage indemnity business, face total losses in excess of Pounds 2bn for the three years between 1991 and 1993. Yet elsewhere the picture is much brighter. CU reported underwriting profits on its private and commercial motor accounts. The industry is recording small profits or breaking even in problem areas such as industrial fire, while the business of insuring homeowners against the risks of theft and fire is again proving to be profitable. One of the reasons for the improvement is that claims trends certainly seem to moving in the industry's favour. To some extent the industry has been lucky. Last winter was unusually benign. Throughout the year there has been more rain and fewer storms. In the first half of 1992 losses from subsidence were 35 per cent lower than in the first half of 1991, according to the Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade association. CU says subsidence claims are now running at between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of last year's levels. Industry figures indicate that there are fewer road accident and motor insurance claims, partially because motorists have less money available to pay for petrol. Royal and GA say that as the density of traffic flows have declined, only one in four of their motor policyholders have claimed on their insurance this year. Motor claims frequency is declining by around 10 per cent. The industry appears to be beginning to see the benefit of what it calls 'corrective actions' taken over the last two years. Premiums have risen, with sharp rises in home and motor insurance. Since early 1991 the average cost of motor insurance has increased by between 20 per cent and 30 per cent a year. Household premiums have risen by more than 100 per cent in areas which insurers regard as susceptible to subsidence. Insurers have also become more selective about the risks they underwrite, fine-tuning premium rates to take into account a greater range of possible risks and rejecting many potential customers. In motor insurance Royal and GA are increasingly persuaded by the success of the 'direct writers', companies such as Direct Line and Churchill, which underwrite motor insurance via direct telephone sales and mass media advertising. In particular direct writers are able to retain greater numbers of customers each year, which reduces their cost base. Royal and GA are now more prepared to promote their direct writing subsidiaries even if it means offending brokers, the industry's traditional intermediary. Three in 10 Royal motor policyholders now buy their policies from the Bristol-based The Insurance Service, a Royal subsidiary. Mr Bob Scott, who heads GA's UK operation, says: 'Accounts have to be restructured in order for us to obtain more control of the business. We can't just be pushed and pulled by what's on a broker's screen. That is a path to nowhere.' Insurers have also reduced staff numbers and their own expense base. Since 1990 General Accident has reduced its staff numbers by 20 per cent, for example. Some observers even believe that the worst of the domestic mortgage indemnity problem may have passed. Royal would already be comfortably in the black if it were not for its exposure to domestic mortgage indemnity, which will cost it at least Pounds 450m in the the three years to 1993. Insurers only assume a first tranche of losses - usually equivalent to the first 25 per cent to 30 per cent of a loan's value. But such has been the fall in house prices already that a further drop in prices and increase in repossessions could affect building societies directly. Pessimists point to the weakness of the industry's capital base, which will undermine its capacity to compete if overseas companies enter the market. The industry may have its stiffest challenges still to face but at least it will do so with its domestic market in better shape.  --------------------------------------------------------                  UNDERWRITING MARGINS            Percent of non-life premium income  --------------------------------------------------------                    1986    87     88    89    90    91 General Accident   -8.3  -4.5   -1.3  -6.6 -15.1 -17.6 GRE                -5.3  -4.4   -1.0  -8.0 -22.6 -22.3 Royal Insurance    -3.5  -4.8   -7.3 -10.9 -20.1 -25.6 Sun Alliance       -3.9  -5.4    2.6  -2.6 -21.9 -31.1 Commerical Union  -10.8  -7.6   -5.9  -9.8 -14.2 -16.9  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORNOGRAPHY AND 'ADULT CHOICES'  </P> <P> In reference to your editorial, there is more at stake than mere freedom of  speech. There is also freedom of religion at stake.  </P> <P> The anti-pornography laws were enacted at the request of different religious  groups who wanted to jail and silence all those who do not believe in "original  sin," and their doctrine that sex is evil.  </P> <P> Since they could not directly jail the unbelievers, different religious groups  got laws enacted by working through surrogates and by using a propaganda  campaign that any sexual depiction was "dirty, filthy, and unfit for human  consumption."  </P> <P> However, many Americans do not believe in original sin, or that sex is dirty,  etc.  </P> <P> More than a million adult video cassettes are rented each week. Nor, as the  propagandists would have you believe, does viewing such material lead directly  to violent sex crimes: If it did, there would be over 1 million such crimes per  week.  </P> <P> In short, no matter how much religionists may want the manufacture, sale, and  viewing of such films to be a criminal event, they should stand back and make  this a personal, rather than a governmental, issue.  </P> <P> By keeping up the lie that adult materials cause sex crimes in an era when many  households can prove that to be a lie, the credibility of religionists goes  down the drain totally.  </P> <P> LYBRAND P. SMITH  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by State Duma Deputy Boris Fedorov: "The Central </F> Bank of Russia: What Next?"]    [Text] None of the state's economic institutions today is  more important than the Central Bank. Some five years ago  hardly anyone knew its chairman's name, whereas now it has  become a political office attracting universal attention.    The only question now is: To what extent does the Central  Bank perform its functions which, in the conditions of market  economy, are always extremely simple -- to ensure the stability  of the currency and the stability of the banking system.  Stability of the currency means low inflation and a stable  exchange rate. Stability of the banking system means the  absence of defrauding of clients and the stability of banks.    No country in the world has a stable currency with a weak  economy. On the other hand, most countries with weak currencies  have very weak economies. It is obvious that today we fall  within the second group and the length of time we will spend in  this group depends largely on the Central Bank.    A sound way of boosting the Central Bank's activeness in  this  sphere has been devised in New Zealand -- the Central Bank  chairman's salary there is linked to the level of inflation.  The lower the inflation, the higher the salary; the higher the  inflation, the lower the salary. There we have some food for  thought.    The Central Bank's independence is a key question. The  Germans had a taste of hyperinflation in the wake of two world  wars, and no Central Bank is stronger or more independent than  Germany's. The independence question was widely discussed in  our country in 1989-1990, but independence was in fact replaced  by excessive dependence on parliament and -- frequently -- by  irresponsibility. I recently read a report analyzing the link  between the level of inflation since the beginning of this  century and the Central Bank's status. Thus, we are a unique  country where greater independence for the Central Bank means  higher inflation.    I am reluctant to draw the conclusion that we have not yet  fully experienced the "wonders" of hyperinflation. I am in  principle against any form of subordination of the Central Bank  to either the government or the parliament. Both are equally  bad, politicians should not interfere with professionals  provided, of course, that they are professionals and are  accurately performing their functions.    In our case it is necessary to change the system of running  the Central Bank so as to reduce the likelihood of dangerous and  unlawful decisions. On the one hand, there must be a  supervisory council -- a "political" organ comprising  representatives of the banking system, industry, and trade,  which would make key decisions of monetary, credit, and banking  policy. On the other hand -- a board of directors as an organ  for daily leadership of the bank's activity which would prepare  all basic decisions. Collective and professional leadership  should protect the economy against arbitrariness. Such a system  exists in all countries in the world.    Furthermore, it is necessary to render banking legislation  as  detailed as possible, and it must be operating directly, ruling  out any free interpretation and precisely defining normatives  and their limits, the instruments of policy, and the Central  Bank's mutual relations with the government and other  institutions of power. Nowadays hardly anyone in the country has  any accurate knowledge about questions affecting the lives of  each and every one of us.    I fear that many people have an incorrect perception of the  idea of a federal reserve system. The specific U.S. system is  "federal" on the surface, but the United States does have a  unified policy, all decisions are made in Washington and there  can be no autonomization. Any experiments with a total  restructuring of the banking system can bring more harm than  good.    On the other hand, it is time to say honestly that the  processes now under way in several republics within Russia are  extremely dangerous. The redesignation of the Central Bank's  territorial organs as national banks, the adoption of their own  banking laws, and the demands for greater autonomy and  regionalization of monetary policy -- all these are signs of  separatism. Therefore, there is perfect justification for  creating territorial organs of the Central Bank in economic  regions comprising several Federation components. Such organs  would exercise greater powers and would be less dependent on  local authorities.    Another problem facing the Central Bank is its withdrawal  from the sphere of commercial activities. This means  liquidating its holdings in former Soviet banks abroad, the  Foreign Trade Bank of Russia, the Bank for Labor Savings and  Credit to the Population, and the Sovfintrade [expansion  unknown]. It is impermissible to mix the functions of banking  regulation with direct involvement in business dealings -- this  creates a conflict of interests. Another aspect of the question  is the persistent desire of former Gosbank [USSR State Bank]  officials to remain involved in credit facilities for the  economy under the cover of conducting operations through  commercial banks. I am profoundly convinced that, for as long  as central bankers engage in business, they will not tackle  monetary and credit policy.    It is obvious that the current law on the Central Bank is  outdated and we can no longer remain satisfied with cosmetic  amendments to the legislation. A new law on the Central Bank is  needed.</p>

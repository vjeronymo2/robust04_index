			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO BUSH FOR NBC WEST COAST VIEWERS  </P> <P> Although CBS and ABC aired President Bush's Friday news conference live  nationally, an NBC error gave the network's West Coast viewers only the regular  "Today" broadcast normally aired there on a tape-delay basis.  </P> <P> It was a mistake that will not happen again, said Marty Ryan, the program's  executive producer.  </P> <P> Ryan said that the show originally was told by NBC staff members in Washington  that Bush planned only "a quick, informal get-together" with reporters late  Friday morning at a time that the taped "Today" broadcast normally airs on  NBC's West Coast stations, including KNBC-TV in Burbank.  </P> <P> By the time Ryan was advised that it would be a full-blown press conference, it  was too late to cut into the show, he said. "It was kind of a lousy call on our  part, but also theirs," Ryan said, referring to the network's Washington staff,  which provided the incorrect information.  </P></p>

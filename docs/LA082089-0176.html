Investigators into Friday's escape  from the Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility near Ordway, Colo., said the  escapees, Freddie Gonzales, 21, and Ralph Brown, 30, and their wives, Patricia  Gonzales, 41, and Rebecca Brown, 26, surrendered after a nine-minute gun battle  in Holdrege, Neb., 400 miles from the prison.  </P></p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Gardening: The seeds of recovery - Robin Lane Fox sorts through the fakes and pseudonyms in Britain's nurseries Down among the packets, I have just seen evidence which calls the consumer recovery into doubt. Among the sweet pea seeds and cornflowers, you can walk away with a pseudo-wisteria, with flowers of a deeper purple and an odder shape than you have ever seen before. Its leaves are a bit strange, too. Actually, they are not real but 'simulated' and the accompanying leaflet advises you to maintain them with the help of your hair dryer. Pseudo-wisteria is fake from top to bottom. 'Made in England' by Pouliot Designs, a market leader, it can be yours for only Pounds 155.10 if the station managers of British Rail do not get there first and buy it as part of the Pleasure-from-Platforms programme. What are consumers supposed to be recovering - their nerve or their senses? Those of us who think they have recovered both already will not be surprised if sales of pseudo-wisteria are falling below projections. For Pounds 155.10, you could buy a dozen good plants of the real thing. Or you could buy 120 packets of flower seeds and stock your own garden to maturity by 1996. Indeed, from now on, you need less of the hair-dryer and more of the seed packet. In steady progression, each weekend from now until the Chelsea flower show is an important time for sowing. Begin with seeds of your own geraniums: sow indoors immediately. They are vastly cheaper than plants at Pounds 2 each in May and they really are not difficult if you can start them in a steady heat of 20`C-22`C. At the same time, remember the electric blue salvia Patens, never a mass of flower but always a dream of a colour late in August if you sow it now in similar heat. In town gardens, you could also house cobaea Scandens, the rapid cover for walls and eyesores. Sow it indoors now and pot it on individually, training each plant up its own bamboo cane before it goes outdoors up a wall in May and reaches 15ft during one season. Thompson and Morgan, of London Road, Ipswich, Suffolk IP2 OBA (tel: 0473-688821) still sell the white form, which is the best at Pounds 1.99 for five seeds. Last year, I had a prize-winning, board-sweeping, Sloane-stopping success. Everybody wanted it; now, the white venidium is available on open stands in good garden centres. This marvellous annual costs Pounds 1.69 for 80 seeds from Unwins of Histon, Cambridge, (0945-588522) or Pounds 1.69 for 100 from Thompson and Morgan. Unwins calls it Black and White and I think T and M calls it Queen of the Veldt but the reality needs no special name - just praise for white daisy flowers with a huge, black centre. White venidium loves a dry, stony soil and opens fully in sunshine up to a height of 2-3ft. It is one of the few excellent things I have which even Sissinghurst's white garden has yet to discover - it is a marvellous new annual and does not need a blow-dryer. Seedsmen, meanwhile, are extending a silly ploy this year. Well-known forms are being given dotty names and, unless you see through the folklore, you might think your best friends have been discontinued. Perhaps Latin is no longer a language for the semi-educated but, if we are going to be sold tobacco plants called Fragrant Cloud or flax called Bright Eyes, could not the botanically-correct be reassured on the packet that the seeds are the same old Nicotiana affinis and Linum grandiflorum? I mind about these changes because both these annuals are essential buys for the summer. Fragrant Cloud is the tall, white tobacco plant which smelt heavenly when we all were children. Breeders stamped on it, though, because municipal bedders wanted compact little hummocks which would not be flattened by rain; something as wide-eyed and monotonous as clones from Pollyanna. Be warned, too: when I tried to buy more tobacco plants last May, almost everyone could offer only the dreaded Domino mix or the even more dreaded Nikki. They are municipal monsters with no stature. The new breakthrough, Pink Nikki, will also be marketed widely but it is a beastly colour fit only for politically faint-hearted councils. A few plants of the hyper-tall tobacco, Nicotiana Sylvestris, go very much further and will light up an entire garden if dotted singly around its beds. I had a crop failure last year but these white giants with thin, drooping flowers usually reach 5ft by August. The catalogue for connoisseurs is the one from Chiltern Seeds of Ulverston, Cumbria (0229-581137), which is offering an improved form of this giant tobacco called Only The Lonely. It also has the jade-green Brazilian Nicotiana langsdorfii, an essential tobacco at 2ft. While sold rarely as plants in May, it is excellent for those who want unusual plants for pots or expatriate bolt-holes. Blacks and whites seem to be riding a new wave. Thompson and Morgan is offering seeds of a remarkable new aquilegia called Magpie, with flowers that look smart enough for a button-hole in Cecil Beaton's filmed version of the Ascot races. Black and white nemophila is being marketed as Penny Black and after my success with Five Spot, its spotted companion, I think I will have to try it. To restore the balance, white cosmos daisies will have their usual run of my garden. Because they are generally sold to lazy gardeners as young plants in May, you need to order seeds now. The best is still the taller Purity, although the lists try to tell you otherwise. It is my essential companion for pots, rose beds, or anywhere which needs height up to 3ft. You see how white has crept up on me - yet, white gardeners still look to petunias and leave other white annuals to fend for themselves. I am still booking my other non-white favourites: blues like Love-in-a-Mist, deep blue phacelia and dark blue trailing lobelia, a plant of real class if you segregate it. But I am also trying to outflank the homeopaths. They have been telling us for years that evening primrose will cure anything from broken hearts to cellulite. It will now cure over-coloured borders because we can buy seed of Oenothera pallida, which is sold as Innocence. It has a slight tinge of pink, like innocence with a lush, but it is a gentle plant for placing wherever you want soft flowers throughout the summer. And this evening primrose has a virtue above all the half-hardy annuals which I have set above pseudo-wisteria: it will grow for anyone who can follow basic instructions on a packet. Never believe it is difficult to grow your own annuals. Consumers should recover their Innocence: if they choose the right ones, they will find it no more bother than vacuuming the pseudo-wisteria at 100 times the price.</p>

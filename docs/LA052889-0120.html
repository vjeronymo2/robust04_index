			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> VETERANS' HEALTH CARE FACES CUTS  </P> <P> The Department of Veterans Affairs announced Friday that it will cut some  veterans health care services because "urgently needed" funds are tied up in a  congressional battle over an emergency spending bill.  </P> <P> VA Secretary Edward Derwinski called the cutbacks "temporary" and said they  will be closely monitored. But he warned that unless the urgently needed new  funds reach the VA soon, more drastic cutbacks will follow.  </P> <P> Among the immediate steps being taken to save health care funds include a  freeze on accepting new patients whose eligibility depends on available VA  resources.  </P> <P> Except in emergencies, the agency said, veterans affected are those whose  status is not service-connected and whose incomes are above limits set by law.  </P> <P> Other actions include decreasing staff levels at VA facilities through  attrition, the agency said. It said the VA also will halt spending used to  purchase and maintain certain medical equipment and will delay the start-up of  several new projects.  </P> <P> Derwinski said the cutbacks and other cost-saving measures should keep the VA  health care facilities operating until June 15, "when we are cautiously  optimistic that the Congress will resolve its differences and provide VA with  urgently needed funds."  </P></p>

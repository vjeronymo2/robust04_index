			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Last part of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's speech at the </F> conclusion of the Ninth National Assembly's fifth session in  Hanoi on 23 June -- read by announcer]    [Text] 3. Efforts to improve administrative procedures.    Recently, the Government made public Resolution No. 38 on  improving administrative procedures a step further. The  resolution focuses on a number of domains that cause  inconvenience as well as loss of time and money, hurt the  people's feelings, and lead to serious negativism. This is a  breakthrough in the national administrative reform program.  Therefore, the people welcome the move and hope that effective  measures will be taken to implement it.    Initial research results from Hanoi Municipality and Ho Chi  Minh City indicate that because administrative procedures pose a  troublesome problem, citizens earnestly hope that urgent  measures will be taken to improve them. Let me mention a number  of examples. In Ho Chi Minh City, the establishment of a private  business organization requires 32 types of documents and 53  signatures and a waiting period lasting at least from six months  to a whole year. The application for an investment permit must  go through 13 steps and often takes two years to complete. Some  cases even take four years. In Hanoi, motorcycle registration  requires as many as 54 types of documents. The re-registration  of a state business establishment under Decree 388 costs as much  as 30 or even 100 million dong.    The government resolution on improving administrative  procedures has put forth adequate measures to organize practical  implementation. It is the government's policy to adopt urgent  and resolute measures to achieve at all costs the goal of  effecting a breakthrough in the working relations and ways of  handling affairs between state agencies themselves, between  state agencies and other units, and between state agencies and  citizens.    Therefore, ministries, sectors, administrative organs at all  levels, and state agencies are requested to carry out this  important resolution very seriously and regard its  implementation as a key task. Let National Assembly deputies  contribute suggestions and see ato it that administrative organs  at all levels, state agencies, and civil servants implement this  resolution seriously. In cases where National Assembly deputies  also work as managers, more serious measures should be taken to  implement this resolution.    4. Order and discipline in state management.    To reach socioeconomic goals, one must necessarily mention  the need for order and discipline in state management.  Regrettably, there are indications of lack of serious order and  discipline in state management and of deliberate attempts to act  at variance with the law. I want to stress the most evident  cases of failure to seriously implement regulations on fighting  corruption, smuggling, and wasteful spending. Let me mention a  number of examples. The government has issued very strict  regulations on timber exports. Nonetheless, there is no  indications that illegal timber exports have ended. A number of  provincial people's committees has legalized hundreds of  smuggled cars or reduced tax rates at their convenience. Other  provincial people's committees have claimed that their cars  should be dutyfree because they are gifts. Actually, this is  nothing but an attempt to buy cars and resell them for a profit.  In some provinces, customs officials have fixed motorcycle  import fees at their convenience and collected hundreds of  millions of dong for their agencies. Some provinces have  granted import licenses for explosives at their convenience.  Dozens of state-operated corporations have imported motorcycles  before applying for licenses, and so forth.    It is necessary to bear in mind that whatever the motives  and  even if such moves are part of collective policies, heads of the  sectors concerned and chairpersons of provincial people's  committees must bear responsibility before the government and  the prime minister of the government for violations against the  law.    Because our legal system is not perfect, continued efforts  are being made to supplement and develop it. It is not correct  to say that we have no law at all. It is worth noting that  regarding the legal system currently in effect, many sectors and  localities still fail to comply with it in a serious manner.    It is necessary to stress again that heads of sectors and  chairpersons of local people's committees must bear  responsibility before upper echelons for the observance of law  and for the restoration of order and discipline in the sectors  and localities under their charge. First of all, it is  necessary to implement very seriously regulations on finance,  the use of capital, and expenditure. Agencies and units must  discover corruption and smuggling cases on a voluntary basis.  They must also inform organs of control and inspection of those  cases so they can probe into wrongdoings and take punitive  measures, including action specified under the criminal code.  It is prohibited to retain cases of violations for internal  action because such a move will lead to injustice and cause  indignation among the masses.    Law enforcement agencies must step up inspection and  supervision. This applies first of all to the inspection system.  Immediate arrangements must be made to carry out inspection in  the sector and locality under one's charge. It is necessary to  achieve close coordination among agencies to ensure serious  implementation of laws and regulations without inconveniencing  or affecting production and business operations.    May I suggest that our National Assembly deputies step up  management and supervision and, together with cadres and  administrative organs, set a good example for other people to  follow in observing law and in ensuring order and discipline.    The above is a number of tasks that I would like to stress  one more time. May I suggest that National Assembly deputies,  leaders of the front and mass organizations, and comrades in  charge of sectors and administrative organs at all levels keep  those tasks in mind and contribute to directing their  implementation to guarantee success for our set socioeconomic  development goals.    I would like to thank and wish our National Assembly  deputies  good health.</p>

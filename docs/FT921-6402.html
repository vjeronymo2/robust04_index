			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar fails to meet promise THE dollar closed slightly below expectations yesterday in London after a volatile late session which saw it see-saw in a 1 1/2 -pfennig range. Some encouraging, if unexciting, January figures for US durable goods early in the afternoon sent the dollar through the DM1.66 barrier to DM1.6630, but optimism waned later in the day and it slipped back to DM1.6490 at one stage. It recovered slightly to end at DM1.6520/30, compared with DM1.6395 the day before. This was below what some traders had expected after the dollar's surprising rebound in the New York session on Tuesday in the face of gloomy US consumer confidence figures. Traders said that while the 1.5 per cent increase in US durable goods orders (and 3.6 per cent rise in non-defence orders) initially appeared encouraging it came from a low base the month before, and was tempered by the fifth successive decrease in the unfilled orders figures. Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank, said: 'The market has an underlying bullish sentiment towards the dollar, but was presented with unexciting economic figures for the second day running.' In New York, the dollar at midday was weaker than opening levels, although it stayed above DM1.6500. Earlier the dollar probed resistance above DM1.66 then slipped lower. By the New York close it had dipped to DM1.6458. The US unit stayed steady against the yen. In early Tokyo trade, it had briefly touched the Y130 barrier for the first time since December, but profit-taking knocked it lower to close at Y129.73. It moved in a narrow range in European trading, also reaching Y130 before closing at Y129.65. Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating's blueprint for economic recovery got a mixed reception from the markets. The Australian dollar fell  1/2 US cent amid fears that his Budget might boost inflation, now at a 27-year low of 1.5 per cent, and doubts over whether forecasts for economic growth and a return to a budget surplus could be achieved. The US currency rose to ADollars 1.3355 from Tuesday's ADollars 1.3310. The market viewed the Canadian Budget, announced late on Tuesday, more positively, and the US dollar declined to CDollars 1.1810 from a previous London close of CDollars 1.1855. The unexpected rebound in the dollar on Tuesday in New York left the D-Mark slightly weaker against other EMS currencies. Tuesday's 0.25 per cent cut in the Bank of Spain's intervention rate failed to knock the peseta off its pedestal in the EMS, and it remained near its ceiling against sterling. Traders said that as long as the strain between the peseta and sterling existed, room for the UK to make any cut in base rates would be very limited. Sterling opened at DM2.8820, up slightly from its previous close of DM2.8800. It then traded within a narrow band, firming to end at DM2.8850.</p>

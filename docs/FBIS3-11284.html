Alvarez Cambras said he had been able to hold exchanges with  Venezuelan scholars on spinal surgery and [word indistinct] in  ankle lesion surgery at the Social Security Hospital in Puerto  Ordaz.    Alvarez, who is director of Havana's Frank Pais orthopedic  teaching hospital, said he performed six operations and held a  practicum workshop during which aspects of orthopedics were  assessed. Alvarez Cambras explained that two protocols of intent  were signed: one, on exchange of information in metallurgy and  the development of orthopedic instruments and parts; the other,  with the Social Security Hospital where our doctors will go  several times a year to train specialists.</p>

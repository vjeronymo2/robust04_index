			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Data boost for small investors PRIVATE investors who want to make their own share selections often face one big problem: lack of information. While institutional investors are deluged with reports from brokers, individuals must make do with what they can glean from newspapers and specialist magazines. This week, Sharelink attempted to fill the gap by launching a range of products aimed at informing the small shareholder. Clients can choose from a number of services, including: Buy/Sell Guide. This will show the consensus recommendations of analysts on 650 companies. Companies are rated on a scale of 1-9, with 9 ranking as a strong buy and 1 as a strong sell. The cost of each report is Pounds 2.95; it is available weekly. Company reports. These give 12 pages of information on a company, including financial ratios, performance record and analysts' forecasts. The cost is Pounds 4.95 per company (more than 600 are available). Performance summary. Details for 650 companies of price, high and low for the year, price-earnings ratio and gross yield (which are in the FT every day), plus NAV per share, gearing, and performance details. This costs Pounds 4.95 and is available weekly. Telephone service. For a subscription of Pounds 30 a year, investors can get access to the latest consensus buy/sell recommendations of brokers. All of this information is useful, although some is available elsewhere: the Investor's Chronicle gives details of brokers' recommendations while financial information on companies can be obtained from their annual reports, which most will send free. (A special FT scheme, detailed on our London Share Service pages, gives access to reports from 340 companies via a phone call.) But what makes the Sharelink service so attractive is that such a wide range of information is available at a low price. If you are willing to invest Pounds 5,000 in a company, it seems worthwhile spending Pounds 4.95 to get as much information as you can before you take the plunge. Those who want more information or want to order a plan can call Sharelink (from Monday) on 021-200 4600. Alternative services may have more details but are more expensive. The Estimate Directory, published by Edinburgh Financial Publishing (which produces our table of directors' dealings), shows the individual forecasts of leading brokers for each company. It is much bulkier than Sharelink's service, weighing in at 500 pages, but information on more than 1,000 companies is available. These reports are Pounds 35 individually, while quarterly reports are Pounds 105 a year (if paid by direct debit) and monthly reports are Pounds 350. Further details from Edinburgh Financial Publishing, 1 Rothesay Terrace, Edinburgh EH3 7UP, or call 031-220 0468. A different kind of service, aimed at those investors who are frequent traders, was launched this week by FT Cityline and Hutchison Paging. The FT Cityline pager is a bleeper service which allows the investor to keep track of his portfolio. Investors can state pre-established limits for share prices on companies which they hold; if the share price breaches those limits, the bleeper will sound within a minute and a telephone number will be displayed. The investor can then ring to get more details. The 24-hour service costs Pounds 159.99 for the first year and Pounds 99 subsequently. Calls to the FT Cityline cost 48p per minute (36p off peak). For further information, ring 0800-282826.</p>

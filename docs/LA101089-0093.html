			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASEY SIEMASZKO IN 'BREAKING IN': NO TIME TO PLAY IT SAFE  </P> <P> When director Bill Forsyth was casting "Breaking In," which opens Friday, he  was having a tough time picking out an eccentric, likable actor to play Burt  Reynold's safe-cracking protege in the film. Forsyth had spent so much time  staring at 8-by-10 photographs of hopeful young actors that their faces were  turning into one glossy blur.  </P> <P> "They all started to look the same," the Scottish director said.  </P> <P> So he and his casting director drove to the 18-screen Universal City Cinemas,  bought a pair of tickets and began theater-hopping -- spending five minutes in  one theater, five minutes in the next -- hoping to find a bright new face to  star in their film.  </P> <P> "It's quite an efficient way to work," Forsyth said. "We sat down and watched a  few minutes of 'Biloxi Blues,' and one of the soldiers in the barracks was kind  of waving at me from the background."  </P> <P> The soldier was Casey Siemaszko, a 28-year-old actor with a resume of hefty  supporting roles -- as a '50s high schooler in "Back to the Future," a teen-age  gangster in "Stand By Me," a heroic soldier in "Gardens of Stone" and the cocky  pugilist in "Young Guns." He even had his own starring role, as a nerdy  underdog in a showdown with a brutish bully in the stylish comedy "Three  O'Clock High."  </P> <P> Impressed, Forsyth set up an appointment with Siemaszko at the Chateau Marmont,  where they met for the first time in the hotel's garden. After spending a few  minutes talking over the script, Forsyth excused himself to take a phone call.  </P> <P> "When I came back, Casey had climbed up this wall and was halfway up a tree,  looking out over traffic," Forsyth said, incredulously. "I never figured out if  this was just a thing he did, or if he was showing me that he could climb walls  because he knew the character had to do things like that."  </P> <P> Siemaszko is not sure why he climbed the tree, or if he really did.  </P> <P> "I was really nervous, you know," Siemaszko said recently during an interview  in the garden of the Sunset Marquis, just down the Sunset Strip from the  Chateau Marmont. "After reading the script, I knew that I wanted the part. Bill  (Forsyth) left me alone in that garden, and I was like . . . 'This is taking  too long. I got to do something.' " He paused absently. "Apparently, I climbed  a tree. I don't even remember. I mean, I think I did."  </P> <P> In "Breaking In," Reynolds plays an aging pro who cracks safes for a living.  Siemaszko breaks into houses only to read the mail, raid the refrigerator and  maybe watch some TV. When the two go bump in the night on the same job,  Reynolds cuts Siemaszko in on half his take, explaining, "I would rather have a  partner than a witness."  </P> <P> "Hopefully, this role will demonstrate that I'm capable of drawing out of  myself to create totally different characters," Siemaszko said. "That's what my  idea of acting is all about. It's the ability to draw out of that little file  inside of you, beef up certain aspects of yourself that aren't there, and tone  down certain aspects that come on too strong."  </P> <P> Siemaszko has a working man's sensibility about acting: "Work hard, persevere  and everything will fall into place." He says that simple work ethic is rooted  in his Polish upbringing in the Northwest side of Chicago, where as a kid he  would ride his bike to nearby Wrigley Field, shinny up a drain pipe and watch  the Cubs.  </P> <P> "I'm a product of the Polish artistic community," said Siemaszko, who speaks  Polish fluently. "There are a number of professional artists who have been  displaced from Poland for various political and economic reasons. The natural  place for them to get rolling was in the Polish community because their  language and culture was understood there. I grew up surrounded by some of  Poland's top artists."  </P> <P> Siemaszko, who refined his skills with a college acting degree, made his  performance debut when he was 5 on stage with The Kosciuszko Dancers, a  folk-dancing group headed by his father, an instructor in Polish dance and  culture. Growing up, Siemaszko acted in the Ref-Ren Theatre, a Polish community  theater, and for a while sang with three girls in a quartet. "That was before  my voice changed," he said with a grin.  </P> <P> "But my first professional job was with the Illinois State Lottery. I promoted  them on the fair circuit out on the corn and bean fields of Illinois. I  juggled, played guitar, made balloon animals and said" -- he barked out -- "  'Lottery! Gotta' get ya' lottery tickets!' I kind of liked saying that."  </P> <P> Siemaszko, who reprises his role as one of Michael J. Fox's buddies in the  sequel to "Back to the Future," hopes one day to land a role that will allow  him to use up his whole bag of performing-arts tricks, which includes singing,  dancing, clowning, juggling, riding a unicycle and playing several musical  instruments. "I'm a jack of all trades and master of none," he said. "But give  me enough time and I can get any of them to performance level. I'd love to do  Jimmy Cagney because he was able to show everything, from romance to street  smarts."  </P> <P> With "Breaking In," Siemaszko added a new skill to his cache: the art of  busting safes. One of the film's technical advisers was a gentlemanly ex-safe  cracker who instructed Reynolds and Siemaszko in the peculiarities of his  trade.  </P> <P> "What is acting to me?" Siemaszko said, echoing the question put to him.  "Therapy! Therapy!" He laughed and quieted down.  </P> <P> "It satisfies my curiosities. When I'm on the set I'm always asking questions.  I don't ever want to lose the part of me that is curious, the part of me that  is a little boy."  </P></p>

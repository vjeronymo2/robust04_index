			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / People: TSB's Smallwood joins Makinson Cowell Christopher Smallwood, 46, the TSB's strategic development director and Sunday Express columnist, is on the move again. He is becoming a partner in Makinson Cowell, the City investor relations firm which helped Lasmo defeat Enterprise Oil's unwelcome takeover bid last week. Smallwood fills a slot left by John Makinson, one of the founders of the five year-old firm, who was appointed managing director of the Financial Times earlier this year. Smallwood will be one of four client partners who each look after half a dozen big companies. Smallwood, who is also the TSB's chief economist, differs from the rest of the partners in that he does not have a stockbroking background. He started out as an Oxford academic and joined the Cabinet Office when Harold Wilson was prime minister. He then moved to the Treasury as an economics adviser, followed by two years as policy director of the now defunct Social Democratic Party, before joining BP Finance International as head of financial strategy. He was economics editor of the Sunday Times between 1986 and 1989. When Smallwood joined the TSB five years ago it was intent on becoming a broadly-based financial services group. However, the group has reversed its acquisitive strategy and is now concentrating on just two core businesses, retail banking and insurance. Having completed his task of helping refocus the TSB's strategy Smallwood says it is time to move on. Archie Kane, 42, director of operations at the TSB's retail bank, will take over as the TSB's head of strategic development when he leaves in September.</p>

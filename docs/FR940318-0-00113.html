			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Restrict Only Those Substitutes That are Significantly Worse <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a corollary to the above point, EPA does not intend to restrict a substitute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if it poses only marginally greater risk than another substitute. Drawing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fine distinctions concerning the acceptability of substitutes would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extremely difficult given the variability in how each substitute can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used within a specific application and the resulting uncertainties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surrounding potential health and environmental effects. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also does not want to intercede in the market's choice of available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes, unless a substitute has been proposed or is being used that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly more harmful to human health and the environment than other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Evaluate Risks by Use <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 612 requires that substitutes be evaluated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by use. Environmental and human health exposures can vary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly depending on the particular application of a substitute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the risk characterizations must be designed to represent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differences in the environmental and human health effects associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with diverse uses. This approach cannot, however, imply fundamental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tradeoffs with respect to different types of risk to either the environment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or to human health. For example, in the Agency's consideration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> global warming as a criterion under SNAP, EPA has principally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared different global warming gases among themselves, as opposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to attempting to establish some methodology for comparing directly the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of global warming and ozone depletion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Provide the Regulated Community With Information as Soon as Possible <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency recognizes the need to provide the regulated community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with information on the acceptability of various substitutes as soon as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible. Given this need, EPA has decided to expedite the review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process by conducting initial risk screens for the major substitutes now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known to the Agency and to include them in this final rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Future determinations on the acceptability of new substitutes will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in quarterly updates to the SNAP lists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Do Not Endorse Products Manufactured by Specific Companies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the goal of the SNAP program is to identify acceptable substitutes, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency will not issue company-specific product endorsements. In many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, the Agency may base its analysis on data received on individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products, but the addition of a substitute to the acceptable list based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that analysis does not represent endorsement of that company's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. Generally, placement on the list merely constitutes an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acknowledgement that a particular product made by a company has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found to be acceptable under SNAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Defer to Other Environmental Regulations When Warranted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In some cases, EPA and other federal agencies have developed extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations under other statutes or other parts of the CAA that address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any potential cross- or inter-media transfers that may result from the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of alternatives to class I and II substances. For example, ceasing to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an ozone-depleting compound may in some cases entail increased use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals that contribute to tropospheric air pollution. These chemicals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or hazardous air pollutants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (HAPs), are already regulated under other sections of the CAA, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations under the SNAP program will take these existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations into account. Where necessary, the Office of Air and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Radiation will confer with other EPA program offices or federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to ensure that any regulatory overlap is handled efficiently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Implementation Strategy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation of the SNAP program is directed towards fulfilling the general policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in section 612 of identifying substitutes that can serve as replacements for ozone depleting substances, evaluating their effects on human health and the environment, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encouraging the use of those substitutes believed to present lower overall risks relative both to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ozone depleting compounds being replaced and to other substitutes available for the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end-use. Implementation of this policy involves four key activities. The first is to develop,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgate, and administer a regulatory program for identifying and evaluating substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second activity is to undertake a review of the existing substitutes based on criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established for the program and then to publish a list of acceptable and unacceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes by application. The third activity is to review additional substitutes as they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed to allow their timely introduction into the marketplace. The fourth is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggressively disseminate information about those substitutes found to pose lower overall risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through a clearinghouse and outreach program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To expedite implementation of the SNAP program, EPA has not only developed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening process for examining the alternatives, as discussed in this final rule, but has also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed an analysis of many key substitutes based on the criteria presented here. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IX summarizes the results of this assessment. More detail on the steps leading up to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule and the implementation of the SNAP program is given below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. ANPRM and Request for Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 16, 1992, EPA published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  an Advance Notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) and Request for Data (57 FR 1984). The ANPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in general terms EPA's plans for developing the SNAP program and solicited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment on the Agency's planned approach. The ANPRM also included an appendix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing substitutes that the Agency planned to include in its initial substitute determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ANPRM invited industry to submit information on these substitutes and to identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional alternatives to be considered in the SNAP program. The Agency received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately one hundred comments from industry, trade groups, and other federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These comments contained information on potential substitutes for ozone-depleting chemicals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as comments on the SNAP program as described in the ANPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

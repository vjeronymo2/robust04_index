			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MASTERCARD AND VISA WILL HALT DEBIT CARD BID  </P> <P> Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Mastercard International have agreed to terminate a  national debit card venture to settle charges they conspired to dominate the  market, a group of state attorneys general announced today.  </P> <P> An antitrust suit by 14 states claimed that because Visa and Mastercard members  include virtually every major U.S. bank, their joint development of the  so-called Entree debit card network constituted an attempt to create a monopoly  in the emerging "point-of-sale" debit card industry.  </P> <P> A debit card can be presented at stores like a credit card, but the money is  automatically deducted from the cardholder's account and transferred to the  merchant.  </P> <P> The suit, filed June 26 in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, alleged that Visa  and Mastercard tried to undermine the debit card competition by gaining control  of the nation's two largest automatic teller machine networks.  </P> <P> The two networks, Cirrus System Inc. of Downers Grove., Ill., and Plus System  Inc. of Denver, had been formulating their own plans for national debit card  networks in the early and mid-1980s.  </P> <P> Visa also took over the Interlink Network, based in San Mateo, Calif., the  nation's largest regional debit card network.  </P> <P> Visa and Mastercard began developing Entree in 1986, but the venture has not  yet begun operation.  </P> <P> Robert Abrams, New York state attorney general, said in a news release that the  two companies had been engaged in a "creeping merger" that had already resulted  in largely uniform pricing in the credit card industry.  </P> <P> "The two corporations have virtually the same members and rate structures," he  said. "With Entree, Visa and Mastercard would have taken the crucial step of  jointly marketing a debit card, which most observers expect to be a dominant  form of payment in the 'cashless' society of the future. This had to be  stopped. . . . "  </P> <P> The states that filed suit were Arizona, California, Connecticut, Louisiana,  Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,  Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.  </P> <P> Under terms of the settlement signed today by U.S. District Judge Pierre N.  Laval in Manhattan, Visa and Mastercard will abandon Entree and notify bank  participants that it will be terminated by Oct. 1.  </P></p>

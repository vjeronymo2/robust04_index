			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Omens suggest recovery may be starting in US A SHARP rise in the index of leading indicators and a jump in home sales yesterday signalled that the early stages of a US economic recovery could be under way. The composite index of leading indicators rose 0.9 per cent in January to register its first big rise since last July. Sales of new homes rose 12.9 per cent in January to an annual rate of 622,000, the highest level for nearly two years. Both indicators were considerably stronger than most analysts expected. Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, was again cautiously optimistic in congressional testimony. He pointed to a 'few hopeful signs' that the economy was reviving but warned that prospects were still highly uncertain. Rising share prices provided much of the impetus behind the recovery in leading indicators. But the rise also reflected strength in orders for plant, equipment and consumer goods, a rise in building permits, and faster growth of the money supply. Leading indicators for November and December were revised to show declines of only 0.2 per cent in each month, rather than 0.3 per cent as previously calculated. Last year, the index of leading indicators began rising about three months before the economy staged a partial recovery from recession. Yesterday's figures, however, showed a sharp 1 per cent fall in the composite index of coincident indicators, which track the current state of the economy. The fourth monthly decline in the coincident indicators suggests the economy has been experiencing a second economic dip. Home sales in January were running about 20 per cent above the level of last summer and about 50 per cent higher than in January last year, which was artificially depressed by the Gulf crisis. The improvement reflected falls in mortgage rates following successive interest rate cuts by the Fed. Last month's increase, however, was heavily concentrated in the mid-west and, to a lesser extent, the south. Home sales rose only fractionally in the west and not at all in the depressed north-east. Yesterday's encouraging figures follow news of an unexpected surge last month in the purchasing managers' index. This index is a closely-followed barometer of industrial conditions.</p>

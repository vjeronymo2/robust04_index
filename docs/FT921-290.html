			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Lamonts stand up for their namesake: Conservatives switch from 'negative campaign' but hit at Labour public sector plans MR NORMAN LAMONT may be having a less than scintillating election campaign, but he is winning the vote of the Lamont clan. In an informal FT poll of small companies which carry the Lamont name, only one in three said it hoped to see a new chancellor after the election. Several said their businesses have been helped by being called Lamont, in spite of the chancellor's association with the deep recession, and his relatively poor image among directors of big companies. The 20 companies in the poll are linked by the Lamont name but operate in a range of sectors. Even though most of the people quizzed are Tory supporters, many admitted to hard times in the recession and were unhappy with the party's economic record. However, Mr Lamont did much better in the poll than in an earlier FT survey of directors of big companies. Only 39 per cent of these said they wanted to see him continue in office, with 46 per cent preferring Labour's Mr John Smith as chancellor. Just seven of the small company representatives wanted to see Mr Lamont replaced, while 11 favoured him and two were undecided. Eleven said they would vote Tory, with six for an opposition party and three undecided. Among supporters of the chancellor is Mr Alan Lamont, director of Lamont Clamping Systems, of St Ives near Cambridge, which sells woodworking equipment. 'He is a rather dour individual, but I have no grounds for thinking that he is any worse at his job than anyone else,' he said. Another backer is Miss Alison Lamont, who runs Lamont for Beauty, a beauty parlour in Diss, Norfolk. She liked the Budget, which she said would give people 'more money in their pay packets for treatments like mine'. Mr Gordon Lamb, proprietor of Lamont Interiors, a builder in Farnborough, Hampshire, hoped Mr Lamont would continue as chancellor, although he said: 'He should admit he has made mistakes; he should say, 'OK, I've copped it'.' Lamont Holdings, a six-person London telecommunications company, has gained through its association with the chancellor's name, according to Mr Alex Covell, a director. 'It has been a form of advertising,' he said. Mr Albert Lamont, a tailor in Carrickfergus in Northern Ireland, said he was 'very lucky' to share the chancellor's name. Mr Graham Lamont, a chartered accountant in Workington, Cumbria, has cashed in on the Lamont association. For the past two years, he has organised a 'Budget breakfast' for clients the day after Mr Lamont has presented his Budget to parliament. In contrast, Mr Charlie Doran, manager at Lamont City Farm, in Erskine, west of Glasgow, is a Labour supporter, and no fan of the chancellor. 'The words I would use to describe Mr Lamont are not printable,' he said. Mr John Lamont, who farms 450 acres near Elgin, Moray, said the chancellor had weak presentational skills. 'I would like to see him replaced. I would buy a used car from John Smith, but I wouldn't buy one from Norman Lamont,' he said.</p>

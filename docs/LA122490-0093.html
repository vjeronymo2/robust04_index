			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY 1990-1991 RESOLUTIONS  </P> <P> "I resolve to maintain our single-family neighborhoods. We have to learn say no  to developers and I have.  </P> <P> We have got to maintain our quality of life - if not, people are not going to  want to live here. I also resolve in 1991 to hire more police officers. There  is a special initiative in March and I hope and pray that it is successful. As  the major I will also work to get my other council members to help settle the  Angels' lawsuits and to make sure the sports arena construction goes on time."  </P></p>

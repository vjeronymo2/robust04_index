			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / League table of student debt University students from Scotland who graduated this year were the most solvent, a survey by Barclays Bank has found. The Scots owed an average Pounds 900, partly because Scottish parents were the most likely to pay their formal contribution, with 77 per cent doing so in full, and because a high proportion of Scottish students attend a local university and live at home. The survey found students from the Midlands and north-west and north England accumulated the heaviest debts. Midlands students who graduated this year accumulated average debt of Pounds 2,371. Comparable figures for other regions are Pounds 1,907 in the north-west, Pounds 1,837 in the north and Pounds 1,479 in London.</p>

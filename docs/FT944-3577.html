			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Vietnam in deal over US embassy The former US embassy in Saigon, once the scene of frantic efforts by staff to evacuate Americans by helicopter as North Vietnamese tanks smashed their way into the city in 1975, has become the centrepiece of diplomatic moves of a rather different nature. The cheerless white structure in central Saigon, now known more commonly as Ho Chi Minh City, is one of 36 US government buildings in the city whose fate has been decided under an agreement between Vietnam and the US. The deal, details of which were not revealed, took 11 months to negotiate and included a decision on the future of the former South Vietnamese embassy in Washington, which occupies a prime site not far from the White House. The US embassy building in Saigon is just down the road from the presidential palace in the city's bustling centre. Its current tenant is Vietnam's state oil agency, and its peeling facade remains in much the same state as it was at the end of the Vietnam war. However, there are plans for two large hotels backed by foreign investment on the opposite side of the street and the site itself has attracted attention from developers. 'It's an interesting piece of real estate,' said one Vietnam-based US businessman. 'That's going to be the most interesting strip in Saigon.' US State Department officials say this clears the way for the opening of diplomatic liaison offices in the two countries' capitals by the end of the year, a target set by Hanoi and an important step in establishing full relations. President Bill Clinton removed the US trade embargo in February, but settling the issue of outstanding governmental and commercial claims had to come before any initiative on closer relations, Hanoi-based US officials say. Commercial assets seized by victorious communist forces and worth about Dollars 230m include offices owned by US banks such as Citibank and Chase Manhattan, as well as insurer American International Group. Caterpillar, the construction equipment maker, estimates that hundreds of its earth-moving vehicles are still in use in the southern part of the country. Diplomats say agreements on commercial assets would be settled shortly, although this has not held up US banks' moves into Vietnam. Chase Manhattan last week received approval to open a representative office in Hanoi. Citibank and Bank of America were awarded full branches for Hanoi late last month. It is unclear what will become of the former US mission building, as US diplomatic representation will be focused on the capital Hanoi. The last job handled by US diplomats in Saigon was to try to co-ordinate the evacuation of the city's few remaining Americans and some Vietnamese from the building's rooftop. The operation quickly dissolved into a panicked struggle for places on departing helicopters. An Air America official was pictured punching one Vietnamese clutching at a helicopter footplate as it was taking off. Reuter adds: Vietnam's central bank said it had appointed Bank of Tokyo and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group as advisers on the restructuring of the country's medium- and long-term commercial bank debt.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Racism row continues DELEGATES approved an emergency motion calling on all local parties to campaign against racists and urged Liberal Democrat councillors to seek the eviction of proven racists from council housing and their dismissal from council employment. Mr Akbar Ali, from the Mossley Hill local party in Liverpool, said accusations of racism against Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets had been 'conveniently forgotten' in the past. He said the issue had been 'simmering' for seven years and in spite of a promised investigation by Sir David Steel, the former Liberal leader, no action had been taken. 'This time we won't allow this matter to be brushed under the carpet,' he said.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Austria optimistic on EU European Union membership on January 1 1995 for Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden, is 'an ambitious but feasible' target, provided all parties are fully committed to the negotiations, Mr Wolfgang Schussel, Austria's economy minister, said in Vienna yesterday, writes Patrick Blum in Vienna. This will require completing EU entry negotiations by March 1, to allow enough time for the European parliament to approve the four countries' membership before European elections due in June. For Austria, keeping to the timetable is especially important because the country must hold a referendum on membership in July at the latest. This is to avoid a clash with the general election scheduled in October.</p>

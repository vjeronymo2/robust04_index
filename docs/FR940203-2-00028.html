The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the applicability of the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines water dependency provisions (40 CFR 230.10(a)) to the cultivation of cranberries, in light of Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulations at 33 CFR 323.4(a)(1)(iii)(C)(1) (ii) and (iii), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations at 40 CFR 232.3(d)(3)(i) (B) and (C). These sections of the Corps and EPA regulations state, among other things, that cranberries are a wetland crop, and that some discharges associated with cranberry production are considered exempt from regulation under the provisions of section 404(f) of the Clean Water Act. The characterization of cranberries as a wetland crop has led to inconsistency in determining if cranberry production is a water dependent activity as defined in the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (Guidelines). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The intent of Corps regulations at 33 CFR 320.4(b) and of the Guidelines is to avoid the unnecessary destruction or alteration of waters of the U.S., including wetlands, and to compensate for the unavoidable loss of such waters. The Guidelines specifically required that ``no discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if there is a practicable alternative to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem, so long as the alternative does not have other significant adverse environmental consequences'' (see 40 CFR 230.10(a)). Based on this provision, an evaluation is required in every case for use of non-aquatic areas and other aquatic sites that would result in less adverse impact to the aquatic ecosystem, irrespective of whther the discharge site is a special aquatic site or whether the activity associated with the discharge is water dependent. A permit cannot be issued, therefore, in circumstances where an environmentally preferable practicable alternative for the proposed discharge exists (except as provided for under section 404(b)(2)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. For proposed discharges into wetlands and other ``special acquatic sites,'' the Guidelines alternatives analysis requirement further considers whether the activity associated with the proposed discharge is ``water dependent''. The Guidelines define water dependency in terms of an activity requiring access or proximity to or siting within a special aquatic site to fulfill its basic project purpose. Special aquatic sites (as defined in 40 CFR 230.40&hyph;230.45) are: (1) Sanctuaries and refuges; (2) wetlands; (3) mud flats; (4) vegetated shallows; (5) coral reefs; and (6) riffle and pool complexes. If an activity is determined not to be water dependent, the Guidelines establish the follow two presumptions (40 CFR 230.10(a)(3)) that the applicant is required to rebut before satisfying the alternatives analysis requirements: <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

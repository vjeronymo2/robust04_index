			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Uzice, Serbia, May 26 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb  Republic (RS) President Radovan Karadzic said on Thursday [26  May] that a new peace conference should focus solely on  territorial issues because political solutions have already been  reached -- the United States has created a Muslim-Croat  federation, and the Serbs their own state. We have a solution  and our own state. We are willing to discuss territories but on  condition that the sanctions are lifted and a peace established,  Karadzic said in an interview to Uzice paper VESTI. He added  that these two states should immediately be recognized.    Commenting diplomatic moves for speeding up the peace  process, Karadzic underscored that the Serb side had told Cyrus  Vance, Lord David Owen and Vitaliy Churkin that, if they want to  succeed, they should coordinate their efforts with the Serbs'  interests. He said that a new peace conference can succeed only  if a solution is not imposed on the Serbs. The end of the war  is close because our enemies have tried everything and have  clearly faced their own powerlessness, Karadzic said and added  that this powerlessness clashed with the legitimate and  justified will of the Serb people and their centuries-old wish  to finally set up their own state.    Karadzic believes that the next moves of the Muslim-Croat  side will be a new offensive out of one of the `safe areas' --  Tuzla or Bihac. We will defend ourselves for a time, then we  will publically warn them, as in the case of Gorazde, and openly  say that we will launch a counteroffensive in which case they  will start wailing and the entire world will then try to save  them and create their state, Karadzic said.</p>

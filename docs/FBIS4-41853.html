			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 29 Jun -- "During this tour I am pursuing  two main goals: first, to meet villagers and Moscow Oblast  residents, to get a feel of their everyday lives, as it were,  and second, to discuss conversion issues with the directors of  the defense industry." This is how Russian President Boris  Yeltsin, who was visiting the Soyuz Research and Production  Association, described the purpose of his one-day tour of Moscow  Oblast.    Boris Yeltsin said the Russian economy is stabilizing. He  corroborated his words by citing the inflation rate, which has  been maintained at 8-9 percent a month over the past five  months. Price rises in June were 5.5 percent. Moreover,  Yeltsin said, the fall in industrial output slowed down in June.  "The economy is gradually leveling up, and by the end of the  year we expect to have a stable rate of inflation of 5-6 percent  a month," he noted.    The Russian president believes the "political situation in  society is stabilizing, and the Treaty on Social Accord is  really working." In view of this, he called for support for the  presidential decree on the fight against crime.    After examining the products manufactured at the Soyuz  Research and Production Association, Boris Yeltsin is to visit  the Nikolo-Ugresh monastery.</p>

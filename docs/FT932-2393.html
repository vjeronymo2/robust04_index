			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading FADING hopes of a reduction in interest rates dominated the day's trading in Footsie futures, ahead of today's expiry, writes Joel Kibazo. On its last full day of trading, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened strongly at 2,890, just above Wednesday's closing level. A rally to 2,897 in the first hour soon ran out of steam as traders concentrated instead on today's expiry and the rolling forward of positions into the September contract, which becomes the market leader on Monday. The late-morning release of favourable economic data on employment and inflation should have cheered the market but was instead seen as indicating that there would be no reduction in rates - at least in the UK. June continued to decline and fell further when there was no rate cut announcement from the Bundesbank early in the afternoon. The continued drift of the contract brought it to the day's low of 2,874 at around 3.30pm, when it traded at a discount to the cash market. The June contract ended at 2,878, down 11 from its previous close and at a three-point premium to cash. Volume in the June future was 7,876 lots and in the September contract 4,688. In traded options, total turnover was 29,158, slightly below Wednesday's figure. The FT-SE 100 option traded 6,141 lots and the Euro FT-SE 1,844.</p>

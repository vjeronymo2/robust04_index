			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Letter: Banks have variety of options to avoid introducing charges Sir, Having worked for one of the largest banks until last year, and as a still captive customer of that bank, I think creditworthy bank customers should bear in mind a few points that weren't in your otherwise reasoned article 'A charge that's set to shock' (February 9). First, it is misleading to suggest that pressure to reintroduce charges has been caused by the fall in the base rate. The level of the base rate is not as important to the banks as lending margins, since a bank's assets comprise mainly of personal and commercial lending. While rates of interest paid to depositors have fallen, rates for borrowers have been sticky downwards, through lenders' delays in adjusting rates and because many borrowers pay high fixed-interest rates, fixed when the base rate was twice its present level. Even variable rate loans are usually subject to a minimum interest rate, below which the effect of base rate falls are not passed on to the customer. Banks' margins are probably higher now than when base rate was above 10 per cent. On the other hand, the banks have not done enough to rationalise their cost bases. Consequently, too large a part of bank charges is required to fund overheads. If Marks and Spencer, with some 300 branches, can provide retail services used on occasion by a majority of the population, why do the top banks still need to maintain thousands of branches? Too little has been invested in information technology to increase efficiency. The banks could avoid introducing across-the-board fees, which would prove most unpopular, by charging for certain services. The logical extension of the banks' joint campaigns to encourage use of Switch and direct debits would be to introduce charges on cheques. This would go some way to offsetting the cost of each cheque processed (about 70 pence). 'Free' banking could also be linked to the sales of other products and services, without compromising standards, since none of the main banks (and only three building societies) now normally offer independent financial advice.

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Pioneer's half-term profits fall to ADollars 71.5m PIONEER International, the Australian building products and petroleum group, yesterday announced a 20 per cent fall in interim net profit to ADollars 71.5m (USDollars 49m), and warned that full-year profit was likely to fall sharply. Mr Rodney Price, chief executive, said the result for the six months to the end of December was 'quite commendable' in the light of tough trading conditions in Australia, the UK and Spain. Mr Price said the 'subdued' outlook for the second half indicated that profit for the full year would fall well short of the record level of ADollars 178m in 1991-92. However, the board maintained the interim dividend at 7.5 cents, franked to 35 per cent, and indicated that the longstanding policy of maintaining dividend payments would continue. Operating revenue was steady at ADollars 2.6bn. Pioneer said pre-tax profit from its building materials businesses fell by 31 per cent to ADollars 82.5m. Building materials profit in Australia fell by 20 per cent to ADollars 47m. Profit from European operations fell by half to ADollars 24m, mainly because of recession in the UK and a downturn in Spain following the Olympic Games. Asian profit fell to ADollars 600,000, mostly because of uncertainty in Hong Kong. Pioneer said Ampol, its wholly-owned petroleum subsidiary, suffered a 19 per cent fall in profit to ADollars 88m. Higher sales were offset by poor refining margins and renewed retail petrol discounting. The group said it would retain a ADollars 43m investment in Westpac, the Australian bank, which hit the group's share price after it was revealed last year. Pioneer said it stood to make a profit of ADollars 10m on the investment at current share prices. Pioneer shares fell 9 cents on the Australian Stock Exchange to ADollars 2.36.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Japan's UN peace-keeping bill reaches its last stage A CONTROVERSIAL bill to permit Japanese troops to join United Nations peace-keeping missions was due to enter its final stage of Diet deliberations today. The bill was approved by the Diet's upper house early yesterday by a vote of 137 to 102 after filibustering by opposition parties forced the chamber to hold four exhausting all-night sessions. Although sometimes bordering on farce, the Diet's deliberations have highlighted the deep concerns evoked by the bill about a possible infringement of Japan's pacifist constitution. The opposition Social Democratic party finally abandoned its delaying tactics out of consideration for the health of some of its elderly members and for public protests about wasting taxpayers' money. However, the smaller communist party continued filibustering to the bitter end. Both parties have pledged to fight the bill when it returns to the lower house today for the deliberation of amendments. The lower house passed the original bill last December but it has since been watered down in a vain attempt to accommodate opposition party views. The ruling Liberal Democratic party is confident that the bill will be passed before the Diet ends on June 21 even though opposition party officials vowed to block the measure. Party officials have threatened to call a general election if the legislation fails. It would be held at the same time as an election for upper house seats due in June. The LDP often does well in such a 'double election' because it has more money than the opposition so can more easily fund the extra campaigning. The opposition parties say they would welcome a general election in order to put the peace-keeping forces bill to the people. There is an element of bluff on both sides - some senior officials in both the LDP and opposition parties are against wasting valuable funds on an unnecessary double election. The bill would allow the government to despatch 2,000 troops to serve on United Nations peace-keeping missions. At the insistence of the opposition, Japanese participation will be limited to support roles. Japanese servicemen will be allowed to carry out combat duties only if the Diet revises the bill on a future occasion. Even then, every despatch of troops would be subject to a Diet veto. Meanwhile, the delays over the bill have placed in jeopardy the plans of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to attend the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Mr Miyazawa, who was due to travel to Rio this weekend, may be unable to leave Tokyo if problems emerge in the lowerhouse. Nor will Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, be able to deputise for the prime minister, either in Rio or in the Diet. Mr Watanabe has been rushed into hospital for emergency treatment for gall stones. See Editorial Comment</p>

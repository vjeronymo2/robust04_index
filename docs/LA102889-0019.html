			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CAPTAIN SEEKS ELECTION WAIVER FROM SHERIFF -- AGAIN  </P> <P> Jim Roache, a San Diego County sheriff's captain, said he delivered a second  request Friday to Sheriff John Duffy, asking him to set aside a department  policy that says he must resign before he can challenge Duffy in next year's  election.  </P> <P> And he threatened legal action if Duffy does not respond to his requests by the  middle of next week.  </P> <P> "That's the most likely alternative I would select," Roache said of a potential  lawsuit against his boss.  </P> <P> Roache wants Duffy to waive a Sheriff's Department policy that prohibits staff  members from running against the incumbent sheriff. He said the policy violates  his constitutional rights to run for office and Duffy, in the spirit of fair  elections, should allow him to join two other potential contenders in mounting  a campaign against the longtime veteran sheriff.  </P> <P> Under the existing policy, Roache would have to resign his captain's position  to run against Duffy.  </P> <P> Roache sent Duffy a written request last month.  </P> <P> Roache said he is particularly concerned because, without an answer from Duffy,  he may be losing ground in early fund-raising and other political spadework  needed to wage a campaign.  </P> <P> "Your recent political fund-raising activities and increased visibility at  public events demonstrates that you realize that a countywide election requires  significant time and early preparation," Roache said in his second letter to  Duffy.  </P> <P> "Consequently, I need an immediate answer."  </P> <P> He said he "would appreciate a response within three working days."  </P> <P> "At that time, if I have not received a reply, I will assume your answer must  be negative, and I will consider pursuing whatever alternatives that may  exist," the letter stated.  </P> <P> He added that a lawsuit asking a judge to overturn the policy would be his next  step.  </P> <P> But Duffy, questioned about the matter Thursday, said "the legal research isn't  finished yet" into Roache's request. He said the policy has been around since  1850 and the matter is a complicated legal one that must be reviewed before he  can decide how to proceed.  </P></p>

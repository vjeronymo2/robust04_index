			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): Costs and salesmen under scrutiny - The product has a place in government strategy, but a way needs to be found to protect accrued benefits from a collapse in the value of equities at the moment of retirement PERSONAL PENSIONS, with over 5m plan holders, have helped Britain's insurance industry through a recession that has seen a sharp drop in sales of other long-term savings products. More significantly, they have become a critical part of long-term government strategy - an alternative to expensive social security provision. Options under consideration include tax incentives to encourage individuals to opt out of the state basic pension scheme in favour of personal plans. Ministers are also said to have quietly discussed the possibility of replacing the earnings-related elements of state social security provision with personal pension-type arrangements, producing a lump sum on retirement. On the other hand, the government seems to be restructuring tax advantages for pensions in other ways. For instance, for the current fiscal year it has frozen the maximum amount that high earners can contribute towards their pension each year. It has also reduced the amount of advance corporation tax paid on dividends, which occupational schemes are allowed to reclaim from the Treasury. Other European governments continue to envy Britain the success of her personal pensions industry, and are adapting versions of it in their battle to hold down social security costs. Yet at home, the virtues of personal pensions have undergone close scrutiny from regulators, the financial press and public policy think-tanks. The question is whether this will slow the pace of sales, or force the industry to rethink the way it has designed the product. The antics of salesmen, who profited by persuading redundant coal miners to opt out of their attractive occupational scheme and into a less beneficial personal pension, for instance, have put pressure on financial services regulators to get tough. Paul Trickett, secretary to the Mineworkers Pension Scheme, said that over Pounds 400m had been transferred out of the scheme and into personal pensions in the past two years: 'We estimate that sales agents have earned some Pounds 20m in commissions from coal miners (in that time).' Such reports have prompted regulators to issue guidelines on the sale of personal pensions, under which occupational scheme members are for the most part off-limits. Meanwhile, the costs of personal pensions have also come under public examination. A report by the left-of-centre Institute for Public Policy Research, for instance, recently showed that the cost of administering schemes was roughly four times the figure for state schemes - a level sufficiently high to discourage reliance on personal schemes as an alternative to state benefit. Even the Department of Social Security, which has championed personal pensions, is concerned. Earlier this year, it told the the self-regulatory bodies that oversee the sale of personal pensions to ensure that firms properly advise policyholders of the effects of changes to tax law. The changes, which will curtail the National Insurance rebates offered to personal pension holders who opt out of the State Earnings-related Pension Scheme (Serps), could cause many of those clients to discontinue or abandon their contributions, cutting profits for life insurance companies. Also, industry data suggest that as much as a half to two-thirds of personal pension plans in Britain are 'rebate only'. This means that the only contribution made into them is the NI rebate, and implies that little additional long-term saving has been prompted by the government's massive expenditure. Anne Widdecombe, pensions minister until the Cabinet reshuffle in May, admits that the data are causing unease in government circles. Moreover, the government has curbed some of the tax advantages to those who opt out of Serps via a personal pension from this April, and has said that it will overhaul the system from April 1996. Miss Widdecombe has said that the government plans a system of age-related rebates of NI contributions, in place of the current flat-rate rebate system. At the moment, relatively large rebates to young people enable them to buy more benefits for themselves with a private pension than they could if they remained in Serps. But by the time individuals reach their mid-40s the rebates are too small to be attractive, and policyholders would be well advised to opt back into Serps, curbing the cost savings to the taxpayer. Earlier this year, the government's own actuary produced figures showing that rebates will have to fall steadily during the next decade; so that, by early in the new century, NI rebates will be too small to encourage any but those under 30 years of age to opt out of Serps. The prospect of changes in tax structure could force the industry to abandon sales efforts aimed at younger people, and concentrate on older workers, who will have a much larger tax allowance to invest in a personal pension scheme. The rethinking of sales tactics is but one of the challenges facing the industry. 'The greatest shortcoming in personal pensions is the volatility in the final value of the pension,' said Stewart Ritchie, pensions director at Scottish Equitable. These values generally rise and fall with stock market prices, and those who retire in a bear market may be badly off. High on the agenda is the need to devise an investment strategy that protects accrued benefits from a collapse in the value of equities - the largest asset sector - shortly before an individual's retirement date. 'Consider two people whose retirement is separated by Black Monday of October 1987,' said Ron Spill, director of pensions at Legal and General. 'The difference in the value of their pensions is 20 per cent.' If personal pensions, or other individual provision, are to become the bedrock of government social security policy, then those who sponsor the plans will have to find ways to build in the kind of security offered by employers' defined-benefit schemes. Indeed, Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, has called for personal pensions to guarantee a minimum level of benefit on retirement. Such a guarantee would require a re-think of both pricing and investment strategy. Meanwhile, providers will have to consider the effects on the annuities market of a ruling, shortly to be issued by the European Court of Justice, on equal benefits in occupational schemes. The test case, brought by male and female pension scheme members of Coloroll, the home furnishings company now in liquidation, has already prompted the ECJ's advocate general to comment that employers may not buy annuities for men which make monthly payments higher than those to women. Since women tend to live longer, current sex-based annuity rates mean they can expect to receive less each month for an annuity purchased for the same amount. While the ruling says nothing about personal pensions, it could force Britain's insurance industry to abandon sex-related annuity rates altogether, as has happened in the US following a similar Supreme Court ruling. Such a move could lead to a rethink of personal pension contribution rates as well as product design. The industry, created by a government determined to see its social security expenditure curbed, and nurtured by insurers anxious for new products, is at a crossroads. While it has firmly fixed itself in the minds of policymakers and the public as a suitable means of retirement provision, it remains to be seen whether it will become the bedrock of old-age income. The question is whether the personal pensions industry can respond swiftly to the public clamour for changes in sales tactics, cost structure and product design.</p>

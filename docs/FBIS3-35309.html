Mirsalim thanked the leader of the Islamic revolution  Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i and President Rafsanjani for their  confidence in him and disclosed the western conspiracies against  the Islamic Republic.    He underlined the importance of the Islamic culture for the  Iranian nation and said today's world is faced with the  domination-seeking tendencies of certain heinous states who  insist to score cultural supremacy through dominating over other  nations so as to pave the way for pocketing more interests.    Underlining the extensive dimension of the cultural assault,  he said that only last year, 40 European and American research  centers have published 214 books and 300 articles on Iran and  Islam while 16 counterrevolutionary and eight foreign radio  stations broadcast programs in Persian. He added that 1,100  counterrevolutionary t.v. stations also broadcast programs in  Persian and 214 publishing centers of Iranians and non-Iranians  abroad distributed 315 books in Persian in an effort to mock the  Islamic values and to level accusations against Iran.    Giving more statistics, he also said that 310 cultural  centers abroad were engaged in activities against the Persian  and Islamic culture through publishing materials in 114  periodicals in Persian while world's leading publications have  published 110 articles on Iran and Islam.    Moreover, he added, eight world conferences were held on  Iran  during the period including the one on Iran-U.S. relations known  as Clinton conference.    The minister underlined that cultural growth is more  important than economic and social growth. Mirsalim noted that  language is the main medium for transfer of cultural concepts  and that he plans to make efforts towards "preserving and  strengthening the eloquent Persian language while at the same  time to refine the language of alien words." He added that  efforts will also be made to promote Persian in other regions  particluarly in Persian speaking countries.    As another domain of his plans, he said that he will protect  the rights of the writers and artists and systematize cultural  and research centers.    As far as cultural relations with foreign countries are  concerned, he said that facilities would be provided for  cultural cooperation with the Central Asian states while such  cooperation with Pakistan and Afghanistan would be strengthened  and cultural ties with the Persian Gulf littoral states would be  continued.</p>

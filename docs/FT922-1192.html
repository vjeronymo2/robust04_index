			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 13.5m purchase for Plysu PLYSU, the plastic bottle and houseware manufacturer based in Milton Keynes, has announced a European expansion through the Pounds 13.5m purchase of a Benelux-based blow moulded plastics container company. The company is paying for SEP Group through a vendor placing of 3.12m shares at 276.5p, which raised Pounds 8.6m, and about Pounds 2.5m in cash. The vendors will also keep about Pounds 2.3m of Plysu shares for at least one year. Mr Richard Gordon, chief executive, said the acquisition would provide a platform for further growth in Europe, in particular in France where the company has been seeking to expand. The deal will be earnings enhancing in the year to March 1993 and leaves the group with a pro-forma balance sheet that is virtually ungeared. The acquisition follows two years in which Plysu has grown rapidly after capturing a large slice of a relatively new UK market for resealable plastic milk bottles for the supermarket and dairy trade. SEP had sales of Pounds 23.6m in the year to December 31, and made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.3m, down from Pounds 2.1m after being hit by fluctuations in raw material prices as a result of the Gulf war. It had net assets of Pounds 9.1m at the last balance sheet date. Plysu believes its existing smaller blow moulding operation in the Netherlands will fit well with SEP's operations and markets. Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, underwrote the share placing with institutions yesterday at a 3 per cent discount to the market price of 285p at which the shares closed.</p>

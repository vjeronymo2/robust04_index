			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Everything seemed to be going badly for the Liberal  Party recently. Three weeks ago Carlos Lemos said the party was  operating in a "maricona" [homosexual] manner. Two weeks ago,  the glittery launch of Andres Pastrana's campaign was presented  as the arrival of a new era in political marketing. A  week ago, Carlos Lleras de la Fuente announced that he was so  concerned about his party's fate that he had decided to submit  his name as a presidential candidate. And two days later, Alvaro  Gomez--the historic enemy of the Pastrana family--sealed the  Conservative Party's unity with his endorsement of Andres.    This string of misfortunes for Ernesto Samper led many  people  to think that, as things were going, the next tenant of the Casa  de Narino [presidential residence] was going to have a  moustache. Andres Pastrana, with his gorgeous wife and two  precious children, conveys the image of the perfect candidate  about to win the hearts of the Colombian people as the leader of  this new country.    In high-level social and business circles, the comment  always  seemed to be the same: "Even though I am a liberal, this time I  am going to vote for Andres." In the Jockey Club of Bogota; in  the Club Colombia of Cali, and in the Union in Medellin, all  bets were on Pastrana. Ernesto Samper, who was traveling all  over the country amidst considerable indifference, was perceived  as a personality distorted by his managers; in  addition, he was zigzagging ideologically between Fernando  Botero's new right and the old left of Horacio Serpa Uribe. Many  people were starting to announce his political demise.    What may have brought about Ernesto Samper's resurrection  was  a poll by the CNC [National Survey Center] published in all the  media at the end of last week. The poll was paid for by Bavaria,  which for the past 16 months has been financing periodic opinion  polls on the presidential campaign. In the world of politics and  journalism this polling is considered the best barometer of this  election contest. All the polls done by the Bavaria brewery had  always given the victory to Andres Pastrana over Ernesto Samper.  The margin of victory varied, but not the position of the  candidates.    But Bavaria is not the only organization doing polls. Other  firms, like Opinion Publica [Public Opinion] and Napoleon Franco  also conduct polls, and they all had something in common:  Ernesto Samper never won. This was extremely difficult for  Samper's campaign to explain. When he was ambassador to Madrid  it could be argued that he was not in Colombia. After he  returned, they could say he was not yet a candidate. But once he  had actually begun his campaign swings from department to  department, the advantage of Pastrana--who was not  campaigning--was difficult to justify. And while that was when  his rival was not saying a word, there was no guarantee that  things would improve when Pastrana's campaign actually got  started. For in addition to being very well financed, Pastrana's  campaign has been designed and guided by the expert hand of Luis  Alberto Moreno, who left the Ministry of Development to work on  the Pastrana campaign.  <H5>  A Rigged Poll? </H5>   Against this backdrop, last week's Bavaria-CNC poll caused a  real surprise. In one month the situation had dramatically  turned around and Samper, instead of losing, was shown winning  both the first and second rounds. The results in the first  round: Samper, 38 percent; and Pastrana, 33. In the second  round: Samper, 50; and Pastrana, 43. The poll was done between 3  and 8 February, that is, the week immediately prior to the  launch of Andres Pastrana. But although this factor was not  taken into account, Samper's rebound was surprising.    As the poll was financed by Bavaria, a member of the Santo  Domingo Group, there were insinuations that it might have been  rigged, as this conglomerate has been somewhat cool toward  Pastrana. Still, that suggestion was not persuasive. If they had  financed polls for 16 months in which Samper lost and had openly  published them, why perpetrate a hoax now? Moreover, Augusto  Lopez--Bavaria's CEO--is a reliable man, and falsifying  information for electoral purposes would be an extremely grave  matter for such a conglomerate. In addition, the new regulations  on polls would make any such manipulation difficult, as it could  be easily detected. And finally, Carlos Lemoine and the CNC are  putting their prestige on the line in backing the veracity of  their forecasts. Therefore, even though there may have been some  debate about the methodology--particularly by the  Pastranists--the poll's validity could not be seriously  challenged.    What conferred the most legitimacy to Samper's resurrection  was not just the Bavaria poll. It was the fact that all the  other polls done at that time and immediately after began to  show the same results. Peter Hart's consulting firm, along with  Napoleon Franco, both showed Samper the winner by an equal  margin. And an EL TIEMPO poll published on Sunday also agreed.  That unanimity demonstrated that, against all expectations,  Ernesto Samper had managed to pull ahead of Andres Pastrana  during the week preceding the official announcement of  Pastrana's candidacy. Though it was very likely that the  successful launch of the campaign of the New Democratic Force's  candidate would give him a substantial boost, this does not  necessarily mean the imminence of a Pastranist victory. What is  clear is that Andres Pastrana would face a contender in the  ring up to the final round. Ernesto Samper's  strategists always expected Pastrana's best time to be the week  following the start of his campaign; that is, right now. That  was because of the publicity fanfare generated by a new  campaign, the charisma of the candidate and his family, and  Colombians' propensity to get enthusiastic about anything new.  After that phase, though, Samper would have a lot going for him.  First of all, his predictable victory in the Liberal Party  primary would give him not only the image of a winner, but  legitimacy as the sole candidate of liberalism. And this party,  despite all its flaws, limitations, and frustrations, is still  by far Colombia's majority party.    This factor means that the Liberal Party's sole candidate  always has great chances of being elected, even though he may  not be the favorite of the multitudes. That is how Gaviria,  Barco, and Turbay all reached the presidency without being  considered--when nominated--to have great mass appeal. Since  1930 the Liberal Party has never lost an election when it was  united. It lost when the party was split over Ospina Perez in  1946 and Betancur in 1982. Obviously, things have changed. Now  party affiliation is not as strong as it used to be, and new  factors like the second election round have created unknowns.  But if Ernesto Samper, the sole liberal candidate, loses the  election, it would be the first such case in this century.  <H5>  Liberal Party Primary </H5>   For Which Candidate Do You Intend to Vote?

Financed by Bavaria, S.A. Sample size:  7,550 persons over 18 who expressed their intention to vote in  some of the elections in 1994. Group studied: representative  sample of the population in urban areas of Colombia. Collection  method: personal interviews conducted at respondents' homes.  Date of collection: 3 February to 8 February 1994. Maximum error  margin for total sample: 1.1 percent. The CNC is registered with  the National Election Board.  <H5>  Samper's Rebound </H5>   The question, then, is: if things were going so badly for  him  just a month ago, why is he doing so well now? Especially  running against Pastrana, a candidate with star quality, who so  far has made no mistakes. There are two answers to this  question. The first is purely and simply the party machinery.  All the polls in which Samper lost were conducted when the  congressional campaign in the departments had not yet caught  fire. They barely got off the ground at the start of this year,  and such is the force of the liberal machine that it is  producing a snowballing effect for the candidate.    The last Bavaria-CNC poll on the Senate's composition shows  that, of a total of 100 senators, it should have about 64  liberals. All these liberal campaigns are putting in money and  giving a strong boost that inevitably benefits Samper who, as  people now know, will be the official candidate. Napoleon Franco  attributes last month's surprising rebound to this factor.  Pastrana may have more support in big cities and a considerable  edge among the ruling class and young people. But in midsized  and smaller towns, ordinary people continue to produce the  votes. And in this area, the Liberal Party still outperforms its  rivals. So when the polls are conducted in the four major  cities, Pastrana wins; but when the polling universe is widened,  then the Samperist forces appear. And now, with the elections  drawing nearer, these forces are starting to make themselves  felt.    Party machinery is not the only explanation. There is also  the fact that Samper has defined himself ideologically, and so  the election is growing more polarized. Pastrana's candidacy has  become a candidacy of the center right, and Samper's is becoming  a center left candidacy. Both men deny these labels, trying to  disguise them with other words. Pastrana rejects the neoliberal  tag and calls himself a centrist; Samper defines himself as a  supporter of democratic capitalism and places himself in what he  calls the social center. But the truth is that Pastrana is the  candidate the farthest to the right since Alvaro Gomez. With the  difference, of course, that what was considered  reactionary is now considered in. He has  bravely announced that he supports the policies of President  Gaviria who, economically, has also been on the right, though he  does not like the "neoliberal" label either.    Ernesto Samper at one time flirted a little with  neoliberalism, trying to harmonize it with the Liberal Party's  traditional positions. Then, finding that this strategy was  leaving him high and dry, he decided to leave this space to  Gaviria and Pastrana and return to the position that liberalism  had historically occupied. He went to extremes, like allowing  himself to be praised by people like Hernando Agudelo Villa,  considered obsolete by contemporary economic thought, people who  have upheld the same old economic line for 25 years.    All these decisions entail risks for Samper, especially now  that the right is in fashion and the left has become taboo. But  not differentiating himself from Pastrana and simply  tagging along and continuing Gaviria's new capitalism  held even greater risks. As Samper himself has said dozens of  times in private, he wants to be more like Clinton than Bush.  The strategy was to touch this traditional liberal fiber which  historically has been able to mobilize the masses.  <H5>  Left vs. Right </H5>   The truth is that both Pastrana and Samper are moderates.  Pastrana is shocked by the image of savage capitalism with which  people are portraying him, but there are many Colombians who  believe that market forces produce better results than state  intervention. Particularly in the ruling class, where the  Pastrana majority is well known.    And Samper is neither a populist nor a leftist. But he knows  that Colombian workers, students, and unions believe that  neoliberalism has produced excesses that need to be corrected.  These views are not heard much in the social clubs, but they may  be in the majority. His speeches do not mention the word  "apertura" [trade liberalization], considered compulsory in the  Pastrana group. Samper's key word is "jobs" which, though  sounding somewhat trite, is the Colombian people's biggest  concern right now. Ernesto Samper is using this traditional  strategy, and the results are showing up in the polls. After  waffling from side to side for years he has decided to play the  liberal card. Today this card is much more to the center than to  the left. But in any case, it is different from Andres  Pastrana's neoliberal right.    Pastrana, though, is a formidable candidate. He has a great  image and while by no means an intellectual, he is ideologically  consistent. In handling the media he is infinitely superior to  Samper; therefore, defeating him is not going to be easy. But  the liberal candidate still has two aces up his sleeve: the  party leadership and the vice presidency. When he is proclaimed  the official candidate, the selection of these two posts will  allow Ernesto Samper to give an image of renewal to the party.  This "makeover" may manage to persuade many a skeptical liberal  that it is better to be disciplined and loyal to the party. And  as 50 percent of the voters are now liberals, compared with 25  percent who are conservatives, if Ernesto Samper can mobilize  his party, his victory is highly probable.    To mobilize liberals, they must be made enthusiastic. And  the  truth is that even though the machinery is running at full  speed, there are still signs of lack of interest. The party  image is a little out of fashion and modernizing it is  essential. Former President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala, as the  party's sole leader, has been conciliatory and effective. But  his image--although venerable and respected--evokes other eras.  The image of Samper himself is not the best. While he is barely  over 40 and comes from the private sector, he has been perceived  as an old-style politician. This image contrasts with that of  Pastrana, the perfect product for a marketing  director.    But when Ernesto Samper emerges as the winner of the Liberal  Party primary he is going to be running the show, and he may be  able to bring about a change enabling him to turn this situation  around. As the winning candidate, he can become the sole leader  of his party--as the tradition has been in the past--or delegate  this function to people who symbolize the new times.    The selection of his vice president will also be a message  of  the changes the Liberal Party will have to make upon reaching  the 21st century. Names like Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, Juan  Manuel Santos, and Pedro Gomez have been mentioned in different  contexts for the concluding phase of the campaign.    Some strategic decisions of this nature may radically change  the profile of liberalism and of its candidate in the final  stretch. In a little while, Ernesto Samper will hold in his  hands the ability to bring about this shakeup. If he does, he  will be elected.  <H5>  The Truth of the Polls </H5>   The years go by, and Colombians are still skeptical about  polls. For the experts, the reality is very simple. Polls for  the Senate and Chamber are not very reliable because of the  number of candidates running. The polls for presidential  candidates, when properly done, are reliable. It is almost  impossible for them to be in error. This is because it is one  thing to ask questions for three or four names, as in  presidential elections, and something else for 300 or 400, as in  parliamentary elections.    Reservations about the methodology used in the poll released  last week showing Ernesto Samper ahead are based on a single  point: the inclusion or noninclusion of undecided voters. All  pollsters in Colombia agree on two points. The first: of the  people who intend to vote in the next election, Ernesto Samper  is ahead of Andres Pastrana. The second; people who do not know  if they are going to vote or not tend to prefer Pastrana.  Therefore, a poll's final results depend on which percentage is  attributed to these undecideds. The Bavaria-CNC poll lists 11  percent classified as independents. LA PRENSA criticized this as  very low, arguing that independents in Colombia are at about 45  percent. However, Napoleon Franco, a polling rival of Carlos  Lemoine, believes that the 11 percent of independents included  as certain or probable voters in the Bavaria poll is a  reasonable figure.</p>

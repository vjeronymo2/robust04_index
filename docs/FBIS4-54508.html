			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vlastimil Stana on press conference given by </F> Chief of General Staff Jiri Nekvasil: "Yesterday, Today, and  Tomorrow--Some Facts on the Transformation of the Army of the  Czech Republic"]    [Text] As announced by General Major Jiri Nekvasil,  ACR [Army of the Czech Republic] chief of the General Staff, at  a news conference, the Czech Army has undergone several waves of  change over the past several months. The reorganization impacted  not only on top organs of the Ministry of Defense but also was  manifested particularly in military units and formations.    One of the features of change in the Army is undoubtedly the  substantial movement of personnel, equipment, and all types of  materiel. Only for purposes of illustration, last year some  266,043 tons of materiel were transported within the framework  of the Army. Even though the majority of this materiel was  transported by highway, the Army also used 12,332 railroad cars.  This year, the volume of materiel to be shipped will be  approximately 177,500 tons of state property.    A specific element in the transformation is the  disestablishment of military components. Since 1990, some 777  formations and installations have been disestablished, with 132  of them being eliminated just recently. Some 126 formations  moved to other garrisons, and 187 new formations were created.    Just for last year, the reorganization impacted on a total  of  198 formations and installations of the Army. Military personnel  left 28 garrisons, which represents the evacuation of 261  facilities. This trend will continue in the coming months.    During the next two years, another seven garrisons will be  disestablished. One of the problems that burdens the Army and  exerts an influence in terms of the final consequences affecting  training in some units is the fact that abandoned facilities  continue to be guarded by the Army, although it does not utilize  them. Virtually 400 facilities are being guarded by almost 2,000  men.    A special chapter in the transformation is military  aviation.  According to official sources, the Air Force terminated regular  flying activities at seven airfields since 1990; the Army is  preparing to abandon an additional three airfields.    Unfortunately, pressure by representatives of some  communities and municipalities continues to have military pilots  evacuate their surroundings. Military aviation also has three  air rescue centers under its wings. It is precisely the members  of the Army who used this service to transport 5,500 persons in  life-threatening situations last year; of these, 850 were in  critical shape and 1,250 were children.    At the same time as the numerical strength of the military  is  declining (just last year the planned peacetime strength of the  ACR was reduced by 12,923 individuals), the number of military  training areas has also declined. The Army has thus permanently  left the training areas at Mimon, Dobra Voda, and Mlada.    The reorganization has substantially impacted the area of  military education and has had a basic impact upon civil  defense, the military health-care service, and the military  police. In March of this year, military railroad troops will be  disestablished.    The personnel area continues to be one of the most closely  monitored problems in the current Army; it has also been  subjected to more than one change. But the search continues for  a system to determine military careers; some reports indicate  that there are several models for this but that they continue to  stay under cover. Departures from Army ranks continue. Last  year, some 6,594 individuals left the Army, including 113  noncommissioned officers, 1,856 warrant officers, 4,607  officers, and 18 generals.    On the other hand, 1,821 individuals joined the service in  the ACR, including 438 noncommissioned officers, who joined the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] unit. At foreign schools, 117  career soldiers are training, as of today, or have completed  their training.    Gen. Nekvasil indicated that the most immediate  reorganization would transform the central and western Army  commands into the headquarters of the 1st and 2d Army Corps. An  additional four combined-arms divisions will change into  mechanized brigades. Air Force bases will be developed to house  the 6th Air Force Transport Regiment and the 20th Air Force  Bomber Regiment. The development of the rapid-deployment brigade  is announced for April of this year.    In a more extended time frame, it is expected that 11  territorial defense brigades and pontoon brigades will come into  being. One motorized division, three infantry divisions, a  chemical protection brigade, the headquarters of two divisions  of air defense, and the headquarters of the 7th Civil Defense  Recovery and Rescue Brigade will be completely disestablished.    All changes are to be accomplished by 1 October 1995.    The resulting status should then have the following  structure: There would be a Ministry of Defense and a General  Staff, followed by the headquarters of the 1st and 2d Army  Corps, the headquarters of the 3d Corps of the Tactical Air  Force and the 4th Air Defense Corps, the headquarters for  logistics. The armed forces would be formed by: seven mechanized  brigades, a rapid-deployment brigade, and 14 territorial defense  brigades. Military aviation would operate six air bases.</p>

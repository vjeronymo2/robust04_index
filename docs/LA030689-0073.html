			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> U.S. COMPILES FIRST POLICE AGENCY STUDY  </P> <P> While the nation's biggest cities employ thousands of police, nearly half of  all local law enforcement agencies have fewer than 10 officers, the Bureau of  Justice Statistics reported. And there are 987 local police departments in the  nation that can count but one officer on their staffs, according to the first  detailed analysis of law enforcement agencies to be compiled by the federal  government. At the other end of the scale, 34 local police agencies and 12  sheriff's departments reported having 1,000 or more officers when the survey  was conducted in 1987. All state police agencies, 99% of sheriff's offices and  97% of local police agencies with 135 or more officers now require at least a  high school diploma, the study found. A separate analysis of police standards  in 1967 found only 70% required such a diploma. The new study found that about  10% of the larger police departments and 6% of sheriff's operations are now  requiring prospective officers to have at least some college education.  </P></p>

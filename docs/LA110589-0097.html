			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAVE THE DEPOT  </P> <P> In the Oct. 28 article "Del Mar Depot Faces Closure, Demolition," I read both  good news and bad. The good news is that a decision has finally been reached as  to a location for the Del Mar/Solana Beach station on the Oceanside-San Diego  commuter train. Del Mar has gotten what it deserves for its incredible myopic  and self-centered attitude about this project (i.e., no station in Del Mar).  </P> <P> The very bad news is the abandonment and proposed destruction of the Del Mar  depot. I can't think of any reason to tear it down just because it's not going  to be used by Amtrak anymore. We already have in San Diego County some  excellent examples of railroad depot reuse (chambers of commerce, restaurants,  museums, etc.). And Del Mar's 1912 structure is certainly deserving of some  reasonable study for alternative uses. I understand that the model railroad  group that uses a facility at the Del Mar Fairgrounds will soon need a new  home, for example.  </P> <P> Historic preservation has been (I thought) on the increase, even in Southern  California. How can it possibly be justified to take away a building that  stands not only for almost 80 years of railroad service to Del Mar but which  can also be used for something else with minimal conversion or restoration?  </P> <P> JIM PRICE  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

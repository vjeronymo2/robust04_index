			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OOPS;  </P> <P> QUAYLES NO 'BEAKON' OF SPELLING  </P> <P> Barbara Bush's literacy efforts could start close to home with the Christmas  cards sent out by Vice President Dan Quayle and his family.  </P> <P> A misspelling of "beacon" was in a holiday message handwritten by the vice  president's wife, Marilyn Quayle, who has a law degree from Indiana University.  Her staff and the printer who re-created the holiday wishes failed to catch the  error.  </P> <P> "May our nation continue to be the beakon of hope to the world. May our lives  continually be guided by the light of the Lord's love. May He bless you and  keep you during this holiday season and throughout the new year," reads the  card sent to 30,000 people at the expense of the Republican National Committee.  </P> <P> It is signed "Fondly, the Quayles."  </P></p>

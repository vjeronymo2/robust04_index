			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: A new strategy for income shares - Two trust groups recently warned shareholders of the dangers of reinvesting dividends in income shares. But Ian McKeever suggests ways sophisticated investors can profit from reinvestment THE SIMPLEST kind of income share provides only dividends and a negligible capital payment when the trust is wound up. These are often called annuity shares (for obvious reasons) and probably are the most misunderstood of all. They substitute a taxable income stream for an untaxed return of capital and forego any hope of capital gain except in the very short term. This might be in the price, but it makes them attractive only to non-taxpaying investors such as pension funds and charities or, more interestingly, Pep-holders. They are very rewarding for these non-taxpayers who, effectively, pay only a small premium for the net dividends and receive in addition a 20 per cent tax refund from the Inland Revenue. This provides a very good investment return. The problem of the lost capital remains, but what matters is the total investment return after tax. The capital gain on zero coupon preference is an attractive surrogate for interest on a deposit account. In this case the opposite is true: the dividend stream is an attractive surrogate for capital or capital gain in a Pep. All that is required is that the dividends be re-invested. Although the price of the individual shares might fall, the portfolio would hold an increasing number of them and its market value should increase. Because the investment return is received from a dividend stream, rather than realising the underlying portfolio, the risk is of falling dividends rather than falling market values. The return is immune to the effect of low market values when the trust is wound up. As the number of dividends to be received is constantly reducing, the market value of the shares will tend to fall as wind-up approaches. If dividends are re-invested, this will be more than compensated for by the increase in the number of shares held. The past year has provided two reasons for falls in gross dividends. Dividends have reduced marginally over the past 12 months but the extent of this for the market overall is small and the unusual nature of such an event has been shown by the media attention paid to reduced dividends from, for example, Barclays and BP. The more serious risk is of political change: this year's Budget has reduced gross dividends by 6 per cent. Clearly if the strategy of reinvestment of dividends is followed, eventually the whole investment will be in the final dividend from the trust. Even so, the risk of a substantial fall in that dividend is much less than that of a substantial fall in the market values of the underlying assets. Where the trust holds a revenue reserve this will also be distributed with the final dividend, further stabilising the amount available for the final payment. The problem with reinvesting dividends is the need to obtain an increasing number of shares. As wind up approaches, the price of the income shares will be falling rapidly and the dividend income will be rising equally rapidly. The effect of this on the demand for the shares will eventually be enormous. For example, only a very few people investing Pounds 6,000 in a Pep of Jos Income Shares would eventually end up holding the whole issue of this class of share capital. For the investor this is not really a risk because there is the option of selling the holding at the inflated market value and repeating the exercise with another income share further from maturity. For a Pep holder they represent a relatively low risk investment in spite of the apparent unattractiveness. Assuming reinvestment of dividends and no dividend growth the expected return would be around 8 per cent. If dividends grew at 5 per cent per annum the return would be around 13 per cent. Even if dividends fall these shares should offer the Pep investor a positive return. An alternative application for a Pep investment in income shares is for school fees planning. All that is needed when the fees come to be paid is for the dividends to be paid out rather than reinvested. This eliminates the risk of having to sell shares after a substantial fall in the stock market. Other strategies are possible. An investor could invest part of his capital in income shares through a Pep and invest part directly in zero coupon preference shares. The income shares would provide a growing income and the zeros would ensure the return of the original outlay on wind up. This might be particularly suitable for retired people who could maintain their income after that by using the money to purchase an index linked annuity. This would then be a more attractive proposition as they can then confidently expect to be somewhat older. With these income shares the tax advantages are likely to far outweigh the Pep managers' charges even after the budget changes. The only disadvantage is that the capital loss will give no tax benefits. Ian McKeever is a consulting actuary.</p>

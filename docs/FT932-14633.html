			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo rally fails to change the sceptics's minds - Emiko Terazono reports that serious doubts remain about the recovery of the Japanese economy The sudden rise of the Tokyo stock market in recent months has renewed enthusiasm for stocks and increased the confidence of Japanese brokers. The Nikkei average has risen by 20 per cent since the beginning of the year, and volume has risen to levels reminiscent of the late 1980s bull market. While the index corrected down 1.8 per cent to 20,297.86 yesterday, Japanese brokers continue to cheer prices on. The unexpected rally, however, leaves many investors still sceptical about the recovery of Japan's economy, and has raised concerns about a resurgence of asset inflation, seen in the days of loose credit in the late 1980s. The change in investor sentiment was initially triggered by a wave of government buying through public funds at the beginning of last month. Foreigners were quick to respond to the rise, and a jump in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, a benchmark for investor sentiment, fuelled further optimism. Share prices received another boost earlier this week with the government's Y13,200bn emergency economic package, and the Nikkei recovered the psychologically important 20,000 level for the first time since March last year. Japanese brokers have been quick to point out that the stock price movements reflect rational investor behaviour, and that share prices were reacting to the bottoming out of the economy and future corporate profits. 'The economy has hit the bottom and investors are discounting future earnings,' says Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities. Indeed, some economic indicators have been encouraging. New car sales in March rose 1.5 per cent after 14 consecutive months of decline. Money supply expanded by a slim 0.2 per cent in February after a 0.3 per cent contraction in January. However consumer demand has yet to recover, as indicated by a 11.4 per cent fall in March department store sales, the sharpest fall since the Japan Department Store Association started collecting statistics in 1965. Capital investment is still weak, and some economists are expecting last month's money supply figures to indicate sluggish growth. The speed of the market's rise against the mixed economic backdrop has triggered concerns over a potential recurrence of the asset 'bubble' last seen in the late 1980s. Low interest rates, a Y6,000bn emergency package, and a higher yen triggered the sharp rise in asset prices in 1987. While government officials point out that they are keeping a close watch, cynics suggest that the Japanese authorities are now trying to counter the sluggish economy by shoring up share prices. Some analysts point out that the Japanese economy is closely linked to asset prices. Since a rise in share prices will help Japanese companies and banks by relieving them of losses on their stock portfolios, the rise in share prices will help to increase the flow of funds into the economy. Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo reckons that a 15 per cent rise in the stock market creates Y45,000bn of financial wealth. Thus, while the economy has yet to recover, a sustained recovery in share prices may lead to an improvement in economic fundamentals. The emergency economic package may also help property prices. The package includes a total Y1,600bn to be pumped into the property market through advance land purchases for public works projects and increased funds for the Housing Loan Corporation, which provides a third of all mortgages in Japan. Brokers are already resuming the trading patterns seen in the late 1980s, using 'themes' to sell stocks and whipping up market activity by rotating trading from one sector to another. The big question is whether economy and corporate earnings will catch up with the 'bubble' on the stock market, which is currently trading at a price/earnings ratio of 74 times. Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities, says the package will help the economy, but adds that it will recycle existing cash rather than pump in new funds. Although Japanese brokers maintain a bullish stance, foreigners, who led the recent rally, are starting to take a cautious stance as the index approaches its forecast ceiling of 22,000. Technically, some analysts consider the index overstretched at 17 per cent above its 200-day moving average of 17,200. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel says: 'Normally if the market is 11 to 13 per cent over the 200-day average, there is a correction.' However, with more public funds waiting to be invested, a floor is expected around the 19,500 level. The earnings reporting season in mid-May is unlikely to bring big surprises and the focus will be on companies' profit estimates for the current year to next March. Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson says that unless the higher yen forces the Bank of Japan to ease its monetary policy, the next few months may see few events for investors to get excited about. Meanwhile, smaller stocks have also recovered, with the over-the-counter market yesterday closing at 1,581.67, up 44 per cent from its low in November. Foreigners seeking exposure in Japan have been leading buyers; investment trust funds have also actively purchased shares. However, Mr Takehiro Tsuda, at Ichiyoshi Securities, a medium-sized brokerage specialising in OTC stocks, says the index may be at a near-term peak. 'The OTC index will face a correction to the 1,400 level ahead of the March earnings announcement season.'</p>

Arde] </F>   [Text] Pietermaritzburg March 26 SAPA -- Natal Midlands  branch of the African National Congress [ANC] on Saturday warned  that if drastic measures were not taken in Natal the province  would be on brink of full-scale war. In a memorandum to the  Transitional Executive Council [TEC] -- delivered by up to  10,000 ANC supporters who marched to Loop Street police station  -- the ANC also said it rejected any postponement of the April  elections.    "We, the people of Natal, want to make it clear that any  postponement of the elections (nationally or in Natal) would  plunge this country into a disaster and turn it into a  wasteland."    The ANC's memorandum went on to condemn the government for  "continued sponsorship of the war in Natal by the South African  Police through its very top generals". The memorandum was  referring to recent disclosures made before the Goldstone  Commission on political violence. ? The ANC's memorandum  included a number of demands aimed at creating a climate for  free politicking in kwaZulu/Natal. The organisation called for,  among other things, the takeover of the kwaZulu Police by the  SAP [Sout African Police], and an end to kwaZulu government  paramilitary training camps.    Addressing supporters before the march, ANC Midlands leader  Harry Gwala warned Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President  Mangosuthu Buthelezi that his days were numbered. "Gatsha should  try to read events because he's only got 31 days to breathe and  kwaZulu will be finished."    Mr Gwala also lashed out at the Democratic Party [DP] in  Natal, which on friday called for a postponement of the  elections because of the volatile climate in the province. He  said the DP had "become spoilers like the IFP".    Mr Gwala warned of escalating violence if the elections were  postponed, saying "there will be more violence because no-one  can stop us from going forward to elections". "We want to decide  who will govern this country," he said.    The ANC Midlands leader said his organisation wanted peace,  but he urged his opponents in the IFP not to "play with fire" by  denying political campaigning in Natal.    He also called on King Goodwill Zwelithini not to act as  "the  king of Inkatha" but as a Zulu monarch.    Addressing minority groups in the audience, Mr Gwala said  voting for State President F W de Klerk's National Party was  like "backing a dead horse".    Saturday's activities passed without incident, police said.  ANC Regional Secretary Mr Sifiso Nkabinda said no reports of  violence had been received by 3.30PM. However, three ANC  supporters were seriously injured when the bus they were  travelling on to pietermaritzburg overturned.    Traffic officials at the scene, on Duncan McKenzie Drive  just  outside Pietermaritzburg, said another 50 passengers were hurt,  but none were seriously injured. The bus slipped on to its side  coming around a bend. Police said enthusiastic passengers were  jumping around in the vehicle, which may be caused it to  overturn.</p>

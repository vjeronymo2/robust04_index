			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Fax points the way forward - In a Nutshell How often have you wasted precious time attempting to find a company in a characterless trading estate or in a busy town centre? A new fax service called Faxmap will provide visitors with detailed maps of where they should be, as well as a written explanation of how to get there. If someone asks how to reach your company, you give them your Faxmap number. Your visitor dials the number on his fax machine and receives a two page fax of maps and information. The cost of renting a number is Pounds 199 a year but the charge for the fax time is paid for by the inquirer. Contact DIS Information Services. Cavallino House, Corsley Heath, Nr Warminster, Wiltshire BA12 7PL. Tel 0373 832656.</p>

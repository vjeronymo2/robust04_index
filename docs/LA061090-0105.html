			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA CAN STILL COMPETE;  </P> <P> THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF NATIONS BY MICHAEL E. PORTER (THE FREE  PRESS/MACMILLAN: $35; 855 PP.; 0-02-925361-6)  </P> <P> In the 1960s, American firms dominated both domestic and international markets,  so their corporate strategies tended to focus more on personnel and less on  product. That was the age of T-groups (T for training) and group dynamics,  popularized by Warren Bennis and Ed Schein of MIT (later UCLA).  </P> <P> Then, in the 1970s, as competitive pressure mounted from Germany and especially  Japan, American corporations turned to a growth-share matrix, introduced by the  Boston Consulting Group.  </P> <P> The buzzwords were cash cows (for low-growth, high-market-share products),  which fed shooting stars (high-growth, high-share), which maybe became dogs  (low-share in a slow market) that had to be liquidated to fund the question  marks. The acquisition craze in this era was driven partly by a desire to buy  cash cows or shooting stars and divest the dogs.  </P> <P> But in the 1980s, the matrix as an analytical tool gradually gave way to a more  comprehensive concept called "competitive strategy," which spawned a new book  of the very same name by Michael E. Porter of the Harvard Business School.  </P> <P> Subtitled "Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors" (Free  Press/Macmillan, 1980), it established Porter as a leading practitioner of the  art. The core of his analysis was the competitive behavior of corporations  within their industries, and it isolated three generic strategies: low-cost  leadership (such as IBM in computing); differentiation (e.g., Mercedes in the  auto sector) and focus (Kodak in film). It was followed by his "Competitive  Advantage" in 1985.  </P> <P> Well, the 1990s have now begun, so it's time for another shift in the marketing  of buzzwords. Porter is back again with another hefty tome that brings us  concepts such as "clusters" (related and supporting industries) and the  "diamond" of national advantage that should take us through the decade.  </P> <P> His "diamond" is a complex, four-cornered diagram of what he calls  "determinants of national competitive advantage." They include (1) corporate  strategy, structure and rivalry; (2) factor conditions (capital,  infrastructure, human and natural resources); (3) "clusters," and (4) demand  conditions (the dynamics of competition in a country's domestic economy).  </P> <P> "National prosperity is created, not inherited," Porter argues. "A nation's  competitiveness depends on the capacity of its industry to innovate and to  upgrade. Companies gain advantage . . . because of pressure and challenge. They  benefit from having strong domestic rivals, aggressive home-based suppliers,  and demanding local customers."  </P> <P> In his new book, Porter thus deviates from the conventional wisdom of  comparative advantage -- advanced by the traditional neoclassical economists  such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo, who argued that it was hereditary -- and  invites us to think instead about competitive advantage, which is created.  </P> <P> Comparative advantage suggests that nations with rich factor endowments such as  land and natural resources will be producers of agricultural commodities and  minerals. The United States and Australia have fit this traditional paradigm  well.  </P> <P> But the neoclassical model breaks down when it comes to countries like Japan,  which should theoretically specialize in labor-intensive goods since labor is a  strong factor endowment. Yet as is now common knowledge, Japan rejects the  neoclassical theory of comparative advantage and has become the leading example  of how a nation can create its own competitive advantage: an uncompromising  commitment to public education, a powerful trade bureaucracy and targeted  incentives for new investment.  </P> <P> The intellectual cornerstone for the theory of competitive advantage was laid  nearly two decades ago, however, by Kazushi Ohkawa and Henry Rosovsky of  Harvard in their seminal work "Japanese Economic Growth: Trend Acceleration in  the 20th Century" (Stanford University Press, 1973). This original work  (strangely unmentioned at all by Porter) cited the inherent dynamics of Japan's  high-speed domestic economy -- not export-led growth -- as the key factor in  its famous postwar miracle.  </P> <P> Porter spent four years analyzing more than 100 companies in 10 countries to  refine his new paradigm of competitive advantage. In his lengthy analysis, he  applies this paradigm both to nations in various stages of development (the  United States, Japan and Germany are included as advanced economies, with Korea  and Singapore as industrializing models, in addition to five other European  countries), as well as to specific industry sectors such as Italian ceramic  tiles and Japanese robotics.  </P> <P> These specific analytical studies comprise the book's real strength and most of  its bulk. Less convincing are Porter's general implications for corporate  strategy or government policy, which take up the final section in an attempt to  identify national agendas for each of the countries in question.  </P> <P> Particularly disappointing is his pessimistic assessment of America's own  future, a position popular with liberals these days, especially in Cambridge  and New Haven and Washington. "That America will remain a great power is not in  doubt," he concludes, "the issue is whether the American economy has the  dynamism to maintain or raise (its) standard of living, or whether the nation  will steadily lose ground in relative terms."  </P> <P> While Porter rightly isolates the many critical problems that America faces  (flagging performance in public education, a short-term focus, lower spending  on R&amp;D, an anemic savings rate, etc.), he falls into a common trap by not  suggesting how we can solve them. Here, even a cursory analysis of tax-based  incentives to strengthen R&amp;D and capital formation would have been helpful,  or a discourse on the advantages of market-based competition and choice to help  reform and restructure education -- unless Porter erroneously believes, as  conventional thinkers in Cambridge and Washington do, that a national economic  strategy or its first cousin, an industrial policy (both predicated on an  outdated Japanese model), are viable solutions.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the book's length (855 pages) and its price will be daunting for  the general reader, who may find excerpts more appealing. While this is  regrettable, given the book's considerable detail, both the Harvard Business  Review (in its March-April, 1990, issue) and Fortune (March 12, 1990) offer  abridged versions that most readers will undoubtedly prefer. But business  schools and reference libraries will want to stock it.  </P> <P> The critical question is whether one is optimistic about America's future, as I  am (despite its present problems), or pessimistic about it, as Porter seems to  be. Beware the permanent trend: America's great strengths as it moves toward  the next century are an incredibly diverse and resilient society that is  capable of unmatched entrepreneurial energy, vitality and skill; a market  second to none in responsiveness, flexibility and size; an unparalleled  inventiveness that will continue to drive the information revolution, and a  dynamic heterogeneity that is being revitalized and rejuvenated by our new  immigrants, more than half of whom now are coming from East Asia.  </P> <P> These underlying strengths ought to put new and clever buzzwords into a broader  perspective, because the T-groups and the growth-share matrix and the diamonds  and the clusters never seem to live much beyond the fads that their short-term  popularity creates.  </P> <P> The solid building blocks of America's competitive strength, on the other hand,  clearly will.  </P></p>

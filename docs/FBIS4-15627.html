			<p>BFN     [Text] The president of the Ukrainian Autonomous Republic  of Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, said, "I haven't had any meetings with  the envoy of the Ukrainian president to Ukraine, Valeriy  Gorbatov, and hope I won't as long the Republic of Crimea  exists."    Meshkov said to reporters on Sunday that the situation in  Crimea might be destabilized before the convocation of the  republic's legislature, elections to which are underway on  Sunday along with those to the Ukrainian parliament. "Such  attempts are being made by the Kiev leadership but have  fortunately been unsuccessful so far," he said.    Meshkov took no part in either round of the Ukrainian  parliamentary elections (at the first round, he took his ballot  paper away with him and urged all other Crimean electors to do  the same). On April 10, he only participated in the Crimean  elections.    Asked about the "war of laws" between Ukraine and Crimea, he  said, "It isn't a war of laws but Kiev's attempts to make it  impossible for us to solve our economic problems." "It is my  strong hope that those who take power in Ukraine will simply be  reasonable people. That's enough for Crimea," he said.</p>

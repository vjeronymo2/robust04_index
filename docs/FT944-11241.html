			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (4): The community has its say - Partnerships are not new. Hazel Duffy examines their evolution Partnerships are on the increase, spurred by a government that has made them a pre-requisite in the competitive bidding process for regeneration money. There is nothing new about the concept. In the 1970s, the partnership was between central and local government, the former channelling money through local authorities to be spent on physical renewal. During the 1980s, the word was applied by Mrs Thatcher to a relationship between the public and private sectors. A further dimension was added as a result of the corporate sector's involvement with voluntary agencies and schools - for instance, to bring extra resources to areas of economic and social deprivation. The 1990s has seen the birth of the training and enterprise councils (Tecs), requiring yet another sort of partnership between central government, which finances most of their activities, and local companies. And with the City Challenge programme, whereby local authorities co-ordinated a number of agencies to put a bid for money to government, the community became formally involved. The community is now represented on many of the 37 partnerships across the West Midlands region, which are waiting to hear if they have been successful in capturing a slice of the Single Regeneration Budget. These partnerships are variously led and co-ordinated by local councils, voluntary agencies, higher education, and Tecs. Some partnerships have economic stimulus as their objective. Coventry city council, for instance, has teamed up with surrounding local authorities to form an embryo 'city region', bringing more potential development sites into the catchment area than could be produced in the city itself. It is hoped that this approach will bring increased opportunities to seek money from Europe, as well as from the government through such agencies as English Partnerships, which will be responsible for City Grant and money to restore derelict land. Coventry also hopes that the private sector, with seven seats on the board of the partnership company, will be encouraged to bring forward investment plans. The private sector is in a leading position on partnerships in several other areas, including Stoke-on-Trent, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Burton and Cannock, which have put in bids to the government. The role which corporate leaders - many of whom are already involved in Tecs  -and other partners will take in the implementation of some of the schemes emerging from successful bids is less clear. Even where schemes have a specific economic, rather than social, goal, the local authority is likely to emerge as the partner that ensures things get done. Chief executives sometimes fulfil a largely symbolic role, yet they are easier to bring into the partnership circle than representatives of the community, says Steve Martin, research fellow in the local government centre at Warwick Business School Centre. Moreover, community representatives often do not represent all parts of the community, and some use it as a platform which could get them out of the area. 'What is important in all partnerships is that each partner brings something distinctive into it. In that way, they can avoid clashes over turf,' says Mr Martin. Current government thinking is that publicly funded schemes should demonstrate that they will benefit the community. The four City Challenges in the region - in Walsall, Wolverhampton, Tipton and Birmingham - all want to get property development schemes off the ground, whether they centre on a supermarket, a science park, housing or a combination of all three. This brings the potential developer into the partnership as well. But it has to be demonstrated that these plans will include extra activities, such as training and childcare, so that local people have a chance to get work. The short-term nature of government programmes set up to address long-term problems of unemployment and social deprivation points to the need to identify the people - the partners - who will take on the mantle after the agencies are wound up. The two urban development corporations in the area, Black Country and Birmingham Heartlands, are already preparing for their demise. They have taken on some responsibility for other publicly funded schemes that no longer exist, like the government's task force in East Birmingham. But they have only short lives ahead of them, so must foster arrangements for the future. Some partnerships will be adaptable, others might not survive beyond the immediate purpose for which many were set up. Local government has been pushed into the partnership mode by the very fact that it does not have the resources these days to strike out on its own. But councils across the region will probably prove to be the mainstay of many of these partnerships, because they are still better geared up to make things happen at the local level. They are also the only democratically elected element in partnerships. Birmingham, in particular, has had much experience with partnerships. Some councillors would like the Heartlands area to return to the sort of development agency partnership between private contractors and the city council which existed before the government turned it into a development corporation. But it would have to be adapted for the mid-1990s, which would suggest more partners than originally. The chamber of commerce has played an important role in city partnerships with an economic slant, and, with the Tec and the council, initiated one of the first Business Links in the country. Local government is having to be adaptable in working with others, in order to satisfy the European structural funds' masters, who want the emphasis to be on the region and sub-regions rather than individual councils. Partnership similarly requires a degree of agility if it is to make a real impact. The more partners there are, the greater the skill that is needed to reconcile what is attainable with over-ambitious goals.</p>

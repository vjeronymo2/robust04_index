			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Japan's top industrial policy official to quit The most senior bureaucrat in Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry is to resign, government officials announced last night. Mr Hideaki Kumano, who as Miti vice-minister is Japan's top industrial policy official and one of its top trade negotiators, is to step down after the end of the year, they said. No reason was given, but this appears to be the climax of a more than year-long power struggle between the bureaucracy and Japan's politicians, in which Mr Kumano is the most senior victim so far. Since the Liberal Democratic party returned to power six months ago, after a humiliating year in opposition, it has been seeking to reassert its authority over the public administration. Mr Kumano's political master, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Miti minister, also happens to be a rising and reputedly ruthless star in the LDP. Miti has been at the centre of this battle, because of the influence it exercises as controller of more licences and permits (1,769 at the latest government count) than any other ministry. Mr Kumano's resignation had been rumoured since the LDP's return in June, when several ministers in the incoming government called for a purge of senior bureaucrats who had used the political upheavals of the past year to boost the public administration's power. The government issued a warning at that time, rather than risk an open dispute with the bureaucracy. Mr Kumano is believed to have annoyed the party by failing, during the LDP's period out of power, to stop the forced resignation of Mr Masahisa Naito, an LDP sympathiser, as head of Miti's powerful industrial policy bureau. Mr Naito was ousted last December by former Miti minister Hiroshi Kumagai, now a member of the opposition New Frontier party and a close ally of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, NFP strategic mastermind. Mr Naito was alleged to have promoted a young Miti official, to improve his chances of winning a parliamentary seat for the LDP. Early this year, Mr Kumano had to make a public apology for a Miti document encouraging business organisations to comment favourably on an economic stimulus package issued by the government of the time. The document, criticised as an example of covert bureaucratic influence, may have further linked him to the present opposition in the mind of the LDP's Mr Hashimoto.</p>

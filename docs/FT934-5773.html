			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Co-operative Bank cards plan - At a Glance The Co-operative Bank has simplified and reduced the interest rates charged on its Robert Owen card, and affinity cards issued by the RSPB, Help the Aged, Amnesty International, the Labour Party, and the Liberal Democrats. From January 1 1994, there will be a single rate of 1.7 per cent a month (22.42 APR), down from the present rates of 1.85 per cent for direct debit payments and 2.35 per cent otherwise. The original structure involved three tiers relating to the amount spent on the card each month, but this was found to be too confusing.</p>

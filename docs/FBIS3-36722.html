ITAR-TASS was told at the Foreign Office that the head of  Britain's foreign affairs department called the exchange of  views "quite useful," but also asked Yerevan to take specific  measures to settle the conflict situation in this region, which  is causing justifiable concern in London.    Levon Ter-Petrosyan explained his country's position on this  problem and confirmed his support for the process of finding a  political settlement started within the CSCE framework which, in  his opinion, represents the best way to normalize the situation  in this region. The Armenian president said the Russian  Federation not only enjoys influence in the southern Caucasus  but "should play a key role there."</p>

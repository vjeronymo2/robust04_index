To Mr. Senator Vasile Vacaru, chairman of the Joint Standing  Commission of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate for  Parliamentary Control Over the Activity of the Romanian  Intelligence Service:    Regarding certain leaks of information from within the SRI  and the accusations against certain persons or groups of persons  whose actions might affect the national security, we state the  following:    Regarding the article "The Alarm Bell -- The Setting Up and  Functioning, Under the Guidance of Some Foreign Secret Services,  of an Organized Group Placed in Official Positions," published  in the weekly ROMANIA MARE No.185/1 Jan 1994, as well as in  connection with other such materials, we have the following to  say:    An examination of the ROMANIA MARE article reveals that it  was not based on secret information, which might have come from  our institution, but rather on information obtained from a  number of real situations, known to the public, such as:    -- The persons accused in the article have worked in various  former institutions (the Institute of Political Studies, the  Center of Military Theory and History, the Institute of World  Economy, or the International Law and International Relations  Association-ADIRI);    -- The official activities carried out by ADIRI and its  personnel, which also included links with institutions and  individuals abroad, especially from the United States and  England;    -- Scholarships granted by this institute for specialization  courses to two of the accused individuals;    -- The statements made by Messrs. Vasile Secares [rector of  the Romanian National School of Political and Administrative  Studies (SNSPA)] and Ioan Mircea Pascu [secretary of state at  the Ministry of National Defense] in their interviews with daily  AZI on 6 and 26 February 1990, full passages of which were taken  over (with a number of comments and interpretations by the  author of that article) by the magazine and actually represent  the substance of that article.    However, given the allegations about certain named  individuals and institutions belonging to some foreign  intelligence services, one can assume that the author of the  article has used the favors of certain former cadres of the  counterespionage of foreign intelligence services, who, by  putting together and interpreting certain data, arguments, and  suppositions, have managed to confer an aura of professionalism  on that article.    A possible argument in favor of this supposition is the fact  that, in the 1990-1992 period, similar accusations against other  political figures of those times -- Silviu Brucan, Dumitru  Mazilu [former top leaders of the post-1989 National Salvation  Front Council], and so forth -- were published by ROMANIA MARE  and the SPIONAJ-CONTRASPIONAJ [ESPIONAGE-COUNTERESPIONAGE]  magazine led by former Securitate General Neagu Cozma; the  authors of the incriminating articles must have had access to  material about individuals with connections abroad, known to  have belonged to the Third Directorate of the State Security  Department [DSS], who could be found in the files of retired  Major General Aurelian Mortoiu and retired Colonel Filip  Teodorescu, files that were taken over by Vice Admiral Stefan  Dinu, after his appointment to the command of the respective  union.    The SRI cannot be accused of consciously keeping silent  about  the matter raised, as claimed by Mr. Senator Eugen Dijmarescu  [of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front)] in his  letter sent to Romania's Senate, a letter that was presented to  us during our appearance before the Joint Standing Control  Commission on 9 February 1994.    That the SRI did not take an immediate official stand  vis-a-vis the respective press materials can be explained by the  fact that it had to conduct certain checks, which took time,  until final conclusions could be drawn, which rebutted the  allegations in the aforementioned article.    From the checks done so far, it results that the SRI has not  been and is not involved in any way in the mass-media  dissemination of the respective materials. The SRI itself is  the first one interested in blocking any leaks of information.    Regarding the publication by ROMANIA MARE of material about  alleged criminal activities by Major General Gheorghe Florica  [former general commissioner of the Financial Overseeing Body  until 1993], we state the following:    An investigation into the activities of an Arab citizen,  known to belong to an extremist-terrorist group operating on  Romania's territory, has shown that he had criminal links both  with the former chief of the Financial Oversight Body and with  other Romanian citizens and foreigners.    In this respect, all proof collected by our service was  forwarded to the relevant state institutions authorized to take  appropriate steps in this respect and were used by them in  resolving their cases.    The study and examination of the material published by  ROMANIA MARE reveal that some of the data sent to the legal  consumers (various institutions) was at the basis of the  articles published by Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor. (As a  matter of fact, our institution will continue its investigation  to establish the way in which this data, which was not meant for  publication, has been disseminated.    Regarding the letter sent to you by George Sergiu Rizescu,  deputy of the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party  [PNTCD] from Arges, who asks that one should clarify his alleged  collaboration with the former Securitate and the SRI, we state  the following:    EVENIMENTUL ZILEI on 11 July 1992 published some material  from the archives of the former Arges County Securitate branch  regarding certain informer files, which also included the names  of certain PNTCD leaders from Arges.    The same issue of the newspaper published the transcript of  a  recording -- registration number 0012806 of 3 March 1992 --  belonging to the Arges County Intelligence Section, which  contains references to Mr. Deputy Sergiu George Rizescu, who, on  one occasion, allegedly told his entourage about the PNTCD's  position vis-a-vis the parliamentary elections due to be held in  1992.    The results of the investigation carried out by the SRI to  elucidate this case were at the basis of legal suit No. 302576  of 20 July 1992 started by the SRI against EVENIMENTUL ZILEI  editors Dan Andronic and Ion Cristoiu for disclosure of state  secrets as well as against Lieutenant Colonel Emilian Oprescu,  active officer at the Arges County Intelligence Section, for  negligence shown in keeping state secrets.    The case is being investigated by the military prosecuting  magistracies of the General Prosecutor Magistracy of the supreme  Court of Justice, under penal file No. 395/P/1992.    As shown by the text of transcript of recording No. 0012806  of 3 June 1992 published in daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, Mr. Deputy  Rizescu has not been and is no "source of information" for our  institution.    On the other hand, the checks we have conducted in the  archives of the former Securitate -- documents that can be  accessed to in accordance with the provisions of Article 45,  Paragraph 4 of Law No. 14 -- show that Mr. Deputy Sergiu George  Rizescu has not been part of the Securitate's network of  informers.    Constantly concerned with ensuring the protection of the  information it holds (a specialized body in charge of this task  is actually operating within our institution) and with  drastically and promptly punishing any violations in this  respect, the SRI emphasizes the urgent need to elaborate a set  of rules in order to protect the data and information not  intended for publication.    By the same token, the appearance of press material that  undoubtedly uses data from the aforementioned category requires  investigation at the level of all state institutions where such  leaks might occur. The SRI is directly responsible only for its  own violations from the rules governing the circulation of data  and information that constitute a state secret and are not meant  for publication.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / International Company News: Banks cautious over O&amp;Y funding for Canary Wharf OLYMPIA &amp; York's bankers are likely to provide Pounds 15m (Dollars 26.55m) to allow work at the Canary Wharf development in east London to continue to the end of May only. O&amp;Y had been hoping to receive a Pounds 110m facility from a group of 11 banks, which have provided loans of about Pounds 1bn for the Canary Wharf project. This Pounds 110m would have been enough to finance Canary Wharf's costs for 90 days, during which O&amp;Y hoped to conclude negotiations on a reorganisation of its worldwide debt of CDollars 14.3bn (USDollars 12bn). However, the 11 banks - including Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover of the US, Credit Suisse of Switzerland, Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Canada, Barclays and Lloyds of the UK - do not believe they have been given good enough information on the financial health of Olympia &amp; York Developments, O&amp;Y's parent company. So they are only prepared to provide Pounds 15m, which they hope will be sufficient to meet Canary Wharf's needs to the end of May. However, the bankers who negotiated the deal have to receive the permission of their senior directors before the money can be disbursed. Therefore, O&amp;Y is unlikely to be told that it has been given the facility till after the weekend. In case O&amp;Y runs out of cash before the Pounds 15m facility is formally approved, bankers are providing a much smaller emergency line of credit. O&amp;Y tried to raise CDollars 100m (USDollars 84.7m) to finance its operations in Canada, where it has its headquarters. But a group of Canadian banks, including Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, refused to provide the full amount. They are allowing O&amp;Y to draw on about CDollars 20m. Meanwhile, Mr Steve Miller, the investment banker who is in charge of O&amp;Y negotiations with its banks, has returned to New York for a weekend meeting to formulate the details of O&amp;Y's reorganisation plan. Mr Miller has been concentrating on persuading banks to provide sufficient new facilities to allow the company to continue working. Now O&amp;Y, led by the founder Mr Paul Reichmann, has to provide banks with detailed proposals relating to how much of its interest payments it needs to defer and how long it wants to cease payments of principal.</p>

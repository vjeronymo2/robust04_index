			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unnatributed article: "Nine Questions for the Russian </F> President's Team"]    [Text] Last week's publication of a document proposing the  creation of military bases on the soil of the Russsian  Federation, the CIS member countries, and Latvia leaves a number  of questions unanswered.    1. How could the document be passed from the RF Ministry of  Defense to the president's administration, if Minister of  Defense Pavel Grachev knew nothing about it?    2. Why is it mentioned in the document that the MID  [Ministry  of Foreign Affairs] is informed of the initiative, while this  ministry in reality had no knowledge of it whatsoever? Why did  the document, (which is directly concerned with foreign policy),  not receive the stamp of approval by the very ministry involved  with foreign policy?    3. How is it that, in the president's administration, the  document bypassed the people who are directly involved with  coordinating Russia's foreign policy actions and who are  responsible for the president maintaining communication with the  MID and RF MO [Ministry of Defense]? It would definitely appear  that they should be informed of all initiatives associated with  these ministries.    4. Why indeed did the president, who is informed of the  progress made in the talks being held between Russia and Latvia,  sign the document?    5. Why is it that the document (the text is not an issue  here), in which the RF MID and the MO were to merely hold the  attendant TALKS with the CIS member countries and Latvia, did  not bear the secret security classification?    6. How did the document fall into the hands of ITAR-TASS?    7. The failure to coordinate the actions taken by the MO,  MID, and president's administration became an object of scrutiny  by the press twice in 10 days (counting as the first time the  changing of the day of signing of the Partnership for Peace),  smacking of a scandal. What is this? Deep political differences  which cannot be kept hidden, or is it bureaucratic confusion  carried to absurdity?    8. Who (other than the Ministry of Defense clerk who  included  Latvia in the list of states on whose territory it is proposed  to create Russian military bases) will be held responsible for  what has happened? It must be realized that the scandal not only  reinforces the world's thinking that Russia's foreign and  domestic policy is unpredictable, but it also exerts a direct  influence on the political, economic, and social conditions  attending the Russian-speaking minority residing in the Baltics.    9. Can it be guaranteed that the same thing will not occur  in  the future?    Any citizen of Russia can and does ask himself the above  questions. And if it so happens that an "explanation via  diplomatic channels" satisfies Riga, this would definitely be  insufficient as far as the Russian public is concerned.</p>

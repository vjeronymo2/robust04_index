			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: An MP who won't answer DESPITE writing repeatedly to my member of parliament about the unprofessional manner in which the Inland Revenue has dealt with my tax affairs, he either fails to reply or gets his secretaries to reply (clearly, they have not bothered to read my correspondence). I have asked for the matter to be referred to the ombudsman but, again, my MP failed to reply. Can you provide me with the address of the income tax/Inland Revenue ombudsman? Second, is there an independent body to which one can write with a complaint about an MP's attitude. It seems ridiculous that an MP can simply fail to do his job for his constituents. The address of the Revenue Adjudicator, Elizabeth Filkin, is 3rd Floor, 28 Haymarket, London, SW1Y 4SP. The phone number is 071-930 2292. As a first step, ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR120 (You and the Inland Revenue) if you have not yet seen a copy. MP are free agents - indeed, they are even free to decide not to go near the House of Commons between election and the next dissolution, and to ignore all correspondence. Those who voted for them must accept the consequences of their choice, as must all their other constituents. In defence of your MP, we should point out that the volume of correspondence received by most of them would overwhelm many business people. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

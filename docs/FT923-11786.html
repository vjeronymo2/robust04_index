			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Mexico current account deficit at 20-year high MEXICO'S current account deficit climbed to Dollars 4.4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in the first quarter, the highest in 20 years and 143 per cent more than in the same period last year, according to the Bank of Mexico. Unless import growth falls sharply over the year the government will miss its official target of Dollars 13bn for 1992 by some way. Mr Rogelio Ramirez de la O, of the consultancy Ecanal, believes the deficit for the year will be Dollars 20bn, or 6.4 per cent of estimated GDP. The trade deficit during the first quarter was Dollars 4bn, 127 per cent higher than in the same period in 1991, reflecting a growth of just 0.6 per cent in exports and a 27.7 per cent increase in imports. However, manufacturing exports grew by 16.8 per cent, an indication of the continued strength of the industrial sector. Most of the increase in imports was due to capital goods purchased by Mexican companies, which the government has explained as part of the necessary restructuring of the Mexican economy. There are signs that the rate of increase in the current account deficit is slowing. The deficit in the first quarter was 5.3 per cent higher than that in the final period of 1991. This year's first-quarter deficit was easily covered by a surplus in the capital account of Dollars 5.157m, of which 27.5 per cent was direct physical investment and the remainder portfolio investment.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Gardening: That old witch hazel magic - Hampshire's Hillier Arboretum casts a fresh spell over Robin Lane Fox WHEN local authorities have a gardening budget, they usually make fools of themselves: they put hanging baskets down old streets, chopped bark on roundabouts, and trees at a density of five to the square metre. I am happy to put the opposite case. In 1977, Hampshire county council accepted responsibility for 160 acres of trees, shrubs and mowing bequeathed to it by one of the kings among nurserymen, HG Hillier. Nobody knew what would happen. Late in winter, you might have expected hectares of heather and universal pansies. You would be wrong. I have just spent an afternoon walking around a pre-run of heaven, sustained by council funds and a discreet balance of management. In two hours, I have seen more flowers than I will have grown myself by mid-April. If your spirits are low, head for Ampfield, near Romsey. In the Hillier arboretum, camellias are open already beyond the lake; among the winter honeysuckles, Lonicera setifera will test the experts; and you ought to be in time for two extraordinary spectacles: a daphne from the Himalayas and dozens of witch hazels shining like stars through the mist. Since 1977, the council has not compromised or made the arboretum worse. It has survived the storms and gained in height, maturity and coherence. Harold Hillier had planned a certain amount and planted even more: like Topsy, his arboretum just grew, and he probably did not think about the width of a gang mower or every ultimate vista through the thujas. His gardens had some firm, straight walks, a lovely lake, and raised beds of gravel near the main house. Design was only one consideration, though. The other was variety: as a result, the garden now includes more than 100 of the champion trees in Hampshire and over 100 listed rarities including one, a rather dismal conifer, which is believed to be extinct in the wild. The council's budget is well over six figures and supports 12 gardeners, a distinguished curator, and the necessary work of clearing, inspiring and opening up. The council can be proud of it and deserves a round of national applause. Hampshire head-scarves have a way of kidnapping the early places on the arboretum's popular weekend workshops; but anyone can visit and you can become a Friend for Pounds 10 a year. Meanwhile, visitors continue to pile in, increasing as healthily as the birch trees. Under the general slogan of education, the county must also reckon on quiet, personal visits when somebody looks, thinks and decides to go away and imitate. I sound confident about this aspect because it has happened to me twice at this place. Once was on a spring day three years ago when the magnolias opened all at once and hundreds of Weekend FT readers set off to see them. The second was the week before last when, admittedly, the arboretum committee gave me lunch  -although I do not think the lunch was to blame. Our tour was not a laid-back affair. It was the sort of afternoon when angular figures in anoraks might ask if you thought a particular birch tree was costata or ermanii and, if you were not sure, they would ask someone else instead. There were no bimbettes, no rides on runabouts: just a covey of gardeners and botanists, one woman in a mackintosh hat, and an inability to stay in a bunch because our guides Roy, Chris and Tony kept finding something more interesting about 50 yards away. The point of the meeting was to view the collection of witch hazels and, just to be sure, I had checked them before lunch. They are quite marvellous and their flowers, like frost-proof strips of papery textile, ought to be hanging on even now. The pale yellow forms have stood up best to the wet winter and, anyway, I prefer them to the coppery reds and oranges with bouncy, female names. Most of this family spread widely - too widely for front gardens, when they have to be pruned. In an arboretum, a Hamamelis can develop its full stature. It can also show its full range, because new forms have been bred from Belgium to America and you need to see a collection in order to anticipate the best. If you live on a soil without too much lime, try Hamamelis pallida, which is an exquisite shade of lemon yellow; Sunburst, which has a tinge of green to the lemon; or a dark yellow one called Vesna, which is remarkably scented but has yet to make a mark in the trade. In Japan, these shrubs grow wild in woodland clearings; and although they will survive and flower on lime, they are much happier without it and also turn a better colour in autumn. If money and supply were no object, I would choose Sunburst, while noticing that Advent flowers very early and the self-explanatory Goldcrest much later, extending the season through 2 1/2 months. Witch hazels have nothing to do with witchcraft. Their name means flexible or pliant and the only magic in them is their scent, which is strong on a clear winter's day. Under council management they are a marvellous sight, and perhaps it is enough to be able to visit them, even if you cannot grow them. But there is something even better. We had already admired a fine white Abeliophyllum from Korea and the insiders were being matey with one of the under-gardeners. Turning left, I entered another world. By a grass path stood an evergreen daphne, over 4ft high and wide, smothered in scented flowers of a pale pink. Sometimes, these close encounters make you want to turn a somersault. In late winter, not far from the beastly old A31, here was a form of the Nepalese daphne bholua, bursting in all directions with flowers of colour and quality which I had never seen before. There are other, rather sparse forms of this famous shrub from the Indian continent, but this particular variety is highly personal to the arboretum. Its parents were conveyed to Hillier by runners from the hills during a visit to Nepal. Back in Hampshire, they set seed; and Alan Postill, a sharp-eyed propagator on the nursery, noticed how some of the seedlings looked better than others. He selected the best and called it Jacqueline Postill, since when it has won many prizes including a First Class Certificate. Can you and I grow it? Opinions divide on its tastes and hardiness. Roy Lancaster tells me that it needs a south or west wall, that it can be pruned quite hard, but that it prefers little or no lime. The head gardener at the arboretum thinks Roy might be wrong because he himself grows it on an open slope of chalk above the centre of Winchester. Nonetheless, Roy thinks that readers with lime in their garden should not expect miracles. At present, I am inclined to follow the arboretum's head gardener, having just seen a flourishing specimen on the alkaline rock garden at St John's College in Oxford; whatever you might expect from that rock garden, it is certainly not the sight of miracles. But daphne Jacqueline Postill is a scarce plant at present, its price ranging between Pounds 16 and Pounds 25. In mid-winter it is worth anything, not least a visit to Romsey. Without the Hillier family, without Hampshire county council and without the skill of the arboretum's staff, we would not have this extraordinary, winter-flowering shrub for which our great-grandchildren will bless us. Forget those grumbles about marigolds, begonias in baskets and love-lies-bleeding on the roundabouts: in Hampshire, a council still knows how to support the best in gardening.</p>

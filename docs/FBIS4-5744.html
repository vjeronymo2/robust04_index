			<p>BFN     [Text] The Central Ideological Agencies Bloc party  organization opened its third mid-term party conference in Hanoi  this morning. Comrade Nguyen Duc Binh, member of the Political  Bureau and secretary of the party Central Committee, attended  and addressed the conference.    According to the report presented by the Central Ideological  Agencies Bloc party organization's executive committee, for more  than two years now, ideological, cultural, and artistic  activities have helped to motivate everyone to step up  production and score achievements in all fields. The report  also pointed out a number of drawbacks that need to be overcome.    Based on past achievements and shortcomings, the report set  forth the key orientations for 1994-95 as follows: It is  necessary to satisfactorily implement the party Central  Committee's resolutions on the need to carry out ideological,  cultural, and artistic activities aimed at shifting the country  to a new stage of development through the implementation of a  national industrialization and modernization program based on  socialist orientations.    The report stressed the importance of party-building  activities. It is necessary for all party organizations to  concentrate efforts on enhancing party militancy; overcoming the  danger of socialist disorientation; fighting all indications of  waste, red tape, and corruption; eliminating the danger of being  left behind; and foiling the enemy's peaceful evolution  strategy. It is particularly important for party chapters to  devise practical and interesting party activities to make them  appeal to the masses.    Speaking on this occasion, Comrade Nguyen Duc Binh pointed  out the important role of ideological and cultural activities in  enhancing party militancy. It is necessary to make cadres,  party members, and the entire people clearly understand that  given the country's new development stage, everyone must strive  to overcome difficulties, step up production, and avoid the  danger of being left behind. It is important for theoretical  agencies to draw practical experiences from national and  international developments at an early date. It is equally  important for the mass media to step up propaganda activities  aimed at making the people sharpen their determination and at  encouraging businessmen to improve their skills. It is  particularly important for the Central Ideological Agencies Bloc  party organization to make everyone clearly understand the  enemy's peaceful evolution strategy aimed at creating political  unrest and at undermining our national development efforts.    Also at today's session, many delegates expressed their  views, further clarifying the causes leading to problems and  suggesting measures to carry out the tasks for the days ahead.    The conference is scheduled to last for two days.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Irish Sea gas field project approved BRITISH GAS yesterday received official permission from the Department of Energy to develop its North Morecambe gas field in the Irish Sea, Juliet Sychrava writes. The field is about 25 miles off the Lancashire coast close to the larger South Morecambe field. It will produce at a rate of 588m cu ft a day, or about 5 per cent of UK gas consumption, and is expected to start output in October 1994. British Gas has already started work on a new Pounds 295m terminal to handle the gas, next to its existing terminal at Barrow-in-Furness. The total value of the project is estimated at just more than Pounds 500m.</p>

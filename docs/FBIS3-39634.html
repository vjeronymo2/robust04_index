			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Geir Salvesen: "EU Seeking Norwegian </F> Flexibility"]    [Text] "The EU [European Union] Commission has tried to  reach out a hand to Norway over the whaling issue -- but its  gesture has not been reciprocated," an EU bureaucrat has said.    Laurens Brinkhorst, who is director general of the  environmental protection directorate under the EU Commission,  finds it hard to conceal his amazement at Norway's negotiating  strategy. Instead of accepting an opt-out clause which would  give Norway permission to catch whales for a two-year trial  period, Norway has responded to the EU with total "radio  silence," as he put it.    The Norwegian side takes the view that the proposal from the  EU has not been made officially -- and that it is really only  about the right of access which all have to opt-out arrangements  in EU rules. The objection has been voiced that Norway will not  be able to decide the future of Norwegian whaling independently,  because the EU side will the whole time have a right of veto.    But given the way spokesmen for the Commission are now  choosing their words, an opening is being left for Norway to  continue whaling for minke whales for a two-year period.  Thereafter there will be an environmental investigation of  several criteria -- such as size of minke whale stocks, the  amount of fish they eat, and so on. It will then be decided  whether Norway can continue whaling. In the view of the European  Commission, this means that a lifeline has been left.    Signals from central Norwegian sources in negotiating  circles  indicate that in the final phase of the EU negotiations Norway  is willing to consider solutions like these that prevent a  head-on collision between Norway and the EU. But the two sides  have not as yet come to grips with each other in the  negotiations proper. This could happen as early as tomorrow at  one of the negotiating meetings in Brussels.    EU Director General Laurens Brinkhorst has already been to  Norway and talked to Industry and Energy Minister Jens  Stoltenberg and Environment Ministry Under Secretary of State  Borre Pettersen, among others.</p>

The vehicles belong to the U.S. organization Pastors for  Peace, which advocates the lifting of the blockade imposed by  the United States on Cuba 33 years ago.    Israel Garza Salinas, a spokesman for customs in Nuevo  Laredo, which is located in Mexico's northeastern Tamaulipas  State, said the pickups were detained because they lacked and  their owners have already initiated the process for their  recovery. [sentence as received]    The pickups are loaded with $2,000 worth of books,  typewriters, computers, medicine, and a parabolic antenna. They  will be shipped to Cuba from the port of Tampico, Tamaulipas.    The cargo is part of the humanitarian aid which, earlier  this  month, the U.S. authorities prevented the pastors from sending  to Mexico for later shipment to Cuba.    Garza said the U.S. authorities allege that the cargo of  both  vehicles was taken to Mexico secretly in violation of a U.S. law  banning the shipment of strategic material to Cuba.    He said the Mexican authorities granted facilities so  Pastors  for Peace could bring the two pickups into Mexico on condition  that they would request permits to do so and would pay a  symbolic tariff.    On 9 March the Pastors for Peace caravan crossed into Mexico  with 68 vehicles and 140 tons of humanitarian aid for Cuba.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Bank lending fall underlines fragility of Japan's recovery Japan's official economic forecaster yesterday upgraded its outlook slightly, but the fragility of the recovery was underlined by a record fall in bank lending last month. Bright economic spots are continuing to spread, said the Economic Planning Agency's monthly report for October. It pointed as evidence to a 'gradual uptrend' in industrial production and 'signs of a pick-up' in corporate profits. This contrasts with September, when the economy was seen heading for recovery, the first official recognition of the end of Japan's three-year economic downturn, the longest in post-war years. Subtle changes in wording from one EPA report to the next are closely watched as an influence on monetary policy. So the Bank of Japan can be expected to take the latest prognosis as further evidence that it has no domestic economic reason to cut official interest rates, despite the dollar's renewed fall last week to a record low against the yen. The EPA's cautious optimism is the latest sign that Japan's economic cycle has slowly turned, as Y45,000bn (Pounds 286bn) of government spending programmes over the past two years and an income tax cut last summer have started to feed through into corporate activity and private spending. On the corporate front, industrial production rose 1.6 per cent in the three months to September, the third quarterly rise in a row. Meanwhile, the jobs market has become slightly less weak, shown by a rise, for two months in a row, in the number of jobs available per 100 applicants, from 63 in August to 64 in September. The labour market is still tough, especially in manufacturing, which em-ployed fewer people than services in September for the first time recorded, but the worst is over, said an EPA official. Yet the fall in bank lending, announced by Federation of Bankers' Associations yesterday, is equally a sign that consumption may be lagging and that banks' lending policies continue to get tighter. The balance of lending by the 11 'city banks', the country's main retail banks, fell by a record 1.8 per cent in October from a year earlier, the tenth consecutive monthly fall, and the largest year-on-year decline since the statistics were first collected in 1954. The fall was blamed on weak demand for personal housing loans, consumer credit and corporate capital investment funds. The rapid growth in problem loans produced by the collapse of property and other asset prices in the last few years has at the same time forced banks to adopt a more cautious approach to domestic loans. Over a quarter of all lending by top banks is secured on property. Land prices have kept falling in the main cities in the past year; as a result banks have reduced credit lines to many smaller customers. Lending by the three long-term credit banks fell 0.9 per cent from a year before, but loans from the seven smaller trust banks registered 4.5 per cent up on a year ago.</p>

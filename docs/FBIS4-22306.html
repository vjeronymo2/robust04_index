			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with State Duma Deputy Aleksandr Nevzorov by </F> Andrey Uglanov; place and date not given; under the rubric  "Special Opinion": "A. Nevzorov, the Deputy"]    [Text] It has been said so many times--that combating  crime is the No. 1 task. M. Gorbachev, B. Yeltsin, R.  Khasbulatov, A. Rutskoy, and V. Chernomyrdin all said it. A.  Nevzorov, "600 Seconds" anchor, has also devoted a considerable  part of his life to combating crime--through television. Today  he is a Duma deputy from St. Petersburg and member of its  Committee on Security.    [Nevzorov] The recipe for combating crime is extremely  concise and sounds, shall we say, unacceptable to your  democratic ears. It is called "Comrade Stalin." It is the only  possible, 100 percent option for defeating crime.    [Uglanov] Can you be more specific? Zhirinovskiy, for  instance, believes it necessary to introduce courts martial.    [Nevzorov] This is good when you have qualified  executioners.  They, unfortunately, also are in great shortage, because the  executioners of the hated 1934 were guided by high ideological  motives. Which are absent now. That society was healthy in  comparison with ours. It was ugly, lopsided, but healthy. Now  that all this social pus is oozing from every hole...    [Uglanov] This is a general condition. I am interested in  concrete steps. Would perhaps tightening the Criminal Code help?    [Nevzorov] In the Committee on Security I oversee foreign  intelligence. My task is to let it work unimpeded. As to  Criminal Code articles and tightening them, it is not all  straight and clear. S. Stepashin, for instance, came up with a  proposal to make mercenarism a crime. But I will do everything I  can to keep this article from getting into the Criminal Code in  its current form. Can you, for instance, to draw a clear line  between the notions of "mercenary" and "volunteer"?    [Uglanov] It is probably a question of money, is it not?    [Nevzorov] No. You arrive at the designated place. You are  given a pea-jacket. It now costs 100,000. You eat a bowl of  porridge. How much does this cost? If you add it all up, it  comes to no less that the cost of having a Russian boy fighting  in Karabakh. Therefore, even such attempts to tighten the  Criminal Code are very imperfect.    As to the recipe for combating crime, it does not and cannot  exist. We are a criminal state. A state that entered a new level  with the shelling of the parliament on 4 October.    [Uglanov] In the past you were a television program anchor;  now you are a lawmaker. Now your task is to prevent violations  of the law rather than register them.    [Nevzorov] I am at a loss here because, first, I cannot  answer for the entire Committee on Security. Second, I  deliberately agreed to be thrown into this  line--intelligence--rather than combating crime. Because I am  convinced that in this fight we are doomed to fail. Sooner or  later we will still have to capitulate to them. And live through  a situation where legitimized criminals will take power anyway.  We cannot stop now. Do you see a way to stop, to win? I do not.    [Uglanov] Regarding foreign intelligence. It has been headed  for some time now by Ye. Primakov. Is it your goal to replace  this man?    [Nevzorov] No. Frankly, this is an area of activity, an area  of applying one's abilities in which politics should have no  place. Sympathies and antipathies are inappropriate here.  Because the agency lives. It may be one-hundredth of the old  strength, but it is still the successor to greatest intelligence  service in the world. Primakov is far from the saboteur my  "friends" in the opposition camp want to see him as. He is a  very complex man. As I understand it, he is not an enemy of this  country.    [Uglanov] Regarding the Ames case. Could the disclosure of  this Russian agent in the United States be the result of one of  Ye. Primakov's deputies reporting it to the other side?    [Nevzorov] Do you really think I will tell you anything? On  top of everything else, I have signed an official nondisclosure  pledge.    [Uglanov] Where is your journalistic destiny heading now?    [Nevzorov] I am lucky. I have an opportunity to "shed my  skin." This is rare for a journalist. I have the opportunity now  to look into things in depth and seriously, to build some new  bridges.    [Uglanov] What will happen to "600 Seconds"?    [Nevzorov] I do not think that the program could be  resurrected now in its old form. For the reason that I spend  most of my time in Moscow now.    [Uglanov] But do you have such plans?    [Nevzorov] I think so. We have to sort out the story  regarding bribes on Petersburg television. Unfortunately, I will  not be doing it myself. And anyway, it would be strange for me,  a State Duma deputy, to devote my time to petty bureaucrat B.  Kurkova. To find out whether she stole anything or not. I think  the proper organs will sort this out.</p>

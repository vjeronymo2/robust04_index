			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Drugs, telecoms seen as spur to EU growth Pharmaceuticals, telecoms, computer and office equipment, and plastics processing are among the six leading growth sectors in European industry, according to a study published yesterday by the European Commission. The 1,400-page report says a surge in demand for health services, the drive toward a new 'information society', as well as rapid expansion of car manufacturing and electronic engineering, were the engines of growth between 1986 and 1992. But a source of worry is the widespread fall in European companies' average profit ratio as a result of weaker world growth, stronger competition and high real interest rates. European companies are also failing to keep pace with their Japanese and US competitors in investment in the fast-growing east Asian economies, according to the 5th edition of the Panorama of EU industry*. One of the EU's success stories, nevertheless, is in the world pharmaceutical market, where it is the leading producer. Production rose 44 per cent (in constant prices) since 1987, while the US and Japan increased their level by 8 per cent and 17 per cent respectively. As a result, in 1992, the value of EU production was about a third higher than that of the US and double Japan's. In telecommunications, the report predicts growth of 6 per cent a year, boosted by new technologies and liberalisation of data services and mobile communications. The total information services market in the EU could reach Ecus244bn (Pounds 195bn) by 1997, with telecoms accounting for Ecu136bn. The computer industry is undergoing a downturn, with large indigenous suppliers such as Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany, Groupe Bull of France and Olivetti of Italy losing money amid radical restructuring, the report says. But it predicts Europeans may be well placed to exploit the trend to smaller data processing machines. Eco-industries have strong growth potential. The report says Greece, Portugal and Spain are projected to have the highest rates because they will have to invest to meet EU legislative targets. Market growth estimates among the southern Europeans range from 7.4 per cent to 8.3 per cent; but growth in the UK, France, Italy and Belgium is likely to be only moderate and may have already peaked in Germany and the Netherlands. The report predicts demand in waste management and land reclamation are likely to increase, while the share of the water treatment and air pollution control equipment sectors is likely to decline - partly because of the Commission decision to adapt legislation to match demands for subsidiarity (devolving decision-making to member states from Brussels).

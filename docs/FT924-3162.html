			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Mansfield Brewery up to Pounds 6.7m MANSFIELD Brewery, the Yorkshire and east Midlands brewer, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds Pounds 6.36m to Pounds 6.67m in the 26 weeks to September 26. Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 60.8m (Pounds 59m). Mr Joss Nangle, acting chairman since the death of Mr Geoffrey Kent in September, said that sales volumes of draught beers advanced by 4.3 per cent against an estimated regional decline of 3.5 per cent. The success with draught sales, along with 'continued strong control over costs' resulted in trading profits up 13 per cent at Pounds 6.65m. This was struck after a Pounds 900,000 provision for bad and doubtful debts in the free trade. Earnings per share inched up to 28.8p (28.4p) and the interim dividend is lifted 10 per cent to 4.4p (4p).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Beijing will speed up  the establishment of a socialist market economy this year, Mayor  Li Qiyan said here today.    Li made the remark at the second session of the eighth  municipal people's congress opened here today.    Li said that more effective measures will be explored to  push  forward the modern enterprise system. A group of well-performed  large and medium-sized enterprises will be selected to have a  trial operation of the modern enterprise system.    More experiments will be done to promote the share-holding  system. Five enterprises in Beijing will be listed abroad,  according to the mayor.

Small state-owned enterprises will go through various  reforms  such as leasing operation, joint-stock holding and selling  properties by auction, Li said.    A network of markets will be developed with emphasis on the  establishment of a capital goods market, the mayor said.    This year, the city will mainly develop and improve edible  oil and commodity exchanges, chemicals, steel, automobile, coal  and building material markets.    Financial and property markets will also be developed while  promoting technology, information, labour and futures markets.    The city will accelerate legislation to keep the markets in  good order, Li added.    A macro-economy control system will be established in the  city. Specialized banks will be shifted to commercial banks, and  financial insurance system will be promoted.    The city plans to set up a development bank, a merchant bank  and an urban and rural cooperative bank. Foreign and  joint-venture banks and the Beijing securities trading center  are also expected to be established in the city this year.    Beijing will work hard to promote its insurance and welfare  system. A new system will be built up to guarantee a normal  increase of pensions for the retirees.

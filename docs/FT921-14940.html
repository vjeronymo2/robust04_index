			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Wage gap 'wider than in 1886' THE GAP between the earnings of the highest and lowest-paid employees is wider today than it was in Victorian times, according to an analysis of official figures carried out for the Council of Europe by the Low Pay Unit pressure group. According to the LPU analysis, the lowest tenth of male earnings was 68.6 per cent of median male earnings in 1886, when pay figires were first recorded. In 1991 the figure had dropped to 64.2 per cent. At the same time, the highest tenth of male earnings were 143.1 per cent of the median in 1886 and 160.1 per cent in 1991, the figures show. More than 27 per cent of full-time workers earn less than the LPU's low pay threshold - set at two thirds of average male earnings - even when overtime pay is included, according to the group. The Labour has set an ultimate target for the level of a proposed national minimum wage of two-thirds average earnings. Its immediate target if it wins the next general election is for a minimum wage to match half average earnings. The study also found that progress towards equal pay between men and women was slow during the 1980s and, although gains have been made recently, at the current rate it will still take 55 years for women's weekly earnings to reach those of men. Women working full-time still earn, on average, only 70 per cent of men's pay, the LPU reported. New Review No 13. Available from Low Pay Unit, 9 Upper Berkeley St, London W1H 8BY. Price pounds 3.50.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Georgian troops secure rebel city GEORGIAN troops yesterday tightened their hold on Sukhumi, the capital of the breakaway Black Sea resort region of Abkhazia, after three days of fighting left at least 50 people dead. The streets of Sukhumi, which until Monday were filled with thousands of Russian holidaymakers, were littered yesterday with burnt-out tanks and downed trees. Georgian troops were clearly in control, and although there were no civilian vehicles on the road, the population appeared relaxed, with old men and women smiling and waving at jeeploads of passing soldiers. Brig-Gen Zurad Nairashvili of the Georgian army said Mr Vladislav Ardzinba, the deposed Abkhazian leader, was holed up in the town of Gudauta, 80km north of Sukhumi, protected by 1,500 men. There was no indication whether Mr Ardzinba would receive help from his ally, nearby Chechnya, which is an autonomous region within Russia. 'We shall fight until we win our freedom or they annihilate us,' Mr Zarab Achba, a member of the Abkhazian parliament, told Itar-Tass news agency. He was speaking from Gudauta, where many Abkhazian deputies fled as Georgian tanks and troops occupied Sukhumi on Tuesday. Gen Nairashvili said the rebels had killed eight Georgian soldiers during Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, bringing the death toll in fighting to more than 50 since Monday. Georgian troops attacked Sukhumi after the Abkhaz parliament indicated it wanted to declare the republic, part of Georgia, an independent state. Georgians emphasise that only 18 per cent of the population in the region is Abkhaz. The conflict has confronted Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, with his most serious political crisis since taking charge in Georgia five months ago.</p>

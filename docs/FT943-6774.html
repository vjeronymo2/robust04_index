			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Argentina drops blast accusations Argentina's Supreme Court yesterday dropped accusations against Iranian officials who were named over an anti-Jewish bomb attack last month in which nearly 100 people died, Reuter reports from Buenos Aires. The court decided there was insufficient evidence against the officials and voted topass the case back to inves-tigating Judge Juan Jose Galeano, members of the court said. In his report on the bombing, Judge Galeano named four Iranian officials as wanted in connection with the July 18 attack that razed Argentina's main Jewish community centre. Under Argentine law, the Supreme Court would take on the case if foreign diplomats or officials were suspected to be involved.</p>

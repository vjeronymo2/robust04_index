			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Flaws in the German model  -How a statutory system works in practice British businesses clamouring for a statutory right to interest on overdue bills often look to Germany as a model. But since the recession set in there it is more common to hear the German experience cited by UK opponents of legislation as an example of why it would not work. In Germany suppliers have recourse in the courts against late payers, and can charge a legally-specified rate of interest on overdue accounts. Under commercial law the supplier may charge interest of 5 per cent on overdue amounts once it has issued three reminders (the last one typically a formal warning of late payment) or when payment has not been made by a mutually agreed date. The problem is the practice. 'The 5 per cent level was fixed a long time ago and is not commercially realistic,' says Carl August Hartmann, at Dr Kocke &amp; Partner. 'It is possible to obtain from the courts a further payment designed to compensate for interest payments that you yourself are obliged to pay at commercial rates as a result of the customer's late payment.' In practice few companies exercise their legal rights - to do so would be deemed a hostile gesture which would jeopardise normal commercial relations with a customer. As a result the late payment problem has got worse during the economic downturn, and is partly responsible for the increase in corporate insolvencies in Germany this year to a new post-war peak. In an effort to make UK legislation workable, campaigners may argue that the interest claimed against a customer - possibly a punitive one  - should be accrued until the day the company ceases to be a supplier. At that point the claim would be presented. Unreformed late-paying customers might also be required to include any late payment interest that they might one day be called to pay as a contingent liability on their balance sheets. The accounts of some of the UK's largest companies would therefore make interesting reading.</p>

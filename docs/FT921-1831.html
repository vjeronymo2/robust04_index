			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Silver service - Ballot Box Belton House has finally got its silver back. When Mrs Thatcher became prime minister, she was appalled at the poor quality of the porcelain and plate on hand at Downing Street to service visiting world leaders. She coveted the fabulous 18th century Brownlow silver, the pride of Belton House, an ancestral seat close to her Grantham home. Lord Brownlow was only too happy to oblige and loaned some of the service to Number 10. Then, a few years later, he decided to become a tax exile and sold up, with the National Trust acquiring both house and contents. The trust was shy to ask Mrs Thatcher for its silver back, but once John Major was installed in Downing Street there was no problem. He has commissioned modern British crafted silver and was happy to return the antiques. The National Trust has discovered that the silver has been well used. When the public gets to see the united collection from April 1, it will be easy to spot the pieces off which the famous fed at No 10.</p>

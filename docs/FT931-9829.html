			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: NHL to repay Pounds 120m bond issue on time NATIONAL Home Loans, the centralised mortgage lender, yesterday signalled confidence in its prospects of recovery by announcing that it intended to repay Pounds 120.1m in D-Mark bond issues on time rather than rescheduling the debt. The shares firmed  3/4 p to 6 1/4 p. The group said it had postponed rescheduling offers to holders of Pounds 48.4m of bonds due for payment on June 7, and Pounds 71.7m of bonds due in mid-1995. It now intended to repay the debt rather than moving back the repayment dates to the end of 1995. The company said it had postponed plans to reschedule debt because of the 'significant costs' of making exchange offers, and because improving prospects for the UK housing market had made it more confident of its own trading prospects. It added that its confidence had also been increased by the falls in sterling interest rates. Mr Jonathan Perry, chairman, said the cost of exchanging the bonds, which trade on the Frankfurt exchange, included fees and commissions to exchange agents, higher interest rates on the bonds, and legal fees. The company, which had to reschedule on-balance sheet debt of Pounds 700m last June to keep trading, requires permission both from banks involved in the refinancing, and from holders of Pounds 50m of dollar bonds already rescheduled to 1995. Mr Perry said that the banks had 30 days to respond to the request for consent. Dollar bond holders would be consulted at a meeting for which 21 days notice would be given. He said that if consent was not given, the company would have to return to its original plan to reschedule the D-Mark bonds. The company originally said it was confident that the D-Mark bonds would be rescheduled by the end of 1992.</p>

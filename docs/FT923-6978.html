			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Naval dockyards may be sold to private sector THE government is con-sidering selling Britain's two main naval dockyards at Devonport, in Plymouth, and Rosyth, in Fife, to the private sector. The Ministry of Defence said yesterday that it was inviting companies to register by September 18 potential interest in buying one or both of the royal dockyards, which have been managed since 1987 by private contractors. Trade unions involved criticised the announcement of a possible sell-off. Mr Neil Moore, national officer of the GMB general union, said the decision threatened the future of Britain's dockyards. National security could be 'placed in the hands of private speculators', he said. The MoD said it would consult all interested parties, including unions, before taking a decision. If ministers decide to go ahead, tenders are likely to be issued next spring. The MoD said: 'Commercial management of the two yards has proved a success and sale to private-sector operators would be a logical progression.' The objective was to ensure the most cost-effective support for the Royal Navy, with any sale having to guarantee that strategic needs were met. The MoD emphasised that, in the event of a sale, the government would probably want to retain 'an overriding ownership stake' in refitting facilities for the Navy's nuclear-powered submarines. At present refitting of Polaris submarines is carried out at Rosyth and work on nuclear-propelled 'hunter-killer' submarines is split between there and Devonport. The MoD announced yesterday that it has given Rosyth a Pounds 120m two-year contract to refit and upgrade weapons on HMS Sovereign, a hunter-killer vessel. The operators of the yards - Devonport Management (DML) and Babcock Thorn - believe the logical option is to concentrate work on nuclear-powered submarines at a single site. The MoD said it was possible that a decision on whether nuclear refits should be concentrated at one dockyard - and at which one - could be made before any invitation to tender was issued. Management contracts held by DML and Babcock Thorn are due to expire in 1994 and the MoD is in the process of arranging extensions of up to two years. Babcock Thorn, which is known to have already declared to the MoD an interest in purchasing the Rosyth shipyard, proposed in June that the two yards be brought under a single management structure. Rosyth and Devonport have both enacted heavy redundancy programmes, with the combined number of job losses reaching nearly 8,000. Earlier this year DML warned there was 'a real possibility' that the Devonport dockyard might close.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres favors permitting  all Labor members who resigned in the wake of the Histadrut  labor federation primaries to return to the party, including  Hayim Ramon and his associates.    In an interview to Qol Yisra'el, Foreign Minister Peres said  that the desire of Histadrut voters for a change should be  respected. He adds however, that the results of the primaries  must be honored if one seeks to maintain a democratic system.  Peres warned of the danger of forsaking democracy to television  in which a candidate's image counts more than level-headed  considerations.    As for the political process, Peres asserted that yesterday  had marked the completion of an important stage in the process,  with the next stage of elections in the territories and the  IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from population centers  starting now.    From now on, Peres noted, there would be two parallel  tracks:  One, in Washington, where the expansion of autonomy to the rest  of the territories would be discussed. The second track would  deal with the early empowerment of the Palestinian residents in  the fields of education, health, social welfare, and taxation.    On the eve of Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour  of  the region, Foreign Minister Peres said there was no certainty  that the visit would lead to progress in the negotiations with  Syria seeing as up till now, Damascus had offered nothing new in  its proposals which merely repeated previous, well-known Syrian  positions.</p>

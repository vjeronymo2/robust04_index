Minister Joao Miranda said that UNITA's behavior -- which  hinges solely on its greed for ministerial portfolios -- shows  that it wants to continue war because it is not ready for  democratic coexistence.    [Begin Miranda recording] The talks are at a crucial point,  at this stage, because they face the risk of collapsing. That  is because UNITA is neither collaborating nor interested in an  immediate end to the war. Decidedly, what it is in fact  interested in are the ministerial portfolios that it has been  demanding. UNITA presents those demands merely as a (?hobby),  but it seeks greater goals, namely to create a space for itself  because it is not ready to live in a democracy. [end recording]    Deputy Foreign Minister Joao Miranda said this when he met  Pak Myong-ku, his DPRK counterpart, whom he briefed on the  postelectoral crisis in Angola. The visiting DPRK is scheduled  to be in this country for a few days, during which he will meet  Angolan officials to get acquainted with the situation in the  country. He will be obtaining that information from officials  such as Johnny Pinnock Eduardo, secretary of state for  cooperation; Media Minister Hendrick Vaal Neto; and Lopo do  Nascimento, secretary general of the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Arafat on ropes as peace process comes under fire: Bloodshed in Gaza Strip prompts growing fears of Palestinian civil war Yesterday's violence in the Gaza Strip has underlined the growing crisis in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and raised the threat of a Palestinian civil war. The simmering tension between Mr Yassir Arafat's authority and his Islamic opponents erupted into full-scale bloodshed, raising serious doubts about the stability of the self-rule experiment. Palestinian police yesterday were forced to open fire on anti-Arafat Islamic demonstrators illustrating the extent to which the Islamic opposition has become a real challenge to the authority of the Palestine Liberation Organisation on the streets of Gaza. Political observers believe Mr Arafat is on the ropes with the fragile political support base for the peace agreement eroding daily. Palestinians are losing faith in a process which shows no sign of addressing their grievances - the end of Israeli occupation of Palestinian land; right of return of Palestinian refugees and improvement in living conditions. Hours before yesterday's clashes, Mr Terje Larsen, UN under-secretary general responsible for Palestinian territories said: 'If there is no change immediately, there will be more killing more blood ..My assessment is that both the peace process and the legitimacy of the Palestinian authority are losing ground day by day and the reason is that nearly nothing has been delivered on the ground.' Instead of trying to shore up Mr Arafat's rule, Israel continues to undermine the PLO leader, fuelling the opposition. A partial closure of the Israel-Gaza border remains in place, preventing thousands of Palestinians travelling to jobs in Israel. The peace process is at least nine months behind schedule and Israel shows no recognition of the danger of further delay in handing over the still occupied West Bank to Palestinian rule. Palestinian prisoners remain in Israeli jails months after Israel promised to release them and Israel is forcing Mr Arafat to go to war with the Islamic extremists by linking further progress in peace negotiations to a crackdown on Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two main Islamic Palestinian groups. The failure of the peace process to meet Palestinian grievances has created a fertile ground for Mr Arafat's Islamic critics who are increasingly confident and determined to meet his crackdown by force. They successfully portray him as a 'poodle' of Israel doing its dirty work. Israel refuses to accept the Palestinian view that there is no military option against Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Although Gen Nasr Yussuf, the Palestinian military strongman, has been spoiling for a fight with the Islamic opposition, Mr Arafat's political advisers have warned against a conflict that could erupt into civil war with no guarantee of victory. Both groups are well disciplined and maintain small tightly knit underground military wings willing to carry out suicide attacks in the name of Islamic glory. Hamas and Islamic Jihad are bound to exploit yesterday's shootings by Mr Arafat's security forces, using them to accuse the Palestinian leader of acting as an instrument of Israel's security agenda. They are also likely to strike back, further escalating the tension and violence. Israel's refusal to honour the timetable and the commitments of the peace accords is also fuelling division inside the PLO and Mr Arafat's Fatah faction. This week's PLO executive committee meeting in Gaza was attended by only eight of the 18 members. Two of the most senior Fatah officials - Mr Farouk Kaddoumi and Mr Mahmoud Abbas, the architect of the peace agreement - refused to attend and are increasingly critical of the implementation of the deal. Mr Suleiman Najjab, one of the PLO executive committee members who refused to attend the meeting, said a majority favour a review of the entire experiment, given Israel's refusal to implement the accords. Israel will welcome yesterday's events as a sign of Mr Arafat's willingness to confront extremists, but the dangers of its policy are apparent. Israel's apparent determination to force Mr Arafat into conflict with Islamic groups could irretrievably weaken the PLO and leave Israel with no other partner to negotiate with but Hamas and Islamic Jihad which oppose a Jewish state.</p>

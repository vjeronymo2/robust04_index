			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Premiums cut for projects with high risk - Exports The chancellor yesterday threw further support behind Britain's export drive by announcing improvements in the terms and cover provided by the Export Credits Guarantee Department. Premiums charged by the ECGD for political risk will be reduced from December 12 by an average of 10 per cent. Rates for some markets that have recently re-established their creditworthiness will be cut even more deeply, and by more than 20 per cent for Argentina, Brazil, the Philippines, Egypt and Vietnam. As an example, the government said the premium for a typical project in India would fall from 5 per cent to 3.75 per cent. The government also plans to increase, to Pounds 3.5bn in 1997-98, ECGD cover for so-called amber zone markets, where risk is either unusually high or where the ECGD's exposure is most highly concentrated. Amber zone markets include China, India, South Africa and Indonesia. The figure is Pounds 300m higher than the level of cover agreed for 1996-97 and Pounds 800m above that available in 1993-94. It brings to Pounds 10bn the total amount of ECGD cover available in the next three years for exports for amber zone markets. 'These measures will provide an added incentive for British exporters to play an even greater role in the most successful and rapidly growing economies in the world,' Mr Clarke said. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the changes would boost the competitiveness of British exporters. This is the third consecutive Budget in which ECGD premiums have been reduced. The cuts represent a victory for sustained lobbying by the Department of Trade and Industry and UK exporters over resistance by the Treasury. Exporters have long argued that premiums for high-risk markets were substantially above those charged by export credit agencies in other European countries, though rates for lower risks are generally more competitive. However, the government warned that ECGD political risk premiums for Mexico, Colombia, Zimbabwe and Slovakia will rise from the end of March, when temporary rate-capping arrangements introduced for these markets in the last Budget are due to expire.</p>

How to ensure the healthy development  of the socialist market economy and promote a sustained, stable,  and speedy development of the socialist economic construction  are important problems confronting us.    Modern economic theories believe: To ensure normal operation  of the market economy, it is necessary to carry out  macroeconomic regulation and control over the market. By  macroeconomic regulation and control, it refers to regulation  and control by the government over market operations, and is  intervention by the government in the course of operations of  the economy as a whole. For economic operations to reach a  scheduled state, it is the conduct of carrying out regulation  and control over national or social economic activities by  comprehensive use of various means of regulation proceeding from  the overall situation of the national economy. In his work  "General Study of Employment, Interest, and Money" published in  1930, the well-known British economist John M. Keynes, in light  of the failure of market economic setups that purely relied on  the laissez-faire market regulation of economic operations, put  forward the theory of expanding government functions of  intervention in economic affairs and standardizing them. If we  make a comprehensive survey of the history of development of the  market economy and the practices of China's economic  development, the socialist market economy likewise should not  deviate from government macroeconomic regulation and control.  <H3>  I. The Building and Development of the Market Economy Should  Not Deviate From Government Macroeconomic Regulation and Control </H3>   The market economy emerged and developed in the capitalist  society, and promoted a major development of capitalism, but the  intrinsic contradictions of the capitalist society also became  acute. By the early 19th century, periodic economic crises  began to appear as one of the basic contradictions of the  capitalist society. It later became increasingly acute,  resulting in the closing down of factories. In 1929-1930, major  crisis broke out in the Western world, the Great Depression led  to an unprecedented social disaster of capitalism during  peacetime, and various contradictions of capitalist society were  thoroughly exposed. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt put  into practice the New Deal, and the administration intervened in  the market economy, thus resulting in a turn for the better in  the U.S. economy. The macroeconomic management theory  represented by Keynes's "General Survey" was also gradually  accepted by Western countries, and various governments carried  out macroeconomic regulation and control over their economies by  fiscal and monetary policies, and other means. These measures  could not eliminate the basic contradictions of capitalist  society, but greatly relaxed its periodic economic crises and  social and class contradictions. Furthermore, powerful postwar  tides of scientific and technological revolution not only made  capitalism survive, but still have considerable vitality.    Now the market economies of Western countries are fairly  developed, but government macroeconomic regulation and control  have never stopped. These countries intervene in economic  operations by constantly making use of interest rates, tax  policy, and other economic means, and provide a certain  guarantee for the development of the national economy. This  indicates that whether in an initial or highly developed stage,  the market economy should not deviate from macroeconomic  regulation and control.    The socialist market economy which China is speedily  cultivating and developing is different from the capitalist  market economy, but the former too has general character with  the latter. In November, 1979 when he met with (Gypney), deputy  chief editor of the Encyclopedia Britannica, Comrade  Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "It is definitely incorrect to say  that the market economy is limited only to the capitalist  society, thus the capitalist market economy. Why cannot  socialism go in for the market economy? The market economy had  rudiments during the period of the feudal society; socialism can  also go in for the market economy." The socialist market  economy, he believed, is basically similar to the capitalist  market economy in method, but it is also different in the  relation between ownership by the whole people, relations  between collective ownership, and relations with foreign  capitalist countries. But in the final analysis, it is  socialist, the market economy of a socialist country. In his  talks during his inspection tour of southern China, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping clearly put forward that both planning and market were  economic means. In terms of operational mechanism, there is no  difference in the market economy under the two kinds of social  system. If there should be any difference, it is not a matter  of the market economy itself, but is brought by the basic  feature of two kinds of social system.    China is a developing socialist country, with relatively  backward productive forces and unbalanced economic development.  China's national conditions and its present stage of economic  development require that China should all the more attach  importance to strengthening and improving macroeconomic  regulation and control.    At present, China's socialist market economy is in its  initial stage of development, its economic structure has not  been rationalized, and new contradictions and problems have  appeared in the course of economic development. Therefore, in  developing the market economy, China must strengthen and improve  macroeconomic regulation and control, should draw on the useful  practices of capitalist countries in market control and their  successful experiences in market regulation, and carry out  effective macroeconomic regulation and control over the market  economy.  <H3>  II. To Carry Out Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Is the  Intrinsic Requirement for the Operational Mechanism of the  Market Economy </H3>   The market allocation of resources is generally achieved by  bringing into play the functions of the competitive mechanism  and the changes in the supply and demand relations according to  the requirement of the law of value. By sensitive price signals  and constant competitive pressure, it can promote the superior  ones and the inferior ones will be eliminated, coordinate supply  and demand relations, and effectively allocate resources.  However, there are also unavoidable defects in market  allocation, which itself has weak points and negative factors.  For ensuring the equilibrium of the total economy, preventing  drastic economic functions, rationally restructuring the  economy, carrying out fair competition, preventing a wide gap  between the rich and the poor, for ecological balance and  environmental protection, and the relations between fairness and  efficiency, it either does a poor job or is incapable of action.  Market regulation has a certain blindness, and will easily give  rise to economic fluctuation. Market regulation is a kind of  local regulation, and it is impossible for it to achieve a  comprehensive balance of the macroeconomics. Market regulation  is a regulation of actual resources, and cannot bring into play  the potential superiority of resources. It is a regulation of  productive activities and cannot automatically regulate the  social target of fair income distribution.    Market regulation can only regulate the allocation of  economic resources, and some nonproductive departments cannot  carry out market regulation. It is impossible for market  regulation to affect nonmarket behavior and it cannot safeguard  fair market competition. Therefore, market regulation requires  intervention by the state and the government, and requires  constant macroeconomic regulation and control. Market without  planning is incompatible with the increasingly socialized  commodity economy. In building the system of the socialist  market economy, we should better integrate planning as the means  of regulation with the market. In the course of allocating  resources, whatever problems can be solved by the market will be  solved by the market; whatever cannot be managed or managed well  by the market will be managed by the government through policies  and planning. The modern market economy not only does not  exclude government intervention and planning guidance, but also  remedies the defects of the market by drawing support from and  relying on them. This is what we should never forget even for a  moment in shifting from the planned economy to the market  economy, far less should we completely abandon planning as the  means of macroeconomic regulation and control whenever we talk  about the market economy. It seems once we talk about planning  we are "taking the old road." When we say we should strengthen  macroeconomic regulation and control, it absolutely does not  mean to return to the old mandatory methods commonly used in the  past under the unitary planned economy system, but to regulate  the supply and demand equilibrium, the direction of funds  investments, social distribution, and regional differences by  interest rate, tax rate, exchange rate, prices, and industrial  policies by using primarily economic means, legal means, and  necessary administrative means that conform with the economic  law of the market economy, and to standardize and constrain the  behavior of the economic subject and the order of market  activities by speeding up the legalization of economic work. We  should take necessary administrative means to solve those  problems of confused economic orders caused mainly by  administrative behavior. Of course, this is not to replace  economic means, but to ensure the implementation of economic  means by administrative means.  <H3>  III. To Proceed From China's Practical Situation and  Seriously Strengthen Macroeconomic Regulation and Control </H3>   The development of China's market economy is different from  that of the market economy in capitalist countries. They take  different roads and have their own characteristics in  macroeconomic regulation and control.    The market economies of Western countries have experienced  the process from laissez-faire development to constant  government intervention. China's market economy has experienced  a rather complicated historical process and has gone through an  ever-intensifying process of gradual advance from taking on all  economic affairs by the state and carrying out the management  system of highly centralized planned economy to reform and  opening-up and gradual establishment of the system of the  socialist market economy. The planned economy management system  China carried out during the early period after the founding of  New China played a gigantic role in the rapid recovery of the  national economy. However, with social and economic  development, the drawbacks of the planned economy system also  became increasingly apparent and seriously obstructed the  development of social productive forces. Since the Third  Plenary Session of the 11th Congress, the CPC put forward the  theory of planned commodity economy, carried out the policy of  reform and opening-up, vigorously developed the socialist  commodity economy, and gradually reduced the state plans,  especially mandatory plans. Based on the development of the  commodity economy, the CPC then proceeded to put forward in time  the theory of building the system of the socialist market  economy, and cultivated and developed with great efforts the  socialist market economy, thereby energetically promoting the  development of the productive forces. This is a road entirely  different from the building and development of the market  economy in Western countries. Therefore, we must carry out  effective regulation and control by combining with China's  practical situation in the light of the characteristics of the  socialist market economy. China accumulated rich experiences in  macroeconomic management over decades of economic work in the  past, which makes it possible for China not only to carry out  macroeconomic regulation and control over the socialist market  economy, but also to yield more fruitful results than the  measures for macroeconomic regulation and control introduced in  the Western countries.    At present, China's socialist market economy is still in its  initial stage of development, there is a process of transforming  from the old to the new system, various kinds of relations still  require further straightening out, and it is inevitable that  drawbacks and problems will appear in economic development. But  these are contradictions and problems in the course of  development; they can only be overcome and solved by further  in-depth reform and seriously strengthening macroeconomic  regulation and control. It also determines that we must now  still use necessary administrative means to guide the market  when strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, and  escort economic development. We must further strengthen the  building of the legal system, build up and improve as soon as  possible the legal system of the socialist market economy, and  try our best to rely on and use economic and legal means to  regulate and control regular economic operations, thus creating  a set of theories and methods for macroeconomic regulation and  control over the market economy with Chinese characteristics,  and ensuring that the socialist market economy will forge ahead  along a healthy course.</p>

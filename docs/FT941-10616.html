			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Scandal set to take the politics out of Italian banks: New corruption inquiries Within a week the heads of two of Italy's most important banks, the Treasury-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and Milan-based Cariplo, have been obliged to offer their temporary resignations because of judicial inquiries into alleged corruption. The resignations are in line with Bank of Italy rules introduced last August, when bankers first came under the judicial spotlight. Whatever the outcome of these investigations, the impact on the future of Italian banking will be profound. Mr Roberto Mazzotta, a Christian Democrat appointee, stood down last Friday from the chairmanship of Cariplo and since Monday has been in a Milan jail on charges of corruption. He is due to be questioned today about alleged phoney property deals conducted by Cariplo's pension fund to benefit the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties. Four other Cariplo executives have been issued with arrest warrants. At BNL, Mr Giampiero Cantoni, the chairman, announced on Monday he was stepping down after news that he was being investigated for alleged payments to local Socialist politicians to facilitate property development in a Milan suburb. Mr Cantoni, a Socialist appointee, was brought in to clean up BNL in 1989 after the scandal of Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) in unauthorised loans made to Iraq by its Atlanta branch. A separate, routine Bank of Italy inspection is understood to have raised questions about BNL's lending to Mandelli, a high-tech engineering group recently placed in liquidation. With more than L100bn (Pounds 39m) of loans outstanding, BNL is the group's largest creditor. Both Cariplo and BNL have insisted the functioning of their institutions is not affected. However, 14 executives who either hold or have held high office in 11 large banks and savings banks are under investigation on corruption charges throughout Italy. These events will accelerate the process of change brought about by a combination of the collapse of the post-war political system and privatisation. Until now the state has controlled two-thirds of Italy's banking and financial institutions. The latter were simply divided into spheres of influence by the main parties, leaving managements with the often impossible task of fending off political interference. The opportunity for abuse was ample since there was insufficient accountability. The Bank of Italy had only limited powers - for instance Mr Mazzotta was appointed by the Christian Democrat-led government against the central bank's objections. BNL was regarded as a 'Socialist preserve'. Now the old political masters are fast vanishing, and privatisation further limits the scope for interference. Management will be answerable to shareholders - including foreign institutional investors  - instead of the politicians. The question is whether the latest arrests, and the possibility of other embarrassing revelations as the judicial spotlight is increasingly turned on the banks, will upset the gradual modernisation and improvement of standards in the antiquated banking sector. In the medium term, the stigma of corruption investigations into Italian banking, once wrongly thought to be free of political influence thanks to close Bank of Italy supervision, will be an obstacle to privatisation. Many big municipal savings banks are being transformed into joint stock companies  -the first step towards a possible flotation. Investors may think twice about buying shares if they fear skeletons in the cupboard. Further ahead, however, the latest wave of investigations and arrests will accelerate calls for fresh blood in the banks. The two-year-old political corruption scandal has already put a virtual end to the time-honoured practice of lottizzazione, whereby political parties inserted their people into key public-sector posts. Revelations of corruption in bank boardrooms would speed up the move toward greater transparency and accountability, instigated by privatisation. Already, Credito Italiano, the first big bank on the privatisation list, which was sold off last December, has altered its articles of association to allow outsiders into its top management ranks. Others are bound to follow.</p>

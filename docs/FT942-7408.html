			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (6): The aim is to create a competitive workforce - Barbara Harrison on plans to reform education In 1990, 320 Tennessee companies were asked in a survey for their top recommendation to improve the state's business climate. The overwhelming answer - by 70 per cent of the companies - was that the most important thing to do was to improve education. In Tennessee, as elsewhere in the American South, the poor quality of education has increasingly been viewed as a barrier to economic progress. The concern reflects the changing nature of the South's economy - from low-skilled assembly plants and textile mills to high-tech manufacturing and higher-skilled service industries. Tennessee's response was an education reform plan called the 21st Century Schools Programme. The plan, launched by Governor Ned McWherter in 1992, includes an infusion of funding, a comprehensive revamping of the way schools are run - from kindergartens to high schools - and a set of basic goals that each local school system must meet by the year 2000. The aim is to create a workforce that can compete nationally and internationally. Tennessee, like many of its neighbouring southern states, has traditionally ranked at the bottom of the US education ladder. Its schools were plagued by high drop-out rates and low scores on national academic achievement tests. As many as 20 per cent of high school graduates lacked the basic skills needed to be trained for jobs. Even students who went on to university often required remedial studies. Governor McWherter's programme, funded by a 0.5 cent increase in the state sales tax, has injected funds directly into classroom expenditures, rather than teacher salary increases. From the 1992-93 school year through to 1994-95, the state budget will have put Dollars 504m into the programme, which represents a 45 per cent increase, said Mr Billy Stair, the governor's top aide on education. By 1997, the programme will have generated some Dollars 900m in new funds for schools. The previous governor, Mr Lamar Alexander, who served as George Bush's education secretary, had already brought some much-needed improvements to the pay scale for teachers during his tenure from 1978-1986. But despite the salary rises for teachers, educational achievement still lagged in the mid-1980s and poor quality schools were increasingly viewed as the culprits in a growing skills gap. Business leaders, weary of poorly prepared workers, asked Mr McWherter to 'Give us a high school diploma that has meaning,' recalls Mr Stair. While it is too early to measure the impact of the 21st Century Schools Programme with respect to improved examination results or better skill levels, the infusion of monies has helped to build, renovate and outfit more classrooms, buy books and computers, provide adequate bus transportation and equip vocational classes with modern equipment. To address overcrowding in schools, class size was decreased by the hiring of 2,100 more teachers. Another 1,400 are expected to be hired over the next year. Other aspects of the programme include: A new 'fair and equitable' funding formula. Given that American schools are supported by local taxes as well as state and federal monies, the new formula provides more state money to schools in poorer districts which have smaller tax revenues. The formula helps remedy the inequality of funding for schools in rural Tennessee and in urban minority communities. Higher academic standards. Students in all grades will be tested to assure they have attained or exceeded the national standards for achievement. To graduate from high school, students will have to pass a proficiency test for basic skills. Increased school accountability. Schools are held accountable for the achievements of their students. A 'report card' on how the students have performed in tests at each school is issued to the public. Greater local decision-making and control. The state has freed its 139 school systems from 3,700 burdensome rules and regulations about how they should be run. And, while increasing their budgets, the state has refrained from telling them how they must spend their monies. Instead, the state has demanded that they attain national achievement standards at a minimum. If schools fail to perform, they will face sanctions, such as sacking the district superintendent or the local school board. If they exceed performance, they are rewarded with extra funds. The programme, backed in the legislature by both Republicans and Democrats, has received little criticism. It has also been lauded by national education experts such as the University of Pennsylvania's Centre for Research and Evaluation in Social Policy. But doubts exist that the funding will be sufficient to achieve its goals. Nonetheless, while performance improvements are still not clearly in evidence, Tennessee officials believe the programme is already yielding important results. 'The first and most dramatic change has been just a change in attitude,' says Mr Wayne Qualls, Tennessee commissioner of education. 'Local school administrators, principals and school boards now all say 'We want to make a change.''  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           School Goals  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Tennessee's goals for its schools are consistent with those set by the federal government for the year 2000. These include: High school proficiency test pass rates of 90 per cent. High school graduation rates of 90 per cent. Academic gains by all students at or above the national norm. Promotion rates of 97 per cent in kindergarten through 8th Grade, and Attendance of 95 per cent through Grade 6 and of 93 per cent through Grade 12.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Roman Czerwinski, under secretary of state </F> in the Ministry of Industry and Trade, by Zbigniew Kozakiewicz;  place and date not given: "Swords Into Plowshares"]    [Text] [Kozakiewicz] The arms industry has a highly skilled  labor force and a great tradition, and its products are of good  quality. Nevertheless, it is in trouble.    [Czerwinski] Let us begin by considering that, in the  1980's,  the concept "arms industry" extended to some 90 manufacturing  plants, both final producers and supplier plants. These plants  were geared to serving our military and the armies of the Warsaw  Pact, and, in addition, we exported part of the output outside  the Warsaw Pact. The changes in our region, the collapse of the  Warsaw Pact, and the abandonment of the policy of confrontation  and of materiel stockpiling led to a situation in which such a  considerable potential of the arms industry has turned out to be  unnecessary. Most of its manufacturing plants had to retool to  other production. At present, our arms industry consists of 31  plants, chiefly final producers. It is a modern industry, and  its products do not deviate from international standards; its  output can supply about 70 percent of weaponry and equipment for  the military.    [Kozakiewicz] What kinds of weaponry can it manufacture?    [Czerwinski] To put it differently, except for medium- and  long-range antiaircraft missiles, supersonic aircraft, and large  deep-sea vessels displacing more than 2,000 tons, we can make  the entire weaponry and equipment needed by the military.    [Kozakiewicz] That is an impressive capability, but what is  the industry's financial situation?    [Czerwinski] Its basic problems are its huge debt and the  absence of alternative civilian production. In peacetime, arms  plants cannot--because it is unnecessary--exploit their entire  arms-manufacturing capacity, even if they are able to export  part of their output. Thus, in order to keep operating, they  have to make goods for the civilian market. Well, civilian  production is not the problem; the real problem is its expansion  to an extent sufficient to offset the deficit due to the  mothballing or only partial utilization of defense production  lines--hence the need to restructure the plants. Our experience,  as well as the experience of other countries, indicates that, if  output for the military is not more than 30 percent of capacity,  a plant can still perform in the black if the remaining 70  percent is sold.    I mentioned the arms industry's debt; last year it amounted  to 16 trillion zlotys [Z]. At present, this burden is much  lighter. Debt-reduction agreements account for about Z7.7  trillion and other forms of debt conversion for Z3 billion. The  remaining obligations were rescheduled and will be repaid  partially in cash and partially in the form of shares in  civilian production. Government loan guarantees--I emphasize,  loan guarantees and not subsidies--have been provided, totaling  Z25 trillion for industry as a whole. The arms industry and its  particular plant can, if they have tangible prospects, count on  loans totaling Z1 trillion and perhaps even more. About Z1  trillion has been allocated for funding inactive production  capacities. Altogether, this is, relatively speaking, a  substantial amount. Arms plants have caught their breath and can  exploit new opportunities.    [Kozakiewicz] You mean opportunities for developing products  attractive to the civilian market?    [Czerwinski] Not only that. Our analyses demonstrate that  the  Polish arms industry can meet the needs of the military 70  percent. The world is not standing still; hence, we too must  think in long-range terms, about new types of weaponry and  equipment, the modernization of current equipment, and the  utilization of electronics and other achievements of science and  technology. The Ministry of National Defense and our industry  are doing a great deal of work on the modernization of weaponry.  We have also established interesting contacts with foreign  companies--Swedish, French, American ones. Joint undertakings  are being planned. An example of a modern Polish project may be  the Grom missile. An example--of course, not the only one--of  extremely promising cooperation with foreign companies may be  the joint project of the Gdansk Unimor and the Swedish Ericsson  for developing tactical communications based on digital  processing and the encodement of information.    [Kozakiewicz] Some foreign newspapers have been advising us  to introduce a far-reaching conversion of our arms industry. It  may be that the motive is to get rid of competition, is not that  so?    [Czerwinski] It is hardly conceivable for a country of  Poland's size to have no arms industry of its own. I believe  that this idea is not even worth considering. Our arms industry  remains in our Polish hands, and we shall continue to improve  our technologies, but we shall also be wide open to foreign  cooperation. The arms market is uncertain, but, perhaps, owing  to such cooperation, broader export opportunities will be  afforded. At any rate, I do not believe our exports are to  diminish.    [Kozakiewicz] What other factors will influence the process  of reforming the arms industry and adapting it to the market  economy?    [Czerwinski] This process still continues and, for the  enterprises to perform truly efficiently, it must continue  further. The next step will be to commercialize the plants by  transforming them into Treasury companies; this precisely means  the adaptation of enterprises to the requirements of the market  economy and adherence to the commercial laws and cost-effective  accounting on the microscale. Arms enterprises will not be  transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Ownership  Transformations because their sale, partially or in their  entirety, is not envisaged. But this does not preclude  structural and ownership transformations in those enterprises  that produce for the civilian market. We shall support the  concept of employee stock ownership, and this should favorably  affect the ties between the work forces and the enterprises.  Groups of companies will be organized under the arms  enterprises, with the object of spurring their civilian  production. The debt of these enterprises could be converted to  shares in their civilian departments. All of these changes are  intended not only to spur economic revival but also to  counteract unemployment, which has strongly affected arms  enterprises. At the same time, I wish to emphasize that these  changes will not extend to the enterprise departments geared to  defense production.    For the arms industry, privatization is not a means in  itself  but a means of promoting and accelerating economic growth. This  policy on privatization will continue to be pursued. At the same  time, considering the special nature of the arms industry, we  shall also guide ourselves by the principle that the State  Treasury is to own at least 51 percent of stock--that is, a  majority share--in every arms enterprise, and the stock will be  the registered rather than the bearer kind. Given adherence to  this principle, practically all forms of structural-ownership  transformations can still be applied.    [Kozakiewicz] The arms industry at one time found itself in  an extremely difficult situation that was traumatic to its work  force. What has changed in that respect?    [Czerwinski] We should bear in mind that at those 90 plants  that worked for the arms industry in the 1980's, the share of  civilian production was small, so that when the demand for  military production slumped, it entailed collapse, mass layoffs,  unemployment. That is why we attach such great importance to  restructuring these plants, to converting to civilian  production. Here I wish to emphasize the great role of the  Committee for Scientific Research, whose projects are making it  possible to surmount the related difficulties.    The arms plants had tried to save themselves by exporting to  the East. This caused them to contract considerable debts owing  to the difficult situation of their Eastern partners. By now,  the plants have regained one-half of the value of those exports,  while the other half does not appear to be irretrievably lost. I  have already mentioned negotiations intended to reduce our  multitrillion debt. Definite symptoms of a stabilization of the  job market are arising. Such plants as the Rzeszow WSK  [Transportation Equipment Plant] and Wroclaw Hydral, which  slashed their employment in the years 1991-92, are now  increasing it; the employees laid off in those years are  returning to their work stations. For next year, we envisage no  employee discharges other than those owing to old-age  retirement. The establishment of civilian companies under the  arms plants will also favorably affect the job market and reduce  unemployment. All of this warrants speaking of a gradual  improvement, of bettering the situation at arms-industry plants.  As time goes on, this will be more tangible to employees than it  is at present.    I would like to emphasize one other thing: There has been a  marked improvement in the political climate, which favors the  arms industry and the development of production for domestic  consumption and exports. Our undertakings are commensurate. On  the basis of what was done last year, we are organizing in  Kielce an educational and promotional exhibition. We expect  that, like other measures, it will foster the development of  cooperation with domestic and foreign companies, the expansion  of exports, and the strengthening of our potential.</p>

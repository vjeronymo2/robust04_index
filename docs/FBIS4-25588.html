			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 13 (XINHUA) -- The issuing of state  bonds has become a pillar of China's securities market alongside  the listed stocks, after six years of effort.    China has issued six types of such bonds since 1981. The  amount expanded from 19.8 billion yuan-worth in 1981 to 100  billion yuan-worth this year.    Until 1988 state bonds were not allowed to be put onto the  market, a local bank official said.    "Although the interest rate on the bonds was higher than on  the bank's savings deposits, people still regarded their  purchase as making a contribution to the state and not making an  investment for themselves," he explained.    A survey shows that the transactional volume of the Shanghai  market for state bonds amounted to 11.321 billion yuan-worth in  five trading days from May 30 to June 3, while that of stocks on  the Shanghai Stock Exchange during this period reached only 2.54  billion yuan-worth.    According to the official, state bond futures are more  attractive to investors.    At present, China is working out a package of regulations to  ensure the healthy development of these markets.</p>

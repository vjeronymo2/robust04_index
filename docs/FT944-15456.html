			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Transition hits third quarter at Unisys Third-quarter earnings at Unisys dropped sharply as the US computer group continued a painful transition from proprietary mainframe computers to information services. Net income for the third quarter was Dollars 42.9m, or 8 cents a share, compared with Dollars 84.1m, or 29 cents, in the same period last year. Excluding a one-time favourable tax item of 9 cents a year ago, earnings were 20 cents a share. The lower earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenues continued to decline, but more slowly than in recent quarters. Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 1.79bn, down from Dollars 1.81bn. The company cited three factors that had a negative effect on third-quarter performance: declining government business, a continuing shift away from high-margin proprietary systems and an increase in sales expenses. However, Unisys reported strong growth in its information services business, which is the primary focus of its efforts to return to profitable growth. 'Revenue from information services, our strongest business, grew 23 per cent in the quarter and 22 per cent over the past nine months,' said Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive. 'We are continuing to invest in this growth business which is leading our information management thrust. Information services is now our single largest business revenue stream with 25 per cent of total revenue,' he said. Mr Unruh said that the transformation was on course, in spite of declining earnings. Unisys returned to profitability in 1992 after three years of heavy losses. Revenues, however, have continued to decline. For the year to date net income was Dollars 152.8m, or 36 cents a share. The nine-month period included a charge of Dollars 7.7m, or 4 cents, for costs associated with repurchase of debt. In the same period last year net income was Dollars 447.7m, or Dollars 1.83, including a net gain from accounting changes and an extraordinary item of Dollars 203.8m, or 83 cents. Revenue for the first nine months of 1994 was Dollars 5.28bn, compared with Dollars 5.64bn last time.</p>

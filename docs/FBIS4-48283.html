However, deputy  ministers Winnie Mandela (arts, culture, science and technology)  and Bantu Holomisa (environment affairs) were not present.    First Deputy President Thabo Mbeki explained that Mrs  Mandela  was attending an urgent meeting with the royal family in  Pondoland and Mr Holomisa was involved in the handover of the  Transkei administration to the Eastern Cape provincial  government.

Mr Mbeki also announced that University of the Western Cape  Rector Jakes Gerwel had been appointed director general of the  office of the president.    And former Rivonia treason trialist Ahmed Kathrada, who  President Nelson Mandela originally named as a cabinet minister  but then dropped him from the final cabinet list, will fill "a  senior political position in the office of the president".

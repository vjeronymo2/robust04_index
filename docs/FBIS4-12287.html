			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Everyday" column by Tariq Masarwah: "Peace by Blockade and </F> Impoverishment"]    [Text] In my opinion, the government should stay away from  a session of Middle East multilateral talks set for 17 April in  Muscat.    Washington seems bent on undercutting His Majesty King  Husayn's courageous stand!! A meeting was supposed to have been  held at the U.S. State Department last Thursday to review the  Port of al-'Aqabah blockade, but was put off the day before,  lest a lifting of the siege be preceived as a reaction to his  majesty's position.    It seems very unlikely Washington will set a new date for  the  review before 17 April to make certain we will show up at the  waters conference in Muscat. This is a challenge we must come  to grips with, seeing that the U.S.-imposed blockade is to force  us into a particular course of action advancing Israeli  interests in relation to the peace process!!    The Port of al-'Aqabah blockade was not a UN decision; it  was  undertaken unilaterally by the United States.    The blockade has no connection with the UN Security Council  sanctions imposed on Iraq. Both Turkey and Iran have seaports  and both maintain more substantial economic ties than any such  relations Jordan may have with Iraq. Why, then, does not the  U.S. Navy inspect Turkish and Iranian ports?    In the matter of the blockade of the Port of al-'Aqabah,  then, there is more at stake than ensuring Jordan's compliance  with the Iraq sanctions resolution. At stake is a drive to  impoverish us and force us to our knees and then incorporate us  into Israel's strategic reach and transform us into a buffer  between the Zionist entity and each of Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon  and an extension of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho!    In any case, the so-called multilaterals do not seem to be  getting anywhere. With Syria and Lebanon not putting in an  appearance at talks supposedly tackling such issues as the  environment and waters, what is there to talk about?    These talks are zero; they are little more than symposiums  comparable to many gatherings held at Amman hotels. There does  not seem to be much point in the multilaterals beyond the fact  that they are convened in Arab capitals. The idea behind them,  then, is to serve as gateways for Israeli teams and television  crews, no matter how much we or our kinsfolk in the West Bank  and Gaza may resent it.    Initially, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland were chosen as  venues for the multilateral sessions. Israel demanded that they  be held in Cyprus. Washington, however, decided that they  should be hosted by Arab capitals.    Why do we attend such talks at all? Is it because Washington  wants us to? If that is so, what about our national and  pan-Arab interests? And, why should we oblige Washington while  it points a gun at our head?    We call on the government to take its cue from his majesty  the king. If the blockade is not lifted by 17 April, we should  not send a delegation to Muscat. We will not go along with a  peace settlement that sets out to impoverish us. Are we  supposed to become as impoverished as the West bank and Gaza  strip population before we become eligible for peace?</p>

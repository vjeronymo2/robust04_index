			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Economics: Markets focus on G7 for signs of change FINANCIAL markets will this week scour reports from the Munich summit for hints of policies either to encourage growth or bolster specific currencies. Even if the news from the meeting of the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations fails to contain such nuggets, there will be plenty of economic data from other sources for the number-crunchers to work on. In the UK, further indications are expected on Friday of the degree to which inflationary pressures are being squeezed from the economy by the recession. Markets are expecting the increase in the year to June in the retail prices index to come out at 4.1 per cent, down from the 4.3 per cent for the 12 months to May. Elsewhere, important figures on the state of the labour market in both eastern and western Germany will provide signals as to the degree to which its economy is slowing down. Perversely, many commentators will hope these figures will indicate growing economic weakness. Assuming demand levels in German economy start to come down later this year, the way may be clear for the Bundesbank to reduce high German borrowing rates. Such a move would give the green light for other European countries to shave interest rates in a bid to revive their faltering economies. The following are the highlights of the week ahead.

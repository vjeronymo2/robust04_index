			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ON ROAD, OLD BULLETS WERE ALL-TIME DUDS  </P> <P> They played their home games in an old roller-skating rink, on a floor of  unvarnished wood. They changed their team colors three times during the 1953-54  National Basketball Association season. They were a quarrelsome lot, their  locker room split into factions. Their coach allegedly drank. Sometimes,  particularly on the road, he didn't even show up for games.  </P> <P> They were the Baltimore Bullets and they folded on Thanksgiving in 1954, but  not before setting a league record by losing 32 straight games in opponents'  gyms, a streak encompassing part of one season and all of another. They are  back in the news these days because the New Jersey Nets have lost 31 in a row  on the road, threatening the record, one of the NBA's oldest.  </P> <P> "But we had a whole different set of problems than the Nets do now," Paul  Hoffman was saying at his house in Glenarm, Md. An All-American at Purdue in  the 1940s, he was one of the Bullets' best players in those years, and the only  one who still lives in the area. Now 64, he works as a therapist at the  Maryland Rehabilitation Center.  </P> <P> He paints an unseemly portrait of his Bullets. The NBA was still a fledgling  operation then, low-paying and largely ignored, and the Bullets were  particularly flimsy. Their coach and general manager was Clair Bee, one of the  game's legends, a Hall of Famer who coached championship teams at Long Island  University. He was out of his element in the NBA, though, and near the end of  his career.  </P> <P> "Clair was anything but stable," Hoffman said. "He was drinking heavily. It's  sad. He's a legend, but to us he was anything but a coach. I've never really  said anything about it publicly. But he didn't coach, didn't manage, wasn't  around the club at all. We were on our own, and we just got our butts beat."  </P> <P> They were not completely without talent. Their best player, a big man named Ray  Felix, scored almost 7,000 points in his pro career. Hoffman was among the  league leaders in assists. Bob Houbregs, a forward, had been an All-American at  Washington. The Bullets won almost 40 percent of their home games during the  two seasons in which they built the losing streak.  </P> <P> They still were the worst team in the league, though, and it started at the  top. Instead of paying for a training camp before the 1954-55 season, Bee took  the team to Japan on a USO-sponsored trip. He was often absent without  explanation, and the team came back unprepared for the season. It was just as  hard in those days to win on the road. The disorganized Bullets were an easy  mark.  </P> <P> "Clair's secretary would call me before a trip to tell me he would meet us on  the road," Hoffman said. "I'd go by the office and get the plane tickets, and  I'd take the club on the road. We'd go for three or four games, and maybe for  the first three he wouldn't show up. I coached the team. We'd just get waxed.  </P> <P> "We didn't have any cohesion at all. Bee had brought in three of his players  from LIU. Al Roges, Rollie Hans and Hal Uplinger. They didn't have any damn  business being in the league. They caused problems on the floor and off. If  they wanted something, or if there was a dispute, they'd go to Clair and he'd  listen to them. We had a lot of dissension."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the road losses mounted. (The streak did not include games played at  neutral sites, of which there were many in those days.) The Bullets' last road  victory came on Jan. 1, 1953, an 83-81 defeat of the Milwaukee Hawks, in  overtime. They lost the rest of their road games that season, and every one in  the 1953-54 season.  </P> <P> "Toward the end of that year, we lost two in one night in Milwaukee," Hoffman  said. "They'd gotten fogged out trying to come here for a game, and Clair said  we'd just make it up the next time we went out there. Played a doubleheader.  Lost both by almost the same damn score (65-54 and 64-54). We were tired. You  try playing a doubleheader."  </P> <P> By that point in the season, Bee had changed the team's uniforms three times.  "We'd always used navy blue and mustard yellow on the road," Hoffman said, "but  Bee didn't like that, so he went and bought us solid black road uniforms. But  we lost so much he said, 'Shoot, you look worse in black than yellow and blue,'  and went and bought cardinal red."  </P> <P> Regardless of the color they wore, the Bullets would go into Minneapolis and  lose to the Lakers and George Mikan, the NBA's elite in those days. They would  lose in Boston to Bob Cousy, Bill Sharman and the Celtics; in Syracuse to Dolph  Schayes and the Nationals; in Philadelphia to Neil Johnston and the Warriors.  </P> <P> The eight-team NBA was just beginning to gain fans and compete with the popular  college game, and teams were beginning to think about moving into larger  arenas. The Bullets had no chance. They played their home games at the  Baltimore Coliseum, a little building with 3,900 seats in it. Tickets cost $2,  and crowds were skimpy.  </P> <P> "They'd have roller skating one night and we'd play the next," Hoffman said.  "The floor was just raw wood, no shellac on it. No one came to see us. We  always looked like we were getting ready to disband."  </P> <P> They finally did after playing 14 games in the 1954-55 season. They lost their  first two road games that year, stretching their streak to 34 in a row, then  broke it by beating the Knicks in New York. But all their games that season  were wiped from the books when the team disbanded. The players learned they  were folding after a 92-89 loss in Fort Wayne, Ind., to the Pistons.  </P> <P> "We didn't have enough money to get back to Baltimore," Hoffman said. "We'd run  out of meal money, expense money, didn't even have enough to pay for the hotel.  The hotel manager called and said, 'Don't leave until you pay.' I called the  airport and told them to hold the plane, and we hired a limo that came around  to the back of the hotel. We slid the bags out, jumped in and took off.  </P> <P> "The plane was waiting for us when we got to the airport. We went through a  side gate of the terminal, took the baggage right onto the plane, and they  closed the door and took off. We made it back and I never paid for the limo or  the hotel."  </P> <P> The Bullets' best players were picked up by other teams. One from the 1953-54  season, James Luisi, got into acting and years later wound up playing James  Garner's lieutenant on "The Rockford Files." Another, Hal Uplinger, got into  television production and helped pioneer the use of instant replay.  </P> <P> Hoffman retired after the season -- "there was no money in it" -- and went back  to Purdue, where he replaced a fraternity brother named Hank Stram as the  baseball coach and assistant basketball coach. He came back to Baltimore and  was the Bullets' general manager when they returned in 1963.  </P> <P> He never again ran into Clair Bee. The life of the famous coach, who invented  the 1-3-1 defense and later wrote a series of children's sports books, was at a  low ebb during his years in Baltimore.  </P> <P> "I stayed away from him after that," Hoffman said. "I wasn't very happy with  the way things turned out. It hurt my pro career. We just weren't a very good  team. We lost a lot of games. But we never had much of a chance."  </P></p>

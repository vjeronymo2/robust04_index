			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Morocco goes to the polls, but the king will still rule: Elections considered freer than in the past will help soften the monarch's feudal image IF THE first general elections to be held in Morocco in nine years do anything at all, it will be to soften the 'feudal' image many foreign observers have of King Hassan. Some 11.5m Moroccans go to the polls today, most with the secret hope that the results will be closer to the ballot papers cast than has traditionally been the case. If so, many Moroccans are likely to be encouraged in their hope that the king is seeking to broaden the narrow group of advisers and senior industrialists around him to include younger technocrats and businessmen. A new constitution endorsed by 99.96 per cent of the electorate last September requires the government to reflect the balance of forces in parliament. For his part, King Hassan has made public his wish to delegate some powers in recognition of changes in the kingdom over the past 20 years. Local elections in October last year were, by common consent, reasonably free. Provincial governors and other local officials brought less pressure to bear on voters than is customary. The amount of cash wielded by certain candidates, notably in the northern Rif region around Tangiers, provoked a public outcry, and the authorities were forced to bar some of them. The money is believed to come from the export, worth up to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year, of local cannabis, a long-standing mainstay of this traditionally poor region. The fact that most of the barred candidates belonged to the Constitutional Union (UC) and the National Assembly of Independents (RNI), the two key parties of government in the past eight years, embarrassed the government, which was seeking help from the European Community to eradicate cannabis and develop the north economically at the time. At the same time the opposition is pleased that the electoral register has been computerised and that 60,000 voters who appeared to enjoy the privilege of voting in two places will now enjoydoing so in one. Over the past 10 years, political parties have been allowed to speak out on a range of issues, including the increased inequality which has resulted from successive International Monetary Fund-backed economic restructuring programmes. But direct criticism of the monarch is out. The authorities have been ruthless with any opposition that is 'off limits', especially on Morocco's West Saharan policy. Last April, the international human rights organisation Amnesty International alleged that, despite 'positive changes in recent years', hundreds of people who had 'disappeared' for more than 10 years were still unaccounted for. The majority of 'disappearance' victims have been from Western Sahara. Today polling will take place in the Western Saharan provinces, as it did in 1984 and 1992, in spite of the fact that Moroccan sovereignty is not recognised by the UN and leading western powers. The election is for 222 constituencies in the 333-seat parliament. (The remaining seats will be filled by members elected from local councils and professional bodies.) The main opposition comes in the form of an alliance of four parties, the two most important of which are the nationalist Istiqlal party and the Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP). Meanwhile, Mr Abdeslam Yassine, who leads the radical Islamic Al Adl Wal-Ishan (Justice and Improvement) movement, remains under house arrest, and the party is barred from contesting the poll. The government-supporting RNI is led by the king's brother-in-law and former prime minister, Mr Ahmed Osman, and the UC by another former prime minister, Mr Maati Bouabid. Both parties are broad chapels in which personal and clan rivalries matter more than ideological differences. The main battle is to convince the electorate that casting a vote will make a difference to their lives. Some two thirds of the population are illiterate and the economic restructuring of the past decade has increased the extremes of wealth and poverty. A second year of drought last year and a poor cereal crop that cut gross domestic product by 3.5 per cent means that the half of the population that lives on the land may have more pressing matters to attend to. Many ordinary Moroccans would not dream of voting for an 'opposition' party  -for them that would be tantamount to sacrilege. The King of Morocco, scion of an Alaoui dynasty that has ruled the country since the 17th century, remains the real fount of all power, be it religious, symbolic or economic. Last September, the king repeated his view that the doctrine of Islam forbids him to reign without ruling. Most observers expect senior members of USFP and Istiqlal to join some form of coalition government. King Hassan has consistently demonstrated finely-tuned political antennae, time and again outmanoeuvring the opposition with a bold gesture. To pursue and deepen his dialogue with the EC, he knows that he must move beyond the trappings of democracy. The next government will provide a clearer indication of the speed at which the monarch wishes to travel.</p>

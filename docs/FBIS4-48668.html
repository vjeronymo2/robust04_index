			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Residents of Bugesera, southern Rwanda, who had  fled to Burundi, are now returning home. Only yesterday, 500  people crossed the border from Burundi to Rwanda. The returnees  have complained that the Red Cross officials in Burundi are  preventing the people from returning home. It has been reported  that the Red Cross has even tried to shift the refugee camps and  take them further into the interior of Burundi so as to make it  more difficult for the refugees to return home. The Red Cross  in Burundi is not succeeding because the refugees are returning  home in large numbers. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Lloyd's chief in threat to quit over reforms MR PETER MIDDLETON, chief executive of Lloyd's of London, yesterday threatened to resign if his plans for the introduction of corporate capital into the insurance market were not approved. He said that he and Mr David Rowland, the chairman, would quit unless Names  -the individuals whose assets underwrite the market - supported them at an extraordinary general meeting called for October 20. The warning came at a regional meeting in London yesterday afternoon of the Association of Lloyd's Names, the biggest Names group, and was confirmed last night by officials. 'They (Middleton and Rowland) are there to see the business plan through and if it fails they are off,' a spokesman for Lloyd's said. Mr Middleton's threat represents an escalation of the intensifying campaign by Lloyd's to ensure that its sweeping proposals announced in a new business plan in April are implemented. The centrepiece is the introduction for the first time of money pledged by corporate investors, who would not be subject to the unlimited liability requirements imposed on Names. Mr Rowland wrote to all Names last week urging them to support Lloyd's proposals. 'I believe that access to new capital is necessary to ensure that we can continue to trade as a significant force in the international market place,' he said. Lloyd's announced the extraordinary general meeting last month in an effort to head off any action by dissident loss-making Names that could delay the entry of the new 'incorporated Names'. It did so in spite of a previous egm held in July, which overwhelmingly endorsed the idea of corporate capital and defeated motions of no confidence proposed by dissident Names. All 32,000 Names on the market will be entitled to vote at the meeting, including many who have become insolvent following recent heavy underwriting losses. Mr Brian Garraway, who was deputy chairman of the Council of Lloyd's and first chairman of its regulatory board since the start of this year, has died.</p>

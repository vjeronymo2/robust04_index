			<p>BFN     [Text] Mainz (DPA) -- In the view of Mainz Interior  Minister Walter Zuber (Social Democratic Party of Germany),  Klaus Steinmetz, the former liaison official of the  Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the  Constitution, was not involved in the attack on the new prison  in Weiterstadt. "According to what I know of the  investigations, Klaus Steimetz has a watertight alibi for the  time of the deed," Zuber told the Rhineland-Palatinate Landtag  on Friday [22 April]. The attack in spring 1993 caused material  damage of about 130 million marks.    Concerning reports about the discovery of traces of  explosives in the car of the liaison man, who became known in  connection with the bloody antiterrorist operation in Bad  Kleinen in June 1993, Zuber said that, according to experts, the  substance is also used in other compounds. If only very small  amounts are available, one can hardly distinguish between traces  of explosives and traces of pharmaceuticals. Stienmetz put the  authorities on the track of suspected Red Army Faction  terrorists Wolfgang Grams and Birgit Hogefeld, who were caught  during the failed police operation in Bad Kleinen. Grams was  killed during the action.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We will now present a statement by the Romanian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs which states that it has learned  about the abominable tragedy in the sacred establishment in  Hebron in the West Bank, where scores of innocent people have  become victims of insanity and intolerance, with profound  concern.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs most firmly condemns this  criminal and irresponsible action just as it has condemned and  continues to condemn any act of violence committed by the forces  that oppose the easing of tensions in the Middle East.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses the hope that,  despite this dramatic incident and other attempts to hamper the  peace process, the desire by the sides to solve the conflict in  this area by political means will continue with the same  determination to capitalize on the favorable preconditions  offered by the results of the bilateral Arab-Israeli  negotiations in Washington, which have led to a mutual  recognition between the PLO and Israel and to the signing of the  principled declaration of 13 September 1993.    By virtue of its traditional relations in that area, Romania  reiterates its readiness and interest in supporting the process  of achieving peace, understanding, and economic cooperation in  the Middle East, the statement by the Romanian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, which has been faxed to us, emphasizes in  conclusion.</p>

A team of state and local officers raided  three bars and several other businesses and residences in Santa Barbara,  Carpenteria and Santa Maria as well as Rocklin, near Sacramento. The raids  concluded a six-week investigation led by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's  Department. The raids came after undercover officers made a series of large  cash bets at the bars and traced the movement of money to other locations.  </P></p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Maytag hit by Hoover flights promotion in UK MAYTAG, the US appliances group, yesterday announced a net loss of Dollars 10.5m in the first quarter after taking a Dollars 30m special charge to cover the cost of the controversial 'free flights' promotion by its Hoover subsidiary in the UK. The promotion, which offered free flights to the US for purchasers of more than Pounds 100 of Hoover products, backfired when Hoover was swamped by an unexpectedly high take-up rate. Mr Leonard Hadley, Maytag's chairman, told the company's annual meeting it had now bought a block of tickets on 11 airlines, covering 1,100 flights, 'to take care of customers over the next six months.' He said the episode was like a 'bad accident and you can't determine what was in the driver's mind,' and hinted that other employees could lose their jobs over the affair, in addition to three already dismissed. He said Maytag's earnings would hopefully improve this year, thanks to a new integrated sales approach in North America and new product models. The first-quarter loss, which worked through at 10 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 282.3m, or Dollars 2.66 a share, after accounting changes in the first period of 1992. Excluding the various charges, net income totalled Dollars 19.5m, compared with Dollars 24.7m a year ago, while sales dropped from Dollars 753.2m to Dollars 716.9m.</p>

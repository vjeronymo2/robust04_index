			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the Somali National Alliance, SNA,  has stated that groups of troublemakers opposed to stability and  peace in the country are busy creating a situation which could  lead to war. He said these groups are arming themselves in  preparation for war. The spokesman said the groups were the  same ones which perpetrated terrorist acts and relied on foreign  assistance. He said the objectives of the groups are:    1. To ensure that pacification does not take place among  communities in the central regions, including the Hiiraan  region, and also to ensure that the recently concluded Kismaayo  agreement, which was signed by communities in the Jubbada Hoose  region, is not implemented and;    2. To create insecurity, with the aim of ensuring that the  proposed national conference in Mogadishu does not take place.  The conference was proposed in the Nairobi agreement, was  witnessed by international organizations such as the United  Nations, the OAU, and leaders from friendly countries, who would  like peace and harmony to return to Somalia.    For these and other reasons, the SNA spokesman said, the  groups are trying to bring about a situation in which peace and  dialogue are not possible. In light of this, the SNA tells the  world that it will not be responsible for any consequences in  the country arising from war-mongering and insecurity. The SNA  once again appeals to the Somali people to guard against being  used to fight each other, and to strive to maintain peace and  stability in Mogadishu and throughout the country, the spokesman  concluded.</p>

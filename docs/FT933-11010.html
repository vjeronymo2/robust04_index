			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Commodities (Week In the Markets): Gold breaks through Dollars 400 barrier THE BUNDESBANK this week inadvertently succeeded where international speculators had repeatedly failed - by pushing the gold price through the psychologically-important Dollars 400-a-troy-ounce barrier. In response to the foreign exchange turmoil caused by the crisis into which the German central bank's refusal to cut its discount rate had precipitated the European Community's exchange rate mechanism, the price of the yellow metal - a traditional haven for money in times of currency uncertainty - leapt Dollars 11.65 to a post-Gulf War high of Dollars 405.75 an ounce on London bullion market yesterday. Yesterday's rise built on earlier gains reflecting concern about last weekend's violence in South Africa, the biggest gold producer, and the publication of a series of strong US economic indicators. But these factors had never threatened to lift the market out of its Dollars 388- to Dollars 395-an-ounce range, let alone to encourage a fresh assault on the Dollars 400 mark. Attempts to clear that hurdle two and a half weeks ago faltered in the face of stiff overhead resistance and the dispirited bulls allowed the price to settle back into its restricted range. But they had not abandoned all hope and this week's ERM crisis provided just the excuse they had been looking for to renew their efforts. The silver and platinum markets joined in the fun, the former ending 37 cents up on the week at Dollars 5.37 1/2 an ounce and the later Dollars 9.45 up at Dollars 413.60 an ounce. At the London Metal Exchange, meanwhile the exchange authorities stepped in to stop the fun some copper market operators are suspected of having in recent weeks. After expressing concern two weeks ago about technical supply tightness that was developing for the September-early October period, Mr David King, the chief executive, reacted this Thursday to continuing signs of market manipulation with a stern warning that the exchange 'will not hesitate to take such steps as are deemed necessary in the light of any changing situation'. The authorities concern was caused by a growing premium being charged for September delivery over the three months position, which had reached Dollars 17 a tonne. Such a situation - known in the trade as a 'backwardation' because it is a reversal of the normal situation where forward positions command premiums over nearbys - is usually associated with supply tightness, an explanation that hardly applies at the moment, with LME warehouse stocks close to a 15-year high. The guilty parties seemed yesterday to be paying little heed to Mr King's warning; the September-October premium had narrowed by only Dollars 1 a tonne by the close. And in defiance of the clearly bearish fundamentals the three months position edged up another Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 1,967.50 a tonne, up Dollars 56.75 on the week, while cash metal was up Dollars 10.50 on the day and Dollars 61 on the week at Dollars 1,971.50 a tonne. The nickel market's fundamentals are still more bearish - LME stocks have reached a record 101,568 tonnes - and there has been no attempt to defy them. This week saw a technical rally from the six-year lows reached on Monday, but that ran out steam yesterday, when the three months price fell back by Dollars 87.50 to Dollars 4,940 a tonne, up Dollars 30 on balance. The tin market had few friends as the recent gentle downtrend in stocks was reversed and demand remained slack. The three months LME price closed yesterday at Dollars 4,887.50 a tonne, down Dollars 57.50 on the week and a fresh 20-year low. The mood of the coffee market was altogether more cheerful. Although the Brazilian frost scare that pushed the London Commodity Exchange's September robustas position above Dollars 1,000 earlier this month had all but faded from traders memories, increasing faith in producers' determination to make their export retention scheme effective kept the market on the uptrend. The September futures price touched a seven-month high of Dollars 1,044 a tonne yesterday, before closing at Dollars 1,037 a tonne, up Dollars 44 on the week. As Latin American producers met in Rio de Janeiro this week to thrash out details of the cartel through which they plan to operate their agreed 20 per cent retention of scheduled exports, coffee traders continued to withdraw from the scepticism with which they had initially greeted the scheme. 'The retention scheme is now almost a fact of life,' one trader told the Reuter news agency. 'The only thing now is how long it's going to last and what will be the effect.' Having accepted that the Latin Americans mean what they say the coffee market is looking with growing interest towards their meeting next month in Kampala, Uganda, aimed at agreeing a co-ordinated retention plan. Mr Arega Worku, scecretary-general of the Inter-African Coffee Organisation, said yesterday that ministers from African producing countries, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and Central America would meet on August 16 and 17. He said the scheme should be in place the start of the 1993-4 coffee marketing season on October 1. The coffee retention plan has been well-timed, according to the latest coffee report from ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house. 'Producer stocks are low and exportable production is around or below annual international demand, which we estimate at some 74m bags.'  ------------------------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------------ Aluminium        +9,700   to   1,948,800 Copper           -1,875   to     463,250 Lead             +1,950   to     272,500 Nickel           +1,176   to     101,568 Zinc             +2,900   to     715,300 Tin                +440   to      20,915  ------------------------------------------------</p>

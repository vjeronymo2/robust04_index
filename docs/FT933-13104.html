			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Recruitment: The Doubleday family's damaging effect - Backroom research by Japanese economist casts light on real problems of employment SO soon after Japan's royal wedding, it's perhaps un-seemly to liken Tsugunori Hara to the boy who proclaimed that the emperor was wearing no clothes. There is nevertheless a strong case for doing so, the reasons being twofold. The first is that Tokyo, where Mr Hara works as an economist at the Sumitomo-Life Research Institute, was also the site of the announcement of the forthcoming international conference on how to create jobs in industrialised countries. The other is that, on past performance, the political eminences doing the conferring will overlook the point the Tokyo economist has apparently made. I say 'apparently' because the only information to hand on his feat is a two-sentence snippet based on a news agency report which can no longer be traced. It says Mr Hara has proclaimed that Japan's real unemployment rate, far from being the 2.5 per cent officially recorded, is 6 per cent. He has arrived at the higher figure by taking account, not just of citizens who are unwillingly jobless, but also of what he terms 'in-house unemployment' - the numerous people who, although occupying paid positions, have little if any actual work to do. Having no more data, we alas can't check his way of estimating how many such people there are. All I can say is that if they really amount to only 3.5 per cent of those available for employment, Japan has cause to be proud. But our lack of knowledge of his methods does not detract from the importance of the point he has made: that employment, as gauged by numbers in jobs, is not the same as productive work. Nor is the distinction any less important for the fact that it could hamper the international political leaders soon to confer. For, if they just ignored the difference as usual, their task in creating jobs would be a doddle. Indeed they might well go far towards it simply by acting in precisely the reverse way to the government of Singapore which, fearing an over-supply of lawyers, is taking steps to cull them. In explaining the policy, the minister responsible talked fore-bodingly of a time soon coming when there would not be enough work for the country's lawyers to do. With all due respect, however, the odds are that Judgment Day will be over and done with before the time he spoke of arrives. The reason is that lawyers fall into the category of employees who not only create work for one another, but also undo the work that the others have done. Hence the more of them there are, the busier they will become. The only trouble of course is that, far from being productive, the net effect could conceivably be harmful - as witness a hypothetical couple the Jobs column has nightmares about, called Michael and Margaret Doubleday. Since he is a senior inspector of taxes and she a tax-avoidance accountant, they have more self-cancelling work to do than time to enjoy their resulting opulence. Moreover, as professional ethics require them to work well apart, they rarely meet. But they did get together for long enough 16 years ago to have a son nicknamed Buster who, agonised by his parents' remoteness, expresses his disaffection by vandalising public property. Hey presto: a family producing net harm. In fact, the only point of their existence is to show that society would have been better off if either Michael or Margaret - and it doesn't matter which one - had given up employment to ensure that Buster received the love as well as the discipline essential to a civilised up-bringing. Accordingly I present the Doubledays along with Mr Hara's calculation to the politicians booked in for the conference. Perhaps the gift will remind them that the best way ahead may lie, not in creating more employment of the purely self-nourishing sort, but in engineering a reduced demand for it by social-security and legal measures to encourage a strengthening instead of further fragmenting of family life. NOW to the table alongside, showing developments in the United Kingdom's executive employment market as gauged by the MSL consultancy's quarterly counts of jobs for managers and senior specialists advertised in UK national journals. The upper part of the table focuses on the year to June 30, starting with the separate 12-month tallies for eight broad categories of work. Then comes the overall total, with the individual quarterly counts beneath. As may be seen from the April-June tally at the bottom, while the plunge in advertised demand is not yet over, it is closer to being so than it has been for almost four years, being only 0.4 per cent down on April-June 1991-92. But before anyone breaks into wild rejoicing, it must be noted that six of the work categories still show falls from the levels of 12 months before. By that yardstick, the only two with increases are sales-and- marketing and computing, both of which have been on a rising path for nine months without transferring any of their upward energy to any other field. True, the accounting category shows signs of being about to join them - although whether that's good or bad news is another question.</p>

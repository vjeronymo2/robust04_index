			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Prague to raise Dollars 250m in first offering since 1920s The City of Prague is preparing to launch its first bond offering since the 1920s to help finance the modernisation of its underground transport system, built during Communist rule. Prague, the only east European borrower apart from the Czech Republic to have obtained an investment-grade rating (it is rated triple-B with a positive outlook by Standard &amp; Poor's), intends to raise Dollars 250m in the international bond market next week. Nomura, the Japanese securities house, is arranging the issue of five-year Eurobonds which are expected to be priced to yield around 120 basis points over US treasuries. Mr Jan Koukal, the mayor of Prague, said the city wanted to provide a cheap and efficient service for its 1.2m inhabitants to motivate them to use public transport. 'We have many problems with technology because we were forced to use Russian metro trains,' he said at a presentation to investors in London. More than one-third of Prague's expenditure of Kcs16.9bn (Dollars 577m) in 1993 was spent on public transport, the largest single area of the city's expenditure. Mr Koukal said it was likely that the city would have to continue to heavily subsidise the system. But he added that this drain on resources should be offset by Prague's strong local economy, its growing revenue base, its good control over expenditures and its significant property holdings. Moody's yesterday placed the Baa3 long-term foreign currency debt rating of the Czech Republic under review for a possible upgrade. About Dollars 835m of debt is affected. The review is motivated by the favourable macroeconomic trends in the Czech Republic, and the country's progress to a market economy. Moody's said the shifts in the economy in recent years had not generated significant imbalances, noting that the fiscal budget and current account of the balance of payments had a slight surplus in 1993. It added that although the economy declined by 1.5 per cent last year and inflation reached 20 per cent, these trends reflected the ongoing structural change.</p>

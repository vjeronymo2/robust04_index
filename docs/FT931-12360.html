			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Letter: 'Clarification' has only complicated competitive tendering Sir, No doubt Mr Michael Forsyth was trying to be helpful in his letter (January 22) explaining the application of the EC Business Transfers Directive in the UK. Indeed, he was merely repeating the views expressed by the attorney general on January 21 at the standing committee considering the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill. Unfortunately, this 'clarification' complicates the situation and gives no assistance to those trade unions, private contractors and local authorities seeking to understand how the directive applies to compulsory competitive tendering. Equally it does nothing to explain why government departments have adopted different (and contradictory) approaches to the effects which the directive may have on a range of other transfers from the public to the private sector - market testing, tendering in the National Health Service, etc. The TUC welcomes the government's proposals in the bill to remedy the defective implementation of the EC Directive in the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981. However, what we are also looking for is clear and definitive guidance from the government on whether the regulations will protect the rights of those people at work affected by CCT and market testing. It is simply not sufficient for the Department of Employment to abdicate responsibility and say that whether the regulations apply is a question of trust to be determined by the courts. Litigation is a lengthy and expensive process which all the parties affected by the present situation wish to avoid. The decisions of the European Court of Justice in the field are clear, and it is for the government to explain the relationships between these judgments, the regulations and government policy. The fact is that the principle behind the directive is a fundamental one: that the interests of employees should be protected where transfers of undertakings take place. Any proposal to withdraw this limited but essential right would fly in the face of the basis of Community social policy, which is that the objective of policy should not prevent change but ensure that the interests of the workforce are protected as change takes place. That has the supplementary benefit of tending to reduce the opportunities for short-term employer strategies which would unermine the competitive edge of the Community in the longer term. That is why the government's argument for a derogation from or withdrawal of the directive is unlikely to find favour with other Community member states. We would therefore welcome a clear statement from ministers on the steps which employers must take to ensure full compliance with the directive. We need to know which operations in the government's view are relevant transfers and which are not. Norman Willis, general secretary, TUC, Congress House, Great Russell Street, London WC1B 3LS</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi by Samir </F> Tawfiq; place, date not given]    [Excerpts] [Tawfiq] Which countries finance terrorism in  Egypt and when will they be named? Not naming them causes  confusion. Defining them is important so that we know the  countries that do not want stability for us.    [Al-Alfi] We have some good information about the financing  and training places and the planners and their locations. But  there is an advantage in not revealing all the facts about this  issue, because there are continuing efforts and intense contacts  under way with numerous countries to cooperate with us. Indeed,  several fugitive terrorists have been arrested and others have  been handed over. I hope you will not ask for the names of  these countries and any figures right now, so that we will leave  them in the dark.    [Tawfiq] But the minister told a news conference he would  name these countries.    [Al-Alfi] Yes, but I said I would do that at the proper  time.  When I announce a specific location and say we brought in  someone from there, his colleagues will go elsewhere or flee the  country and thus we will have done them a service by warning  them.    The same thing applies to terrorist operations. Sometimes we  ask that news of such operations is not published and  journalists start asking in whose interest is this secrecy. I  tell them: Yes, there is an advantage, that of the  investigation.    There are two examples: First, when we arrested the first  suspect and banned the publication [of news] on the attempt to  kill the prime minister. Then, we arrested nine suspects in  subsequent measures.    The second example was the Hulwan movie theater incident.  After news was published of two arrests, the others escaped  after reading the newspapers. We had pinpointed their locations  but found nothing except that day's newspapers. [passage omitted]    It is not only Egypt that faces terrorism, because it is  apparent that there is a plot to strike at every Arab and  Islamic country in the name of Islam. Training in implementing  this plot takes place abroad, where they assemble personnel of  every nationality in one place. The methods of arming,  training, and financing are the same. I saw pictures of  incidents carried out by terrorists abroad and found them  compatible with what happens in Egypt. The bombs have the same  materials; they put nails and ball bearings in the bombs and use  the same detonator. Weapons here and abroad are used in the  same way and the training is the same. [passage omitted]    If we had wanted to eliminate terrorism fast, we could have  done so by resorting to extraordinary measures. But we are  confronting terrorism with law and democracy, not resorting to  extraordinary measures.    In addition to aborting the plots that were prepared during  the new year, Christmas, and police day celebrations, we aborted  other plots, arrested the plotters, and seized documents  containing the names of some personalities. But I will not name  names. All these are now cases, which will be referred to the  court. The trials will be public. But secrecy will be  maintained during the interrogation period.    [Tawfiq] Have antiterrorism steps been developed?    [Al-Alfi] Most important for us, the security men, is that  we  adopt a scientific course and sound planning and train on the  highest level, in addition to acquiring weapons. The police  department has been supplied with the most modern weapons.  Police missions travel abroad. Technicians and experts arrive  in Egypt to train us. The whole department has undergone such  training.    I want to say something: Our action is no longer a  tit-for-tat response. The initiative now is in the hands of the  police. This has produced better results. We are searching for  the terrorists' hideouts. We have arrested many terrorists and  seized their equipment, explosives, and weapons. Thus, we have  foiled several incidents before they took place.    If the terrorists are targeting policemen to get at the  morale of the entire police department, I tell them: Every  incident against a policeman, security man, or any citizen  increases our determination to eliminate these terrorists. It  also deepens our faith because we uphold justice and defend  religion and the homeland. The initiative is in our hands and  will remain so, despite the sacrifices. [passage omitted]    [Tawfiq] Terrorist incidents take place in broad daylight in  crowded places in Upper Egypt's governorates. How do you  explain the people's failure to resist the terrorists? Is this  due to the negative attitude of the Upper Egypt resident to some  customs and traditions that prevent him from intervening or to  the police's bad treatment of citizens?    [Al-Alfi] One thing manifested in these crimes is the custom  of taking revenge. This custom still exists. In some cities  and villages in Upper Egypt, the people take their own revenge  and do not surrender the criminal to the authorities. They  don't even receive condolences for their own dead until they  have taken revenge. Some families teach their children to take  revenge as soon as they are old enough to use firearms. The  mountains on both sides of the valley in Upper Egypt also make  it easy for criminals and accused people to escape.    I can say the police don't get involved in ill treatment.  But there is no doubt that like other police forces, there are  violations.    [Tawfiq] Why, when owners of licensed weapons apply to renew  their licenses, are weapons being withdrawn? This is happening  more and more. And why have stringent measures been adopted  when it comes to granting new licenses?    [Al-Alfi] It is not an issue of making things easier or more  difficult. The firearms law is clear. There must be  justifications and reasons, as stipulated by law, for granting a  firearms license. What is happening is that some people are  carrying weapons without any legal justification. But when  there is a justification, the license is issued immediately.  Many incidents happened in Upper Egypt in front of people  carrying licensed weapons; they did not attempt to intervene.  The issue here does not relate to licensed or unlicensed  weapons, but to customs and traditions.    In the past few months we seized about 18,000 unlicensed  weapons. We also discovered many weapons manufacturing shops and  stores illegally trading in weapons. These stores' licenses  have been canceled and their owners brought to trial. [passage  omitted]</p>

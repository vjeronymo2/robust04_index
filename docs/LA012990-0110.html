			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: STREISAND'S 'PRINCE OF TIDES' MOVED TO COLUMBIA  </P> <P> NO GRASS has grown under the fast feet of Jon Peters -- now one of the  billion-dollar boys of Columbia, playing "Kong" to Peter Guber's "King." Jon,  once hairdresser to Barbra Streisand, then Barbra's lover, then Barbra's movie  producer-partner for many years, has now inked Streisand's latest pet project.  "The Prince of Tides" has been moved from MGM/UA to Columbia.  </P> <P> So Jon and Barbra will be working together again. She'll direct the movie and  also play the role of the New York City psychiatrist. But Barbra, who tried  over the last two years to talk Robert Redford into portraying the  teacher-coach of the Carolina-Georgia Tidewater region, has given up on her  "The Way We Were" co-star. She will put Nick Nolte in the leading role of Pat  Conroy's novel.  </P> <P> JUST WAIT until tomorrow when Premiere magazine's March issue hits the stands  with a bang. It may cause whimpers. Editors Nancy Griffin and Kim Masters have  interviewed scores of movie pros who've worked through the years with  Guber-Peters. Sources had much to say, including Jon's ex-wife, Lesley Ann  Warren, and "Mad Max" director George Miller, who toiled with the two on "The  Witches of Eastwick."  </P> <P> The article is the latest in a series of deadly portraits of Columbia's new  boss men. (Vanity Fair and Fortune have already had their say.) Everybody  credits Jon and Peter with very special talents, but they are also cited for an  ability to spend lots of other people's money, to cross-market deals, and to  take credit for the work of others. I don't think Guber-Peters will like this  story, but Hollywood will be riveted.  </P> <P> SPEAKING OF Lesley Ann Warren -- she is the talk of TV with her coming CBS  miniseries, "Family of Spies." It unravels for six hours beginning Feb. 4.  Lesley Ann periodically revives her career; remember her as the dizzy  gangster's girl in "Victor/Victoria"?  </P> <P> Even hotter is the word-of-mouth about her as Flora in the A&amp;E channel's  Feb. 1 adaptation of Tennessee Williams' "Twenty-Seven Wagons Full of Cotton."  Lesley co-stars with Ray Sharkey and Peter Boyle in this sizzler.  </P> <P> WANT TO read a different point of view? Almost everything written about "Roger  and Me" applauds the idea of the little guy standing up to an industry titan.  But the capitalist film critic Malcolm Forbes says: "The real irony of the  movie is that no one in America has exerted more Herculean efforts to get the  U.S. automotive industry back in high gear than Roger Smith. He has revitalized  the world's largest business while it's been besieged by lower-waged foreign  competition. To make this warm, caring, top-notch CEO the film's villain is the  ultimate irony."  </P> <P> REMEMBER? There were two very sensationalizing books about machinations at CBS  News over the last year. But if you want to read a REAL insider's considered  and dispassionate story of this great network, pick up the super book by Les  Midgley, titled "How Many Words Do You Want?" Veteran Midgley gives us a grand  look at the "golden age" of newspapers and TV. This is "must" reading for  dedicated news junkies alike.  </P></p>

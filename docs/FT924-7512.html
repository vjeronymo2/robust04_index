			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Risk and Reward: Traders in volatility relish the profits on recent uncertainties THE events of the past two months could have been stage-managed for anyone who trades on uncertainty. The French vote on Maastricht, the US election, the Canadian referendum  - each had the power to turn the tide in financial markets, and each seemed too close to call in advance. For the growing band of volatility-traders - the people who do not mind what happens to prices, as long as uncertainty about them rises - it was a godsend. Option pricing is a complex business. But it is intuitively not difficult to grasp why volatility itself has a price. Uncertainty, for example, about the outcome of an election, may have no effect on the level of interest rates or equity and currency prices. But it will make it more expensive to hedge a particular market exposure. More people will want to buy protection, pushing up the cost. This extra cost - the price of greater perceived risk in a market - reflects a change in what options traders call implied volatility. Trading on that volatility, rather than any actual movement in market prices, has become a popular pastime among banks active in the derivative markets, and even some fund managers. To do it, traders buy two matching options, a call and a put, which exactly cancel each other out. One may give the right to buy sterling at 1.50 to the dollar in three month's time, the other the right to sell at the same rate. Underlying market risk - known as delta risk - is neutralised. What remains is a play on volatility - or gamma risk, in the jargon of the options market. The volatility of the Italian bond futures market is around 8 per cent at the moment: prices have settled into a relatively narrow range after the gyrations of September. If that volatility rate leapt back to the 25 per cent peak of September, then anyone holding matching put and call options could sell both of them on at a profit. Even if you're wrong about volatility rising, you can still make money this way. If prices in the market move far enough, no matter in which direction, you could exercise one option at a profit and let the other expire worthless. One risk is that volatility will not rise but fall, against a background of stable market prices. That is roughly what has happened in recent weeks across a range of markets. The volatility of German government bond futures has fallen from 5 per cent a month ago to under 3 per cent. This decline may be bad for anyone betting on volatility, but it has made it cheaper for investors or companies to hedge their financial exposures. It is better to buy an option when volatility is low. In extreme circumstances, such as mid-September in Europe, it can be not only prohibitively expensive but actually impossible to hedge. Falling volatility is not the only way to lose money - as the events of recent weeks have taught less-experienced options traders. Rising uncertainty punishes traders who have sold, rather than bought, volatility. Also, interest rates can jump through the roof, sending the carrying costs of an option position soaring - in Sweden, the overnight rate leapt to 500 per cent at one point. And it takes a real market shake-out to reveal the flaws in new-fangled financial instruments. One such is the 'stop-out', or 'one-touch' option. This was designed to reduce the cost of hedging: the option is exerciseable if the price moves to a certain level, but if it moves far enough in the opposite direction, the contract instantly expires. Recent oscillations in some ERM currencies proved too much for these instruments, as prices bounced up and down, killing off the options before they could be exercised. Trading in volatility could itself have profound effects on underlying markets - a consideration which has not been lost on regulators. Some options strategies are actually designed to increase volatility. Where will the volatility traders look next for a profit? Most still think Europe offers the best opportunities. The French elections, the next event stage-managed for the options market, are still some way off. But in the meantime there is always the chance of some excitement at or beyond the fringes of the ERM. Italy and Sweden, the most volatile markets in September, remain the favourites. European central bankers should tighten their safety belts: it could be a bumpy ride ahead.</p>

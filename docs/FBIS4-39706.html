			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Theses" of speech by Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich </F> delivered at the inauguration of the Center of Ethnic Cultures  on 3 June 1994: "There Will Never Be Second-Rate People in  Belarus"]    [Text] Dear compatriots!    I want to use today this simple and, at the same time,  meaningful phrase that unites us all -- citizens of the Republic  of Belarus!    All of us in our young sovereign state should aim for a  single goal and desire -- to realize ourselves and become  forever a single nation of Belarus.    While looking in the statistical data, one may easily see  that Belarus is a multinational state. Almost one-third of its  population is comprised of Russians, Ukrainians, Jews,  Lithuanians, Poles, Tatars, and other nationalities.    Our policy is based on respect with regard to all  nationalities living in the territory of the Republic. Creating  the model for our new statehood, we have laid fundamental  principles of the relations between the state and all  nationalities. These are: civic equality, social equality,  economic, and political guarantees for every resident of the  Republic, regardless of nationality, rights to national cultural  development, and many others.    Now, inaugurating our cultural center, I have remembered an  idea from ancient philosophers: "A nation is strong because of  its people!"    It is a great happiness when the social and historical  foundations of one nation is interwoven with the cultures and  traditions of many ethnic communities. This enriches the  intellectual life of the entire society.    As a matter of fact, we cannot put artificial national  barriers between us today.    In our Republic, over half of the marriages are mixed; past,  present, and future generations are closely joined by blood and  cultural affinity.    However, every one of us has an undeniable right (and a holy  right, as well) to preserve his or her national heritage,  historical culture, and spiritual values.    The guarantor of all this is the state -- sovereign and  multinational in its essence.    These guarantees are set forth in our Constitution and laws.    They include the right to education in native language, the  right to follow one's national cultural tradition, and the right  to national and political equality.    All this is important, not only in a physical aspect. We are  faced today with the difficult task to find a way out of the  economic crises. This task can be resolved only by our joint  efforts. Only a nation that holds together the best sources of  various national cultures, common intellectual life, and civic  accord, is capable of resolving such a problem.    I, being one of the state leaders, can see all these  problems  very clearly. Therefore, the government continues to render  assistance to all ethnic cultural associations.    Yes, I am a supporter of dual citizenship. Not everything is  simple in this issue. However, I think that one will feel  oneself more stable socially if the issue is resolved this way.  This is a very democratic and civilized norm. Yet there are  opponents. You know who they are.    One more argument. Over 3 million Belarusians are living  outside of our Fatherland. They are true sons and daughters of  Belarus. They have the right to possess the citizenship of their  Republic.    I also rule out a possibility of the partition of our  society  due on the principle of the indigenous nation and national  minorities.    Dear fellow-citizens!    We undoubtfully need a network of such centers, as this one  being inaugurated today, in other regions of the Republic. We  must render governmental assistance to multinational system of  publishing. It is necessary to broadcast special programs for  the nationalities on radio and television.    It is necessary to create kindergartens, classes, and  schools  namely for the nationalities. This is not an infringement on  Belarusian language, education, and culture.    This is a logical and natural process in the life of a  civilized and multinational state.    These days, one may often hear that there is nothing wrong  in  the word "nationalism." Is it a good word? The point is not in  the ideas themselves, but in that what is behind these ideas  historically. We know very well, and remember, that this means  woe, tears, interethnical conflicts, human blood...    I did not even mention fascism.    There is, and will ever be, no roots of nationalism in  Belarus. Here live different peoples -- of great spirit and  philanthropy.    This is a country where nobody will be able to impose on the  people the shameful norm of taking on employees according to the  percentage of nationalities; there will also never be  second-rate people in Belarus. Our people are capable of  cutting off any shoots of nationalism and put them into  historical rubbish!    National cultural problems also include those of religions.  We have over 20 religions today. Understandably, there are  numerous religions, as well as small ones.    The matter is in something else. The issues of national  accord go well back to the high principles of divine morals. It  is not important what your religious beliefs may be. It is  important how you honor those principles. I would not like  discuss politics today. The best politics -- I am sure that you  will agree with me -- is to accomplish a concrete business.    For example, the creation of our cultural center is a good  foundation for future business.    The center will be visited by both adults and children. It  will be a source of what can be called by one good word -- the  Motherland.    We have a custom of giving presents on such momentous days.  As a matter of fact, this center is a present from the  government and our good-willed veterans who amiably agreed to  make room for the cultural center in their place.    However, I am of different stock. I prefer to feel myself a  debtor, in the good sense of the word, with regard to the  development of ethnic cultures and interethnic relations -- it  opens a permanent perspective for resolving new tasks and  problems in this direction.    Thank you for your attention and I wish you every happiness  in your new home!</p>

It was  manifest in the refusal to have Jerusalem mentioned as an  occupied Palestinian city. Likud lost in Israel but it still  rules supreme in Washington.    The Likud Party lost power in Israel but Likud logic still  prevails in the U.S. political circles. In its approach to the  Arab-Israeli conflict and especially the Palestinian question,  the U.S. Administration appears to be more Israeli than the  Israelis. It is a Likudist approach, putting pressure on the  ruling Labor Party to rise to the level of its own extremism.  The latest UN Security Council discussions presented a rare  opportunity to demonstrate that U.S. (Likudist) position as it  really is.    In the beginning, and despite the Hebron massacre,  Washington  was opposed to the issuance of any resolution by the Security  Council and just called for a statement by the chairman only  condemning the massacre. It was acting on Israel's behalf.  When it realized the magnitude of the Palestinian and Arab fury  as a result of the massacre and the extent of the world's  sympathy with the victims of the massacre, Washington kindly  agreed to let the Security Council pass a resolution provided it  did not condemn Israel. The Council would have had to condemn  the massacre as an anonymous act by unknown people in an unknown  place with unknown responsibility and unknown culpability.    When the Palestinian side tried to link the massacre to the  Geneva Convention on occupation and people under occupation, the  United States opposed that and insisted that there should be no  mention in the resolution of Jerusalem as an occupied city. It  objected to that part of the resolution when voting took place.    The United States wants to force the world to act on the  basis that the Oslo agreement supersedes everything that came  before it, that all the Security Council's resolutions on  Jerusalem, the massacres, the deportations, and the settlements,  are now null and void and no longer constitute terms of  reference for the negotiations, and that the only terms of  reference are the Oslo agreement and what the negotiators agree  upon in their meetings.    The Likudist character of the U.S. Administration is no  illusion, nor is it an exaggeration. The Jewish lobby in the  United States is openly pro-Likud. It had even opposed the Oslo  agreement. Shim'on Peres, the architect of that agreement, had  to go to Washington to persuade the Jewish lobby to accept it  because it was in Israel's interest. Furthermore, the main  Jewish figures in the U.S. Administration who are responsible  for the handling of the Palestinian question, are also  pro-Likud, from Dennis Ross to Martin Indyk. In addition to  that Likudist line, the U.S. Administration is willing to change  the Security Council from an international body to a secretariat  attached to the White House. Voting on the massacre resolution  was postponed 12 times. The postponements took place after  phone calls from Warren Christopher to the U.S. representative  at the Security Council. That representative (not the the  Council's chairman) then announced these postponements to  reporters. When asked by reporters: Are you disappointed? She  replied: I am always disappointed -- having been transformed  from being the representative of a superpower into a mere  secretary receiving orders on the telephone. The U.S. position  on the Security Council and on Jerusalem in particular is a  dangerous position, very dangerous indeed, and its seriousness  may even be greater than that of the massacre itself  necessitating a general Arab awareness and a unified Arab stand  rising to the level of the issue of Jerusalem and what it means  to everyone.    Dennis Ross was threatening Yasir 'Arafat when he told him  that discussion of the issue of the settlements and  international protection would bring down Rabin. In other  words, it would bring Likud to power. Examined in depth, that  was not an American threat but rather a U.S. wish and a hint as  to what could happen in the future as the U.S. Administration  prepares to implement the Likud designs fully.</p>

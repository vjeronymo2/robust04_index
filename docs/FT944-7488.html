			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Harrisons seeks to rein in expectations Harrisons &amp; Crosfield shares dropped 8 per cent yesterday as the chemicals, commodities and building supplies company sought to rein in profit expectations for the second consecutive year. Mr Martin Anderson, finance director, said the expected recovery in pig prices had not materialised in the second half, and malt margins remained depressed. In addition, profits would be hit by a Pounds 10m rationalisation charge. As a result, he said, analysts' profit expectations might have been too high. Harrisons had also sought to clear up confusion about the impact of disposals completed this year, which have netted the company about Pounds 134m. Analysts cut profit forecasts from about Pounds 115m to less than Pounds 90m, excluding the disposal proceeds. The share price dropped 13p to 149p, a far sharper fall than the 2 per cent decline in the overall market. 'It is a litany of mini-disasters,' said one analyst. 'The management is definitely on trial now.' Last year forecasts were pulled back by about Pounds 5m after a similar trading statement. The analyst speculated that further disappointment from Harrisons could leave it open to a possible takeover bid. It is known that at least one large company has examined the possibility of a break-up bid in the last 18 months. Mr Anderson said Harrisons expected to incur losses of about Pounds 3.5m in the pigs business this year, similar to last time. The chemicals division was having a mixed year, with pressure on margins from higher raw material costs in some sectors and solid advances in others. Mr Anderson said that the UK building supplies business had experienced strong first-half growth. The US building supplies business was ahead of last year. Profits from the Papua New Guinea plantation would be lower in the second half.</p>

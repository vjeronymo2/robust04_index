He  added, however, that it is not a legal problem but a political  one. Venizelos said the Greek Government is particularly  satisfied with the outcome of the European foreign ministers'  meeting because it handled the issue as a political one.    Venizelos said the measures continue to be implemented.  Asked whether EU Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek will visit  Skopje and Athens, the spokesman replied positively and added  that his mission would be to examine the situation. The  government spokesman said Van Den Broek will meet the Greek  Government, which will express its well-known and clear  positions. He said: For us, dialogue will begin when [FYROM  President Kiro] Gligorov's government gives tangible proof of  goodwill.    Asked about the community's mechanism and Van Den Broek's  visit to Athens and Skopje, Venizelos said the Dutch  commissioner will pay a visit in order to determine whether  Skopje maintains the same intransigent behavior. Greece has  adopted these measures after considering Skopje's intransigence.  The spokesman described as absurd reports of an equal distance  between the EU, Greece, and Skopje, because Greece is a member  of the community and currently holds the presidency. Venizelos  concluded: A presidency that has been praised so far.</p>

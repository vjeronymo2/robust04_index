			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] London ITV Television Network in English  at 2000 GMT on 13 April in its "Dispatches" program carries a  45-minute report entitled "Pocket Neutron," in which  correspondent Gwyn Roberts reviews the findings of an 18-month  investigation he conducted into red mercury, a chemical compound  allegedly used by the Russians to develop a smaller, more  efficient nuclear warhead.    The program opens with various shots of a border crossing in  Como, northern Italy, and goes on to include a brief interview  with Italian Magistrate Romano Dolce on the smuggling of red  mercury through Italy. Asked about its final destination,  Dolce, speaking in Italian with English subtitles, says:  "Israel, Iraq, Iran, South Africa, and the rest of the world.  Even Western countries like the United States seem interested  in red mercury. Why should it be top secret? Why this silence?  Why this fear of talking about it?"    Brief clips are then shown of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy during  his visit to Serbia in February this year, followed by various  street scenes in Moscow. Roberts then introduces a recording  of an interview he conducted with an unidentified Kremlin  official who, he says, has access to full government  intelligence. Roberts asks: "What proof do you have that there  is such a substance?" The official replies: "The hardest  evidence is the report prepared by the first chief directorate  of the KGB. This report was prepared especially for Boris  Yeltsin. The conclusion of this report is that there is no  doubt that red mercury exists."    Roberts asks: "What military applications of red mercury are  listed in the KGB report?" The official states: "The  production of fuses of high precision for conventional bombs.  The production of fuses for nuclear bombs. The production of  military equipment coating to avoid radar detection, production  of warheads for self-guided missiles of high precision."    Asked whether red mercury represents new technology, the  official replies: "I think it does." He goes on to say that  Iraq, Libya, Israel, and South Africa all wish to purchase red  mercury because they all want nuclear weapons.    Roberts is then seen at the Moscow metro where he meets an  unidentified former nuclear chemist who worked at a secret plant  in the Urals. They are then seen in an apartment where the  chemist is interviewed. Roberts asks why everyone denies that  red mercury exists. The chemist replies: "Because of reasons of  secrecy." Roberts asks: "Why should they want to keep it  secret?" The chemist says: "Because it is the latest  technology. If it is available to the Third World it may be a  serious danger to existing order."    Still photographs are then shown of containers labeled RM  2020, followed by clips of diagrams of how red mercury can be  used and a government document on the existence of the  substance. A person described as the head of the Promocology  company exhibits what purports to be the raw material for RM  2020. Scenes of the Moscow White House siege of 1993 are then  shown.    Roberts then interviews an unidentified military scientist  in  Moscow, who he says worked as a nuclear physicist producing RM  2020 for five years. Roberts asks: "Why is red mercury such a  mystery?" The scientist replies: "The fact is that it is the  latest technology which allows an atom bomb to be made very  simply." Roberts asks: "So you are saying that with red mercury  and nuclear materials an atom bomb could be easily assembled by  Third World countries?" The scientist replies: "Yes, that could  happen." Asked how red mercury would be used, the scientist  states: "It can reduce the critical mass and increase the power  of the explosion."    The program shows street scenes in Ekaterinburg and a  meeting  with former nuclear physicist Yevgeniy Korolov, who replies to  Dr. Taylor's questions. Korolov says: "This technology is one of  the most complex and one of the most dangerous. It enables you  to create micro-nuclear charges. This means it can be used for  nuclear terrorism."    The program concludes with a visit by Roberts to a security  company near Bonn, which trades with Russia and has business  links with secret military plants producing radioactive  isotopes. A document acquired in Ekaterinburg is shown which  demonstrates that this company wishes to purchase 1,000 kg of RM  2020, cutting to what is described as a list of the chemical  properties of RM 2020.</p>

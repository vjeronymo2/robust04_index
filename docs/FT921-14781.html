			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / James McCallum: Obituary JAMES (Jim) McCallum, who died in hospital on Sunday at the age of 28, had already established a reputation as a skilled and accurate FT reporter who could get to the heart of complicated financial markets and explain them with clarity and authority. Educated at George Heriot's school in Edinburgh and at the London School of Economics, he started in journalism in 1985 with the Financial Times World Commodity Report. Brief spells there and at the shipping magazine Seatrade led him to the Knight-Ridder financial news agency in 1986. He had discovered the subject in which he was to specialise: the working of the world's financial mar-kets. In September 1989 he joined the FT's UK stock market reporting team and quickly established a reputation with his colleagues and the markets. In the 2 1/2 years he worked for the paper he wrote on stock markets, stock index futures, currencies and the money markets. Those are not always the most intrinsically exciting of subjects but Jim could explain why their daily movements were important and he could do so with skill and authority. His reports were required reading for those earning their living in these markets. Senior figures in the City always found the time to talk to him and his sharpness of mind and cheerfulness of disposition easily converted contacts into friends. He stood at the threshold of a wider career in journalism but his reputation among his colleagues was already secure. His goodheartedness, genuine affection and concern for his fellows was rooted in his active socialism, a central feature of his character. He suffered an aneurysm of the brain on New Year's Day and was immediately admitted to St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He is survived by his parents, Mr and Mrs Ian McCallum of Edinburgh, and their family.</p>

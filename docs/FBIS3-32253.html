			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Guatemala City, 3 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan  President Ramiro de Leon faces a new headache with the  transportation strike, which entered its third day today,  virtually paralyzing the entire country, four days after the  constitutional referendum obtained a faint victory.    Interurban transportation owners are firmly maintaining the  strike and have decided to defy de Leon Carpio, who has offered  them a 10-percent tariff readjustment on costs of fuel  transportation.    Some 2.5 million Guatemalans are directly affected today in  the Guatemalan capital, where 1,500 buses and 1,100 minibuses  that are used in public service are not running.    Rudi Maldonado, Urban Bus Transportation Association  president, has announced the suspension of night service, adding  buses will not provide service on 3 February due to a lack of  fuel.    Most minibuses are not providing service either due to a  lack  of gasoline, according to bus owner Cesar Arellano.    Most gas stations that operate in the capital have depleted  their reserves and have stopped operations, while hundreds of  fuel trucks are at a standstill in the Atlantic and Pacific  areas in support of the strike.    Miguel Angel Luna, president of the National Transportation  Coordinating Board (CNT), has said the chief of state's decision  is "unilateral," because they were not consulted at any moment.    According to Luna, the official proposal was rejected by a  consensus of the owners of cargo, fuel, cement, and passenger  transportation services. He has warned the strike will not be  lifted until their demands are met.    The increase in the costs of fuel transportation is one of  the seven points on their list of demands, he has said. Luna  has said when the government announces their demands have been  met they will lift the strike.    In an effort to overcome the transportation strike, the  president announced a 10-percent tariff readjustment in the cost  of transporting fuel, but the CNT rejected it.    On announcing the readjustment, de Leon said it was the  government's final word, and he asked the bus owners to lift the  strike immediately or otherwise bear the full weight of the law.  [passage omitted]    The strike began on 1 February, two days after the  referendum  in which 43 constitutional reforms were approved by only 400,000  of 3.4 million individuals eligible to vote, while 2.8 million  Guatemalans preferred to stay home. To many people this  evidences the lack of popular support for de Leon Carpio.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Bonn plans toxic waste retrieval MR Klaus Topfer, Germany's federal environment minister, arrived in Bucharest yesterday to assess ways to clean up 400 tonnes of toxic waste illegally exported by Germany to Romania in recent years. The waste, exported by both east and west German companies, has been stored in and around the Transylvanian town of Sibiu in corroding containers, according to the environmental group Green-peace. Plans were made to take the toxic waste back to Germany in early March. But disputes between the German states over where the waste should go and who should pay for its transportation have delayed the move. The total cost of re-importing the waste is estimated at DM3.3m (Dollars 1.98m). The plans followed a campaign by Greenpeace which has recently reported a string of illegal dumping sites used by German companies abroad. At the weekend, officials from the Environment Ministry in the state of Lower Saxony ordered back some 3,000 tonnes of metal waste due to be exported to Russia by a west German enterprise and labelled as industrial goods, according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung. The government will probe Hoechst, Germany's largest chemical group, to see if poor organisation was to blame for a string of accidents at its plants, officials said at the weekend, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Mr Topfer said he and local officials had agreed on the investigation, to be carried out by his ministry.</p>

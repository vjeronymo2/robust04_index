			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FIFTH EX-HUD OFFICIAL BALKS AT TESTIFYING;  </P> <P> HOUSING PROBE: LANTOS REOPENS INQUIRY DESPITE THORNBURGH DECISION TO SEEK  SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.  </P> <P> A former HUD official invoked his constitutional rights and refused to testify  before a House panel today as it reopened its investigation into alleged  widespread abuses in federal housing programs.  </P> <P> James Hamernick, former director of the office of insured multifamily housing,  became the fifth former official of the Department of Housing and Urban  Development to refuse to testify before congressional investigators.  </P> <P> Hamernick cited Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination in  refusing to testify.  </P> <P> Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the House Government Operations  subcommittee on housing, said he had decided to resume a HUD probe despite  Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's decision Thursday to seek appointment of a special  prosecutor to investigate former Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. and other  former top housing officials. That appointment by a federal court is now  automatic under the law.  </P> <P> Pierce is among the other former officials from the Ronald Reagan  Administration who have refused to testify.  </P> <P> "As has happened in the past, most notably in the Watergate investigation . . .  and the Iran-Contra investigation . . . there is occasionally a compelling need  for simultaneous parallel investigations by Congress and by law enforcement,"  Lantos said, explaining his decision to proceed further after holding more than  20 hearings last year.  </P> <P> "The subcommittee is duty-bound to proceed with its investigation of abuses at  HUD," he said. "This is particularly true since in recent weeks the  subcommittee staff has uncovered a good deal of relevant new information."  </P> <P> He declined to say what that information is.  </P> <P> Hamernick refused to answer when Lantos asked him what HUD programs he  discussed when he was entertained by Lance Wilson, a former top aide to Pierce  who later became a housing consultant with the Wall Street firm of Paine  Webber. Wilson reported spending more than $2,000 in that job on meals and  other entertainment for Hamernick in expense accounts filed with his employer.  </P></p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Military manoeuvres: Britain's army will remain stretched They marched them up to the top of the hill, and they marched them down again. Two years ago, the soldiers of the 1st Battalion, the Staffordshire Regiment, were camped out in Saudi Arabia, about to join the land campaign to liberate Kuwait. In April 1991, they returned to Fallingbostel in northern Germany. In November they moved to England. The following April they left their families again for a six-month tour in County Fermanagh, Ulster. Now back in Chester, at full strength of 600, they were waiting to be merged in the autumn with the Cheshire Regiment when it returns from Bosnia, with another emergency tour looming eight months later. That is what is meant by 'overstretch' in Britain's army. Soldiers are supposed to get at least two years between emergency assignments. They have been getting about 15 months. The Staffords were among four regiments saved this week from amalgamation. In 1991, they were unexpectedly included on the merger list. The reprieve came just as much out of the blue. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, made his move as pressure was building up in Westminster for a more drastic scaling-down of army cuts. The all-party Commons defence committee was ready to launch a report calling for all the measures to be put on hold. Regiments are great stirrers of emotion, although there have been many amalgamations before. The Royal Scots, who until Mr Rifkind's announcement were set to merge with the King's Own Scottish Borderers, are a rarity in having survived intact since the 17th century. The Scottish regiments - affected by one other merger and the loss of a guards battalion - and the Staffords, waged the strongest campaigns. By selecting regiments for reprieve, Mr Rifkind took the risk of opening a Pandora's box; over the next two years, there are 10 more armoured and infantry regiments waiting for amalgamations and three guards regiments destined to lose their second battalions. The government has backtracked, but so far by no more than 2.6 per cent, retaining 3,000 more troops than planned for the mid-1990s, including keeping 40 infantry battalions instead of 38. Defence ministers, who always stood firmly by their Options for Change programme of armed forces cuts, argue that its fundamentals have not altered. The 6,500 army redundancies due later this month, mostly voluntary and linked to ages and rank rather than individual units, are not materially affected. The target first set in 1990 was an army of 'around 120,000'. Over the following year, the figure was trimmed to 116,000 - a reduction of 40,000 over three years. Army chiefs had fought for more battalions. The infantry that remained included two surviving Gurkha battalions of Nepalese soldiers, who have never been used for jobs like patrolling Northern streets. Since taking over the defence ministry last April, Mr Rifkind has faced a difficult concatenation of circumstances. One of the premises of Options for Change was that the number of British troops sent to Northern Ireland would remain stable at about 10,500, with 10 regular army battalions. Early last year this was increased by two extra battalions, and Northern Ireland ministers are expected to argue against returning to the previous level. In the meantime, more than 3,000 troops have been sent to former Yugoslavia. Much of the army, meanwhile, is tied up in reorganisation and withdrawal from Germany. Options for Change was meant to leave a margin for the unpredictable, but the margin was too small and the unpredictable came sooner than expected. Then, with British troops newly arrived in central Bosnia, came the autumn round of public expenditure cuts, reducing the defence budget for the next financial year from more than Pounds 24bn to Pounds 23.5bn. The change in army plans adds Pounds 80m a year to some Pounds 1bn worth of savings Mr Rifkind has to find over the next two years. Cuts could hit RAF fighter squadrons and the navy's plan for a helicopter carrier, due to be ordered this autumn. Inter-service battles, which the government has tried hard to keep a lid on, are bubbling up again. The army asked for some 6,000 more troops than it got, not so much to revive regiments as to bring depleted units up to strength. Public controversy has focused on the infantry, but that is only about a quarter of the army. The rest, including tank forces, engineers, signals and artillery, also face heavy cuts. A new Royal Logistic Corps comes into being in April, merging five activities from transport to catering, the biggest reorganisation since 1904 when the army was drawing lessons from the Boer war. The problem is that it is infantry that is required for peacekeeping. The army, which has been given the job of leading Nato's new rapid reaction corps, does not want to cut its tank units any further to make up numbers. It wants to keep its capacity for fighting real wars, in which infantry is only part of the picture. It is determined to be something more than a gendarmerie and to keep a place at Nato's top planning table. Manning is still tight, just slightly less so. Pressures should ease in the next few years. Numbers in Cyprus have been cut; the two battalions in Berlin are due to go; the Hong Kong garrison has to pack up in 1997; commitments in Belize and Brunei could end. More soldiers are likely to become available through hiving off support functions and streamlining army structures in the UK. But the changes are unlikely to alter British military reservations about a full-scale peacekeeping operation in Bosnia without US participation. The French have more troops available, but their larger army is based on conscription. Of 4,700 French troops in former Yugoslavia, 39 per cent are national servicemen who have volunteered for foreign service. This could become a problem if they become more directly engaged in fighting. In the area where the British army now escorts convoys, it is reckoned at least a brigade of 6,000 would be needed to oversee a ceasefire. The army could provide that, and more, but could not send fresh troops to replace them if the mission became permanent. UN berets worn by British troops in Bosnia come in different shades of blue. The paler ones are mementoes of Cyprus. The UN went there in response to a crisis in 1964 and is still there almost 29 years later. It is the same lesson Britain has learnt in Northern Ireland - going in is always easier than getting out.  ----------------------------------- British army worldwide deployment  ----------------------------------- Belize             1200 Brunei             1000 Cambodia             40 Cyprus             2700                     600* Falkland I.        1000 Germany           45000 Gibraltar           400                     120* Hong Kong          6000 Kuwait               10* N.

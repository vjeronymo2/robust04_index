			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> The Jewish Defense League says it will monitor a taping of the new Jackie Mason  sitcom to make sure the comedian doesn't promote "negative stereotyping of  Jews." The JDL said its members had obtained numerous tickets for an upcoming  taping of "Chicken Soup," which debuts on ABC Sept. 12. "We are sick and tired  of Jewish American Princess stereotypes being used to demean Jewish women and  we are just as sick of Jewish nebishes being portrayed on television," the JDL  said in a statement. Replied Bernie Orenstein, an executive producer of  "Chicken Soup": "We welcome everyone to come and see the show because we're  totally confident the show is a truthful, funny comedy. We can't imagine any  Jewish or Gentile people being offended by it." "Chicken Soup" stars former  rabbi Mason as Jackie Fisher, a retired pajama salesman sharing an apartment  with his mother, who doesn't approve of his dating a non-Jewish woman.

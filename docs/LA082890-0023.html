			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALESTINIANS, ISRAEL AND MIDEAST CRISIS  </P> <P> Helena Cobban argues that Israel is "irrelevant to the American campaign in the  gulf, and, at worst, seriously detrimental to it" ("Strategic Ally, Strategic  Myth," Commentary, Aug. 16). Moreover, she questions the overall value of the  U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation which has been developed over the past  decade. She is wrong on both counts.  </P> <P> If Arab readiness to join with the U.S. to counter Iraqi aggression is  "directly undercut by Iraq's ability to point to the United States as closely  tied to Israel," then what explains the Administration's ability to garner  support from virtually every Arab state? Even Yemen and Libya, long-time foes  of the U.S., appear to have edged closer to the U.S. position. The exceptions?  Jordan, which continues to attempt to play all sides against the middle in King  Hussein's never-ending juggling act of survival, and the PLO, which has once  again exposed its extremism by embracing Iraq's Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> Though Cobban claims that "Arab allies old and new have far more of value to  offer than Israel," the facts are otherwise. Does anyone seriously believe that  our current joint efforts with such countries as Libya, Syria or Yemen  represent anything other than a momentary convergence of strategic interests?  Or that the U.S. can ever claim shared values with feudal monarchies?  </P> <P> This is not to deny the importance of the collective efforts or the ongoing  need to encourage the forces of moderation in the region. But they cannot serve  as a substitute for the breadth and depth of the relations between the U.S. and  Israel. Whatever its flaws, Israel is the only democratic nation in the region.  It remains in the U.S. interest to support Israel.  </P> <P> Concerning U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation, Cobban attempts to make short  shrift of it. In doing so, however, she overlooks the incalculable value of  this cooperation to both sides. Intelligence-sharing, pre-positioning of  material, access to Israeli ports, assessment of Soviet weapons capabilities,  joint research and development on new weapons systems, joint combat exercises  in Israel are part of the link. As U.S. troops amass in Saudi Arabia, preparing  to face off against an Iraqi army largely equipped with Soviet weapons, the  benefits of the U.S.-Israel link are considerable.  </P> <P> A tragic aspect of the current crisis may be the realization yet again that the  old adage -- "my enemy's enemy is my friend" -- simply doesn't apply when it  comes to Israel. Were it not for their blind hatred of Israel, the more modern  Arab states might realize that they may have more in common with Israel than  with expansionist Iraq and its supporters.  </P> <P> RICHARD A. WESTON  </P> <P> President, Los Angeles Chapter  </P> <P> The American Jewish Committee  </P></p>

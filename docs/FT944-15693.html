			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt Yesterday's German election, in which Chancellor Helmut Kohl was last night heading for a narrow majority, took place against the background of an economic recovery that looks increasingly solid and an inflation rate expected to ease from the current 3 per cent this year. It is these economic fundamentals and the gradual slowdown of money supply growth which will determine the progress of the bond market, along with events in the US, once the vote's outcome has been digested. The bond and stock markets rose last week, with 10-year bund yields easing towards 7.50 per cent, on the growing assumption that Mr Kohl's coalition government would be re-elected. Earlier, however, investors were not so certain and the markets softened. The prospect of a Kohl victory and the continuation of deficit-reducing fiscal policies injected a new confidence into the market. Thus said Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Kidder, Peabody Securities: 'If bond markets had votes, Mr Kohl - rightly or wrongly - would romp home.' Even if he was not voted in again, she recommended investors to move up the yield curve, not jump off. The Bundesbank would see to it that any fiscal laxity in Bonn was met with stern monetary policies.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lucio Vaz: "Factions Divide Campaign </F> Leadership"; followed by an interview with Wander Bueno do  Prado, Lula's private secretary, by Claudia Trevisan, place and  date not given: "Adviser To Lula Since 1981"; paragraphs in  italics as published]    [Text] Brasilia -- Most of them are from Sao Paulo, have  never held elective office, and participated in left-wing  movements over the past two decades. Four were once guerrilla  fighters. They are the 13 individuals forming Luiz Inacio Lula  da Silva's campaign team, and they represent the range of  factions constituting the PT [Workers Party].    There are only two congressmen in the group, most of whose  members are intellectuals or party leaders. Deputies in the  party comment that the leadership is in the hands of "voteless"  people.    The group includes a businessman who is not a member of the  PT: Oded Grajew. He is active in civil engineering and  advertising. He collected suggestions from businessmen for the  program. Now he is going to collect contributions from  businessmen.    The party presidency is held by State Deputy Ruy Falcao (Sao  Paulo), a leader of the party's left wing. He participated in  the armed struggle against the military regime as a member of  the VAR [Revolutionary Armed Vanguard]-Palmares.    Falcao does not like to talk about that experience. "What is  the point of that now? The amnesty erased all that," he says.  Tried under five articles of the National Security Law, he spent  three years in prison.    Coordination of the campaign will be divided among Falcao,  Luiz Eduardo Greenhalgh, and Deputy Aloizio Mercadante (Sao  Paulo). Greenhalgh represents the party's extreme left wing,  while Mercadante is closer to the center. He is tipped to be  Lula's minister of finance.    Drafting of the government program will be coordinated by  Marco Aurelio Garcia, an intellectual who has great influence on  Lula and who is associated with the center group.    Also participating in the coordination are Joao Machado and  Cesar Benjamin, who represent the left wing. Benjamin stirred up  controversy by advocating a fourfold increase in the Armed  Forces budget.    The alliances in the states are important in getting Lula  elected, and they will be monitored by Gilberto Carvalho, the  party's secretary general. A professor of philosophy linked to  the progressive wing of the Catholic Church, he has never held  elective office. He has been a party leader for four years.    The PT's advertising in the media is in the hands of the  party's most radical leader, Markus Sokol of the faction known  as In the PT Struggle. At the party convention, he advocated  suspending payment of the foreign debt.    The official campaign treasurer will be Tatau Godinho, an  English professor without much experience as a treasurer. She  hopes to collect a large amount of money from the party's  approximately 100,000 members, but is also depending on  contributions from businessmen.    The group also has two intellectuals acting as advisers to  Lula: Paulo Vanucchi and Amilton Pereira. Both participated in  the armed struggle.

"I know Lula better  than I know my brother," Prado told FOLHA DE SAO PAULO.    A sociologist and former metalworker, Prado went to  work for Lula in 1981. He has been his private secretary since  that time. He takes care of Lula's agenda and organizes the  candidate's life.    He left that position only from 1990 to 1992, when he  coordinated the PT's parallel government (established following  the defeat in the 1989 presidential election). He returned in  1993 to organize the caravans of citizenship and participate in  the campaign.    [Trevisan] How did you come to work for Lula?    [Prado] I knew Lula from the union movement, but I was more  closely associated with his brother, Frei Chico.    In 1981, I was teaching a few classes and looking for a job.  I had left my job at the ZF of Brazil metallurgical firm the  year before. (He completed his sociology course at the Santo  Andre Foundation in Sao Paulo's ABC [Santo Andre, Sao Bernardo  do Campo, and Sao Caetano do Sul industrial area] in 1981.)    Lula was looking for someone to handle his agenda during the  1982 gubernatorial campaign in Sao Paulo. Frei Chico recommended  me, and I accepted.    [Trevisan] What was the most difficult political moment you  witnessed in Lula's career?    [Prado] His defeat in the 1982 elections.    [Trevisan] Was it worse than his defeat by Fernando Collor  in  the 1989 presidential election?    [Prado] Much worse. The reason was the number of people we  managed to attract and then the small number of votes we  received in the end. (Franco Montoro won the election, and Lula  ended up in fourth place.)    It was about six months before he recovered. The PT had been  established in 1980, and the defeat caused doubts about the  party's viability.    Lula received a very large number of votes in 1989, and it  became clear to us that it would be difficult to win the  presidency.    [Trevisan] How often do you talk to Lula?    [Prado] Almost every day, either by telephone or in person.    [Trevisan] I see that you have a scrambler (a device used to  prevent telephone wiretapping). Do you use it when talking to  Lula?    [Prado] I bought it last year, but I have never used it.  When  we talk about important things, we do so in person.    [Trevisan] To what faction in the PT do you belong?    [Prado] You will have to believe me. I have never belonged  to  any faction, and I have never held a position of leadership in  the party.    I have always felt that holding office in the PT would be  incompatible with a position in which I am so close to the party  president.</p>

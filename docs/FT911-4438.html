			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Banco Bilbao director quits Hambros' board MR ENRIQUE Mas Montanes, the director representing Banco Bilbao Vizcaya on the board of Hambros, the London merchant banking group, has resigned. BBV has owned 5.6 per cent of Hambros since 1986, the stake intended to be part of a network of relationships among European banks. But Mr Chips Keswick, Hambros' vice-chairman, said yesterday that ties with BBV had 'languished' because of other preoccupations at the Spanish bank. He stressed that relations were still cordial. It is expected that BBV will now move to sell its Hambros stake, though it has not commented on its intentions. Last week Baltica, the Danish insurance concern, sold its 14 per cent interest in Hambros, whose two main shareholders are now Istituto San Paolo di Torino, the Italian bank, with 14 per cent, and GRE, the UK insurance company, with 10 per cent. Although some of the stakes were taken up for defensive reasons, the emergence of the single European market in the late 1980s gave a greater logic to cross-border ties and international banking business; but analysts have increasingly questioned the value to Hambros of its shareholding relationships, and the distancing of BBV will add to the impression that their impact on profits is small.</p>

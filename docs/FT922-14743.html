			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / How To Spend It: Old clothes, new money - Alice Rawsthorn on the craze for collecting antique haute couture A LITTLE black dress goes on sale in Paris this week. It is not exactly new and the fabric is torn in a few places. The owner is open to offers  - anything from Pounds 5,000 upwards. The dress is a velvet evening gown designed by Balenciaga in 1950. It is one of the star lots in La Mode Dans l'Art, a sale of antique haute couture being held on Wednesday afternoon by Millon &amp; Robert, the Paris auctioneers, in the Drouot auction rooms at the back of the Paris Opera. Until recently antique couture was only of interest to the obsessive - the fashion fiends who would rummage around jumble sales, charity shops and costume auctions in the hope of spotting a late 1930s Schiaparelli ball gown or an early 1950s Christian Dior day dress. The market is now much more competitive. There are more dealers and more collectors. The costume shops of London, New York and Paris are crammed with Japanese tourists searching for early Chanels and Yves St Laurents. The best pieces are snapped up by auction houses - Millon &amp; Robert in Paris, or Christie's in London - to be sold for thousands. At a time when prices elsewhere in the art market are plummeting, the cost of antique couture is rising. Perhaps the best indication of the market's strength is that the most expensive piece in this week's Millon &amp; Robert sale is one of a pair of Louis XV fancy dress costumes designed by Balenciaga for Barbara Hutton, the Woolworth heiress, and her partner for the 1951 Bestegui ball in Venice. One of the costumes was auctioned by Christie's in London last summer for Pounds 3,080. Less than a year later it is back on sale at Millon &amp; Robert, this time with a minimum reserve price of FFr60,000, or about Pounds 6,000. Only a very special piece of couture would be worth as much as Pounds 6,000. Balenciaga is one of the few couturiers whose work commands so high a price. Francoise Augen, who organised the Millon &amp; Robert auction, reckons the others are pre-war Chanel, Paul Poiret in the early 1910s, Christian Dior's New Look in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and anything by Charles James or Jacques Fath. Susan Mayor, director of costume at Christie's in London, would add Vionnet and Schiaparelli before the war. 'The value of a piece of couture depends on so many different things,' says Mayor. 'The condition, of course, but a piece will be worth much more if it was worn by a famous client or a favourite mannequin, if it appeared in fashion magazines at the time and, most important, whether it was a key piece in the designers' development.' An auction house such as Christie's is only really interested in pre-1960s couture. Although there is a market for more recent pieces, particularly for 1960s Paco Rabanne and early St Laurent. Christie's only buys haute couture, never pret-a-porter, and only if it is in mint condition. Anyone wanting to sell tattier couture, their mother's old Chanel pret-a-porter, or anything made since the 1960s would be better advised to go to a dealer. Didier Luot, one of the best-known Paris dealers, buys old couture, Chanel suits and Hermes bags for his shops in the Palais Royal. He pays half the price of sale - Pounds 300 for a Chanel suit he would sell for Pounds 600, or Pounds 1,500 for a crocodile Kelly bag to be sold for Pounds 3,000 - and sends everything to be cleaned, repaired or renovated. It is only in the last four or five years that the antique couture market has really taken off. The original collectors came, unsurprisingly, from the fashion world. Among the designers, Azzedine Alai has a wonderful collection of Vionnets and Issey Miyake has been buying for years. Anna Piaggi, the Italian fashion editor, is another long standing collector as was Tina Chow, the model who died earlier this year and whose collection is now on show at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. There are now more collectors around. Museums, such as the Metropolitan in New York and the Victoria &amp; Albert in London, are allocating more space to couture in their collections and tend to take the cream of the auction lots. These days life is much more difficult for the early enthusiasts. Hamish Bowles, style director of Harpers &amp; Queen magazine, has been an avid collector since buying his first piece of antique couture - a late 1950s Balenciaga suit - 15 years ago at a charity bazaar. He still scours charity shops in London and races around the thrift stores whenever he is in New York, but most of his recent purchases have come from auctions, after tip-offs from dealers or from 'friends of friends who know someone who wants to sell something.' 'I still sometimes find the odd bargain in charity shops,' he says. 'But it's becoming far harder to find anything really good. There are so many more people buying these days and they really know what they're looking for.' There are some consolations. The couturiers themselves are more aware of the value of their work. Christian Lacroix saves at least one example of everything he makes. And the thrift store bargains of the 1970s and early 1980s are much more valuable. The Balenciaga that Hamish Bowles bought for Pounds 3 all those years ago is now worth Pounds 300 or Pounds 400.</p>

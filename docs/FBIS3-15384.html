			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As of yesterday, gas supplies to our republic from  Russia were reduced by 10 million cubic meters. Such is the  volume of gas cut down by the Russian joint stock company  "Gazprom" due to late payments. Mikalay Macharnyuk, general  director of the Belarusian state enterprise for transportation  and supply of gas "Beltransgaz," told BELINFORM that this  [reduction] was announced in a telegram. The telegram also  warned against a full cut of supplies because the Republic has  not paid about 50 billion Russian rubles for fuel. All possible  measures to repay debts are now being adopted. In connection  with this, the Council of Ministers held a session which  discussed ways out of the crisis. One of the ways is, first of  all, the urgent payoff of debts by direct consumers of the blue  fuel -- industrial enterprises. This question must also be  worked out by the National Bank.</p>

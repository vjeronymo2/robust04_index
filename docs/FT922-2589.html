			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Executive loses appeal over disqualification A FORMER company chairman who was jailed last year for insider dealing has failed to overturn an order disqualifying him from acting as a company director for 10 years, Raymond Hughes writes. Mr Ivor Goodman, former chairman of Unigroup, the quoted Leeds-based timber and clothing company, is the only person prosecuted for insider dealing in the UK who has served a jail term for the offence. He pleaded guilty last year at St Albans Crown Court to an offence under the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act. He was sentenced to 18 months, of which nine months were suspended. Yesterday he challenged the disqualification order imposed on him as part of his sentence. Dismissing his appeal, Lord Justice Staughton said in the Court of Appeal that the offence was 'a monstrous and scandalous example of insider trading'. The Department of Trade and Industry alleged at the trial that Mr Goodman had disposed of his shares in Unigroup just before the company announced worse-than-expected results in 1987. The sale took place a few days before the Stock Exchange suspended the company's shares at its own request. The sale was later set aside after civil proceedings.</p>

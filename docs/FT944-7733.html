			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Tadpole Technology falls Pounds 1.3m into red Tadpole Technology, the Cambridge-based manufacturer and market leader in high powered notebook computers, lost money last year as anticipated, as it continued to invest heavily in manufacturing infrastructure, research and development. Revenues grew strongly, however, and there was an operating profit of Pounds 671,000 in the second half of the year. The share price, which has been climbing steadily over the past few months, slipped 11p to 402p. The loss before tax amounted to Pounds 1.3m, compared with profits of Pounds 749,000. Revenues grew 42 per cent to Pounds 32.5m (Pounds 22.9m) while losses per share came out at 5.4p (3.5p earnings). No dividend is recommended. Tadpole's principal products are high performance note-book computers, where it reckons to have a six to 12 months lead over other manu - facturers - and electronic circuit boards which it designs and builds for other companies. Its growth in revenues this year, 79 per cent of which derive from the notebook workstation business, result from the success of its 'Sparcbook' line, designed around chips from Sun Microsystems. It is also designing notebook computers for International Business Machines and Digital Equipment. This year it announced a Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.1m) order for Sparcbooks to be used by the US Air Force. It has also taken a Dollars 20m order for the development and manufacture over four years of customised printed circuit boards for an as yet unnamed customer. Tadpole's principal development this year has been the launch of the world's most powerful notebook personal computer based on Intel's Pentium chip. Tadpole claims that its machine is at least twice as fast as competing products. Analysts believe it could sell between 5,000 and 25,000 of the machines next year at prices in excess of Pounds 7,000 each. Mr George Grey, chief executive, said the company might have to raise new money for manufacturing infrastructure if the machines proved more successful than expected. There might be problems with a shortage of chips and colour monitor screens. He said the current year showed excellent prospects for revenue and earnings growth, biased towards the second half.</p>

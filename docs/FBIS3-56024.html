Galazov thinks that the Federation Council will accomplish  its historic role if it resolves the artificially created  problems associated with the confrontation of the regions. "It  is the republics that form the basis for Russian federalism and  reducing them to the level of the other components of Russia may  lead to an intensification of separatist sentiment and the  disintegration of the Russian Federation," the head of North  Ossetia declared.</p>

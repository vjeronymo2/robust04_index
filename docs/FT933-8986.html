			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Enhanced scrip dividendat Commercial Union  -Future tax uncertainties prompt 'one-off' move COMMERCIAL UNION is offer-ing the lion's share of its annual dividend to shareholders at halfway instead of the year end and offering to pay extra dividends in shares out of concern that the Treasury may close a tax-advantaged financing loophole in the November budget. 'It is the uncertainties about the future tax position which have prompted this,' said Mr Peter Foster, general manager (finance). Dividends paid in shares do not attract advance corporation tax, unlike those paid in cash. Companies may offset ACT against UK taxes paid, but those with high overseas earnings or those with low domestic tax bills cannot recover their ACT. Mr Foster said the exercise was 'a one-off' and would not be repeated. Changes to the rules on ACT and the likelihood that CU's domestic tax charge will rise as its UK operations return to profitability should make future enhanced scrip dividends less attractive to the company. The Treasury has given no public indication that it will close the loophole, which has helped UK companies cut their tax bill by over Pounds 200m since April. It has only said that it is 'watching' market developments and from next year has offered to help cut the ACT charge for those with high overseas earnings. CU will pay shareholders who elect cash an interim dividend of 15.1p, equal to the final declared at the end of 1992. It paid an interim dividend of 9.25p last year. 'We are effectively reversing the order of the final and interim dividends,' Mr Foster said. However, the move does not signify that the final dividend will be 9.25p. Investors who accept the dividend in shares will gain an additional 50 per cent, equivalent to a minimum of 22.65p. If all shareholders elect shares, the offer will result in the issue of 16.5m new shares and save the company Pounds 23.6m in ACT charges and Pounds 81.2m in cash which would have been spent on dividends. Assuming full take-up, the existing share capital will be diluted by 3.5 per cent. Previous enhanced scrip dividends from other UK companies have had 90 per cent or more election of shares. Mr Foster said that Pounds 100m which could be raised will be deployed in CU's existing life and non-life insurance businesses. In order to finance the new shares at the same rate as existing shares, CU will need a return on capital of between 6 and 7 per cent. Currently, it is earning return on capital of 8 per cent.</p>

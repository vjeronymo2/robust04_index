			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Bombay leaders demand army control: Panic grips city after a week of violence leaves at least 175 dead TOP Bombay industrialists including Mr J R D Tata, Mr Ramakrishna Bajaj and Mr S P Godrej yesterday urged the Indian government to declare a partial emergency and allow the army full control of India's commercial capital which was paralysed by violence for the seventh day running, leaving at least 175 people dead and more than 700 injured. The industrialists, along with leading citizens such as Mr Nani Palkhiwala, the eminent jurist, and veteran film actor Dilip Kumar, said in a statement that the situation in Bombay was 'totally out of hand' and that 'criminals, monsters and beasts in the form of men had taken over the city'. They urged that Bombay be declared 'a gravely disturbed area,' and that 'any delay in taking such a step would be a crime against the nation' since the 'democratic process of the government had failed'. Mr Sharad Pawar, the defence minister, ordered troops to suppress widening Hindu-Moslem bloodshed. Extra forces were rushed to Bombay, a city of 12m, and convoys of heavily-armed soldiers imposed an uneasy calm in some areas worst affected by the dramatic flare-up. A cloud of smoke hung over the city as the fire services fought to control flames consuming the shops, houses and vehicles set alight by rampaging mobs in several parts of the city. Banks, the stock exchange, shops and offices remained closed, many of them for the fourth day as panic gripped the city. Hundreds of residents, mostly industrial workers in the worst-affected areas, fled their homes to catch trains out of Bombay. Two special trains to Gorakhpur and Calcutta evacuated homeless people. Government officials said additional army and paramilitary troops would be sent in to reinforce the security forces which took up positions in 25 riot-ravaged areas yesterday. The International Federation of Working Journalists has condemned the attacks on Moslem journalists and newspaper offices in the past two days. The city has been tense since last month's nationwide riots triggered by the destruction of Ayodhya mosque by Hindu zealots in which more than 1,200 people died. But the new flare-up appeared to have been deliberately fanned by Hindu political groups trying to push prime minister P V Narasimha Rao into an early general election, political sources said. Leaders of the opposition Janata Dal party courted arrest in New Delhi yesterday, demanding the dismissal of the Maharashtra and Gujarat state governments for failing to control the violence in Bombay and Ahmedabad. The situation remained tense in Gujarat with the death toll in the state reaching 57, with seven more reported yesterday. Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, president of the militant Hindu Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), reiterated his party's commitment to build Hindu temples on the site of the demolished mosque in Ayodhya, and at two other places, Kashi and Mathura, in northern India where Hindus claim Moslem conquerors destroyed temples to build mosques. Mr Joshi and other BJP leaders were released from a month's detention yesterday. The BJP, India's largest opposition party, will meet this morning to chalk out a future political strategy. The Hindu party is most likely to demand an early election, claiming that Mr Narasimha Rao had lost the confidence of the people following the events at Ayodhya. England's opening one-day cricket international against India in Ahmedabad on Saturday has been called off by the Board of Control for Cricket in India because of the violence.</p>

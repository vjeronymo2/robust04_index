			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, chairman  of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq  [SAIRI], today appealed to the United Nations to intervene  immediately to stop the large-scale attack which massive forces  belonging to the Iraqi regime have been launching on al-Ahwar  marshes in southern Iraq since 3 March.    Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim said that the forces of that regime  were using internationally banned napalm incendiary bombs in  their attacks on the people of the marshes.    The Iraqi opposition leader pointed out that four armored  and  infantry divisions were taking part in this attack supported by  forces from the Republican Guard for intervention whenever it  was necessary.    Baqir al-Hakim called on the United Nations to put pressure  on the Iraqi regime to implement the UN Security Council's  resolution No. 688 which stipulates stopping the policy of  repression against the civilian population in southern Iraq.    Reports coming from inside Iraq mentioned that tens of  civilians were killed or wounded in these operations, while  hundreds of others ran away into the marshes fleeing the  bombardment of the Iraqi regime's forces.</p>

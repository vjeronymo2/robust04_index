			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Vinogradov: "Tajiks Sorting Each Other Out </F> in Moscow"]    [Text] A UN-sponsored and Russian-brokered dialogue  between two Tajik delegations began in Moscow 5 April.    The civil war in that country has been continuing for almost  two years. Tajik society is split by not only political, but  also clan enmity. Having sat them down around a table, the UN  secretary general's personal representative, the Uruguayan  Ramirez Piriz-Bollon, noted the historic significance of the  moment and voiced the hope that they will quickly find mutual  understanding.    Russian diplomats have succeeded for the first time in  bringing the warring Tajiks together and giving them the  opportunity to communicate. The two sides are not setting prior  conditions, but it clear from statements made previously that  the path to agreement will be difficult.    The head of the delegation from Dushanbe -- Tajikistan  Minister of Labor and Employment Shukurjon Zuhurov -- suggests  starting with the refugee problem, regarding it as the most  pressing.    The oppositionists, who are headed by former kazikalon [as  transliterated] (supreme spiritual judge) Hoji Akbar  Turajonzoda, who is currently living in Tehran, have brought  their own package of broader ideas. They are demanding the  resignation of Emomili Rakhmonov, head of the parliament, the  creation of a state council involving all political  organizations, the formation of a coalition transitional  government, and the introduction of UN peacemaking troops into  Tajikistan.    Matters are further complicated by the fact that the Tajik  opposition is not homogeneous in terms of its views and demands.  It can be divided into three categories: democratic,  pro-Islamic, and implacable. Turajonzoda himself admits that he  cannot speak on behalf of absolutely everybody who disagrees  with the current state of affairs and would like a change of  political system in Tajikistan. A number of opposition leaders  abroad claim a special role in the leadership and do not  recognize the current delegation's authority.    Taking account of the "delicacy of the matter," none of the  mediators will venture an assessment of the sides' positions or  predictions. Piriz-Bollon pointed out that the first step  toward reconciliation must be an agreement on a cease-fire on  Tajikistan territory and the Tajik-Afghan border. Everybody is  in agreement with this wish.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Matushka poised to shed businesses in big shake-up MATUSHKA Group, formerly Germany's leading independent financial services group, is poised for a drastic restructuring which will leave the Munich-based group with less than a quarter of the 468 employees that it had at its peak barely two years ago. Shareholders and partners in the group - which in the mid-1980s looked as though it could mount a serious challenge to the German banking establishment in its chosen areas - are today holding the first of three meetings to debate plans to sell off all the group's businesses apart from venture capital and corporate finance. At the same time, they will consider proposals for a restructuring of the corporate shareholding. Institutional investors include Nomura, the Japanese securities house, General Electric Capital of the US, the French Suez group and Charterhouse, the UK merchant bank, which together with two other institutions took a total 25 per cent stake in Matushka in September 1989. According to Mr Manfred Meyer-Preschany, the Frankfurt-based 'corporate doctor' who has been acting chief executive at Matushka since June last year, it is certain that the proposed sale of the group's currency trading, property and portfolio management businesses will be sold off following the meetings. 'Quite frankly, there is an absolute need to do this,' Mr Meyer-Preschany said in an interview with the Financial Times at the weekend. 'In certain areas in the group there simply wasn't the bulk of business to justify the cost structure. The right relationship between cost and income just wasn't there, to put it mildly.' He refused to comment on details of the reshuffling of shareholders. It seems likely that some will take the opportunity to cut loose from the group, while at least one will increase its holding. The Matushka Group takes its name from Count Albrecht Matushka, the maverick aristocrat who founded the group in 1970 and has over the years been a forthright critic of the German financial services sector and its domination by the large universal banks. His group was the nearest thing to an Anglo-Saxon financial services conglomerate in Germany. The group now employs 136 and Mr Meyer-Preschany predicts that number will fall further to 90 to 95 by the beginning of next month. Profit figures have never been disclosed but it is understood that the group is budgeted to make an operating profit of DM5.8m for 1992, after taking into account non-recurring severance payments, on fee income of DM65m to DM66m. This is before interest on bank debt and on partners' loan capital. Mr Meyer-Preschany, who played a leading role in restructuring AEG, the electrical group now owned by Daimler-Benz, before he left Dresdner bank's main board in 1984, says that Matushka Group is paying the price for over-reaching itself in the 1980s. 'Ambitions to become a 'world-player' were unrealistic,' he says. The Count, who is likely to remain with the rump of the group, could not be contacted yesterday.</p>

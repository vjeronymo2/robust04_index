Gordon Avenue, Sgt. Pat Findley said.  </P> <P> No one was injured by the shots fired and no other structures were hit,  although many of the shots penetrated the walls of Koutsky's residence.  </P> <P> A search of the house produced a 12-gauge shotgun, a replica of an Uzi rifle, a  pair of handcuffs, a sword and boxes of ammunition, Findley said.  </P></p>

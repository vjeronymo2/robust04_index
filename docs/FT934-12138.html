			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / R-R wins Pounds 140m Army contract ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine and power equipment group, has won a Pounds 140m contract from the Ministry of Defence to produce the next generation of bridges for the Army's Royal Engineers. The contract is expected to double employment to 250 at Wolverhampton-based Thompson Defence Projects, a Rolls-Royce unit set up to develop the bridges. It will also create jobs at subcontractors, including Unipower, the specialist vehicles producer with plants at Watford, Hertfordshire, and Tipton, West Midlands. Thompson was awarded the development contract for the bridging system in 1987, but yesterday's announcement of a production contract is a boost for its export drive. Rolls-Royce said a version of the bridge was a contender for the US Army's heavy assault bridge, and a number of continental countries had expressed interest. The Bridging for the 1990s (BR90) system is a family of bridges based on seven modular panels of aluminium alloy welded fabrication, interchangeable throughout the various bridge types. These can span gaps from nine to 62 metres. The aim is to save time on bridge construction. The system will be deployed with units of the Royal Engineers in Germany and the UK and is planned to enter service between January 1996 and June 1997.</p>

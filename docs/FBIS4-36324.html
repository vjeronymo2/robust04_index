			<p>BFN     [Text] Informed sources have said that the  Jordanian-Israeli negotiations, which opened in Washington  yesterday as part of the meetings of the Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli  tripartite committee, are addressing bilateral and regional  economic cooperation.    The sources added that the issues that will be raised in  this  context include ways of combating insects that cause losses to  farmers in the Ghawr region, making use of the power linkage  networks in the region, as well as banking and trade issues.    The talks are also expected to address the impact of the  PLO-Israeli Paris economic accord on the economic agreement  between Jordan and the Palestinian side and its possible impact  on the memorandum of understanding between Jordan and Israel on  economic affairs.    Political observers noted that the talks come in the wake of  a series of contacts and meetings conducted last month between  Jordanian and Israeli officials in several European capitals,  including London.    Sources have asserted that a senior Israeli official met  officials in the Jordanian Government and discussed with them  economic issues, as well as the border and water issues. The  Israeli side said it was willing to hold border negotiations on  the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338.    Informed sources also said Syria has warned Jordan against  holding bilateral negotiations with Israel on the water  question, since it is a vital issue that concerns Syria as well.    Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, the deputy prime minister, visited  Damascus recently and held direct talks with Syrian President  Hafiz al-Asad.</p>

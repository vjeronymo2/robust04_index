As we know, this delegation, which was headed by Bernard  Schweiger, spent the week in our country. Members of the  delegation acquainted themselves with the work of the first  Uzbek-German joint ventures, and with the activity of different  ministries and departments. The members of the delegation also  visited Bukhara, Urgench, Khiva and Nukus.    The results of the meetings and negotiations were  generalized  in the Cabinet of Ministers. A final intergovernmental protocol  and an agreement on financial and technical cooperation were  signed. The documents were signed in behalf of the Uzbek  government by republic Deputy Prime Minister Utkur Sultanov, and  in behalf of the German delegation by Bernard Schweiger.    The protocol foresees cooperation in areas such as research  and personal training, joint agricultural projects, improvement  of the communication system, reconstruction of the airport in  Tashkent, and assistance in public health.    "We found some warm and dependable people here," said the  leader of the German delegation on the last day of the talks.  "My hope is that our friendship will grow stronger not only in  words but also in specific deeds. The documents that were signed  today on strengthening our cooperation are aimed at this."

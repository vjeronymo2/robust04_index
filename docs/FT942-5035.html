			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Call for trust changes The British Venture Capital Association is this week expected to tell the government its proposed venture capital trusts need substantial changes if they are to be attractive to investors and sponsors. In a submission to the Inland Revenue, the BVCA says the VCTs need to be allowed to invest in larger companies and says greater tax breaks are required to attract investors. The government announced it would launch the VCTs in last November's budget as one of a number of measures to encourage private investment in small companies. While the idea has been welcomed in principle, the structure proposed by the Inland Revenue has been widely criticised as providing insufficient reward for the added risks of investing in unlisted companies. The BVCA wants the single investment limit to be Pounds 2m, compared with the Revenue's proposed figure of Pounds 1m; the Association of Investment Trust Companies wants a Pounds 3m ceiling. The BVCA also wants investors to enjoy capital gains tax roll-over relief when they sell quoted or other investments and reinvest the gains in the VCTs. Since the last budget, this relief has been available on direct investment in private companies. The government wants the VCTs to help attract private equity investment in start-ups, new and high-technology and smaller companies. The BVCA argues that, by only allowing investment in this type of small company, the VCTs would be unattractive to investors and highly risky. It argues the government should consider either up-front relief against income tax at 20 per cent or tax relief for investments in the smallest companies, for example below Pounds 500,000, instead of the proposed tax relief on dividends and capital gains.</p>
